Title:   Cruise Ship Wastewater Discharge   Abstract:       Cruise ship discharge logs, prepared by crew members, were used to create a GIS for discharge events on Alaska cruises.  Ships that discharge within the waters of Alaska (within three miles of the shore) are required by law to prepare these logs.  A number of large ships do not discharge within Alaskan waters and are not included in this record.  This coverage only contains information from large (> 500 passengers) ships.  The period of record is the summer of 2001. Logs were submitted in written form to and subsequently automated by the State of Alaska, Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC).  ArcInfo coverages were prepared from the automated files by Environmental Science, University of Alaska, Southeast. The only spatial references in the discharge logs are beginning and ending points. Arcs generated by ArcInfo were straight lines to which vertices were added so that cruise ship itineraries avoided land masses and utilized traditional routes.  The discharge events in this coverage represent the inferred routes. Approximately 500 records from the discharge logs were excluded from the coverage because of error conditions.  The most common error was a discharge event beginning or ending on land.  The errors are attributable to either the original position reporting by cruise ship staff, or coding errors by DEC staff. The attributes labeled ""int1"" and ""int2"" refer to the total volume of discharge divided by the length of the discharge event.  Two different volumes were used for these attributes:  for ""int1,""the volume is that reported by the ships, ""repvol."" A separate volume derived from the product of flow rate,""florate"" and elapsed time, ""totalt,"" was used to calculate ""int2.""  These attributes are intended to bracket the true value, and serve as a basis for further analysis, such as making generalizations about the discharge in specific study areas.

The coral reefs and seagrass beds support a high diversity of  fishes, endangered sea turtles, and other organisms. Damage to marine  habitats occurs from natural processes (hurricanes, disease outbreaks)  and human activities such as sediment runoff from increased clearing and  development of privately held lands, damage from boats running aground  and cruise ships running into the island, and nutrient input from over  1.2 million visitors a year (VINP) and increasing numbers of charter and  cruising boats.     To provide information on natural rates of change and recovery following  disturbances, permanent long-term monitoring sites were established at  the three parks: in VINP on 3 reefs (Lameshur-1989, Newfound-1990, and  Windspirit reef-1991); on the fringing reef at BUCK (1988); and 5 reef  sites at Dry Tortugas National Park (1989).     Purpose:          Because Virgin Islands National Park, Buck Island Reef National Monument  and Dry Tortugas National Park contain a large part of the protected  coral reefs in the United States and participate in a coordinated  research program, they were chosen in 1996 to be an NPS/NBS Inventory  and Monitoring (I&M) prototype park cluster. The seven years of coral  reef research at VINP, BUCK and DTNP will form the basis for developing  and fine-tuning protocols for coral reef work worldwide.

How do the  communities and assemblages differ spatially and temporally? (2) What  is the recovery rate of damaged coral reefs, including temporal and  spatial variation? (3) What mechanism(s) control the hard  coral/macroalgae balance on coral reefs in the Virgin Islands and  Florida? (4) Do fish traps affect reef fish assemblages? (5) What are  the best field methods for documenting these changes in tropical and  sub-tropical localities?     Experimental design: (1) The coral reef study sites are located on  three reefs off St. John, USVI; the fringing reef at Buck Island Reef  National Monument, St. Croix, and five reef sites at Dry Tortugas  National Park, Florida. Chain transects, quadrats and video methods  are used at permanently marked sites. The St. John sites were samples  twice a year until 1995. All sites are now sampled annually. (2)  Visual fish censuses (Bohnsack and Bannerot method and belt transects)  are conducted annually. On St. John, sampling was conducted monthly  from 1988 to 1994 on two reefs within VINP. (3) On St. John, water  quality sampling has been conducted monthly since 1988.     Results: (1) In St. John, a 40% decrease in hard coral and an increase  in macroalgae resulted from the passage of hurricane Hugo in September  1989 at Buck Island, the south fore reef was severely damaged. (2)  There has been no detectable or apparent recovery of hard coral since  (a) October 1988 damage from a cruise ship anchor on a reef within  VINP; (b) September 1989 damage from hurricane Hugo. (3) No  significant change in coral cover was detected after hurricanes Luis  and Marilyn (September 1995) or Bertha (July 1996). (4) Increased  macroalgal cover has persisted at disturbed study sites on VINP for 7-  8 years.

First, there are several competing technologies and companies in this area of new file types for web site use. For simplicity I will discuss only the concept of vector based web images here.        Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is a vector graphics format created by Adobe and proposed to the W3C as a new image standard.        The concept of scalable vector graphics, and similar competing products, is that images would be described using points and angles just as they are in illustration programs like Freehand, Illustrator, and CADD.        The advantage of this is much the same as with  PDF files   except that individual images could be place directly on a web pages just as Gifs and Jpegs are today. If SVG is accepted as a new standard image format then browsers would build in the ability to decode and display them without the need for plug-ins or stand alone viewers. Vector graphics, unlike GIF and JPEG images which use a fixed grid of pixels to represent an image, can be enlarged and printed at the resolution of the local output device.

The 1995 TIGER/Line files are an extract of selected geographic        and cartographic information from the Census TIGER data base.  The geographic        coverage for a single TIGER/Line  file is a county or statistical equivalent entity,        with the coverage area based on January 1, 1995 legal boundaries.  A complete set        of 1995 TIGER/Line files includes all counties and statistically equivalent entities i        the United States, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the         Northern Marian Islands, U.S. Minor Outlying Areas, and the Pacific Island Territories.        The Census TIGER data base represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or         gaps between parts.  However, each county-based TIGER/Line file is designed to         stand alone as an independent data set or the files can be combined to cover the whole        Nation and its territories.         The 1995 TIGER/Line files consist of line segments representing physical features        and governmental and statistical boundaries.  The files contain information distributed         over a series of record types for the spatial objects of a county.  There are 17 record        types, including the basic data record, the shape coordinate points, and geographic        codes that can be used with appropriate software to prepare maps.  Other geographic        information contained in the files includes attributes such as feature identifiers/census        feature class codes (CFCC) used to differentiate feature types, address ranges and ZIP        Codes, codes for legal and statistical entities, latitude/longitude coordinates of linear        and point features, landmark point features, area landmarks, key geographic features,        and area boundaries. The 1995 TIGER/Line data dictionary contains a complete list        of all the fields in the 17 record types.      Purpose: In order for others to use the information in the Census TIGER data base in        a geographic information system (GIS) or for other geographic applications, the         Census Bureau releases to the public extracts of the data base in the form of         TIGER/Line files.  Various versions of the TIGER/Line files have been released;        previous versions include the 1990 Census TIGER/Line files (version 0003), the         1992 TIGER/Line files (version 0005), and the 1994 TIGER/Line files (version 0021).        The 1995 (version 0024) TIGER/Line  files were originally produced to support         Phase I of the Census 2000 Redistricting Data Program.

No changes or        updates will be made to the 1995 TIGER/Line files. Future releases of TIGER/Line        files will reflect updates made to the Census TIGER data base and will be released         under a revised version numbering system (based on the month and year the data is         extracted).

EST-USA   Data_Set_Credit:       U.S. Department of Commerce      Bureau of the Census      Geography Division    Native_Data_Set_Environment:       TIGER/Line files are created and processed in a VAX/VMS environment.  The       environment consist of a VAX 7630 clustered with a VAX 6610 running OpenVMS       version 5.2-2 used for production operations. The Census TIGER system is driven       by DEC Command Language (DCL) procedures which invoke C software routines       to extract selected geographic and cartographic information (TIGER/Line files) from       the operational Census TIGER data base. Data_Quality_Information:   Attribute_Accuracy:      Attribute_Accuracy_Report: Accurate against Federal Information Processing         Standards (FIPS), FIPS Publication 6-4, and FIPS-55 at the 100% level for        the codes and base names. The remaining attribute information has been examined        but has not been fully tested for accuracy.   Logical_Consistency_Report: The feature network of lines (as represented by Record      Types 1 and 2) is complete for census purposes.  Spatial objects in TIGER/Line belong      to the ""Geometry and Topology""(GT) class of objects in the ""Spatial Data Transfer      Standard"" (SDTS) FIPS Publication 173 and are topologically valid.  Node/geometry      and topology (GT)-polygon/chain relationships are collected or generated to satisfy      topological edit requirements.  These requirements include:        *  Complete chains must begin and end at nodes.        *  Complete chains must connect to each other at nodes.        *  Complete chains do not extend through nodes.        *  Left and right GT-polygons are defined for each complete chain element and           are consistent throughout the extract process.        *  The chains representing the limits of the file are free of gaps.      The Census Bureau performed automated tests to ensure logical consistency      and limits of files.  All polygons are tested for closure.  Some polygons in the      TIGER/Line files may be so small that the polygon internal point has been      manually placed on a node that defines the polygon perimeter.  These small      polygons have been detected, and corrections will be incorporated in the Census      TIGER data base in the future.  The Census Bureau uses its internally developed      Geographic Update System to enhance and modify spatial and attribute data in the      Census TIGER data base.  Standard geographic codes, such as FIPS codes for states,      counties, municipalities, and places, are used when encoding spatial entities.  The       Census Bureau performed spatial data tests for logical consistency of the codes during      the compilation of the original Census TIGER data base files.  Most of the codes      themselves were provided to the Census Bureau by the USGS, the agency responsible      for maintaining FIPS 55.  Feature attribute information has been examined but has      not been fully tested for consistency.   Completeness_Report: Data completeness of the TIGER/Line files reflects the contents      of the Census TIGER data base at the time the TIGER/Line files (1995 version) were      created.   Positional_Accuracy:      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:        Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:           The information present in these files is provided for the purposes of statistical           analysis and census operations only.  Coordinates in the TIGER/Line files have            six implied decimal places, but the positional accuracy of these coordinates is           not as great as the six decimal places suggest. The positional accuracy varies           with the source materials used, but generally the information is no better than           the established National Map Accuracy standards for 1:100,000-scale maps from            the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS); thus it is NOT suitable for high-precision           measurement applications such as engineering problems, property transfers, or           other uses that might require highly accurate measurements of the earth's surface.            The USGS 1:100,000-scale maps meet national map accuracy standards and use           coordinates defined by the North American Datum, 1983. For the contiguous 48           States, the cartographic fidelity of most of the 1995 TIGER/Line files, in areas           outside the 1980 census Geographic Base File/Dual Independent Map Encoding           (GBF/DIME) file coverage and selected other large metropolitan areas, compare           favorably with the USGS 1:100,000-scale maps.  The Census Bureau cannot specify           the accuracy of features inside of what was the 1980 GBF/DIME-Files coverage or           selected metropolitan areas.  The Census Bureau added updates to the TIGER/Line files           that enumerators annotated on map sheets prepared from the Census TIGER data base            as they attempted to traverse every street feature shown on the 1990 census map sheets;           the Bureau also made other corrections from updated map sheets supplied by local           participants for Census Bureau programs.  The locational accuracy of these updates is           of unknown quality.  In addition to the Federal, State, and local sources, portions of           the files may contain information obtained in part from maps and other materials            prepared by private companies.  Despite the fact that TIGER/Line data positional            accuracy is not as high as the coordinates values imply, the six-decimal place precision           is useful when producing maps.  The precision allows features that are next to each           other on the ground to be placed in the correct position, on the map, relative to each            other, without overlap.

Process_Step:        Process_Description:           In order for others to use the information in the Census TIGER data base in a           GIS or for other geographic applications, the Census Bureau releases periodic           extracts of selected information from the Census TIGER data base, organized           as topologically consistent networks.  Software (TIGER DB routines) written           by the Geography Division allows for efficient access to Census TIGER system            data.  TIGER/Line files are extracted from the Census TIGER data base by           county or statistical equivalent area.  Census TIGER data for a given county or           statistical equivalent area is then distributed among 17 fixed length record ASCII           files, each one containing attributes for either line, polygon, or landmark geographic           data types. The Bureau of the Census has released various versions of the           TIGER/Line files since 1988, with each version having more updates (feature           and feature names, address ranges and ZIP Codes, coordinate updates, new record           types, revised field definitions, etc.), than the previous version.

Polygon features -              1) Geographic entity codes for areas used to tabulate the 1990 census statistical                   data and current geographic areas               2) Locations of area landmarks              3) Locations of KGLs         The line features and polygon information form the majority of data in the TIGER/Line        files.  Some of the data/attributes describing the lines include coordinates, feature        identifiers (names), CFCCs (used to identify the most noticeable characteristic of a        feature), address ranges, and geographic entity codes.  The TIGER/Line files         contain point and area labels that describe landmarks features and provide        locational reference.  Area landmarks consist of a feature name or label and        feature type assigned to a polygon or group of polygons.  Landmarks may         overlap or refer to the same set of polygons.         The Census TIGER data base uses collections of spatial objects (points, lines,        and polygons) to model or describe real-world geography.  The Census Bureau        uses these spatial objects to represent features such as streets, rivers, and        political boundaries and assigns attributes to these features to identify and        describe specific features such as the 500 block of Market Street in Philadelphia,        Pennsylvania.         The TIGER/Line files contain information about these spatial objects distributed        over a series of record types.  Users of the TIGER/Line files may need to link        information from several record types to find all the attributes of interest that        belong to one spatial object.          Topology explains how points, lines, and areas relate to each other and is used        as the foundation for organizing spatial objects in the Census TIGER data base.        The Census TIGER data base uses these objects to provide a disciplined,        mathematical description of the features on the earth's surface.  All spatial objects        are interrelated.  A sequence of points define line segments, and line segments        connect to define polygons.         The Census TIGER data base relates information to points or  0-cells, lines or         1-cells, and polygons or 2-cells.  The number preceding the cell identifies the        dimensionality of the objects; for instance, a line segment has a single dimension,         length.  Each of these objects build on the others to form higher-level objects.  The        0-cells form the end points of 1-cells.  The 1-cells connect at 0-cells and form closed        figures that partition space into polygons or 2-cells.         The spatial objects in TIGER/Line files embody both geometry (coordinate location        and shape) and topology (the relationship between points, lines objects, and polygons)         and therefore belong to the ""Geometry and Topology"" (GT) class of objects in the        SDTS.  In the SDTS, nodes represent point objects (0-cells) that identify the start and        end position of lines or 1-dimensional objects (1-cells) called chains.  The chains in        the TIGER/Line files are complete chains because they form GT-polygon boundaries        and intersect other chains only at nodes.  Topological chains that do not contain polygon        information are network chains used to form GT-rings.  Data users may choose not to        use GT-polygon or geographic entity codes and consider the TIGER/Line files a source        of network chain data.         The TIGER/Line files contain point landmark data that are not included in the        Census TIGER data base topology.  Point landmarks are entity points that mark        the location of points of interest and are not connected to complete chains or GT-        polygons.  A polygon identification code is used to link a landmark to a GT-polygon.

The 1998 TIGER/Line files are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the Census TIGER data base. The geographic coverage for a single TIGER/Line file is a county or statistical equivalent entity, with the coverage area based on January 1, 1999 legal boundaries. A complete set of 1999 TIGER/Line files includes all counties and statistically equivalent entities in the United States, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, U.S. Minor Outlying Areas, and the Pacific Island Areas. The Census TIGER data base represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts. However, each county-based TIGER/Line file is designed to stand alone as an independent data set or the files can be combined to cover the whole Nation and its territories. The 1999 TIGER/Line files consist of line segments representing physical features and governmental and statistical boundaries. The files contain information distributed over a series of record types for the spatial objects of a county. There are 17 record types, including the basic data record, the shape coordinate points, and geographic codes that can be used with appropriate software to prepare maps. Other geographic information contained in the files includes attributes such as feature identifiers/census feature class codes (CFCC) used to differentiate feature types, address ranges and ZIP Codes, codes for legal and statistical entities, latitude/longitude coordinates of linear and point features, landmark point features, area landmarks, key geographic features, and area boundaries. The 1999 TIGER/Line data dictionary contains a complete list of all the fields in the 17 record types.   Purpose:       In order for others to use the information in the Census TIGER data base in a geographic information system (GIS) or for other geographic applications, the Census Bureau releases to the public extracts of the data base in the form of TIGER/Line files. Various versions of the TIGER/Line files have been released; previous versions include the 1990 Census TIGER/Line files, the 1992 TIGER/Line files, the 1994 TIGER/Line files, the 1995 TIGER/Line files, the 1997 TIGER/Line files and the 1998 TIGER/Line files. The 1999 TIGER/Line files were originally produced for use by the states participating in the verification of Phase 2 of the Census 2000 Redistricting Data Program, Phase 2, the Voting District project (VTDP) and the verification of the Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP).

The remaining attribute information has been examined but has not been fully tested for accuracy.     Logical_Consistency_Report:       The feature network of lines (as represented by Record Types 1 and 2) is compete for census purposes. Spatial objects in TIGER/Line belong to the ""Geometry and topology"" (GT) class of objects in the ""Spatial Data Transfer Standard"" (SDTS) FIPS Publication 173 and are topologically valid. Node/geometry and topology (GT)-polygon/chain relationships are collected or generated to satisfy topological edit requirements. These requirements include: * Complete chains must begin and end at nodes. * Complete chains must connect to each other at nodes. * Complete chains do not extend through nodes. * Left and right GT-polygons are defined for each complete chain element and are consistent throughout the extract process. * the chains representing the limits of the files are free of gaps. The Census Bureau performed automated tests to ensure logical consistency and limits of files. All polygons are tested for closure. The Census Bureau uses its internally developed Geographic Update System to enhance and modify spatial and attribute data in the Census TIGER data base. Standard geographic codes, such as FIPS codes for states, counties, municipalities, and places, are used when encoding spatial entities. The Census Bureau performed spatial data tests for logical consistency of the codes during the compilation of the original Census TIGER data base files. Most of the Codes themselves were provided to the Census Bureau by the USGS, the agency responsible for maintaining FIPS 55. Feature attribute information has been examined but has not been fully tested for consistency.   Completeness_Report:       Data completeness of the TIGER/Line files reflects the contents of the Census TIGER data base at the time the TIGER/Line files (1999 version) were created.   Positional_Accuracy:         Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:         Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:       The information present in these files is provided for the purposes of statistical analysis and census operations only. Coordinates in the TIGER/Line files have six implied decimal places, but the positional accuracy of these coordinates is not as great as the six decimal places suggest. The positional accuracy varies with the source materials used, but generally the information is no better than the established national map Accuracy standards for 1:100,000-scale maps from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS); thus it is NOT suitable for high-precision measurement applications such as engineering problems, property transfers, or other uses that might require highly accurate measurements of the earth's surface. The USGS 1:100,000-scale maps met national map accuracy standards and use coordinates defined by the North American Datum, 1983. For the contiguous 48 States, the cartographic fidelity of most of the 1999 TIGER/Line files, in areas outside the 1980 census Geographic Base File/Dual Independent map Encoding (GBF/DIME) file coverage and selected other large metropolitan areas, compare favorable with the USGS 1:100,000-scale maps. The Census Bureau cannot specify the accuracy of features inside of what was the 1980 GBF/DIME- File coverage or selected metropolitan areas. The Census Bureau added updates to the TIGER/Line files that enumerators annotated on maps sheets prepared from the Census TIGER data base as they attempted to traverse every street feature shown on the Census 2000 map sheets; the Census Bureau also made other corrections from updated map sheets supplied by local participants for Census Bureau programs. The locational accuracy of these updates is of unknown quality. In addition to the Federal, State, and local sources, portions of the files may contain information obtained in part from maps and other materials prepared by private companies. Despite the fact the TIGER/Line data positional accuracy is not as high as the coordinate values imply, the six-decimal place precision is useful when producing maps. The precision allows features that are next to each other on the ground to be placed in the correct position, on the map, relative to each other, without overlap.

Software (TIGER DB routines) written by the Geography Division allows for efficient access to Census TIGER system data. TIGER/Line files are extracted from the Census TIGER data base by county or statistical equivalent area. Census TIGER data for a given county or statistical equivalent area is then distributed among 17 fixed length record ASCII files, each one containing attributes for either line, polygon, or landmark geographic data types. The Bureau of the Census has released various versions of the TIGER/Line files since 1988, with each version having more updates (feature and feature names, address ranges and ZIP Codes, coordinate updates, revised field definitions, etc.) than the previous version.

This data set was extracted from the UA Census 2000 TIGER/Line Files.   Purpose:     Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs) are geographic entities for which the U.S. Census Bureau provides specially selected extracts of raw data from a small sample of long-form census records. All personal identifying information has been removed from these records. The extract files are referred to as Public Use Microdata Samples (PUMS).  Public Use Microdata Areas must have a minimum census population of 100,000 and unlike 1990 cannot cross a state line. A 5-percent sample of the long-form records is extracted and presented in state files. Super-PUMAs, areas of 400,000 population, are combinations of PUMAs and represent the areas for which the Census Bureau provides a 1-percent file.   Supplemental_Information:     For Census 2000 PUMA boundaries can only follow the boundaries of the following geographic areas:     a. Counties and statistical equivalent entities;     b. Minor civil divisions (MCDs), but only in New England states;     c. Census tracts but only within counties that have more than 100,000 people, and     d. Places with a population of 100,000 or more.   The use of incorporated place boundaries as PUMA boundaries is only permitted when the PUMAs for these places comprise only the area of these places.   PUMA's as a geographic area were created for the 1990 Public Use Microdata Samples (PUMS). These areas replace the ""county groups"" used in the 1980 PUMS files and were defined by each state or local area according to Bureau specifications.

This data set contains extracts from all of Washington State's 39 Counties.    Purpose : Statistical enumeration, cartographic display and analysis.  Supplemental Information :   CDPs are delineated for the decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places. CDPs are delineated to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the state in which they are located. The boundaries usually are defined in cooperation with local or tribal officials. These boundaries, which usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or a other legal entity boundary, have no legal status, nor do these places have officials elected to serve traditional municipal functions. CDP boundaries may change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary. There are no population size requirements for CDPs for Census 2000. For the 1990 and previous censuses, the U.S. Census Bureau required CDPs to qualify on the basis of various minimum population size criteria. These entities were called unincorporated places for the 1940 through 1970 censuses.       The Census Bureau continually updates their TIGER Database. In the update process the points, lines, and polygons are repositioned. Because of the repositioning of various TIGER line segments the boundaries included may not correspond to those derived from previous versions of the TIGER files.      To find out more about TIGER/Line files and other Census TIGER data base derived data sets visit  www.census.gov/geo/www/tiger/ .

This data set was extracted from the 2000 TIGER/Line Redistricting File. The geographic coverage for a single TIGER/Line file is a county or statistical equivalent entity, with the coverage area based on January 1, 2000 legal boundaries. This dataset contains extracts of census tracts from all of Washington State's 39 Counties.                    Purpose : Statistical enumeration, cartographic display and analysis.          Supplemental Information :                         Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county (or statistical equivalent of a county), and are defined by local participants as part of the U.S. Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program. The U.S. Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where local or tribal governments declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of decennial census data. Census 2000 is the first decennial census for which the entire United States has census tracts. In 1990 some counties had census tracts and others had block numbering areas (BNAs). In preparation for Census 2000, all BNAs were replaced by census tracts.  Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,500 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. When first delineated, census tracts are designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Census tract boundaries are delineated with the intention of being maintained over a long time so that statistical comparisons can be made from census to census. However, physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline.  For Census 2000, the U.S. Census Bureau is NOT identifying separate crews-of-vessels census tracts; the crews-of-vessels population will be part of the Census 2000 census tract identified as associated with the homeport of the vessel.  The Census Bureau created 1,318 uniquely numbered Census Tracts for Washington State (2000 Census). These Census Tracts can be made up of multiple polygons.  The Census Bureau continually updates their TIGER Database. In the update process the points, lines, and polygons are occasionally repositioned. Because of the repositioning of various TIGER line segments the boundaries included may not correspond to those derived from previous versions of the TIGER files. These boundaries reflect the three mile territorial limit and extend into large water bodies. The boundaries do not depict a detailed coastline.

Future releases of TIGER/Line files will reflect updates made to the Census TIGER data base and will be released under a version numbering system based on the month and year the data is extracted.

The Census Bureau check for accuracy against Federal information Processing Standards (FIPS), FIPS Publication 6-4, and FIPS-55 at the 100% level for the codes and base names. The remaining attribute information has been examined but has not been fully tested for accuracy. The data represent entities in Washington State only.                      Completeness Report : The data represent the 1,318 Census Tracts in the State of Washington prepared for the 2000 Census at the time the TIGER/Line files (Redistricting Census 2000 Version) were created.      Positional Accuracy :                Horizontal Positional Accuracy :                        Horizontal Positional Accuracy Report :                                 The information present in these files is provided for the purposes of statistical analysis and census operations only. Coordinates in the TIGER/Line files have six implied decimal places, but the positional accuracy of these coordinates is not as great as the six decimal places suggest. The positional accuracy varies with the source materials used, but generally the information is no better than the established national map Accuracy standards for 1:100,000-scale maps from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS); thus it is NOT suitable for high-precision measurement applications such as engineering problems, property transfers, or other uses that might require highly accurate measurements of the earth's surface. The USGS 1:100,000-scale maps met national map accuracy standards and use coordinates defined by the North American Datum, 1983. For the contiguous 48 States, the cartographic fidelity of most of the Redistricting Census 2000 TIGER/Line files, in areas outside the 1980 census Geographic Base File/Dual Independent map Encoding (GBF/DIME) file coverage and selected other large metropolitan areas, compare favorable with the USGS 1:100,000-scale maps. The Census Bureau cannot specify the accuracy of features inside of what was the 1980 GBF/DIME-File coverage or selected metropolitan areas. The Census Bureau added updates to the TIGER/Line files that enumerators annotated on maps sheets prepared from the Census TIGER data base as they attempted to traverse every street feature shown on the Census 2000 map sheets; the Census Bureau also made other corrections from updated map sheets supplied by local participants for Census Bureau programs. The locational accuracy of these updates is of unknown quality. In addition to the Federal, State, and local sources, portions of the files may contain information obtained in part from maps and other materials prepared by private companies. Despite the fact the TIGER/Line data positional accuracy is not as high as the coordinate values imply, the six-decimal place precision is useful when producing maps. The precision allows features that are next to each other on the ground to be placed in the correct position, on the map, relative to each other, without overlap.

Entity Type Definition :                                 Census 2000 Tract boundaries of Washington State as recorded by the US Bureau of the Census. Census tract numbers have a 4-digit basic number and may have an optional 2-digit suffix; for example, 1457.02. Census tract numbers range from 0001 to 9999 and are unique within a county or equivalent area. The U.S. Census Bureau reserves the census tract numbering range of 9400 to 9499 for use by American Indian area participants in situations where an American Indian entity crosses county or state lines. The U.S. Census Bureau uses suffixes to help identify census tract changes for comparison purposes. Local participants have an opportunity to review the existing census tracts before each census. If local participants split a census tract, the split parts usually retain the basic number, but receive different suffixes. In a few counties, local participants request major changes to, and renumber, the census tracts. Changes to individual census tract boundaries usually do not result in census tract numbering changes. In printed reports and on mapping products, the U.S. Census Bureau uses a decimal point (.) to separate the basic number from the suffix. However, in the TIGER/Line ® files and Summary File (SF) data products, the decimal point is implied. The basic number and the suffix appear together in a single 6-character field in Record Types 1, 3, A, and S. A basic number smaller than 1000 will contain leading zeros (for example, 002502). Leading zeros are shown on machine-readable products, but are not shown in printed reports or on census maps. The TIGER/Line ® files use the right-most two characters in the census tract field for the suffix. Where a census tract suffix does not exist, the suffix is zero filled in machine-readable products, but blank in printed reports, on census maps, and in the 1998 and earlier TIGER/Line ® files. Beginning with the 1999 TIGER/Line ® files, zeros will appear in the right-most two characters in the census tract field where a census tract suffix does not exist. Suffixes smaller than 10 have a leading zero. For example, census tract 0077.01 is shown as 007701 in the TIGER/Line ® files.

The grid was converted from an ASCII file obtained from the Consortium for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN).     Purpose:       Large scale representation of population distribution in the conterminous United  States.  This data set was converted for use in the analysis of ground-water quality data on volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Water-Quality Assessment Program (NAWQA) VOC National Synthesis Team.     Supplemental_Information:       PROCEDURES USED   The data from which the population density grid was created was retrieved in ASCII format from data released by the Consortium for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN) (1995) and a FORTRAN program was used to convert it into a format that could be read into an ARC/INFO grid data set. The data was then projected from its original projection to an Albers projection using nearest-neighbor resampling. Detailed processing steps are included in this metadata file. The following documentation file also was released by CIESIN and is included here.      ******************** BEGIN CIESIN README FILE ********************   The Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC)           INTEGRATED DATASETS FOR THE USA                  June 27 1995  ---------------------------------------------------------   GENERAL   The primary mission of The Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC), at the Consortium for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN), is to develop new policy oriented applications and information products that synthesize earth science and socioeconomic data. The SEDAC policy applications development effort is the primary means by which the Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) program helps to ensure that the scientific investment embodied in NASA's Mission to Planet Earth (MTPE) program leads to tangible benefits.   Within this framework, the ""Population, Land Use and Emissions"" Task (PLUE) embarked on integrating data from different sources. Specifically, data from the US decennial census (1990) and recent satelite data were integrated. In the initial attempt, the focus is on transforming census vector based data to satelite pixel based data.  From the US census data Total Persons and Total Housing Unit Structures   were the selected data items (from the blockgroup geography) to be merged with the Land Cover Characteristics database (square kilometer resolution) for the conterminous United States from the EROS Data Center.  This land cover was derived from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) 1990 multitemporal satelite data.   LOCATION   The US census blockgroup boundary information are present on a publicly accessible FTP archive: The Archive of Census Related Products. To access this Archive connect to        ftp ftp.ciesin.org <160.39.8.201>       user <log in as anonymous or ftp>       password <enter email address>       cd /pub/census   Please read the file ""archive.ann"" and ""archive2.ann"" for a detailed description of this Archive which contains 11,000+ densely compressed boundary and demographic data files. The census blockgroup boundary files are located, by state, in /pub/census/usa/tiger.   The Archive may also be reached via WWW at the URL    <http://www.ciesin.org/datasets/us-demog/us-demog-home.html>    The integrated data products are posted as generic compressed ascii files in the location in    <ftp://ftp.ciesin.org/pub/census/usa/grid>    The data files, their structure and creation, are described in further detail below. A series of graphic (GIF) files provide for a quick glance at the data products. In the near future, this information will be accessible via The Interactive System for Analysis Services (ISAS), a suite of query engines for WWW browsers.   LAYOUT   For each state, US census data and EROS Land Cover data have been integrated, meaning both datasets are reported at the square kilometer resolution for the conterminous USA. Support files include:          gridlgd.txt    legend  & variable/file descriptions       griddoc.txt    [this file]       gridbox.txt    bounding boxes for the states      gridcomb.sas    file for data processing and image creation   CREATION   The integrated data were created using in-house developed algorithms written in C. A proportional allocation algorithm was applied. The individual steps of data processing are described next.   a) The census blockgroups, derived from the US Bureau of the Census Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing database (TIGER/Line 1992), were first projected from their latitude-longitude source to the projection used in the Land Cover Charateristics database. This coordinate system is the oblique Lamberts Azimuthal Equal Area LAZEA) projection with an origin of -100 longitude and +45 latitude. The exact equations applied to tranform TIGER92 to this projection were:    X=Rkcos(lat)sin(long-long_origin) Y=Rk[cos(lat_origin)sin(lat)-sin(lat_origin)cos(lat)cos(long-long_origin)]  k={2/[1+sin(lat_origin)sin(lat)+   cos(lat_origin)cos(lat)cos(long-long_origin)]}**1/2   R is radius of sphere (by default 6,370,997 meters)   [from: Map Projections-A Working Manual by John P. Snyder, USGS 1987].   b) Once the boundaries are in LAZEA format, the selected data items from the census were merged into these files and submitted to a suite of programs.   c) Proportional allocation. By state, each census blockgroup's bounding box is first determined in the LAZEA X-Y system. Next the area of overlap for each pixel (km2 grid) is determined. The sum of all overlapping areas is assigned as the total area of the polygon. Next, the data items, typically count type data (such as number of persons or buildings), are distributed across the intersecting grids based on the fraction of grid-overlapping-area over total-polygon-area. These steps are repeated for all polygons within each state and the values are accumulated in memory for each grid. (A check calculation is performed by adding all grid values for the polygon in question and verifying that the actual value does sum to the original total). In a final step, the accumulated total within each LAZEA X-Y grid are divided by the area of the grid itself to arrive at density measures (in our example, each grid is 1 kilometer by 1 kilometer, but this value may be changed).   d) To make the data available in a generic way, the saved binary output files, one for each state, are accessed and the data dumped out in a generic image format. The structure of these files (the ??_int.zip files in  <ftp://ftp.ciesin.org/pub/census/usa/grid/pall> ) is as follows:   2781 3475 1862 2569          xmin xmax ymin ymax 1.000000 1.000000            xsize ysize 0.000000 0.000000 0          pdkm hdkm lckm 0.000000 0.000000 0          pdkm hdkm lckm 1.105958 4.150659 91         pdkm hdkm lckm 0.736277 3.411086 136        pdkm hdkm lckm ...                          ...   Records are shown for each grid inside the state's bounding box. The size of the image (bounding box) is determined by the points (xmin,ymin) for lower left and (xmax,ymax) for top right. The table size is rows=ymax-ymin by cols=xmax-xmin. The grid size is, in kilometers, reported on record 2. The sequence of the records reported from line 3 till end of file begin at (xmin,ymax) on row=1, col=1. Sequentially, all grid values are reported for row=1 until the end of row=1 is encountered (cols) before the row iterates and reporting starts at (row=2,col=1).   These ascii files are then zipped with a CR-LF added to the end of each record (unix users use the unzip -a option replacng CR-LF with a LF). See the file ""gridcomb.sas"" for more detail.   The file ""gridbox.txt"" summarizes all the bounding boxes for all states.   e) When accessing multiple states, boundary conditions need to be corrected.  For example, the state boundary line between two states could split a single grid. So the grid in question will get data allocated to it by both states . When splicing multiple states together these duplicate records need to be collapsed into one record.   For the users this has been done for regions of the US (See the directory /pub/census/usa/grid/pall/us). The abbreviations used are:          Regional Area                States       ------------------------     --------------------------       NE    NorthEast              me nh vt ma ct ri ny pa nj       SA    South Atlantic         dc de md wv va nc sc ga fl       ESA   East South Atlantic    ky tn al ms       WSA   West South Atlantic    ar la ok tx       ENC   East North Central     mi wi il in oh       WNC   West North Central     mn ia mo nd sd ne ks       NWM   North West Mountain    mt wy id       SWM   South West Mountain    ut az co nm       PAC   Pacific                wa or ca nv   From these files a USgrid.asc file will be put together for the whole US. More information on this file and a program to extract, based on any 2 points defining a rectangle, will be added into this file soon.   These <REGION>grid.asc files have yet another file structure simplifying spatial retrievals based LAZEA X-Y. The layout looks like:    3556 1559 42.638058 16.016323 47   lazea-X lazea-Y pdkm hdkm lckm 3557 1559 5.12569 1.939586 47      lazea-X lazea-Y pdkm hdkm lckm 3336 1558 1.402889 0.5097 52       lazea-X lazea-Y pdkm hdkm lckm ...   The file ""gridbox.txt"" can be used in conjunctions with these X,Y coordinates for spatial referencing. The ""USgrid.asc"" file created solves the boundary problems between regions. Consult the file ""us/us-dist.txt"" for simple stats on these files.   PROBLEMS   These files currently contain two problems which have been identified. Future releases will correct for these errors or approach the problem differently. In addition, in the future we will add more census and land cover varibales as well as emissions data.   1. Water areas receiving data in allocation program. First, this is explained by those grids on the shorelines. Part of the grid is water, part of the grid is land. The proportional allocation algorithm thus allocates census data to the grids for which there is partial water. The definition of the grid being water or land should be incorporated into the algorithm to fix this. The other problem in this area is those census blockgroups who consists of a large portion of water area and a tiny land area with significant population (see the Saginaw Bay area of Lake Huron). To avoid this problem, census blocks should be used which are either land or water, not a mixture of the two.   2. An oddity was discovered when examining the District of Columbia. In this area certain pixels receive data values that absolutely have no coverage with any of the polygons in the census blockgroup layer. We are currently investigating this problem and its effect on the integrated data layers.   3. A peculiarity. Certain areas of the census blockgroup coverage are missing because we were unable to ""chain"" the particular polygon. In other instances, large geographic areas might not contain persons in it. In both cases the density values assinged to the grid are 0. When integrating with the Land Cover grids, the with 0 density were missed when integrating the grid data. There does exist a Land Cover Characterization Code for these grids and their density values are zero. A peculiarity we did not catch in time when processing.   4. One LCKM values in the Northwest was assigned a nonsense value over the maximum possible of 159. Please delete this value.   NOTE: Please note that the term ""land use"" is used loosely. Land cover is a better definition. The housing unit structures density is the only measure of urban activity in these data so far. Similarly, emissions data is at the current time lacking from the design.    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------   Email comments/ideas/suggestions and bug reports to ciesin.info@ciesin.org   Phone them in at: 517.797.2727    ********************* END CIESIN README FILE *********************     REVIEWS APPLIED TO DATA   This electronic report was subjected to the same review standard that applies to all U.S. Geological Survey reports.

A FORTRAN program was used to reformat the file into an input format used by the ARC ASCIIGRID command. The cell size, corner coordinates, and projection came from the documentation of the data files as posted on the CIESIN ftp site. (This documentation file is included in this metadata file.)   The ASCIIGRID file was formatted like this:    ncols         4587 nrows         2889 xllcorner     -2050500 yllcorner     -2136500 cellsize      1000 NODATA_value  -9 4 5 3 5 3 4 5 5 3 3 3 2 2 1 1 1 1 ... (4587 values per row)   (data continues for a total of 2889 rows)   The ARC/INFO ASCIIGRID command was used to read this into a grid, and the PROJECT command then was used to project the grid from its original projection (Lambert Azimuthal) to the Albers projection.  Nearest-neighbor resampling was done to preserve the population density values through the projection change.   This processing was performed by David Wolock, U.S. Geological Survey, Lawrence, Kansas.

NSDI Implementation in Utah     Introduction   The OMB Information Initiative to align the needs and resources to continue to develop the National Spatial Data Infrastructure provides public and private agencies in Utah an opportunity to focus on mutually beneficial partnerships.  The results of these efforts will help to provide integrated information for analysis of issues and decision-making at federal, state, local, and Tribal levels of government.  Further it will provide a common frame of reference for communicating information and concepts of complex issues to citizens.     Overview of the Plan   This Implementation Plan identifies the organizational structure of the Implementation Team for Utah, defines a process based on planning and policy issues for prioritizing data themes that will contribute to building the NSDI, and provides a summary of eighteen data themes that will be included in the prioritization process   .   Jurisdiction   This plan addresses issues and information needs statewide for Utah and reflects the collaboration of federal and state agencies and representatives of local and Tribal governments.      Implementation Team       The Geographic Information Systems Advisory Council (GISAC) has led the statewide GIS data coordination efforts in Utah.  GISAC membership encompasses federal agencies, state agencies, local government, Native American Tribes, academia, and private sector participants .   GISAC has met and agreed to serve as the Implementation Team for Utah.  Members of GISAC, in addition to other agency participants have been identified to participate in the Implementation Team (Appendix 3: Membership List ).   Subcommittee working groups of GISAC typically address specific joint projects.  It is proposed that this subcommittee working group structure be used for each framework layer and state defined theme to develop and implement the plan for that data layer (Section 3: Subcommittee participation).  Within this structure, a federal champion would be identified for each theme as requested by OMB.  Representatives from county government (Appendix 3) and Tribal government (Appendix 3) will also be invited to participate to the extent and at the level they are interested in.  The Financial Team liaison is the Chair of the GISAC.  GISAC meets monthly and will report to the FGDC annually or as needed.    GISAC Track Record.   GISAC has successfully coordinated similar efforts under the Framework Demonstration Project Program (FDPP) and Competitive Cooperative Agreements Program (CCAP); has led multi-participant Joint Funding and Innovative Partnership projects, and administered funding programs appropriated by both the State Legislature and the U.S. Congress. Through GISAC, a strong partnership environment exists in Utah.           The mission of GISAC is to ""recommend GIS policy and standards, encourage GIS use and education, and promote data collection, integration and dissemination among all GIS users.  Collectively, these activities promote increased productivity, better decisions, and improved services to customers"".        The Implementation Team is built on the foundation of cooperation developed over the last decade; these relationships were formalized in October of 1997.  The State of Utah and nine federal agencies signed a Memorandum of Understanding for the Utah Digital Spatial Data Sharing and Integration Project (Appendix 1).   The purpose of this MOU is for sharing and exchanging non-sensitive digital spatial information in the State of Utah. Under this agreement an online catalog of the data (SGID--State Geographic Information Database) is maintained by the Automated Geographic Reference Center (AGRC).  AGRC is a NSDI clearinghouse node.     Approach   Framework Layers .  The Implementation Team has defined 18 priority data themes.  These include the seven framework themes defined by the FGDC, an additional eleven layers were defined by the 1997 MOU (8 layers) and by subsequent agency needs (3 layers).  A listing of these layers is provided in Section 3 of this plan.     Selected priority layers currently are assigned to work groups.  Where funding has been identified and work is already in progress, this work will be documented in the inventory process and will continue unimpeded and accelerated where possible.  In cases where funding has not been identified, these layers will be included in the prioritization within the scope of the plan.    Process.   For each framework layer a subcommittee work group (Section 3) will be identified.  Each work group will represent agencies having mandated responsibility and/or programmatic need for the data.  Each group will coordinate completion of the following:      Inventory of the existing data and provide a status report   Develop costs estimate and time requirements for completion of the data layer   Describe how investment has been leveraged to provide data for multiple uses   Identify standards and document   Develop a strategy for completing the data layer   Assign responsibility for creation, integration, and maintenance of the data layer   Provide data access through the SGID or agency based web sites      Prioritization of Framework Layers.   GISAC is in the process of identifying the driving issues for each level of government.  An initial list of issues is discussed in Section 2 of this plan; however, a more comprehensive analysis of the issues and identification of overlapping information needs will addressed in future meetings.  We anticipate this will be an iterative process and issues can be revised regularly.  Also, some agencies may require additional time for their management to prioritize issues.  As the issue analysis is completed, the matrix in Section 3 will be updated to reflect priority issues and identify the framework layers that are needed to address each issue.  As shown on the Issues/ Data matrix in Section 3, framework layers are needed to address most issues, so it is anticipated that even as issues change, many of the data requirements will not change.  It is anticipated that some layers may receive higher priority from time to time and some areas of the state may receive higher priority than others but this flexibility will be workable through the plan.    Budget and schedule.   GISAC meets monthly.  It is planned to place I-Team issues on their agenda as needed, but at least quarterly.  Those quarterly meetings will result in a report that describes progress, identified needs, and alterations to the Implementation Plan.  GISAC will begin immediately to identify funding sources to fulfill needs and to enhance collaborative efforts to secure resources needed to fully implement the Plan.    I-Team Principles.   The principles followed by the Utah I-Team are based upon the following policy statements which have been adopted by GISAC.          Most data should be created and kept current by agencies that have a programmatic need or mandated responsibility for specific layers.        Because users close to the geographic features usually have first hand knowledge of the data and can provide more accurate and timely data, local governments should be encouraged to create and share data.        Coordination of state, local, and federal data development and sharing efforts should continue as a state led activity through the GISAC and it’s partnership with the FGDC.        There will always be a number of  ""framework"" base layers or critical and common thematic layers (identified by GISAC) that will require funded creation and centralized maintenance.        The integration of differing data within and among themes should remain a centralized  function of the State Geographic Information Database.     Standards.  The GISAC and the State of Utah have adopted the FGDC metadata standards as the standard for the State Geographic Information Database.   Data standards for the framework themes and critical layers will be developed jointly by the creation agencies if national standards do not currently exist.  Each layer will have documented standards.  These and other standards are intended to achieve coordination and interoperability.                Section 2.   Driving Issues       Governor = s Message on State Priorities       The State of Utah now has 2.1 million people and is growing at twice the national rate.  The state = s economy has made a smooth transition from the boom or near-boom conditions it experienced during much of the 1990s and remains very well poised to continue to prosper.  The 2002 Olympic Winter Games are now just under a year away and the State is well primed to host the world having invested millions of dollars in highways, rail transit, digital infrastructure, housing, and winter sports venues.    Growth in all of its forms remains the dominant issue facing the state.  Population, job, and income growth rates in Utah continue to outpace those of the nation.  In the last eight years, 250,000 net new jobs have been created, approximately one in every four that exists today.  Managing this growth in a way which preserves Utah = s enviable quality of life is a primary focus of Governor Leavitt.  Through his leadership the state is pro-actively investing in Utah = s future.    The Governor has focused the state = s resources towards the realization of three general goals:         Improve the quality of education   Provide a strong economy and more quality jobs   Improve Utahn = s quality of life       The fulfillment of these goals requires careful planning, investment, and purposeful action.  Accordingly, state government is focusing its energies on education funding; economic development; and, quality of life issues such as transportation congestion, environmental quality, crime and safety, health care, and human services. The National Spatial Data Infrastructure project is an important part of addressing the priorities of the Governor as they relate to growth, health and safety, and quality of life.        Utah = s prospects have never been brighter.  My aim is to seize the moment, maximize the opportunity and turn up the wattage even higher.         B  Governor Michael Leavitt    Driving Issues     The 2002 Winter Olympics are under a year away.   Several of Utah’s counties are among the fastest growing in the country and open space, including prime farm land, is disappearing at an alarming rate.  The Wasatch Front is one of the most susceptible areas in the nation to earthquakes.  Nearly seventy percent of Utah is administered by the government and much of it is off limits to sustainable rural development efforts.  Citizens living in the state as well as all across the nation are concerned about the wise use of Utah’s natural resources and public lands.    Public Officials in Utah concentrate on issues facing the state and its local subdivisions daily.   They must analyze information and make decisions that affect citizens and the environment of the State.  Having the best available information easily accessible by these decision makers is critical.    Required Data:     The Utah Framework Implementation Team (I-Team), working with the agencies they represent, identified many of the State’s most serious issues.  The I-Team then determined which data themes are required to successfully address each issue.  This analysis is summarized in the table below.  The first three issues in the table, represent the Governor’s top priorities.                                                 UTAH ISSUES       Economic Development     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X       Education / Enrollment     X             X         X     X     X                         X         X         X       EGOV Service Delivery     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X                                 X               Olympics     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X             X         X         X     X     X       Rural Economies     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X       Quality Growth     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X       Hazardous/Nuclear Waste     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X         X     X       Open Space/Agriculture     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X             X       Environmental Protection     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X             X       Emergency Management     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X         X                         X     X     X       Public Lands Management     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X       Law Enforcement     X     X     X     X         X     X     X                                 X     X           Traffic/Transportation     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X         X     X     X     X     X       Redistricting / Census     X     X         X         X     X     X                                 X     X           Epidemiology/ Health Care     X     X         X         X     X     X                                 X     X     X       Social Services     X     X         X         X     X     X                                 X     X           E911     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X                                 X     X              Section 3.

Budget and Schedule Summary     The I-Team considered a variety of options for determining priorities for funding and scheduling. We discussed setting priorities based on whether a theme was necessary to address multiple issues identified in Section 2.  Designating the seven FGDC framework layers as the top priorities was another option.  We also recognized that priorities could be based on funding opportunities, that is, if funding is currently available for a given theme, should it be a priority.  After considerable discussion, the team agreed to the following criteria:       Theme is a priority to your agency.   Theme is moderately important to your agency.   Theme is least important to your agency.     In this way, each I-Team member could best answer for their own agency and each member submitted their agency priorities.  These agency-based recommendations were then consolidated into the priority column in the table below.            Theme Type     Priority (1 – 3)     Time Frame     1 st  Year Cost     Total Cost       Geodetic Control               1               ?               ?       $4,900.000       DOQs               1        10 years         $803,200       $4,928,000       Elevation               1         1 year         $460,230        $460,230       Transportation               1         3 years       $2,000,000       $5,370,950       Hydrography               1         5 years         $590,400       $2,678,968       Boundaries               1               ?               ?              ?

More stations are required in populated areas.  These stations should be coincident with PLSS township corners.  There are 2565 townships in Utah and a station is required at least every four townships.  We estimate that approximately 700 stations need to be established.  These average $7,000 per station for a total cost of $4,900,000.     Digital Ortho-Imagery     $147,000 is required to complete the first generation coverage of Digital Orthophoto Quads (DOQs) for the state.  Approximately one half of these were done from photography flown in 1993.  At least for the high growth areas, plans are underway to begin second generation DOQs.  These will cost $800.00 per quarter quad.  Complete coverage of second generation DOQs for the State would cost approximately $4,928,000.  The I-Team has discussed a revision cycle of ten years and has began to identify critical areas for new DOQs this year.  An estimated $803,200.00 is required for second-generation coverage for the priority areas in Utah based either upon coverage for urban growth areas or replacement DOQs for older National High Altitude Aerial Photography (NAPP).  The I-Team will begin to identify the most critical areas this year.     Elevation     An estimated $460,230.00 is required to complete once-over state coverage for 10-meter DEMs.  Estimate based on the current cost of $690 to produce one 10-meter DEM for the remaining 667 7.5-minute quadrangles in the state.     Transportation     Currently, nearly 50% percent of the roads in Utah have been GPSed, nearly 25% have been attributed, and about 10% have been QA/QCed.  To complete this process another $5,000,000 ($100/per mile X 50,000 miles remaining) is needed.  From that complete comprehensive framework database, the DLGs can be updated at a total cost of $320,950 (917 quads X $350 per quad).  Also, UDOT will be able to finalize the State transportation network for state and federal routes for another $50,000.     Hydrography     Hydrologic Sub-basin Boundaries:   An estimated $129,200.00 is required to complete delineation for the remaining 38 sub-basin boundaries encompassing Utah and the surrounding states.  Based on the current estimated cost of $3,400.00 for each sub-basin boundary delineation.  This estimated cost also includes the delineation for the interior watershed and sub-watershed boundaries.      National Hydrography Dataset:   To complete the 1:24,000-scale revision process for the State of Utah will cost $2,549,768.00   based upon the following estimates (for the remaining quads within the state):       1,028 quads revised @ $785/quad =  $806,980.00    1,203 quads high-res NHD (58 sub-basins) @ $527/quad  =     633,981.00    2,231 QA/QC revision and high-res NHD @ $497/quad  =  1,108,807.00          Total Cost =   $2,549,768.00     Costs per quad are an average of a 4% increase per year, figured for a five year projected completion.  An additional $1,443,612.00 will be required to revise the Digital Line Graph (DLG) and FS Cartographic Feature File (CFF) data, do high-resolution NHD, and QA/QC the quadrangles in the adjacent states for those 38 sub-basins that fall over Utah’s border.  To accomplish this it will be necessary to enter into cost share partnerships with the surrounding states.    Boundaries     Costs for the boundaries theme are yet to be determined.    Cadastral     To complete a Cadastral layer for the State of Utah, an estimated total of $5,600,000 will be required.  Of this, the first-year cost is estimated at approximately $500,000.  This figure represents varying degrees of work for the 2,565 townships in Utah, and does not include the ongoing Operations and Management (maintenance) necessary to keep the layer current.  Approximately 305 townships have been validated, leaving 2,260 that need collection, correction, and validation.   The above figure entails collection of existing corner data at all levels of government, and the collection of new corner data, all to the standards specified later in this document.  These data sets will pass through the BLM’s GCDB toolset, before being integrated into the statewide layer.    Demographics    Currently, there are three FTEs working full time on this theme at GOPB for an annual cost of approximately $125,000.  This is the amount required annually to maintain this theme.     Wetlands     It has been determined that it would cost $2,763,000 to complete a statewide digital wetlands data set.  This would include completion of photo-interpretation, draft and hardcopy map production, digitizing quads, and the QA/QC process.  Upon the completion of these steps, the data would be submitted to NWI for certification and integration into the NWI database.     Geology     UGS has expended $850,000 ($500,000 on surface maps, $200,000 on hazards, and $150,000 on resources) in the past five years since the effort to complete the Geology theme began.    $72,204,000 will be required to complete the geology theme and an additional $30,000/year will be required for update and maintenance of this theme (this figure will increase with time as the number of maps in the theme increases).    $4,568,000 and 15 years will be required to complete all 1:100,000-scale surface geologic maps in GIS format (assuming 5 FTE geologists and 1.5 FTE GIS specialists).  $67,990,000 and 110 years will be required to complete all 1:24,000-scale surface geologic maps in GIS format (assuming 5 FTE geologists and 1.5 FTE GIS specialists).  $180,000 and three years will be required to complete all current and published geologic hazard maps in GIS format (assuming 1.5 FTE GIS specialists).  $330,000 and eleven years will be required to complete all current and published geologic resource maps in GIS format (assuming 2 FTE geologists and 1 FTE GIS specialist).      Wildlife     The Utah Division of Wildlife Resources maintains GIS themes for wildlife species locality data and wildlife species habitat data.  Although there is currently adequate funding to update and maintain the wildlife species locality themes, approximately $200,000 is needed to update the wildlife species habitat themes.  Both types of wildlife themes are designated as  A priority data layers"", as they are used for impact analysis, management, research, and planning.    Climate      A quite firm estimate to create the 1971-2000 thematic layers is:  $3,000 to organize and set up the data for each layer, and $2,000 for the mapping of each layer for each year and month.  For example, for temperatures there would be a $3,000 set up cost, and then an additional $2,000 for each of the maximum, minimum and average temperature maps created.  These combinations are required to meet users needs.  The total cost would be $269,000.    Ground Cover    No information currently available.    Land Use     Creation of a statewide land use them is a priority.  To have complete coverage of high-resolution LULC data for Utah would cost approximately $7 million.  This is based on an average cost of $4,500 per quad for the LULC multiplied by the 1,542 1:24,000-scale quadrangles that cover Utah.  The contributions to create and maintain this coverage need to be combined from a number of sources.    Soils    Approximately 15 million acres of soils remain to be initially mapped, to have mapping updated, data sets built, and certified before inclusion in Utah’s SSURGO Data Base.  Estimated costs to complete the detailed soil survey and develop a SSURGO Data Base theme is about 18.75 million dollars.  The funding for NRCS allows for about 10 soil scientists and this is expected to continue.  Soil Scientist funding for progress soil survey averages about 40,000 acres per person per year or 400,000 acres.  The total estimated allocation of funds for the 400,000 acre per year goal for soil survey is about $500,000 for mapping;  $50,000 for correlation, data quality review, and lab data; and about $50,000 for map materials, compilation, and digitizing.  This total is about $600,000 annually to support soil survey mapping and SSURGO Data Base development at its present level.    Telecommunications Infrastructure    Some digital data remains to be developed.  All data distributed for this theme must be documented using the FGDC National Metadata Standard.  The CIO’s office and AGRC will coordinate development and implementation of minimum attribute standards for these themes.    Critical Facilities / Infrastructure     Most of the themes in this section are complete with just maintenance required to reflect current conditions.  The water distribution system theme requires the most work of any in this section.  There are approximately forty Water Districts in the State.  We will contact each of them to get the most current and accurate information.  One and ½ FTEs are needed to complete and maintain this activity.    Environmental Hazards    No information currently available.       Section 5.     Geodetic Control     Theme Description:     Geodetic control is the common basis for referencing other features to the earth's surface relying on nationally used horizontal and vertical coordinate datums.  The National Research Council recognized the importance of this layer when it published the ""Need For A Multipurpose Cadastre"" in 1980.  It reported that ""A survey control base is needed to create an integrated land records and information system.  Monumented points whose coordinates have been determined with respect to the national geodetic control system constitutes such a system.  This system permits spatial reference of all land data to identifiable points on the earth's surface "".    Data Sources:     The primary source for geodetic data is the National Geodetic Survey (NGS).  NGS, known by other agency names in the past, has been responsible for establishing and maintaining a nation-wide geodetic control network since 1807.  This network, currently called the National Spatial Reference System (NSRS), contains monumented survey stations whose horizontal and/or vertical coordinates are precisely known.  In the past NGS was the only agency establishing, maintaining, and publishing high accuracy geodetic control.  Due to the nature of the surveying technologies most horizontal control was on mountain peaks, and vertical control followed roads and railroads.  The US Geological Survey, to support their mapping efforts would come off the NGS control and survey down to the area of interest using lower accuracy procedures and instruments, but adequate for USGS mapping.  Therefore, many geodetic survey stations established 30 or more years ago are considered inaccessible by today's surveyors or inappropriate for using GPS technology. The control network continues to diminish in size as stations are destroyed due to construction and vandalism .    Map 1, at the end of this section, depicts the Federal Base Network (FBN) for Utah.  The FBN is a subset of the approximately 7500 geodetic control stations that comprise the NSRS in Utah.  NGS policy is that only FBN will be maintained by NGS, the remaining stations of the NSRS are the responsibility of local entities.  The rationale is that the FBN stations, by having extremely accurate positions, can be used by local surveying entities to effectively establish new stations or re-establish NSRS stations using GPS techniques.    With the advent of modern technologies such as GPS and bar code leveling instruments, many state, local and Tribal government agencies have undertaken to establish geodetic control.  Data submitted to NGS that comply with standards and specifications are incorporated into the NSRS.  Many entities elect to not submit their data to the NGS but will provide those data upon request, while some entities will not provide those data outside the agency.  The NSRS is made available free of charge by NGS through direct Internet access; other methods (CDs, paper products, etc.) incur a cost of dissemination.    State Statue requires licensed surveyors in Utah to file with the County Surveyor,  geodetic control they establish. County Surveyors establish and publish geodetic control within their own jurisdictions and in conjunction with NG S.    Status:     The status of geodetic control varies with the value and development of the land.  Remote and sparsely populated areas seem to survive with little geodetic control or local surveying entities establish control as needed on a project-by-project basis.  Areas of high population density require a much higher density of control.     The   most aggressive efforts to densify geodetic control are along the Wasatch Front where most of the   state = s   population resides and land development flourishes. County Surveyors are establishing high   accuracy control stations to perpetuate the positioning of the Public Land Survey Systems (PLSS).  A high accuracy network can be efficiently used for Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) GPS surveying and traditional methods.  RTK is very efficient for cadastral survey, stake out survey, and as-built surveying of infrastructure (pipelines, fiber optic cable, etc.). Geodetic positioning of all corners will bring the PLSS into a coordinate system at centimeter level of accuracy, using RTK techniques .     Standards:     Standards for both the establishment of geodetic control and for data transfers are well documented.  See Geospatial Positioning Accuracy Standards (FGDC-STD-007-1998) and Spatial Data Transfer Standard (SDTS), Part 6: Point Profile (FGDC-STD-002.6).     Priority:     The geodetic control layer is of very high priority for surveying and mapping in Utah.  The rationale being that if geodetic control is readily available throughout the state, all geospatial data will be brought into a common coordinate system at the time the data are collected.  This is especially important in developing an integrated cadastre.      Since geodetic control is a fundamental infrastructure for geo-spatial analysis activities, the higher the interest level in a geographic area, the higher the priority for good geodetic control. In remote areas, where small scale mapping is used, the existent NSRS may be adequate.  In urbanized areas or areas undergoing significant development, large scale mapping is recommended and the existent NSRS might not be adequate.    Due to resource constraints, the establishing of geodetic control is usually done on a project-by-project basis.  Geodetic control might have been used to collect data in an area had the control been there initially .     Total Current Investment in Theme:     The total investment to date by federal, state, and local entities is significant but the amount is not currently available.    Contributions by Sector:     Unknown.    Estimate of Investments Needed to complete This Item:     To provide adequate geodetic control for the survey community in Utah, a high order station is needed at a minimum, although somewhat sparse, spacing of every twenty four miles.  More stations are required in populated areas.  These stations should be coincident with PLSS township corners.  There are 2565 townships in Utah and a station is required at least every four townships.  We estimate that approximately 700 stations need to be established.  These average $7,000 per station for a total cost of $4,900,000.    Estimate of Current Allocation of Funding for This Theme:     Other than what is spent on an occasional corner set by a County Surveyor on the Wasatch front, there is no funding currently available.  There must be a coordinated effort created between NGS, state agencies and local agencies to accomplish the goal described above.    Describe Ways to Fund This Gap:    State and national appropriations .     Most Appropriate Data Steward:     We foresee sharing this responsibility between NGS, the State of Utah (AGRC ),  Bureau of Land Management (BLM)   and the County Surveyor = s .   NGS, through its existent on-line database will remain responsible for the NSRS.  However, AGRC is establishing a clearinghouse for the distribution of geodetic data. This clearinghouse will also mirror the data provided by NGS resulting in a single source of geodetic control for local surveyors.  All state, local, and private agencies that establish geodetic control will be invited to participate.     Maintenance Process and Cost:     Unknown at this time.     Section 6.     Digital Ortho-Imagery     Theme Description:     The FGDC ""Framework Introduction and Guide"" explains that ""Orthoimagery provides a positionally correct image of the earth.  An orthoimage is a georeferenced image prepared from an aerial photograph or other remotely sensed data from which displacements of images caused by sensor orientation and terrain relief have been removed.""      Digital orthoimagery is typically utilized in a digital orthophoto format.  A digital orthophoto is a georeferenced image that has the properties of an orthographic projection – positionally correct image of the earth – composed of an array of georeferenced pixels that encode ground reflectance as a discrete digital value.  The orthophoto combines the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map.      This dataset can be utilized to derive and compile many geographic features that are part of the framework for utilization in Geographic Information System (GIS) applications.  In particular, numerous vector data themes can be compiled from digital orthoimagery.  The dataset can also be used to analyze or reference other data and to update older data based on the visible features on the digital orthoimagery.  Change detection is another use of this data.     Data Sources:     There are various datasets for digital orthoimagery.  The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) compiles and produces a standard digital orthoimage in 1-meter ground resolution quarter quadrangles (1:12,000-scale, 3.75- x 3.75-minute in extent) that are referred to as digital orthophoto quads (DOQ).  The U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service (FS) also produces this standard dataset.       Status:     Completion of once-over DOQ coverage for the State of Utah is nearly complete (Section 6, Map 1).  This represents a first generation product initiated in 1994 using 1993 National High Altitude Aerial Photography (NAPP).  Completion is projected for 2001 using 1997 NAPP.  Utah and its federal and local government partners expect to extend this program to develop second-generation DOQs where needed with priorities determined by high urban growth or other issue based areas.       Standards:     Standards for DOQs are described in the USGS ""National Mapping Program Technical Instructions Standards for Digital Orthophotos,"" dated December 1996.    Priority:     Priorities for second-generation coverage would be the urban corridor along the Wasatch Front from the central part of the state (city of Nephi) north through the Provo-Orem city area, Salt Lake Valley, Ogden, to Cache Valley.  The metropolitan areas of Tooele, Park City, and Heber in northern Utah and the urban corridor of St. George to Cedar City in southwestern Utah would also be included.  All these regions represent unprecedented metropolitan growth during the past decade and this data set would contribute to the urban planning and growth, transportation planning, and watershed management in these areas.        Replacement of DOQs produced with older NAPP aerial photography is also a second-generation coverage priority.  Additional second-generation coverage would be identified based on issues pertinent to federal, state, and local requirements for the data.    Total Current Investment in Theme:    Approximately over $5,000,000.00 has been spent to date for DOQ coverage for the state.  This total also represents DOQs currently in production except for those noted in the ‘Estimate of Current Allocation of Funding / Resources for This Theme’ paragraph of this section.       Contributions by Sector:     Contributions have been from both the state and federal sectors.  In addition the Interior Geographic Data Committee (IGDC) Base Mapping Working Group has allocated funding through the Department of Interior (DOI) High Priority Program for DOQs in the state.        Estimate of Investments Needed to Complete This Theme:     Estimated cost for second-generation coverage for the priority areas described above is $803,200.00.  This estimate is based on the current cost of $800.00 to produce one 1:12,000-scale, 3.75-minute DOQ for the 1,004 quarter quads in the priority areas.  This number of quarter quads is based on the amount of total second-generation quads; for either urban growth areas or replacement of DOQs produced with older NAPP aerial photography required in the counties in which the priority areas fall.     The intent is to create new DOQs on a ten year cycle.  There are approximately 1540 quads covering the State.  The total cost for quarter quad creation will be $4,928,000 over each ten year interval.    Estimate of Current Allocation of Funding / Resources for This Theme:     The FS is currently funding and producing DOQs for the following projects:  Dixie National Forest, 280 (264 are second-generation); Sawtooth National Forest (Utah), 36; and the Humboldt Desert Range Experiment Station, 32.  The IGDC Base Mapping Working Group through the DOI High Priority Program has allocated funding for 369 DOQs this fiscal year.  To complete the remaining 184 DOQs for once-over coverage in the state, the USGS, BLM, and the State of Utah recently signed an agreement for $148,630.00.      Describe Ways to Fund This Gap:     Funding for the second-generation orthoimagery would come from cost share partnerships between the state and federal governmental agencies with interests in the area for the production of orthoimagery.  Coordination for these efforts would be through the state’s Geographic Information System Advisory Council (GISAC), which has the leadership and authority for this effort.         Most Appropriate Data Steward:     The primary archive and distribution point for orthoimagery data produced by the USGS is located at the EROS Data Center (EDC) in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.  The general public can order orthoimagery data from this database.      The State Geographic Information Database (SGID) is an established digital database in the State of Utah.    Maintenance Process and Cost:     Not known at this time.     Section 7.   Elevation     Theme Description:     The FGDC ""Framework Introduction and Guide"" explains ""elevation as data to provide information about terrain.  Elevation refers to a spatially referenced vertical position above or below a datum surface.  The framework includes the elevations of land surfaces and the depths below water surfaces (bathymetry).""  Elevation data can be used as a representation of the terrain, such as a contour map, post elevations or a three-dimensional perspective.  The data can also be used to build models to perform applications ranging from line-of-sight calculations, to transportation planning, and watershed management.  Elevation data is often combined with other digital data themes for modeling and mapping applications.      There are many ways to represent elevation data sets and/or models.  The standard product that the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) produces and uses is represented as a digital elevation model (DEM) collected in 10- or 30-meter grid spacing with coverage in 7.5- x 7.5-minute blocks.  Each coverage provides the same coverage as a standard USGS 7.5-minute quadrangle without overedge.  Additionally seamless and multiresolution digital elevation data sets are now becoming available through the USGS.     Data Sources:     Primary sources for DEMs are the USGS and the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service (FS).    LIght Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar   (IFSAR) are currently being researched and utilized as new technologies to produce digital elevation data sets.    Status:     As of March 15, 2001 state coverage for 30-meter DEMs is 100% and 57% for 10-meter DEMs (Section 7, Maps 1).       Standards:     Standards for DEMs are described in the USGS ‘National Mapping Program Technical Instructions Standards for Digital Elevation Models,’ dated January 1998.    Priority:     Priority for 10-meter DEMs is completion of once-over state coverage.  Specific priority areas would be the urban corridor along the Wasatch Front from the central part of the state (city of Nephi) north through the Provo-Orem city area, Salt Lake Valley, Ogden, to Cache Valley and also areas including the cities of Tooele, Park City, and Heber.  All these regions represent unprecedented metropolitan growth during the past decade and this data set would contribute to the urban planning and growth, transportation planning, and watershed management in these areas.      Total Current Investment in Theme:    Approximately $1,307,000.00 has been spent to date for both 30- and 10-meter DEM coverage.  Estimate based on $772,000.00 for 100% completion for 30-meter DEM and $535,000.00 for 57% completion of 10-meter coverage for the state.       Contributions by Sector:     Contributions have been from both the state and federal sectors.       Estimate of Investments Needed to Complete This Theme:     Estimated cost to complete once-over state coverage for 10-meter DEMs is $460,230.00.  Estimate based on the current cost of $690 to produce one 10-meter DEM for the remaining 667 7.5-minute quadrangles in the state.     Estimate of Current Allocation of Funding / Resources for This Theme:       As of March 15, 2001 there are 76 10-meter DEMs in production.       Describe Ways to Fund This Gap:     Funding for the priority areas in the state would come from governmental, business, private organizations, and single entities organizing a consortium to cost share for the production of 10-meter DEMs after identifying and reaching a consensus for elevation coverage in a specific area.  Coordination for this effort would be through the state’s Geographic Information System Advisory Council (GISAC), which has the leadership and authority for this effort.  GISAC membership is composed of representatives from a broad spectrum of governmental and business organizations.    Most Appropriate Data Steward:     The primary archive and distribution point for elevation data produced by the USGS is located at the EROS Data Center (EDC) in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.  The general public can order elevation data from this database.      The State Geographic Information Database (SGID) is an established digital database in the state of Utah that also archives elevation data.    Maintenance Process and Cost:     Not known at this time.            Section 8.    Transportation     Theme Description:     The transportation layers often include many features of transportation networks and facilities.  For the purpose of this initial plan, only roads are included.  For transportation issues related to growth, economic development, disaster preparedness, emergency response (especially wildfires) and public land management,  all  roads must be included in the transportation framework.    There are multiple versions of roads data maintained in Utah. One is a comprehensive GIS version that is a collaboration of state, federal, and local government agencies which complies to the Utah Transportation Data Model (Appendix 4).  Another is a derivative of that, maintained by the Utah Department of Transportations that is used for network analysis of state and federal routes, and which carries some additional attributes.  AGRC currently maintains a version of 1:24,000 scale roads derived from USGS Digital Line Graph (DLG) and Forest Service Cartographic Feature File (CFF) data, which will be replaced by the collaborative version described above.  There is also the transportation data available from U. S. Census Bureau Tiger Files, which currently supplies the best version of address data for the state.    Data Sources:     There are many sources for this data.  The State of Utah, U. S. Geological Survey, Forest Service, and the Bureau of Land Management have cooperated over the last several years to complete the initial digitizing of roads from the 1:24,000 map sheets.  This data, which has a nominal positional accuracy of 20 meters, meets the traditional needs of many state and federal agencies.  Because many of these maps were 20 – 50 years old, a revision process has started to bring them up to date.  Revising those old maps from DOQs and other photographic sources, has been necessary to make them more accurate, complete, and current.    State policy for GIS implementation has recognized that users close to the geographic features usually have first hand knowledge of the data and can provide more accurate and timely data.  Many rural counties have not had the resources to fully participate and provide accurate credible data to this effort without assistance however.  To that end, the State Legislature has provided funding for the counties to purchase GIS and GPS equipment and begin a process to inventory and map every road in the county.  For a variety of county responsibilities, sub meter GPS generated roads centerline data is required.  This data, which incorporates the Utah Transportation Data Model, will contribute to the State Geographic Information Database (SGID) and the NSDI.  Even though state and federal agencies traditionally relied on the 1:24,000 data described above, this sub-meter fully attributed data will provide much more useful information for them.  From the start, this process has adhered to the Framework principles initially defined by the FGDC.  The most important concept being the use of the best available data for the NSDI.   The State is also working with the Utah Association of Counties and the Census Bureau to identify and integrate address information tied to transportation systems.  The Utah Association of Counties has been instrumental in engaging the counties in a discussion about rural addressing standards relative to transportation.  The Census Bureau has talked to state and local agencies about options for improvement and modernization of information about transportation features in TIGER.    Status:     Three maps are included to illustrate the status of the transportation mapping efforts described above.  The first status map included in this section (Section 8, Map 1) indicates the vintage of the digital data currently.  It is easy to tell from that status map which ones have been revised in the last few years and which ones are 10, 20 or 30 or more years old.  Another status map (Section 8, Map 2) indicates the completion percentage of the roads each county has GPSed.   The third map (Section 8, Map 3) identifies agency responsibility or current mapping activities by funding participants.    Standards:     Separate standards are being used for the different versions of this data theme.  For the 1:24,000 digitizing and revision effort, the collaborators are compliant with the Federal Single Edition Program.  This program is a national effort where the Forest Service has accepted responsibility for completion of Quads containing any Forest Service lands and the USGS has accepted responsibility for the rest.  AGRC has processed these data into a consistent layer for the state.  This version has many limitations for state and local uses because the attributes reflect cartographic symbols only and does not lend itself to analysis from jurisdiction, functional class, surface types, width, use restrictions, etc.  The USGS has developed a standard for their Digital Line Graph (DLG) product that is the primary guidance for this layer although the Forest Service Cartographic Feature File (CFF) standard is used by AGRC for accuracy in the conversion process.    For the county based work and to develop a comprehensive framework transportation data layer, the Utah Transportation Data Model has been developed.  It is the result of a multi-jurisdiction effort to compare the basic transportation data needs of most federal, state, and local agencies transportation data needs in Utah.  The full data model is included in Appendix 4.  This standard has now been implemented by most counties and is the model for transportation data in the SGID.  As it gets more widespread use and tested in different environments, it is anticipated that minor modifications will be made.    The State, the counties, and Census must continue to work with the Postal Service and other interested parties to incorporate existing address standards and develop those still needed especially those relating to rural addressing systems.        Priority:     The transportation data layer has been one of the highest priority data layers in the state for several years and will be for several more until the first comprehensive framework version is complete.  Development of many other data layers and most applications in the state are dependent on the completion of this layer.    Total Current Investment in Theme:     Starting in 1995, this collaborative effort has consumed many of the State’s resources dedicated to GIS.  Since the first Innovative Partnership Agreement signed between the State of Utah and the USGS in 1995, the State has spent approximately $1,500,000.  During that period, the Forest Service and USGS may have spent even more than that.  The State and USGS have collaboratively outsourced the revision of 337 quads, while the Forest Service has completed 218 quads to date.  Additionally, in recent months, those two federal agencies revised 70 1:24,000 quads for the 2002 Olympics at a considerable cost although they made the decision not to update the DLG data.  917 1:24,000 quads remain to be revised using current photography and other local sources.    For the GPS effort by the counties, the State of Utah has appropriated $950,000 for financial assistance directly to the counties.  The U. S. Congress has appropriated another $900,000 for that effort.  Typically the rural counties spend 3 dollars for every one they receive through these grants.  The urban counties have done much of this entirely on their own.  The State of Utah has also spent nearly $500,000 for training, technical assistance, quality control, and database administration for this project so far.  The total to date for this GPS/GIS effort is well over five million dollars.    Contributions by Sector:     See above.    Estimate of Investments Needed to Complete This Theme:     The State and federal agencies are reliant on the high quality GPS data coming in from the counties to contribute to the ongoing revision effort.  The revision activity described earlier will become more of a QA/QC process to check for accurateness and completeness of the coordinate information and all attribute information.  To that end, we want to expedite the completion of the GPSing of road centerlines and fieldwork necessary for attribute definition.  Currently, nearly 50% percent of the roads have been GPSed, nearly 25% have been attributed, and about 10% have been QA/QCed.  To complete this process another $5,000,000 ($100/per mile X 50,000 miles remaining) is needed.    From that complete comprehensive framework database, the DLGs can be updated at a total cost of $320,950 (917 quads X $350 per quad).  Also, UDOT will be able to finalize the State transportation network for state and federal routes for another $50,000.    Both the executive and legislative branches of Utah State government have demonstrated their commitment to this effort by prioritizing funding efforts.  All twenty nine counties in Utah are committed to GPSing their roads and contributing the data to the SGID.  Most federal agencies are committed to participating to the extent that their budgets allow.    Estimate of Current Allocation of Funding / Resources for This Theme:     We anticipate future allocations by State, federal, and local agencies to continue at about $2,000,000 per year.  Because of the extreme value and urgent nature of this data layer, additional dollars available through federal agencies is necessary.    Describe Ways to Fund This Gap:     The most important and practical way to fund this gap would be to have a federal agency take responsibility for the creation of a national transportation framework data layer!  The USGS, Forest Service, and the BLM have been able to contribute some money, but not much and usually with constraints that make if less efficient that could be.  So far, the State of Utah and the counties have contributed the largest percentage of funds to this data layer, but the federal government is one of the primary beneficiaries.  Because of that, the federal government should allocate more to agencies that can be distributed to local government.    Most Appropriate Data Steward:     After many years of meetings in Utah about transportation data, we feel we have arrived on an optimum model for data creation, maintenance, and distribution.  Our intention is to have local government create data as they are most familiar with what is on the ground.  AGRC will integrate this locally generated data and do the quality control necessary to insure accuracy and completeness.  State and federal agencies will then have access to it to use in their products.  An example of this is the Forest Service is currently using data from the counties in conjunction with their revision of the maps on the Fish Lake National Forest with AGRC doing the QA/QC.  All current data will be catalogued, documented, and distributed through the SGID as outlined in the Data Sharing MOU (Appendix 1).    Census must continue to update and maintain address ranges for their products but the primary custodian of this data should be local government.  Since there is currently no federal agency that has overall responsibility for all roads features, it makes sense that the Census Bureau be given that responsibility through the revised OMB Circular A-16.        Maintenance Process and Cost:     Maintenance, including periodic revisions, will continue through the stewards and process defined above.  Costs will be minimal and just part of agencies ongoing operational activities.     Section 9.   Hydrography     Section 9A.   National Hydrography Dataset     Theme Description:     The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a comprehensive set of digital spatial data that contains information about surface water features such as lakes, ponds, streams, rivers, springs, and wells.  Within the NHD, surface water features are combined to form ""reaches"" which provides the framework for linking water-related data to the NHD surface water drainage network.  These linkages enable the analysis and display of these water-related data in upstream and downstream order.     High Resolution NHD (1:24,000-scale) is a combination of the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Reach File Version 3.0 (RF3) and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Digital Line Graph (DLG) hydrography files:  hydrologic ordering, hydrologic navigation for modeling applications, and a unique identifier (reach code) for surface water features from RF3; and the spatial accuracy and comprehensiveness of DLG hydrography.          The NHD is designed to provide comprehensive coverage of hydrologic data for the United States.  It is based on 1:100,000-scale data (called low resolution) and designed to incorporate – and encourage the development of higher resolution data that may be required by users.  It will also facilitate the improved integration of hydrologically related data in support of the application requirements of a growing national user community and will enable shared maintenance and enhancement.     Data Sources:     Primary sources for the reach files are the EPA and the USGS for the DLG hydrography.  The 1:100,000-scale data will also be provided by the USGS.  Cartographic Feature Files (CFFs), 1:24,000-scale vector data produced by the U. S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service (FS) will be utilized for coverage of national forest system lands in Utah.           Status:     The USGS and the State of Utah Automated Geographic Reference Center (AGRC) have signed an Innovative Partnership (IP) agreement for a NHD project in Utah.  Within the framework of this agreement the two agencies formed a partnership with the FS and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to coordinate the revision and updating of existing USGS 1:24,000-scale quadrangle DLG and FS CFFs to the USGS DLG hydrography dataset.  A private Utah firm, REDCON is participating as the primary contractor.      Additionally high-resolution NHD watershed catalog units will be created utilizing 1:100,000-scale data and the revised hydrography data.  To date one high-resolution sub-basin (4 th  level) in Utah has been created and one is currently going through the conflation process.  Another is scheduled this spring to finalize the first phase of the project.  For the project’s second phase, 260 1:24,000-scale DLG hydrography layers will be revised and eight high-resolution NHD sub-basins will be created this year in eastern Utah.       All the revised and updated DLG hydrography data and the high-resolution NHD sub-basins will be incorporated into the NHD.       Standards:     There are two standards for NHD; USGS National Mapping Program Technical Instructions ""Standards for National Hydrography Dataset – High Resolution,"" dated November 1997 and USGS National Mapping Program Technical Instructions ""Standards for National Hydrography Dataset,"" dated July 1999.    Priority:     Priorities are twofold:  completion of the remaining USGS 1:24,000-scale quadrangle DLG and FS CFFs to the USGS DLG hydrography dataset and secondly the high-resolution NHD of the remaining sub-basins watershed catalog units for once-over state coverage of these two data sets. To complete will take approximately five years.

Of the 68 sub-basins that encompass Utah 38 fall over the state’s border.  DLG data in these sub-basins will have to be revised and the sub-basin high resolution NHD created.  Below is a list of the six states surrounding Utah and the number of quads and sub-basins in each respective state.  It will be necessary to enter into cost share partnerships with these states to revise and complete the sub-basin high-resolution NHD in the states.

Coordination for these efforts would be through the state’s Geographic Information System Advisory Council (GISAC), which has the leadership and authority for this effort.         Most Appropriate Data Steward:     The State Geographic Information Database (SGID) is an established digital database in the State of Utah.     Maintenance Process and Cost:     Not known at this time.     Section 9B.     Hydrologic Sub-basin Boundaries     Theme Description:     The Sub-basin is the fourth level (8-digit) of the hydrologic unit hierarchy.  Sub-basins, which are sub-divisions of Basins, were formerly named ‘cataloging units.’  The average size for a typical sub-basin is 450,000 acres.  They are subdivided into watersheds (usually 5-15 per sub-basin), which are further subdivided into sub-watersheds (usually 5-15 per watershed).  Sub-basin and the interior watershed and sub-watershed boundaries are based primarily on natural surface water flow and topographic landforms.  Sixty-eight (68) sub-basins encompass Utah and the surrounding states.    The digital data sets containing consistent and accurate attributes (including metadata information) derived from the delineation of the boundaries for the sub-basins, watersheds, and sub-watersheds will be added to both the national and state Geographic Information Systems (GIS) databases.  This information will be used to better manage all the federal, state, and private lands in Utah.  Additionally these databases will provide a basis for regional assessments of Utah’s water resources for the foreseeable future.       Data Sources:     The U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service (FS) and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) – the two primary land management agencies of federal lands in the U.S. – are currently allocating funding for the digitizing and delineation of sub-basin boundaries on federal and state lands in Utah.       Status:     Present watershed delineation has been done to the 4 th  level sub-basin unit at the 1:250,000-meter scale.  However this is often too large an area to use for resolution in ecological studies on the potential impacts to plant and animal life that for example are dependent on a single spring, wetland, or stand of oak for their existence.  The need for a finer resolution at the 4 th  level is therefore required – hence the need for delineation of the interior boundaries; watershed (5 th  level) and sub-watershed (6 th  level).         Standards:     Draft ""Federal Standards For Delineation Of Hydrologic Unit Boundaries,"" dated December 18, 2000.     Priority:     To delineate and attribute sub-basin, watershed, and sub-watershed boundaries for all the sub-basins that encompasses Utah and the surrounding states.  This delineation will be done in a consistent, reproducible method that meets national standards and is accepted by all governmental agencies, public land users, and any other potential data users in Utah or the surrounding states.    Total Current Investment in Theme:     Approximately $102,000.00 has been spent to date for 30 sub-basin boundary delineations.    Contributions by Sector:     The following agencies have contributed to the initial boundary delineation in the state:  BLM, FS, and the USGS Water Resources Discipline (WRD).    Estimate of Investments Needed to Complete This Theme:     An estimated $129,200.00 is required to complete delineation for the remaining 38 sub-basin boundaries encompassing Utah and the surrounding states.  Based on the current estimated cost of $3,400.00 for each sub-basin boundary delineation.  This estimated cost also includes the delineation for the interior watershed and sub-watershed boundaries.       Estimate of Current Allocation of Funding / Resources for This Theme :     Besides the USGS WRD the following two federal agencies have allocated funding for the following initial boundary delineations:      BLM – 20 sub-basins         FS – 10 sub-basins     Describe Ways to Fund This Gap:     Funding for once-over state coverage would come from cost share partnerships between the state and governmental agencies with interests in the area for the boundary delineation.  Coordination for these efforts would be through the state’s Geographic Information System Advisory Council (GISAC), which has the leadership and authority for this effort .            Most Appropriate Data Steward:     The State Geographic Information Database (SGID) is an established digital database in the state of Utah.     Maintenance Process and Cost:     Not known at this time.                Section 10.     Boundaries     Theme Description:     Boundaries are maintained in a series of layers representing the geographic extent of areas that define jurisdiction, taxation units or administrative management responsibilities.    Data Sources:     There are multiple sources for boundary related data in Utah.  The primary sources are listed here with more details of current data availability in the status section.       Census Bureau   Bureau of Land Management   US Forest Service   Counties   State Tax Commission     Status:    A sub-committee on boundaries was formed to identify the needs and directions for this theme.  A disparate group of local and federal agencies collect and store various boundary information in Utah.  Many of these data are currently incompatible in both a technical and a logistical sense.  Issues such as who collects the data and how often, and who should store the data still must be resolved.  In an effort to identify relevant boundaries, the accompanying table matrix identifies all known boundary types critical to any organization that functions or has interests in the state of Utah.   See the accompanying table.     Total Current Investment in Theme:    Undetermined at this time.     Contributions by Sector:    See table.    Estimate of Investments Needed to Complete This Theme:    Undetermined at this time.        Estimate of Current Allocation of Funding / Resources for This Theme:     While we do not have a specific dollar amount, many agencies listed on the accompanying table currently have adequate or nearly adequate funding.    Describe Ways to Fund This Gap:     This issue has not been resolved.    Most Appropriate Data Steward:     See accompanying table.    Maintenance Process and Cost:     In general, each responsible agency would continue to collect and process the appropriate boundary data on the schedule that best fits each boundary type.  Once issues such as meta-data and NSDI compliance on accuracy and content are established, we will be able to define a model for data exchange as well as a maintenance process.             Boundary Type     Datasource    Name     Status    E/P/NP     Data   Steward     Meets    NSDI     Update    Cycle     Meta Data     Currently    Funded     Total Annual Cost   Across State     Contributing   Agencies     Completion    Estimate               Exists,   Planned,   Not P         (Y/N/P)     Date or schedule     (Y/N)     (Y/N)     Current Estimates in $$         Cost to Complete in $$       Legal or Political                                               State           E      ??

Cadastral Data     The format of this theme varies somewhat from the other themes in this Plan.  The Bureau of Land Management has an activity underway to develop plans for cadastral data by state and for the nation.  The format for this section conforms to the BLM requirements which are not currently consistent with the I-Team requirements.    This section has been completed in two parts.  Part A covers the Public Land Survey System and Part B covers administrative ownership as currently implemented in Utah.  We anticipate the addition of  Part C for subsurface ownership in the next revision.     Section 11-A.   Cadastral Data (Public Land Survey System)     Theme Description and Priority     The Public Land Survey System (PLSS) is a rectangular survey system that typically divides the land into 6-mile square townships, which are further subdivided into 1-mile square sections. The extension of the rectangular system of surveys over the public domain has been in progress since 1785. The PLSS is the primary survey and legal description system for defining the boundaries of the parcels of public lands, and forms the basis of patents issued when public lands pass out of Federal ownership. The legal descriptions for most of the western United States originate from the PLSS. Because the PLSS is the basis for all public and private land entitlement in the West, it is a critical component of the cadastral (land ownership) layer, one of 18 primary ""framework"" themes identified by the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) for implementation of the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI). The PLSS provides the spatial reference system for land ownership and title information.     Government organizations and private industry use the PLSS to portray parcel boundary and land record information in day-to-day business processes involving land transactions and entitlement; and as a foundation theme in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to support analysis, planning, and decision making on complex land and resource issues. Many different representations of the PLSS exist that vary significantly in both content and accuracy, resulting in conflicting sources of information. The increasing use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in both the public and private sectors, and greater necessity for collaboration, identifies the need for a common, integrated cadastral infrastructure to facilitate decision-making at all levels.         Background and Purpose:          In the early 1990s, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) began collecting the Geographic Coordinate Data Base (GCDB), The GCDB is a digital representation of the PLSS that provides geographic positions to tie land ownership (cadastral) and other themes to the earth’s surface. GCDB integrates survey records, horizontal control, and land descriptions to portray the legal land parcels described by the PLSS. GCDB is the preferred data source to portray parcel boundary and land record information in both public and private sectors. Unlike other PLSS representations, the GCDB depicts the PLSS to the public land parcel level, and can be readily updated with newer, more accurate information to increase its positional reliability. GCDB provides a more accurate PLSS land grid for parcel mapping at the local level.   The Western Governors Association (WGA) recognizes the GCDB as the "" best hope of standardizing the PLSS in the Western States "", and strongly endorses its use and continued enhancement. In June, 2000, WGA adopted  WGA Policy Resolution 00-005, Public Lands Survey System and Ownership Database , and recommended that a unified plan for GCDB implementation across the West be developed in coordination with federal, state, tribal and local governments. The WGA planning effort is parallel with the Office of Management and Budget’s (OMB) Information Initiative to align the needs and resources to continue development of NSDI framework implementation through mutually beneficial partnerships.    The State of Utah Cadastral Plan is a comprehensive, statewide plan developed through the collaborative efforts of federal, state, local and tribal governments to implement the recommendations of WGA Policy Resolution 00-005 The State of Utah, Automated Geographic Reference Center (AGRC), and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), will lead coordination efforts to develop and implement the plan The purpose of the plan is to identify and communicate to management, and other stakeholders, the commitments and schedules to collect, integrate, maintain and distribute digital cadastral data that will provide accurate, cost effective parcel-based land information statewide. This plan will be incorporated into the OMB Utah Framework Implementation Plan for the cadastral framework layer.     General Status of Data and Sources     There are multiple sources for PLSS data in Utah, including U.S. Geological Survey and U.S. Forest Service (USFS) landnet derived from 1:24,000 scale cartographic products, AGRC Public Land Survey System (RSPLS), and survey records and control data from a range of public and private contributors. This plan primarily addresses the Bureau of Land Management’s Geographic Coordinate Data Base (GCDB), and its collection, integration and enhancement with more current survey information from other public sources.        BLM, GCDB, Survey Records, PLSS GPS-coordinates, land ownership attribute information      The Utah State Office, collects and maintains the Geographic Coordinate Data Base (GCDB) from survey records, horizontal control, and land descriptions. BLM collects the GCDB data on a township basis. The survey boundaries are delineated by computing the geographic positions of township, section, aliquot part, government lot, and special survey corners from record survey plats. Next, official land descriptions are assigned to each land unit in the grid.  The data is then standardized and converted to Arc Info coverages so Geographic Information System (GIS) software can be used to view the PLSS information spatially. The data can be readily updated with new survey and control data.    Of the total 2,566 townships in Utah, GCDB is 90% collected in its native text format, and is currently being standardized and converted to a Geographic Information System (GIS) coverage format. Approximately ??% of the townships need topology and polygon label clean up to create a clean GIS coverage. Townships not collected include extremely complex townships, or townships along the Wasatch Front ""urban corridor"" where counties will have more current data.   The GCDB currently contains only General Land Office (GLO) and BLM survey record data to 1991, with a growing backlog of survey and Global Positioning System (GPS) control data for update of the GCDB. The BLM has not incorporated survey or control data from external sources. The largest sources of external data reside with the Forest Service and local counties, and must be incorporated into the GCDB to improve its currency and accuracy.        USFS,  Survey Records, PLSS GPS-coordinates, land ownership attribute information        The Utah Forests within USFS Region-4 include the Wasatch-Cache, Uinta, Ashley, Dixie, Manti LaSal, Fishlake and a small portion of the Sawtooth. The USFS maintains an active land line location program, dating to at least the early 1970s, which includes corner recovery and retracement, corner restoration, section subdivision and GPS data. There are numerous survey plats and control information that need to be incorporated into the GCDB. One issue with earlier USFS survey plats is that a local coordinate system was used and there is no geodetic tie. Additional fieldwork will be needed in some areas to collect this information before it can be integrated into the GCDB.          Counties,   Survey Records, PLSS GPS-coordinates, land ownership attribute information        The Counties of Utah each maintain extensive survey records dating back many year, providing a comprehensive history of survey activities and ownership patterns.  As the counties obtain more equipment, trained personnel, and funding, their ability to provide survey-grade GPS coordinates increases.  These coordinates, as well as information on land ownership and transfer, form a basis for data that can contribute to the GCDB and Cadastral data layer as well as flesh-out ownership attributes.        Approach        Strategy:      The State of Utah Cadastral Plan describes the overall status and implementation strategy to collect, integrate, and distribute the most accurate, complete and current cadastral data available through the coordinated efforts of the various levels of government statewide. The plan will address technical issues, policy issues, and resource issues, including data content, data sources, funding and resources, as well as spatial accuracy development. The basic strategy is to: 1) inventory, catalog and evaluate existing data; 2) define standards and business rules for cadastral data functions that will facilitate data collection, integration and exchange; 3) create a central clearinghouse at the State level; and 4) develop a systemized program for prioritized data collection and maintenance on a funded project basis, as well as on an ongoing basis as part of the daily businesses processes of various agencies’ internal cadastral activities.     The plan will consist of detailed area plans for each of the 29 counties in Utah, with the option to combine counties to address larger geographic areas, if needed. Detailed plans will summarize the workload, resources, and time frames to collect, integrate, maintain, and distribute cadastral data in each county through the coordinated efforts of federal, state, local and tribal governments. Maps, tables and a township level data base will be developed to show inventory. status and progress. The State of Utah, Automated Geographic Reference Center (AGRC), will lead these collaborative-based planning projects.    Detailed pilot plans will be done first for selected priority areas, with updates and additional plans on an annual basis. Pilot plans will enable refinement of standards, procedures, workload estimates, task completion time frames, and cost estimates, and allow for phased planning and implementation, as funding allows.               Standards and Approach to Standards Implementation:            Standards provide the function of ""normalizing"" data and support the automation, exchange, and integration of publicly available data from multiple sources.       FGDC Cadastral Data Content Standard           FGDC Cadastral Framework Standard (Pending)   State of Utah, Canyon Country Partnership, G5 GIS council Standard           Canyon Country Partnership Cadastral Share Codes                                       http://agrc.utah.gov/standards/cadcode.html                                       BLM, GCDB Coverage Format               Establishing Priorities:     Priorities for the development of cadastral data content, in addition to and/or separate from cadastral data accuracy, may vary substantially from agency to agency. Local governments are at varying stages in There is an immediate need to integrate all existing ""best available information"" within a uniform system, while simultaneously developing increased spatial and content accuracy of the data over time. Meeting both of these needs is critical to maintaining the long term support and participation necessary to create an ongoing statewide cadastral system. Priorities will be identified based on the needs of federal, state, local, and tribal organizations with sensitivity to the different missions, goals, resources and schedules of these organizations The process for establishing priorities will take place in conjunction with the other players in this project. A number of factors will be considered in setting priorities for cadastral data development and integration.         Mutually Important Areas                      Participant priorities driving prioritization:         Federal priority areas      State priority areas      Local priority areas      Other priority areas      Issues driving prioritization:         Land use issues      Data need issues      Planning issues      Other issues…                          Overlap of Participant Priorities and Driving Issues          B. Willingness of priority stakeholder(s) to contribute to process          Data availability   Conformance to standards   Required metadata documentation                    Data Requirements and Stakeholders:     The entities with great concern for the development and maintenance of this data layer constitute the stakeholders in this process.  Their concerns and interests will be enumerated as in along with their data requirements, to provide a comprehensive overview of how this plan’s data development will interact with the expectations and needs of the stakeholders.    Detailed Project Plans:     A detailed area project plan will be developed for each of the 29 counties in Utah. Uintah, Duchesne and Emery counties have been identified as pilot project areas for initial plan development and implementation based on statewide priorities, and to represent a cross-section of Utah’s counties.

Inventory and evaluation of existing data sets     The product for this task I s a basic inventory of existing data for each county.  Inventory consists of a presence/absence condition of the data in each township.  Evaluation represents a more in-depth study of the data.  Data may exist in several broad categories that need to be qualified by ""condition"".  The idea of ""preliminary"" may imply data that is more than acceptable for one type of use, while for another type of use, it could be wholly inadequate.  In general, this ""condition"" can be defined by the needs of the data producer.  Thus, if the producer of the data finds its current condition to be inadequate for their needs, then that data might be considered to be inadequate (even though another user of that data may find it acceptable). The product for this task is to identify areas of existing and missing PLSS/GCDB data and parcel data, and to document the content of information where it exists including PLSS corners (surveys and subdivisions), parcels (fee and non-fee), control, coincident boundaries, source, and method used to capture data.  Data from various contributors will be inventoried and evaluated for specific data requirements (content and accuracy) identify areas where existing PLSS/GCDB data needs to be improved.  Evaluate reliability, topological validity, content of data determine what is needed to improve data (e.g., corner recovery and GPS, regional adjustment, additional data collection etc.) identify areas where data from multiple sources should be integrated.  Produces an electronic database for cadastral data by township that will reflect the status of each township and serve as a tracking mechanism.          Collection of PLSS/GCDB (Initial Collection)          The product for this task is a collected GCDB where it currently does not exist. Work includes computing initial township coordinates and subdivisions from survey and control records, and attributing township polygons with legal land description records to create the township ""template"".     Produces GCDB source data in text format (line work and polygon labels) that can be standardized and converted to a GIS coverage. The source data can be readily updated with new survey and control data.        Improvement of GCDB/PLSS (Build GIS Coverage)        The product from this task is a GCDB Arc Info coverage where GCDB is collected, but has been determined to need improvement. Work includes: standardizing and converting GCDB source data to an Arc Info coverage; improving GCDB source or coverage data to correct or improve topology, polygon labels, attribution; adding minor subdivisions or special surveys; adding metadata; migrating to standards; converting PCCS data to GMM or NILS.   Produces a standardized, seamless, GCDB ArcInfo coverage that is acceptable for use across government organizations for GIS and parcel mapping applications.         Integration and Reconciliation of GCDB/PLSS Data Sources (O&M)        The product from this task is a GCDB coverage that is integrated and updated with the most current and accurate survey and control data available from various identifiable sources. Work includes corner recovery, ground-truthing, collecting field measurements, analyzing and reconciling survey and control data from various sources to resolve data differences, and the incorporation and adjustment of new data into the GCDB solution to update GCDB source and coverage data.    Produces a GCDB Arc Info coverage that utilizes the most accurate, complete, and current data available from various levels of government that can be used as a common PLSS framework across government organizations.             Collection and Integration of Parcel Data     The product for this task will be adding and integrating parcel level data with GCDB. Parcel descriptions will be analyzed for parcel-ID/ownership attribution of GCDB legal land area/aliquot part separate from detailed digital parcel mapping.  Produces a logically integrated parcel fabric that can be used to portray cadastral information consistently across organizational and political boundaries.                   Maintenance:        Maintenance will require coordination between data producers, stewards and stakeholders and will require the development and administration of standards and protocols that ensure successful, efficient, data integration.  Maintenance will require a set of standards and procedures to ensure consistency.  Factors influencing maintenance include priorities, schedules, budgets, update cycles, availability.     Requirements     Strategy:       Create a control data base.    6.3  Identify procedures     Procedures will be jointly developed by the stakeholders to preserve national and local standards, as well as ensure that user needs are being met at each procedural step.    6.4  Identify roles and responsibilities     Coordination of data development and sharing activities should continue as a state-led activity. ""Framework"" layers or critical data will require funded creation. Integration of differing data among themes should remain a centralized function. Data should be created and maintained by specific agencies that have a programmatic need or mandated responsibility   Local government roles and responsibilities for maintenance will vary by county depending on resources, in-house capability (surveyor)   Users most familiar with the geographic features can provide more accurate and current data, and will be encouraged to create and share data.            Data Producer, Data Provider, Data User, Data Integrator Data Steward     State of Utah, AGRC- central clearinghouse, data integrator (PLSS to other related themes)    BLM- GCDB Data Steward, Training to surveyors and technicians for data collection and processing for the integration of survey data into the GCDB         Funding for a Cadastral Data Infrastructure:       Estimate of the Total Investment in This Theme to Date:          Total investment in this theme will be estimated and provided in this sub-section.

Cadastral Data (Administrative Ownership)     Theme Description:     The strategic goal for this data layer is for the respective data steward agencies to jointly  manage a single statewide integrated data set for surface land status and subsurface mineral status information.  A series of intermediate goals and objectives to define processes and procedures to achieve the long term solution will be necessary.  The Utah Cadastral Data Committee will be the forum used to define and implement the data development plan for this data set.    Surface ownership depicts general categories of surface land ownership. (eg. Federal land owners, State government entities, private).  Polygon data for ownership is currently collected and maintained by a variety of organizations which are primarily government.  The current administrative land and ownership dataset depicts the Bureau of Land Management 1:100,000 scale land ownership quadrangle maps published by the BLM along with some modifications described below in the status section.     Data Sources:     The Public Land Survey System landnet (townships, sections, lots, aliquot parts) provides a base for the ownership layer. Currently a variety of landnet versions are employed (GDCB, CFF, 24k DLG, 100k DLG, 500k DLG).  Government land records from a variety of sources provide the information regarding the surface ownership (eg. Bureau of Land Management = s Case Recordation Files and Master Title Plats; State of Utah Land Records and Master Title Plats, County Recorder Plats, USFS land records).    There are multiple sources for the administrative land and ownership data in Utah.    Utah School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration (SITLA) - revises and updates the data regularly to reflect changes to State Trust Lands through exchanges, swaps, and acquisitions.   The other primary sources for the data are listed below.      Bureau of Land Management   US Forest Service   Private   National Park Service   State Park and Recreation   US Fish and Wildlife Service   Native American Tribes        Status:     Currently many government offices collect and maintain this information.  There is no one standard used by all agencies for this data layer. Therefore, there are numerous versions of the data set at various scales.  A statewide dataset currently exists at 1:100,000 scale, however some agencies maintain 1:24,000 scale data in regional offices for their respective areas.  The content of these various datasets has not been rectified and these datasets currently do not agree in content.     Currently, responsibilities are as follows:      -Get exchanges, swaps, and especially new acquisitions to SITLA to update ownership   -AGRC will replace current theme available through the State Geographic Information Database (SGID) ftp://ftp.agrc.state.ut.us/state_wide/aolsa.e00 with quarterly updated theme from SITLA.    -Any major changes between quarterly updates should be notified to the AGRC.       -Intent to integrate with the GCDB for further accuracy.    Standards:       There have been some past efforts to develop a common standard for this data layer. The Canyon Country Partnership Data Group includes representatives from counties, state, federal entities.  It has drafted up standard  A share codes @  for this data layer.  Aside from that, each entity which collects and maintains this data uses its own  A standard @ .    Priority:      The goal of this theme is to develop a single statewide dataset at 1:24,000 scale.  The Bureau of Land Management is beginning Resource Management Planning efforts in portions of the state and this is a critical data layer for those projects.  The work can be accomplished in phases to coincide with the BLM planning projects and the priority areas are eastern and south central portions of the state.  The initial task to be completed is the definition and agreement for common data standard and data structure.  The next steps are to complete the GCDB data for the priority areas and then to integrate the various datasets or the information from the best and most accurate datasets.    Total Current Investment in Theme:     Not available at this time.    Contribution by Sector:     Not available at this time.    Estimate of Investments Needed to Complete this Item:        Complete GCDB landnet   Define a common data standard   Integrate various sources of existing ownership data   Define Review and Update Proces   Estimate of Current Allocation of Funding for this Theme:     Not available at this time.    Describe Ways to Fund this Gap:     Because this is a layer required by multiple federal, state, local, and Tribal entities there must be a way to distribute the costs associated with maintaining this theme.  Each sector of government currently contributes data necessary for this theme.  All state agencies benefit, but currently SITLA is expending resources that would best be covered by a ongoing legislative appropriation. SITLA estimates that it requires one full time employee (FTE) to maintain this theme.    Most Appropriate Data Steward:     SITLA and BLM     Maintenance Process and Cost:     The I-Team must still identify the location for the dataset to reside and establish a process for check-out/check-in and validation.  Currently AGRC maintains the latest version of the Administrative Ownership layer in the SGID. SITLA informs AGRC when a new coverage is available.  AGRC does additional processing that adds two new items that assigns new codes for general ownership categories to the coverage. The final items and categories still need to be determined.      Section 12.   Demographics     Theme Description:       Demography is the study of population, including size, composition, distribution, density, growth, and other characteristics.  The Demographic and Economic Analysis (DEA) section of the Governor = s Office of Planning and Budget (GOPB) manages, analyzes, and disseminates demographic, economic, and fiscal data on the state of Utah.  There are multiple sources for this data, including state and federal entities.    Data Sources:     The demographic data sets housed in GOPB include: state and county population estimates from the Utah Population Estimates Committee (UPEC); decennial census data on population and housing characteristics from the U.S. Census Bureau; state and county population and employment projections from the Utah Process Economic and Demographic Model (UPED), housed in GOPB; city projections produced by GOPB and Utah = s seven Associations of Government (AOGs); state and county total personal income and per capita income from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis; state and county labor force, employment, and unemployment data from the Utah Department of Workforce Services; and state and county residential building permit data from the Bureau of Economic and Business Research at the University of Utah.    Status:             State and county population estimates are produced annually by UPEC and are currently available through the year 2000.  U.S. Census Bureau data, down to the block level, are available from past censuses as well as from Census 2000.  State and county population and employment projections from the UPED model system are available through 2030.  City projections from GOPB and the seven AOGs are available through 2030.  Total personal income and per capita income from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis are available at the state and county levels for the years 1980-1998.  The labor force and employment data from the Utah Department of Workforce Services are available for the years 1980-1999 at the state and county levels.  Data on residential building permits are available for the years 1980-1999 at the state and county levels.    Standards:                FGDC Metadata Standards will be used to document demographic data where applicable.    Priority:             Maintaining the demographic and economic data sets is one of the highest priorities of the DEA section. State and county demographic and economic data profiles are updated periodically to reflect new releases or revisions in a data set.    Total Current Investment in Theme:           Currently, there are three FTEs working full time on this theme at GOPB for an annual cost of approximately $125,000.    Contributions by Sector:     Although there are many other agencies involved in this theme, no dollar amount is available.    Estimate of Investments Needed to Complete This Theme:     Current funding of $125,000 annually is what is required.    Estimate of Current Allocation of Funding/ Resource for this Theme:     $125,000 annually.    Describe Ways to Fund This Gap :         Current appropriation is satisfactory.    Most Appropriate Data Steward:      The Governor’s Office of Planning and Budget, State Data Center.    Maintenance Process and Cost:       Maintenance of the data sets will continue through the Governor = s Office of Planning and Budget as part of DEA = s work plan with current appropriation.                                                                                                                                                                         Section 13.     Wetlands     Theme Description:     The National Wetlands Inventory is data that carries information about the characteristics, extent and status of the Nation’s wetlands and deepwater habitats. The Emergency Wetland Resources Act of 1986 directed the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to map the wetlands of the United States. The act also required the Service to produce a digital wetlands database for the United States.  AGRC has digitized 228 quads for various projects, such as the Quality Growth Efficiency Tools (QGET) project.  These quads are distributed through the SGID. These projects are part of the Governor’s MOU.    The Fish and Wildlife Service is currently involved in projects that use the NWI database.  One of these projects is the calculation of the acreage of isolated wetlands throughout the state.  These isolated wetlands must have an assessment for development.  These isolated wetlands are no longer protected due to a Supreme Court ruling.  This project is essential to the protection of wetlands that are not connected to jurisdictional water rights. The completion of this project depends on the digitizing of the wetlands of Utah. At this time only about 14% of the state is digitized and only 17% is in final hardcopy maps.    Data Sources:     The primary sources of data will come from photo-interpretation of Digital Orthographic quadrangles (DOQs), both STATSGO (general), and SSURGO (detailed) soils data, and vegetation data and Corp of Engineers’ floodplain data.  Fish and Wildlife Services uses all of these data as a basis to identify and delineate categories of wetlands.     Status:           - 126 quads are in the process of photo-interpretation.       - 42 quads need to be digitized from hardcopy maps.        - 1146 quads have been photo-interpreted and need to be developed into draft and then final hardcopy maps, digitized and QC for insertion into the NWI database and the SGID.            - 228 quads need to be QC for certification and insertion into the NWI database.           Standards:     The standards cited from ""Classifications of Wetlands, and Deepwater Habitats of the United State"", 1979, Cowardin, et al.         Priority:     The digitizing and QC of the remaining available hardcopy maps is the first priority.  As new hardcopy maps are available, digitizing and QC of these for distribution through the SGID and NWI database should be the next priority.    Total Current Investment in Theme:         228 quads photo-interpreted, draft and final hardcopy, and digitized       @$2,000 = $456,000          42 quads photo-interpreted, draft and final hardcopy     @$1,500 =   $63,000    1146 quads photo-interpreted      @   $500 = $573,000     Total        $1,092,000         Contributions by Sector:    Fish and Wildlife Service has compiled and is presently photo-interpreting 126 quads.  It has photo-interpreted, delineated, classified 1416 quads.  There are 270 quads in draft and final hardcopies, with 116 digitized quads in the NWI database.  The AGRC has digitized 228 of the hardcopy quads for distribution through the SGID.    Estimate of Investments Needed to Complete This Theme     126 quads, photo-interpretation, draft and hardcopy, digitize, and QC      @ $2,500 a quad =  $315,000           42 quads, digitize and QC final hardcopy maps       @ $1,000 a quad =    $42,000        1146 quads, draft and final hardcopy, digitize and QC,       @ $2000 a quad = $2,292,000           228 quads, QC for distribution through the SGID and NWI database      @   $500 a quad =    $114,000                        Total              $2,763,000          **This project should include an overhead of 8% of total cost of the project.  This overhead would be approximately $230,000, including costs of the Fish and Wildlife Service and the SGID administration .      Estimate of Current Allocation of Funding / Resources for This Theme:     There is currently no funding through the Fish and Wildlife Service for photo-interpretation, draft and hardcopy mapping, and digitizing of the wetlands.  There is currently $5,000 funding from the SGID administrative fund for the QC process of the 228 quads currently in the SGID.    Describe Ways to Fund This Gap:     There is a huge funding gap in the digitizing process of the wetlands.  Part of this funding gap could be corrected through a cooperative agreement between the State of Utah and Fish and Wildlife Service and other agencies that use the NWI database, but additional funding would be necessary to complete the project.           Most Appropriate Data Steward:     The Fish and Wildlife Service is the creator of the data. The SGID is the present steward of the digitized data.  Any digitized data should be distributed through the SGID and submitted to the NWI to be included in the National Database.    Maintenance Process and Cost:    Updates to the NWI and maintenance costs are yet to be determined.     Section 14.     Geology     The geology theme can be broken down into three basic subsections: (1) geologic maps of surface exposures, (2) geologic hazard maps, and (3) geologic resource maps.  Other specialized geology maps, such as gravity anomaly, magnetic, subcrop, alteration, surficial deposits, etc. are not considered basic geology themes and are not considered here, although they may merit inclusion in the future.     Part A. GEOLOGIC MAPS OF SURFACE EXPOSURES       Theme Description:     Geologic maps of surface exposures are the ""standard"" geologic maps that form the basis for most specialized geologic maps and studies of large or small areas.  The Utah Geological Survey (UGS) focuses on three standard scales of geologic maps: 1:500,000 (state map), 1:100,000 (30'x60' quadrangle bases), and 1:24,000 (7.5' quadrangle bases).  Each scale has different uses, and eventually all three should be completed in GIS format.     Data Sources:     (1) The Geologic Map of Utah, by Lehi Hintze, published by the Utah Geological (and Mineral) Survey in 1980, is the 1:500,000 scale geologic map of the state.       (2) 1:100,000 maps are digitized from published maps where available; for much of the state, new field mapping is required to complete maps at this scale (see Map 14-1).  The UGS currently has a team of geologists working in the field to complete this new mapping.    (3) Approximately 400 of the 1,512 quadrangles in the 7.5' (1:24,000 scale) are currently completed as paper maps, though some of these date back to the 1950s and are not suitable for all purposes.  Five to ten new quadrangles are completed each year (see Map 14-2).    Status:     (1) In 1999 the UGS and U.S. Geological Survey jointly funded conversion of the Geologic Map of Utah (1:500,000 scale) to digital, GIS format.  The digital database is complete and has been released.  It can now be incorporated into the SGID.              (2) As of March 20001, seven of the forty-six 30'x60' quadrangle maps at 1:100,000 scale are completed or nearly completed in GIS format by the UGS, and are being prepared for release to the public as of November 2000.  Seven quadrangle maps are published in paper format, but have not been completed in GIS format.  The remaining maps require additional geologic map preparation, and have either not been started or are in progress  (see Map 14-1).  We estimate that at current rates of completion, it will take about 15 years to complete the state at 1:100,000 in printed and GIS format.     (3) The UGS is currently working on about ten 7.5' quadrangles for completion in GIS format.  Another thirty-two quadrangles are completed but there are no current plans to finish them in GIS format.  Another 422 quadrangle maps are published in paper format, but have not been converted into GIS format.  Mapping has not been started on the remaining 1,078 quadrangles.   No other maps are available in GIS format at this scale.  At the current rate, it will take more than a lifetime to complete field mapping of the incomplete quadrangles in the state.  Thus, we concentrate on high priority areas, such as areas of rapid urban growth, high recreational use, geologic resources, or potential geologic hazards.     Standards:     The UGS follows standards set by the National Cooperative Geologic Map Program, which is headed by the U.S. Geological Survey and the Association of American State Geologists, and that works closely with a geologic subcommittee of the FGDC.    Priority:     Mapping priorities are set by the State Mapping Advisory Committee (SMAC), a group of seven representatives from the community of geologic map users.  Representatives are appointed by organizations such as the Utah Geological Association, interested government agencies, and from the community at large.  The SMAC meets once a year to set priorities.  The current top priority is to complete the 1:100,000-scale map series.      Total Current Investment in Theme:     The Utah Geological Survey has spent about $500,000 to prepare GIS files of existing geologic maps.      Contributions by Sector:     The National Park Service, U.S. Forest Service, and Bureau of Land Management have worked on GIS files of geologic maps of areas in which they have an interest.  Some of this work can be incorporated into UGS GIS products.        Estimate of Investments Needed to Complete This Theme:             There are thirty-nine, 1:100,000 scale (30'x60') quadrangle maps that need to be completed.  The seven quadrangles that have already been published in paper format will cost approximately $25,000 per map, for a total of $175,000.  The remaining thirty-two quadrangles will range in cost from $48,000 to $216,000 per map, depending on the amount of field mapping that needs to be done, for a total of $3,120,000.     There are 1,100, 1:24,000 scale (7.5') quadrangle maps that need to be completed. The 422 quadrangles that have already been published in paper format will cost approximately $10,000 per map, for a total of $4,220,000.  The thirty-two quadrangles completed by UGS in all but GIS format will cost approximately $4,000 per map, for a total of $168,000.  The remaining 1,078 quadrangles which have not been started, will cost approximately $59,000 per map, for a total of $63,602,000.     Estimate of Current Allocation of Funding/Resources for This Theme:     The current allocation for completing 1:100,000-scale maps is $100,000/year.  The current allocation for completing 1:24,000-scale maps is $30,000/year.     Describe Ways to Fund this Gap:     Most UGS mapping and GIS compilation is completed as cooperative projects between the UGS and the U.S. Geological Survey through the National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program.  Some funds may also be available through other federal, state, and local government agencies that have an interest in particular parts of the state.       Most Appropriate Data Steward:     UGS must maintain and update data, but AGRC can make the digital data widely available through the SGID.     Maintenance Process and Cost:     An estimated $10,000/year (1/4 FTE) is required to maintain and update existing GIS data.  This cost will increase as maps are added to the database.         Section 14B.     GEOLOGIC HAZARDS     Theme Description:     Geologic hazards include earthquakes, landslides, problem soils, and flooding.  These hazards are important to consider in land-use regulation and urban development, and maps depicting the hazards are used by city and county planners, transportation officials, developers, planning and engineering consultants, and many others involved in land-use planning.   They are also used by emergency management officials both in attempting to mitigate hazards before emergency events and in planning for response and recovery operations after a geologic hazards event.  Public health officials use radon-hazard-potential  maps to target their epidemiological studies, as do scientists in the Division of Radiation Control (Department of Environmental Quality).  Maps have been completed showing the various hazards at scales ranging from 1:500,000 to 1:24,000.  The 1:500,000-scale state maps are useful in depicting the statewide extent of a hazard, but cannot be used by cities and counties in regulating land use.  Maps at scales of 1:24,000 or larger are needed for this purpose, and they need to be in digital form for incorporation into local government GIS systems.      Data Sources:     The Utah Geological Survey (UGS) is the main source of geologic-hazards maps as most of them are derived from primary geologic maps (surface exposures) and other data that must be collected in the field. The U.S. Geological Survey, local government geologists and planning departments, and geotechnical consultants also produce these maps.  UGS also works closely with the University of Utah Seismograph Stations (UUSS).  The UUSS’s Utah Earthquake Catalog is the source for all seismicity data (see Map 14-3).     Status:     (1)  In 1992 the Governors Office of Planning and Budget funded a cooperative agreement between UGS and AGRC.  AGRC digitized or converted five of UGS’s hazard maps into digital, GIS format.  As a result, statewide coverages are already available in the SGID showing landslides (1:100,000 scale) (see Map 14-4), Quaternary faults (1:100,000 scale), problem soils (1:500,000 scale), shallow ground water (1:500,000 scale), and flooding from lakes and dam failures (1:500,000 scale).    (2)  In 2000 a statewide update of the Quaternary faults database was completed with cost-sharing funding from the U.S. Geological Survey National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program.  Data from fault studies conducted in Utah between 1990 and 1999 and published at 1:24,000 and 1:50,000 scales, were added and replaced older, less reliable data (see Map 14-5).  The updated database is ready to be incorporated into the SGID.     (3) Liquefaction-hazard-potential maps (scale 1:48,000) are complete for Davis County, Utah County, Salt Lake County, northern Wasatch Front (Weber, Cache, and Box Elder Counties), and central Utah (parts of  Juab, Sanpete, Millard, Sevier, Summit, and Wasatch Counties).  All but central Utah are in digital GIS format and are already available in the SGID.     (4) The statewide radon-hazard-potential map is complete (1:500,000 scale) but not yet incorporated into the SGID.  Site-specific, radon-hazard-potential maps (1:50,000 - 1:100,000 scales) are complete for Sandy (Salt Lake County), Provo (Utah County), southern St. George Basin (Washington County), Ogden Valley (Weber County), central Sevier Valley (Sevier County), lower Weber River area (Tooele County), southeastern Cache Valley (Cache, Davis, Tooele, and Weber Counties), western Salt Lake Valley (Salt Lake County), and Beaver Basin area (Beaver County).  Some are in digital form, but none have been incorporated into the SGID.     (5) Folios of geologic-hazards maps at 1:24,000-scale are complete for Davis, southern Grand, Salt Lake, eastern Tooele, western Wasatch, eastern Washington (Springdale), Weber, and Utah Counties.  The map folios vary depending on the hazards present but generally include earthquake hazards (liquefaction, surface fault rupture, ground shaking, tectonic subsidence, dam failure inundation, and earthquake-induced landslides), landslide hazards (rock falls, landslides, and debris slides, flows, and floods), flooding (lakes, streams, and shallow groundwater), problem soils (expansive, collapsible and subsidence, gypsiferous, and piping), and radon-hazard potential.  Some in are digital form, but none have been incorporated into the SGID.  Digital files for Salt Lake County maps are available from the Salt Lake County Development Services Department, and those for Utah County are available through the Utah County GIS Department.  Other maps are not available digitally.  Geologic-hazard folios are in progress for Cache County, Ogden Valley (Weber County), and the St. George area of Washington County, and all will be digital files.     Standards:        No generally accepted standards are available for geologic-hazards mapping.        Priority:     The UGS internally sets priorities for geologic-hazards mapping.  Locations are chosen based on present levels of hazard and risk, and potential for future development.     Total Current Investment in Theme:        Over the past five years, there has been one GIS specialist working full time on this theme.                    Contributions by Sector:     The UGS typically participates in projects with other agencies by contributing a cost share of the total project budget.  These agencies include the U.S. Geological Survey National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency State Indoor Radon Grant Program.     Estimate of Investments Needed to Complete This Theme:     All on-going and new maps are being compiled digitally by existing GIS personnel (one full-time FTE).  An additional 0.5 FTE is needed but no dedicated funding is currently available for this task.     Estimate of Current Allocation of Funding/Resources for This Theme:     There is currently one staff GIS specialist working full time on this theme, funded at  $40,000.     Describe Ways to Fund this Gap:     Federal and local government funding may be available for some projects, but in general funding sources are few.     Most Appropriate Data Steward:     UGS must maintain and update data, but AGRC can make the digital data widely available through the SGID.     Maintenance Process and Cost:     UGS periodically updates digital maps as new information becomes available.  GIS specialist requirements for maintenance averages less than 0.25 FTE/year ($10,000/year).                          Section 14C.     GEOLOGIC RESOURCES       Theme Description:     The geologic resources of Utah are subdivided into two broad categories: energy resources and mineral resources.  Energy resources include oil and gas, coal, uranium, oil shale, tar sands, and geothermal waters. Mineral resources include a variety of base metal (e.g. copper, lead, and zinc), precious metal (such as gold, silver, and platinum), and industrial mineral (such as limestone, gypsum, and sand and gravel) commodities. Resource occurrence data is compiled at a variety of map scales including 1:24,000, 1:100,000, and  1:500,000.  Large-scale mapping is used to characterize resource deposits in detail while smaller-scale mapping is most often used to perform regional and state-wide resource assessments.    Data Sources:     (1) The Energy Resources  Map of Utah, published by the Utah Geological (and Mineral) Survey (UGS) in 1983, is the 1:500,000 scale energy resources map of the state.     (2) The UGS maintains a subset of the National Coal Resources Data System (NCRDS), which contains coal resource data for at least 185 Utah quadrangles at the 7.5' scale (1:24,000).  Additional digital data is being generated from this database as part of the National Coal Assessment, which is funded by the U.S. Geological Survey.    (3) The Utah Mineral Occurrences System (UMOS) is a digital database of mineral occurrence information that was compiled on a quadrangle base (usually 1:24,000, but occasionally 1:62,500 scale).  It was originally part of the national Computerized Resource Information Bank (CRIB), which was later renamed the Mineral Resource Data System (MRDS).  A separate name was given to the UGS version because it has been modified from the original MRDS.  This database contains information records for at least 8,900 metallic and industrial mineral occurrences, including 2,000 for sand and gravel, and more than 1,000 uranium records. Some data is also included for coal deposits.    (4) The Digital Geologic Resources Atlas (UGS Bulletin 129-DF, 1999) and A Summary of the Geologic Resource Atlas of Utah (UGS Open-File Report 364, 1999) also provide digital mineral resource information for Utah.     (5) Digital geothermal resource information is contained in the Data Release of Low-Temperature Geothermal Water in Utah (UGS Open-File Report 311-DF, 1994).                Status:     See Map 14-6    (1) The conversion and update of existing data into GIS format for the geothermal resources, limestone resources, and oil and gas resources are in progress and should be completed in 2001.      (2) The conversion and update of existing data into GIS format for coal resources, uranium resources, tar sand resources, and oil shale resources has begun, but no firm completion dates have been set.    (3) As time allows, compilation of  GIS-format data for high-silica sand resources, gypsum resources, gilsonite resources, phosphate resources, sand and gravel resources, and other commodities will be undertaken.  All new projects will be undertaken in GIS format.     Standards:     The UGS follows standards set by the National Cooperative Geologic Map Program, which is headed by the U.S. Geological Survey and the Association of American State Geologists, and that works closely with the FGDC.    Priority:     Geologic resources data are in high demand by many other state agencies, local governments, and private companies.  The UGS provides data on the potential for mineral resources development  to the state Department of Community and Economic Development.  The valuation of mineral resources on School and Institutional Trust Lands maximizes income collected by the state’s Mineral Lease Program.  This data is also vital when the state is evaluating land trades with the Federal government or considering the creation of new Wilderness lands. Completion of the mapping of energy resources is the current top priority.  The second priority is the mapping of those metallic and industrial mineral commodities that are critical to maintaining the quality of life for Utahns.  Subsequent future priorities for data mapping and compilation are flexible and will be re-evaluated on an annual basis.    Total Current Investment in Theme:     Over the past five years the level of time spent has varied widely, but on average, there have been at least two geologists (1/4 time) and one geological technician (1/4 time) working on this theme.  Annual dollar expenditures have averaged about $30,000.    Contributions by Sector:     The UGS typically participates in projects with other agencies by contributing a cost share of the total project budget.  These agencies include the U.S. Geological Survey, the U.S. Department of Energy, the Office of Energy and Resource Planning, and the Department of Community and Economic Development.     Estimate of Investments Needed to Complete This Theme:     At the current level of effort, it is estimated that it would take eleven years to complete the compilation of energy and mineral resources information for the state.  The current $30,000 level of expenditures would have to be inflated annually to keep up with increasing personnel and overhead charges.     Estimate of Current Allocation of Funding/Resources for This Theme:     There is funding for FY 2000-2001 to map the geothermal resources of the state. This project, jointly funded by the UGS, the Office of Energy and Resource Planning and the Department of Community and Economic Development, is funded at approximately $31,000.  No dedicated level of funding and effort has been identified for future years.     Describe Ways to Fund this Gap:     The UGS would hope to obtain outside funding to help leverage state monies to complete the compilation of energy and mineral data for the state in a timely fashion.  Without outside funding this task will likely take longer than eleven years to complete.      Most Appropriate Data Steward:     UGS must maintain and update data, but AGRC can make the digital data widely available  through the SGID.     Maintenance Process and Cost:     An estimated $10,000/year (1/4 FTE) is required to maintain and update existing GIS data.  This cost will increase as mineral resource layers are added to the database.                Section 15.   Wildlife Habitat     Wildlife themes consist primarily of: a) species locality data, and b) species habitat data.  Although other wildlife-related themes (e.g., Wildlife Management Unit boundaries and hunt unit boundaries) exist, they are not  A priority data layers, @  and are therefore not considered here.     Part A. SPECIES LOCALITY DATA     Theme Description:     Species locality data are developed primarily for threatened, endangered, sensitive, and otherwise rare vertebrate, invertebrate, and plant species.  Data are developed state-wide, on a species-by-species basis.  All occurrences are mapped as points, however, occurrences are also mapped as polygons (1:24,000 scale) when appropriate.  Data available to the public are updated on a quarterly (four times per year) basis.    Data Sources:     Species locality data are developed by the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources (UDWR).  Major data sources include: field data collected by UDWR biologists, federal agency biologists, university biologists, and others; museum and herbarium records; published and gray literature; and other existing databases.    Status:     The UDWR = s Utah Natural Heritage Program has recently completed its first round of data development for all federally-listed and state sensitive plant and animal species.  Although much has been accomplished, significant work remains to be completed.  Future work tasks include: 1) keeping the database current as new species localities are discovered, 2) developing locality data for species that are rare but are not yet listed as threatened, endangered, or sensitive, 3) quality-controlling the database, 4) re-working older portions of the database (methodology has changed over the years), and 5) conducting field surveys as data-gaps are identified.      Development of species locality data will always be an on-going process.  Myriad wildlife surveys are conducted each year, species are introduced / re-introduced to new areas, species naturally colonize new areas, historic habitats are destroyed or altered, and so on.  Existing species locality data layers are already invaluable tools for impact analysis, research, and wildlife management.  Future iterations of these data will provide even more information to those who need it.                Standards:     The UDWR follows data development standards set by the Association for Biodiversity Information, The Nature Conservancy, and the Network of Natural Heritage Programs.  FGDC standards are followed for metadata development.    Priority:     Species locality data layers are of extremely high priority.  The UDWR functions as a repository for Utah biodiversity information, and as such provides standardized data to federal agencies, state agencies, researchers, non-profit organizations, and the public sector.  Once it is known where threatened, endangered, sensitive, and otherwise rare species occur, impacts to those species can minimized or avoided, while still allowing development to occur.  It is our hope that our species locality data layers will play a role in precluding future listings (and consequent restrictions) under the Endangered Species Act.    Total Current Investment in Theme:     In excess of $500,000 have been spent to date for the development of species locality GIS data and associated tabular data.    Contributions by Sector:     Major contributors to this effort include the Utah Reclamation Mitigation and Conservation Commission, the State of Utah, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the United States Bureau of Land Management, the United States Forest Service, the Association of Biodiversity Information, and The Nature Conservancy.    Estimate of Investments Needed to Complete This Theme:     The development of species locality data layers occurs on an on-going basis, as data become available and species distributions change.  This theme will, therefore, never be  A completed. @     Describe Ways to Fund This Gap:     Funding for future species locality data development would come from partnerships between the state, governmental agencies, and non-profit organizations who have a need for complete, accurate, and standardized locality data for Utah = s threatened, endangered, sensitive, and otherwise rare species.    Most Appropriate Data Steward:     The Utah Division of Wildlife Resources acts as a repository for Utah biodiversity information, and has statutory authority to manage Utah = s wildlife species.  It is therefore the most appropriate data steward.    Maintenance Process and Cost:     Data are updated on a continual basis.  Data layers available to the public are updated on a quarterly (four times per year) basis.  Maintenance costs are not known at this time.      Part B. SPECIES HABITAT DATA     Theme Description:     Species habitat data are developed primarily for  A high-interest @  wildlife species, predominately game species and species of conservation concern.  In addition, UDWR has recently developed a draft data-layer representing areas of essential wildlife habitat that are currently at-risk from development or other impacts.  With the exception of the essential wildlife habitat data layer, which is a combination of habitat for all wildlife species, habitat data layers are developed on a species-by-species basis.  All species habitat data layers are developed state-wide, and are mapped as polygons at a 1:100,000 scale.  Data layers available to the public are currently updated on an irregular basis.    Data Sources:     Species habitat data are developed by UDWR.  Major data sources include species occurrence data, vegetation (land-cover) data, range-trend data, and the best professional judgement of field biologists.    Status:     The UDWR is currently in the process of updating its species habitat data layers.  Some of these data layers have not been updated for a number of years, however, and may be inaccurate in places.  To complete our updates, the following tasks are necessary: 1) revise our standard methodology for developing wildlife habitat GIS data layers, 2) update existing habitat data layers using the new methodology, 3) quality-control and edge-match the recently updated habitat data layers, and 4) conduct field studies and surveys as data-gaps are identified.     Development of species habitat data will always be an on-going process.  Myriad wildlife surveys are conducted each year, species are introduced / re-introduced to new areas, species naturally colonize new areas, historic habitats are destroyed or altered, and so on.  Existing species habitat data layers are already invaluable tools for impact analysis, research, and wildlife management.  Future iterations of these data will provide even more information to those who need it.    Standards:     The UDWR follows data development standards developed in-house.  FGDC standards are followed for metadata development.    Priority:     Species habitat data layers are of extremely high priority.  The UDWR functions as a repository for Utah biodiversity information, and as such provides wildlife data to federal agencies, state agencies, researchers, non-profit organizations, and the public sector.  Once it is known which areas are essential habitat for Utah = s wildlife species, impacts to those areas can minimized or avoided, while still allowing development to occur.  It is our hope that our species habitat data layers will play a role in precluding future listings (and consequent restrictions) under the Endangered Species Act.    Total Current Investment in Theme:     The UDWR has been mapping wildlife habitat areas for over thirty years.  The current investment in our wildlife habitat data layers is therefore unknown, but is unquestionably significant.    Contributions by Sector:     Funding for wildlife habitat data layers has been provided primarily by the State of Utah.    Estimate of Investments Needed to Complete This Theme:     The estimated cost to improve our current methodology and update all existing wildlife habitat data layers is $200,000.  This cost does not include any additional field surveys that may be needed.     Describe Ways to Fund This Gap:     Although the UDWR is committed to updating all existing wildlife habitat data layers, funding of approximately $100,000 from the I-Team is needed to complete this work.    Most Appropriate Data Steward:     The Utah Division of Wildlife Resources acts as a repository for Utah biodiversity information, and has statutory authority to manage Utah = s wildlife species.  It is therefore the most appropriate data steward.    Maintenance Process and Cost:     Data are currently updated on an irregular basis.  Maintenance costs are not known at this time.               Section 16.      Climate     The basic climate themes include monthly and annual summary, spatial distributions of observed temperatures and precipitation and themes calculated from the observed values.  The temperature themes are for maximum and minimum temperatures.  The precipitation themes include total rainfall and snowfall.  In addition, calculated values for various derived themes include average temperature, evapotranspiration, heating and cooling degree days for base 65, and growing degree days for base 40 and base 50 degrees.    Theme Description:     This theme includes climate maps of average monthly and annual, spatial distributions for the several climatic thematic layers.  Examples of the Average January Minimum Temperatures for Utah and the Average Maximum Temperatures for Utah thematic layers for the 1961-1990 period are shown as an attachment.  These and other climatic layers would be updated to the new normal period of 1971-2000.    Data Sources:     The Utah Climate Center regularly archives weather and climate data for various weather station networks in Utah and for much of the world.  Data sources for this project include all temperature and precipitation from the Utah Climate Center at Utah State University in Logan, UT, and additional data as necessary from the National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, NC.    Status:     The 1971-2000 observed data for temperature and precipitation have been observed and recorded.  These data, with the exception of the October through December months of the year 2000, have been collected and quality controlled.  The October through December data are presently being collected, assembled and quality controlled.  When these data are included, the process of developing thematic representations for the parameters can be started.    Standards:     The Utah Climate Center follows observational and data standards set by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  U. S. Geological Survey mapping standards are applied to all spatial distributions produced by the Utah Climate Center.    Priority:     Mapping priorities are set by the State Climatologist for Utah and the Advisory Committee for the Utah Climate Center.  The Committee meets twice each year to set priorities for the Utah Climate Center, including mapping of climatic parameters.  These persons consider funding for the individual thematic layers as well as the needs of private individuals, local and State entities, and federal agencies.  From highest to lowest, the priorities for several thematic maps include: annual and monthly maximum temperature, annual and monthly minimum temperature, annual and monthly total rainfall, annual and monthly snow depth, calculated annual and monthly average temperature, calculated annual and monthly evapotranspiration, calculated annual and monthly heating degree days, calculated annual and monthly cooling degree days, calculated annual and monthly growing degree days (base 50), calculated annual and monthly growing degree days (base 40), seasonal maps for the parameters listed as needed, and additional applied maps such as plant hardiness and freeze-free season.    Total Current Investment in Theme:     Presently temperature and precipitation data are being assembled and quality controlled.  Computer hardware, software, and expertise have been developed with which to create the thematic layers.      Contributions by Sector:     A dollar amount is not available although both State and Federal agencies spend significant amounts annually to collect and map climate information.    Estimate of Investments Needed to Complete This Theme:     Funding is the only need necessary to complete the climatic thematic layers.    Estimate of Current Allocation of Funding / Resources for This Theme:     A quite firm estimate to create the 1971-2000 thematic layers is:  $3,000 to organize and set up the data for each layer, and $2,000 for the mapping of each layer for each year and month.  For example, for temperatures there would be a $3,000 set up cost, and then an additional $2,000 for each of the maximum, minimum and average temperature maps created.  These combinations are required to meet users needs.  The total cost would be $269,000.    Describe Ways to Fund This Gap:     Undetermined at this time.    Most Appropriate Data Steward:     Most appropriate data steward is the State Climatologist at the Utah Climate Center in Logan, Utah.    Maintenance Process and Cost:     Once thematic layers have been created and stored in digital format there is little or no maintenance required.  Maintenance for computer servers and storage facilities for the digital themes as well as plotters to produce hard copy of thematic layers when necessary, is estimated at $500 per month or $3,000 annually.  These costs can be shared at the University.            Section 17.      Ground Cover     This section is pending.         Section 18.   Land Use     Theme Description:       The State of Utah’s population took 113 years to grow to a total of two million residents, however, it may only take another 30 years for the State’s population to double.  As the State’s population grows, quantifying, monitoring, analyzing effects of urban growth, and managing land use becomes increasingly important.      In Geographic Information Systems (GIS) applications, the use of land surfaces by man for human activities is referred to as Land Use, while the natural and manmade features of the land itself are referred to as Land Cover. Whether the data is to be used for new highway construction planning, habitat protection, or the location of a new school, more and more government officials are relying on LULC data to help their planners and administrators provide them with the information they need to make important decisions.    The demand for large-scale LULC information has increased recently, especially in rapidly growing metropolitan areas.  Many Federal, State, regional, and local planning agencies require up-to-date LULC information for various applications.  These applications include modeling urban growth, determining land suitability for future development, monitoring how land use changes affect the environment, understanding land use patterns, and developing policies concerning land use development.    To meet the needs of State and local government’s data must be current and detailed enough to provide the resolution needed for the environmental and urban analysis, planning, and management.  In addition to currency and accuracy the data must also be of sufficient detail so that the entities utilizing this information can make intelligent decisions.     Currently, there is a layer in the SGID which depicts a comprehensive effort to map water-related land use (LUWRU) for the entire state.  This data layer is used for preparing hydrological inventories and conducting other water-related studies, although it has proven useful for a wide variety of other land use applications.     Data Sources:     The primary source is the 1:24,000-scale high-resolution LULC data presently being produced by the U.S. Geological Survey’s National Mapping Division. Typically, the LULC features are collected using 1-meter resolution digital orthophoto quadrangles.  Ancillary data sources, such as aerial photographs, USGS-scale quadrangles, and information derived in the field are used to help enhance the interpretation and classification of the land surface features.     LUWRU is produced under a mapping program, through the Division of Water Resources.  The inventory is conducted by river basin and updated on an eight-year cycle.     Status:     At present there is no 1:24,000-scale high-resolution LULC data for the State of Utah.    The most current version of LUWRU, with basins updated in 1992 through 2000, is available in the SGID at 1:24,000 scale.     Standards:       USGS requirements for collecting high-resolution LULC features include minimum mapping unit between 2.5 and 5 acres and a minimum polygon width of 125 feet.     The identification of LULC categories follows a modified Anderson classification system (Anderson 1976) developed by the USGS, National Mapping Division, in Denver, Colorado.  Currently, the USGS is mapping LULC features down to level 6 of the hierarchal classification system which contains over 75 categories.  The LULC data are compiled by 1:24,000-scale quadrangles using USGS-developed software and can be merged to form a seamless data set for specific project areas    The standards for LUWRU are found in  A Water-Related Land Use Inventory of the Bear River Basin,  Utah Division of Water Resources, 1991.  All digitizing was performed on USGS 7.5 minute quadrangle paper base maps.    Priority:     Priority for high-resolution LULC is Statewide.  The Utah Geographic Information Systems Advisory Council (GISAC) has the authority to provide the leadership in developing a systematic approach to State wide coverage of LULC.    Total Current Investment in Theme:    None for LULC, however a fifteen year investment by the State of Utah for LUWRU.     Contributions by Sector:     LULC data will be used by a variety of single entities and consortiums of government, industry, local entities. The contributions to begin and complete LULC for the State need to be combined from a variety of sources. This effort will require a long-term committed effort at various levels of government and should be overseen by GISAC.     The State Division of Water Resources is responsible for the development and maintenance of LUWRU.    Estimate of Investments Needed to Complete This Theme:     To have complete coverage of high-resolution LULC data for Utah would cost approximately $7 million.  This is based on an average cost of $4,500 per quad for the LULC multiplied by the 1,542 1:24,000-scale quadrangles that cover Utah.    Another consideration when considering the cost for statewide production of high-resolution LULC is land ownership pattern.  In Utah the approximate ownership is:      State     11%     Private  21%     Federal 68%     LUWRU is complete at this time, but must be maintained on an eight-year cycle.     Estimate of Current Allocation of Funding / Resources for This Theme:       None for LULC.    Describe Ways to Fund This Gap:     The costs for this Theme could be developed using a percentage of ownership, within the State or based on immediate needs of either the State, Private or Federal.  In order to accomplish the initiation and completion of this Theme a long term strategy will need to be developed that will see the completion once the work begins.    Most Appropriate Data Steward:       The Utah Automated Geographic Reference Center (AGRC).    Maintenance Process and Cost:     Some of the high-resolution LULC data sets would require a scheduled maintenance because of urbanization, etc.  However, the more remote areas and areas such as national parks might require a minimum of maintenance.     LUWRU is maintained and updated on an eight-year cycle by river basins.  This must be done in order to show the change in the water-related land use, due to the increase in population and other factors.                 Section 19.   Soils     Theme Description :      The National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS) is a nationwide partnership of Federal, regional, state, and local agencies and institutions. This partnership works together to cooperatively investigate, inventory, document, classify, and interpret soils and to disseminate, publish, digitize, and promote the use of information about the soils.  The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is responsible for the leadership of soil survey activities of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and for the leadership and coordination of other NCSS activities.   Additional information about the NCSS is given in the NRCS General Manual Title 430, Part 402.    Two themes are being developed for soils: Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) Data Base, and State Soil Geographic (STATSGO) Data Base.        1.  SSURGO is the most detailed soil map theme developed for counties, parts of counties, or other administration boundaries.  The Natural Resources Conservation Service has responsibility to coordinate the development of the soil survey databases for the private lands, Native American and State administered lands in Utah, and public areas with cooperative agreements.   BLM, USFS, and NPS have soil data development responsibility for public land administered by their respective agencies.  The soil survey program has been in progress since 1899.  This map theme was designed for use by landowners, local units of government, planners and land use managers.     Field mapping methods using national standards are used to construct the modern soil survey maps in the SSURGO database. Mapping scales in Utah generally range from 1:20,000 to 1:31,680. SSURGO maps are digitized at a standard scale of 1:24,000, and duplicates the original soil survey maps.  The map base used is an orthophotoquadrangle that meets national map accuracy standards.    2.  STATSGO provides a statewide general soils theme.  STATSGO is generalized from SSURGO maps and other soil survey information.  The map scale for the STATSGO map is 1:250,000.  The STATSGO map theme was designed for state or large area planning and management in Utah and between adjacent states.  The map base used is the 1:250,000 scale USGS Topographic Quadrangle.  The current version was created in about 1985.  Updates to this theme are currently in work by NRCS, and estimated to be complete by December 2002.    Data Sources :    The primary source for both soil themes is published or other detailed soil survey reports that meet national data and map accuracy standards. The Status Map for SSURGO displays soil survey areas in digital map development and areas that are certified.    Status :     1.  The SSURGO coverage is about 50 percent complete for private and some public land areas (Section 19, Map 2).  The status map represents progress towards a first generation certified digital soil survey map that began in 1996, and that adhered to national map accuracy standards.  A few areas in Utah have soil surveys in work and a few areas are without soil survey information and are planned in the future.  Soil Survey Status map (Section 19, Map1) displays the status of the areas planned for soil survey.  Schedules for completion and estimated costs are included in the Estimate of Investment and Estimate of Current Allocation of Funding.      Standards :    The NCSS standards used in the development of both soil data themes are at the web sites listed below.  Public land areas managed by the Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, and National Park Service may have additional local standards.           Soil Data Subcommittee controls the development of the FGDC soil digital standard (NRCS):      http://www.statlab.iastate.edu/soils/fgdc-sds/         Soil Survey Standards including mapping, STATSGO, and FGDC map accuracy standards are listed at the following web site within a link called Standards for Soil Survey:      http://www.statlab.iastate.edu/soils/nssc/         National Soil Survey Handbook, parts 647.07, 648.03, and 648.04 describes the NRCS digitizing standards, and archiving of the soil map information.      http://www.statlab.iastate.edu/soils/nssh/      Priority :    The soil survey theme (SSURGO) has been one of t"

ZCTA is a trademark of the U.S. Census Bureau.        The UA Census 2000 TIGER/Line files are an extract of selected        geographic and cartographic information from the Census TIGER database.         The geographic coverage for a single TIGER/Line file is a county or        statistical equivalent entity, with the coverage area based on January        1, 2000 legal boundaries.  A complete set of UA Census 2000 TIGER/Line        files includes all counties and statistically equivalent entities in        the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas as of January 1,       2000.  The UA Census 2000 TIGER/Line files do not include a file for        Broomfield County, CO which became effective November 15, 2001.  The        Census TIGER database represents a seamless national file with no        overlaps or gaps between parts.  However, each county-based TIGER/Line        file is designed to stand alone as an independent data set or the files        can be combined to cover the whole Nation.  The UA Census 2000        TIGER/Line files consist of line segments representing physical        features and governmental and statistical boundaries.  The boundary       information in the TIGER/Line files are for statistical data        collection and tabulation purposes only; their depiction and        designation for statistical purposes does not constitute a        determination of jurisditional authority or rights of ownership or        entitlement.  The files contain information distributed over a series        of record types for the spatial objects of a county.  There are 17        record types, including the basic data record, the shape coordinate        points, and geographic codes that can be used with appropriate software         to prepare maps.  Other geographic information contained in the files        includes attributes such as feature identifiers/census feature        class codes (CFCC) used to differentiate feature types, address        ranges and ZIP Codes, codes for legal and statistical entities,        latitude/longitude coordinates of linear and point features,        landmark point features, area landmarks, key geographic features,        and area boundaries.  The UA Census 2000 TIGER/Line data dictionary        contains a complete list of all the fields in the 17 record types.     Purpose:       In order for others to use the information in the Census TIGER        database in a geographic information system (GIS) or for other        geographic applications, the Census Bureau releases to the public        extracts of the database in the form of TIGER/Line files.  Various        versions of the TIGER/Line files have been released; previous        versions include the 1990 Census TIGER/Line files, the 1992        TIGER/Line files, the 1994 TIGER/Line files, the 1995 TIGER/Line        files, the 1997 TIGER/Line files, the 1998 TIGER/Line files, the        1999 TIGER/Line files, the Redistricting Census 2000 TIGER/Line        files, and the Census 2000 TIGER/Line files.

Native_Data_Set_Environment:     TIGER/Line files are created and processed in a VMS environment.       The environment consists of two Alpha Server 8400s clustered together      running OpenVMS version 6.2-1H3 used for production operations.  The      Census TIGER system is driven by DEC Command language (DCL) procedures      which invoke C software routines to extract selected geographic and      cartographic information (TIGER/Line files) from the operational      Census TIGER database. Data_Quality_Information:   Attribute_Accuracy:     Attribute_Accuracy_Report:       Accurate against Federal information Processing Standards (FIPS),        FIPS Publication 6-4, and FIPS-55 at the 100% level for the codes        and base names.  The remaining attribute information has been        examined but has not been fully tested for accuracy.   Logical_Consistency_Report:     The feature network of lines (as represented by Record Types 1 and 2)      is complete for census purposes.  Spatial objects in TIGER/Line belong      to the ""Geometry and Topology"" (GT) class of objects in the ""Spatial      Data Transfer Standard"" (SDTS) FIPS Publication 173 and are      topologically valid.  Node/geometry and topology (GT)-polygon/chain      relationships are collected or generated to satisfy topological edit     requirements.  These requirements include:     * Complete chains must begin and end at nodes.     * Complete chains must connect to each other at nodes.     * Complete chains do not extend through nodes.     * Left and right GT-polygons are defined for each complete chain      element and are consistent throughout the extract process.     * The chains representing the limits of the files are free of gaps.     The Census Bureau performed automated tests to ensure logical      consistency and limits of files.  All polygons are tested for closure.       The Census Bureau uses its internally developed Geographic Update      System to enhance and modify spatial and attribute data in the Census      TIGER database.  Standard geographic codes, such as FIPS codes for      states, counties, municipalities, and places, are used when encoding      spatial entities.  The Census Bureau performed spatial data tests for      logical consistency of the codes during the compilation of the original      Census TIGER database files.  Most of the Codes themselves were provided      to the Census Bureau by the USGS, the agency responsible for maintaining      FIPS 55. Feature attribute information has been examined but has not been     fully tested for consistency.   Completeness_Report:     Data completeness of the TIGER/Line files reflects the contents of the      Census TIGER database at the time the TIGER/Line files (UA Census 2000      version) were created.   Positional_Accuracy:     Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:       Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:         The information present in these files is provided for the purposes          of statistical analysis and census operations only.  Coordinates          in the TIGER/Line files have six implied decimal places, but          the positional accuracy of these coordinates is not as great as           the six decimal places suggest.  The positional accuracy varies          with the source materials used, but generally the information is          no better than the established national map Accuracy standards          for 1:100,000-scale maps from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS);          thus it is NOT suitable for high-precision measurement applications          such as engineering problems, property transfers, or other uses          that might require highly accurate measurements of the earth's          surface.  The USGS 1:100,000-scale maps met national map accuracy          standards and use coordinates defined by the North American Datum,          1983.  For the contiguous 48 States, the cartographic fidelity of          most of the UA Census 2000 TIGER/Line files, in areas outside the          1980 census Geographic Base File/Dual Independent map Encoding          (GBF/DIME) file coverage and selected other large metropolitan          areas, compare favorably with the USGS 1:100,000-scale maps.  The          Census Bureau cannot specify the accuracy of features inside of          what was the 1980 GBF/DIME-File coverage or selected metropolitan          areas.  The Census Bureau added updates to the TIGER/Line files that          enumerators annotated on maps sheets prepared from the Census          TIGER database as they attempted to traverse every street feature          shown on the Census 2000 map sheets; the Census Bureau also made          other corrections from updated map sheets supplied by local          participants for Census Bureau programs.  The locational accuracy          of these updates is of unknown quality.  In addition to the Federal,          State, and local sources, portions of the files may contain          information obtained in part from maps and other materials prepared          by private companies.  Despite the fact the TIGER/Line data positional          accuracy is not as high as the coordinate values imply, the six-         decimal place precision is useful when producing maps.  The precision          allows features that are next to each other on the ground to be placed          in the correct position, on the map, relative to each other, without          overlap.

Software (TIGER DB routines) written by          the Geography Division allows for efficient access to Census          TIGER system data.  TIGER/Line files are extracted from the          Census TIGER database by county or statistical equivalent          area.  Census TIGER data for a given county or statistical         equivalent area is then distributed among 17 fixed length          record ASCII files, each one containing attributes for either          line, polygon, or landmark geographic data types.  The Census          Bureau has released various versions of the TIGER/Line files         since 1988, with each version having more updates (feature          and feature names, address ranges and ZIP Codes, coordinate          updates, revised field definitions, etc.) than the previous          version.

Polygon features -       1) Geographic entity codes for areas used to tabulate the Census        2000 census statistical data and 1990 geographic areas       2) Locations of area landmarks       3) Locations of KGLs       The line features and polygon information form the majority of        data in the TIGER/Line files.  Some of the data/attributes        describing the lines include coordinates, feature identifiers        (names), CFCCs (used to identify the most noticeable        characteristic of a feature), address ranges, and geographic        entity codes.  The TIGER/Line files contain point and area        labels that describe landmark features and provide locational        reference.  Area landmarks consist of a feature name or label        and feature type assigned to a polygon or group of polygons.         Landmarks may overlap or refer to the same set of polygons.       The Census TIGER database uses collections of spatial objects        (points, lines, and polygons) to model or describe real-world        geography.  The Census Bureau uses these spatial objects to        represent features such as streets, rivers, and political        boundaries and assigns attributes to these features to identify        and describe specific features such as the 500 block of Market        Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

ZCTA is a trademark of the U.S. Census Bureau.        The UA Census 2000 TIGER/Line files are an extract of selected        geographic and cartographic information from the Census TIGER database.         The geographic coverage for a single TIGER/Line file is a county or        statistical equivalent entity, with the coverage area based on January        1, 2000 legal boundaries.  A complete set of UA Census 2000 TIGER/Line        files includes all counties and statistically equivalent entities in        the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas as of January 1,       2000.  The UA Census 2000 TIGER/Line files do not include a file for        Broomfield County, CO which became effective November 15, 2001.  The        Census TIGER database represents a seamless national file with no        overlaps or gaps between parts.  However, each county-based TIGER/Line        file is designed to stand alone as an independent data set or the files        can be combined to cover the whole Nation.  The UA Census 2000        TIGER/Line files consist of line segments representing physical        features and governmental and statistical boundaries.  The boundary       information in the TIGER/Line files are for statistical data        collection and tabulation purposes only; their depiction and        designation for statistical purposes does not constitute a        determination of jurisditional authority or rights of ownership or        entitlement.  The files contain information distributed over a series        of record types for the spatial objects of a county.  There are 17        record types, including the basic data record, the shape coordinate        points, and geographic codes that can be used with appropriate software         to prepare maps.  Other geographic information contained in the files        includes attributes such as feature identifiers/census feature        class codes (CFCC) used to differentiate feature types, address        ranges and ZIP Codes, codes for legal and statistical entities,        latitude/longitude coordinates of linear and point features,        landmark point features, area landmarks, key geographic features,        and area boundaries.  The UA Census 2000 TIGER/Line data dictionary        contains a complete list of all the fields in the 17 record types.     Purpose:       In order for others to use the information in the Census TIGER        database in a geographic information system (GIS) or for other        geographic applications, the Census Bureau releases to the public        extracts of the database in the form of TIGER/Line files.  Various        versions of the TIGER/Line files have been released; previous        versions include the 1990 Census TIGER/Line files, the 1992        TIGER/Line files, the 1994 TIGER/Line files, the 1995 TIGER/Line        files, the 1997 TIGER/Line files, the 1998 TIGER/Line files, the        1999 TIGER/Line files, the Redistricting Census 2000 TIGER/Line        files, and the Census 2000 TIGER/Line files.

Native_Data_Set_Environment:     TIGER/Line files are created and processed in a VMS environment.       The environment consists of two Alpha Server 8400s clustered together      running OpenVMS version 6.2-1H3 used for production operations.  The      Census TIGER system is driven by DEC Command language (DCL) procedures      which invoke C software routines to extract selected geographic and      cartographic information (TIGER/Line files) from the operational      Census TIGER database. Data_Quality_Information:   Attribute_Accuracy:     Attribute_Accuracy_Report:       Accurate against Federal information Processing Standards (FIPS),        FIPS Publication 6-4, and FIPS-55 at the 100% level for the codes        and base names.  The remaining attribute information has been        examined but has not been fully tested for accuracy.   Logical_Consistency_Report:     The feature network of lines (as represented by Record Types 1 and 2)      is complete for census purposes.  Spatial objects in TIGER/Line belong      to the ""Geometry and Topology"" (GT) class of objects in the ""Spatial      Data Transfer Standard"" (SDTS) FIPS Publication 173 and are      topologically valid.  Node/geometry and topology (GT)-polygon/chain      relationships are collected or generated to satisfy topological edit     requirements.  These requirements include:     * Complete chains must begin and end at nodes.     * Complete chains must connect to each other at nodes.     * Complete chains do not extend through nodes.     * Left and right GT-polygons are defined for each complete chain      element and are consistent throughout the extract process.     * The chains representing the limits of the files are free of gaps.     The Census Bureau performed automated tests to ensure logical      consistency and limits of files.  All polygons are tested for closure.       The Census Bureau uses its internally developed Geographic Update      System to enhance and modify spatial and attribute data in the Census      TIGER database.  Standard geographic codes, such as FIPS codes for      states, counties, municipalities, and places, are used when encoding      spatial entities.  The Census Bureau performed spatial data tests for      logical consistency of the codes during the compilation of the original      Census TIGER database files.  Most of the Codes themselves were provided      to the Census Bureau by the USGS, the agency responsible for maintaining      FIPS 55. Feature attribute information has been examined but has not been     fully tested for consistency.   Completeness_Report:     Data completeness of the TIGER/Line files reflects the contents of the      Census TIGER database at the time the TIGER/Line files (UA Census 2000      version) were created.   Positional_Accuracy:     Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:       Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:         The information present in these files is provided for the purposes          of statistical analysis and census operations only.  Coordinates          in the TIGER/Line files have six implied decimal places, but          the positional accuracy of these coordinates is not as great as           the six decimal places suggest.  The positional accuracy varies          with the source materials used, but generally the information is          no better than the established national map Accuracy standards          for 1:100,000-scale maps from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS);          thus it is NOT suitable for high-precision measurement applications          such as engineering problems, property transfers, or other uses          that might require highly accurate measurements of the earth's          surface.  The USGS 1:100,000-scale maps met national map accuracy          standards and use coordinates defined by the North American Datum,          1983.  For the contiguous 48 States, the cartographic fidelity of          most of the UA Census 2000 TIGER/Line files, in areas outside the          1980 census Geographic Base File/Dual Independent map Encoding          (GBF/DIME) file coverage and selected other large metropolitan          areas, compare favorably with the USGS 1:100,000-scale maps.  The          Census Bureau cannot specify the accuracy of features inside of          what was the 1980 GBF/DIME-File coverage or selected metropolitan          areas.  The Census Bureau added updates to the TIGER/Line files that          enumerators annotated on maps sheets prepared from the Census          TIGER database as they attempted to traverse every street feature          shown on the Census 2000 map sheets; the Census Bureau also made          other corrections from updated map sheets supplied by local          participants for Census Bureau programs.  The locational accuracy          of these updates is of unknown quality.  In addition to the Federal,          State, and local sources, portions of the files may contain          information obtained in part from maps and other materials prepared          by private companies.  Despite the fact the TIGER/Line data positional          accuracy is not as high as the coordinate values imply, the six-         decimal place precision is useful when producing maps.  The precision          allows features that are next to each other on the ground to be placed          in the correct position, on the map, relative to each other, without          overlap.

Process_Step:       Process_Description:         In order for others to use the information in the Census TIGER          database in a GIS or for other geographic applications, the          Census Bureau releases periodic extracts of selected information          from the Census TIGER database, organized as topologically          consistent networks.  Software (TIGER DB routines) written by          the Geography Division allows for efficient access to Census          TIGER system data.  TIGER/Line files are extracted from the          Census TIGER database by county or statistical equivalent          area.  Census TIGER data for a given county or statistical         equivalent area is then distributed among 17 fixed length          record ASCII files, each one containing attributes for either          line, polygon, or landmark geographic data types.  The Census          Bureau has released various versions of the TIGER/Line files         since 1988, with each version having more updates (feature          and feature names, address ranges and ZIP Codes, coordinate          updates, revised field definitions, etc.) than the previous          version.

Polygon features -       1) Geographic entity codes for areas used to tabulate the Census        2000 census statistical data and 1990 geographic areas       2) Locations of area landmarks       3) Locations of KGLs       The line features and polygon information form the majority of        data in the TIGER/Line files.  Some of the data/attributes        describing the lines include coordinates, feature identifiers        (names), CFCCs (used to identify the most noticeable        characteristic of a feature), address ranges, and geographic        entity codes.  The TIGER/Line files contain point and area        labels that describe landmark features and provide locational        reference.  Area landmarks consist of a feature name or label        and feature type assigned to a polygon or group of polygons.         Landmarks may overlap or refer to the same set of polygons.       The Census TIGER database uses collections of spatial objects        (points, lines, and polygons) to model or describe real-world        geography.  The Census Bureau uses these spatial objects to        represent features such as streets, rivers, and political        boundaries and assigns attributes to these features to identify        and describe specific features such as the 500 block of Market        Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

GX254-70-3857443	"UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT Oregon State Office P. O. Box 2965 Portland, Oregon 97208 In Reply Refer to: 7200/1283 (933) P February 9, 1998 EMS TRANSMISSION 2/9/98 Instruction Memorandum No. OR-98-033 Expires: 9/30/99 To: From: All DMs, DSDs, Staff Chiefs State Director  Subject: HYDRO Update Standards--Amendment and Clarification to Standards Distributed in Instruction Memorandums No. OR-97-037 and No. OR-97-037, Change 1 This memorandum amends Instruction Memorandum No. OR-97-037 and Change 1 to that document. It provides specific changes to the standards and some additional clarifications to the original memoranda. To simplify the use of these changes, the updated standards document is provided as Attachment 1. Code Changes and Clarifications: 1. STREAMS LAYER--HYDFLOW Under the Space Classification category, the code AG@ is added for a new AGroundwater@ designation. This attribute should be used for portions of a stream which have subsurface flow. They connect reaches with recognized surface flow. This is an estimate of the subsurface flow location, and it is included to assist stream routing and dynamic segmentation. Under the Time Classification, the code AU@ is added for unclassified. It is used in conjunction with the AG@ Space Classification. This is not intended to be a designation for surface flow duration. All continuous or interrupted classifications should receive a AP@, AS@, or AE@ designation.   2 Two additional codes have been added to HYDFLOW. They are to be used in lieu of the Space and Time Classifications. These codes are intended to indicate flow modification. A ADL@ (loss) code is added to indicate ditches or canals which transport water from a contributing 5th field watershed to a receiving watershed. It is a designation for all ditches or canals transporting water from a contributing watershed and represents a loss of water from that watershed. A ADG@ (gain) code is used for all ditches or canals that receive water from an adjacent 5th field contributing watershed. 2. STREAMS LAYER-- PLANFLOW A new code, AZ@, is added to meet the Interior Columbia Basin Ecosystem Management Plan definition of intermittent. This attribute is intended to provide the eastside districts with a method to designate non-perennial streams for various management actions (e.g., delineation of Resource Conservation Areas). A new code, AX@, is added for streams where there is no associated management activity planned. There is a dependency between the use of this code and the use of a HYDFLOW code. An AX@ here should normally correspond with the use of AGU@ in HYDFLOW. 3. STREAMS LAYER--FEDDIST This attribute is a horizontal distance expressed in meters. There needs to be recognition that slope distances must be converted to horizontal distance prior to populating this field in order to have meaningful buffer distances. For this HYDRO update process, there is no state protocol established on how slope distance is derived. It is a district/local steward=s responsibility to document the process used. 4. STREAMS LAYER--Submerged channel centerlines Where a single-line submerged channel occurs for lakes, impoundments, and double-lined rivers, that submerged channel trace will be used as the centerline for the polygonal waterbody shoreline. Where the submerged channel is represented by a double-line trace, then a centerline will be generated for the submerged channel and the resultant trace will be used as the centerline for the polygonal waterbody shoreline. This contrasts with the standard method of generating centerlines based solely on waterbody shoreline. 5. LAKES LAYER--DURATION This is a clarification on use of the ALS@ code. For ALS@ lakes during some point of the year (usually the dry season), there is no land surface expression of water. Basically the lake ""dries up"" annually.   3 6. LAKES LAYER--Minimum mapping resolution This applies to all features portrayed on the LAKES Layer. The minimum mapping resolution is limited by tolerances set within the layer. Currently, the pertinent (fuzzy) tolerance is set to .5 meters. So, theoretically, features above this range will not snap closed during update processing and can be mapped. United States Geological Survey (USGS) has a standard convention of depicting lakes as polygons if they have a diameter of greater than 18 meters at 1:24,000 scale. They depict lakes with lesser diameters as points. It is important to note that we do not map small lakes as points in the HYDRO data model. For USGS source data, we have converted their small lakes portrayed as points to 18 meter circles in the HYDRO Lakes Layer. Because of a BLM need to map features less than the USGS minimum polygon size, no minimum mapping resolution other than the inherent Arc/Info tolerance value of .5 meters is established in this policy. In practice, 5 meters may serve as a good guideline for a minimum feature size to be mapped as polygons in the LAKES Layer. 7. LAKES LAYER--Features that should be included in this layer All water bodies that need to be represented by a polygon should be included in the LAKES Layer. This includes heliponds and other water bodies that support fire management. Some of these features may also be found on another layer such as the Fire Water Source Theme that is currently being developed. 8. STREAMS/LAKES LAYERS--Naming convention for centerlines Case 1-When two or more streams with different names enter a lake, impoundment, or wetland, the generated centerline for the polygon will be assigned the name of the stream Adownstream@ from the waterbody. This is the stream name at the outlet. Case 2-When two or more streams with different names enter an estuary, the generated centerline for the estuary will be assigned the stream name with the highest order entering the estuary. 9. STREAMS/LAKES/HYDPTS LAYERS--SPATIALSOURCE In determining which code to use, preference should be given to the primary method derive the location and extent of the waterbody. As an example, if a combination of Crenulation method (CRW) and an Image (IMG) are used to determine the location, should be selected as the SPATIALSOURCE code since it is the primary method for the extent of the stream. employed to the then ACRW@ determining   4 10. STREAMS/LAKES/HYDPTS LAYERS--WTRBODYTYPE As a point of clarification, springs (points) and streams (lines) can be coincident with wetlands (polygons). Wetlands cannot be coincident with lakes and impoundments. Wetlands are defined by Technical Reference TR 1737 - 11 - 1994 and BLM Manual 1737, USDI - 1992. This is not necessarily a jurisdictional classification. A new code AIW@ has been added to indicate impoundments specifically designated for wetland development. 11. STREAMS/LAKES/HYDPTS LAYERS--Acceptance of other data sources A validation process needs to be performed prior to inclusion of other data sources into the HYDRO theme update. For example, in many instances, it may be advantageous to contact your adjacent National Forest to determine whether they have streams data for their lands. Where available, the acquired data must meet HYDRO update standards and definitions. When this requirement is satisfied, the acquired data may be included as an update to replace Cartographic Feature File (CFF) source data that was originally merged to complete the 5th field coverages and delivered to the districts. 12. STREAMS/LAKES/HYDPTS LAYERS--Feature Names Several NAMES fields are included in the HYDRO data model. These include the STREAMNAME and NODENAME fields in the STREAMS Theme, the LAKENAME field in the LAKES Theme, and the HYDPTSNAME field in the HYDPTS Theme. These all represent the repository for Aofficial@ HYDRO feature names. A clarification is needed for the use of these fields. USGS maps contain a number of feature type labels for which some confusion may arise when incorporating them into the NAMES fields. Not all feature types which are labeled on USGS maps or are found in the Geographic Names Information System are appropriate for these fields. Examples of feature types that are related to waterbodies yet are excluded from use in the Aofficial@ NAMES fields include such features as valley, gulch, canyon, hollow, draw, gorge, etc. Below is a listing which illustrates the types of feature names that may be included in these Aofficial@ NAMES fields. This list is not all-inclusive. Features types which are excluded from the Aofficial@ NAMES fields could be included as a Alocal@ name. Fields are provided for this in each of the three HYDRO themes. Examples of acceptable feature types for the Aofficial@ NAMES fields include the following (grouped according to USGS classification of features):   5 STREAMS THEME--STREAMNAME canal - manmade waterway used by watercraft or for drainage, irrigation, mining, or water power (ditch). gut - relatively small coastal waterway connecting larger bodies of water or other waterways (creek, inlet, slough). stream - linear body of water flowing on the Earth's surface (branch, brook, creek, distributary, fork, river, slough). STREAMS THEME--NODENAME dam - water barrier or embankment built across the course of a stream or into a body of water to control and (or) impound the flow of water falls - perpendicular or very steep fall of water in the course of a stream (cascade, cataract, waterfall). rapids - fast-flowing section of a stream, often shallow and with exposed rock or boulders. LAKES THEME--LAKENAME Note: These may be applied to centerlines on the STREAMS Theme. bay - indentation of a coastline or shoreline enclosing a part of a body of water; a body of water partly surrounded by land (cove, estuary, gulf, inlet, sound). harbor - sheltered area of water where ships or other watercraft can anchor or dock (port). lake - natural body of inland water (lagoon, laguna, pond, pool, waterhole). reservoir - artificially impounded body of water (lake). sea - large body of salt water (gulf, ocean). swamp - poorly drained wetland, fresh or saltwater, wooded or grassy, possibly covered with open water (bog, marsh). wetland - areas inundated or saturated by surface or ground water.  6   HYDPTS THEME--HYDPTSNAME geyser - eruptive spring from which hot water and (or) steam and in some cases mud are periodically thrown. spring - place where underground water flows naturally to the surface of the Earth (seep). well - manmade shaft or hole in the Earth's surface used to obtain fluid or gaseous materials.

STREAMS THEME: REQUIRED ATTRIBUTES FOR ARCS These attributes represent fields which are required to be populated in the update process. Each section provided below includes a description of the attribute as well as the actual field format. Attribute field names will be abbreviated and will follow the format shown in the field format section for each attribute. For example, for Stream Name, the attribute field name will be STREAMNAME. 1. Stream Name: This field is intended for those names that have been approved by the Federal Geographic Names Board. The protocol for determining whether a name is approved or not is as follows: 1. determine whether name is on the appropriate USGS Quadrangle map and if not, 2. determine if the name is in the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS). A current version of the GNIS will be provided to each district. If the name is found in either of these sources, it may be placed in this field. All other names are considered to be unofficial or local and should be placed in the Local Stream Name field. Unofficial or local names should not appear on published BLM maps or other products that are or may be distributed or displayed to the public. Populate only the main channel with the appropriate USGS name. This requires identification of one main channel from the mouth of a named stream to its headwater reach as identified on the spatial update. To the extent possible, this field will be populated from the GNIS as part of the processing effort to this new standard. Field Name STREAMNAME 2. Stream Link: Width 30 Data Type Character  This is a unique link item for relating to other databases and relate tables. This item will be generated based on a feature of the ARC/INFO data structure. Each line or arc within the GIS coverage has a FROM-NODE and a TO-NODE, one at each end of the arc. These usually occur at confluences. In our data model, TO-NODES point downstream and FROM-NODES point upstream. The longitude/latitude coordinate value for the FROM-NODE will be used as the unique link item. This approach will minimize the level of administration and coordination that is required in the creation of these link values. This unique value will not change if the spatial position of the stream changes. Once generated this code is permanent. Field Name STREAMLINK 3. Lake Link: This is a unique link item for relating a line or arc on the Streams Theme to a polygon on the Lakes Theme. The center-lining process for the Streams Theme creates transport and connecter arcs through lakes, ponds, reservoirs, and double-sided rivers. The banks for these features are Width 15 Data Type Character   maintained within the Lakes Theme. In order to relate the transport and connecter arcs to the Lakes feature, the unique link items from the Lakes Theme are also incorporated within this field of the Streams Theme. This field will only be populated for these centerline and connecter arcs. LPOLYLINK is derived from the longitude/latitude values of the label point for the polygon feature within the Lakes Theme. Field Name LPOLYLINK 4. Spatial Data Source: This field captures information related to the original source from which the spatial data was derived. Source data can be inferred from the methods codes included in this field. This information will aid quality control and tracking of updates in the future. WODDB data is defaulted to WOD or HYX coding based on source. In determining which code to use, preference should be given to the primary method employed to derive the location and extent of the waterbody. As an example, if a combination of the Crenulation method (CRW) and an Image (IMG) are used to determine the location, then ACRW@ should be selected as the SPATIALSOURCE code since its the primary method for determining the extent of the stream. Standard values include the following: WOD HYX CRW CRU DFT FPM DEM IMG GPS CFF DLG DRG DOQ DIQ SRV CTR EDG DIS NST OTR WODDB Photogrammetric WODDB Hand drawn-Non Cartographic Crenulation Method 1--Derived from WODDB Contours Crenulation Method 2--Derived from USGS 1:24,000 Contours Digitized from 1:24,000 Topographic Map Digitized from 1:12,000 Forest Plan Map DEM Method Derived from Imagery (screen digitized from scanned aerial photography, SPOT, etc.) Resource Grade GPS (differentially corrected) Cartographic Feature Files (FS) USGS Digital Line Graph Data Digital Raster Graphics Files Digital Ortho Photos Digital Image Ortho Photos From Survey Data Derived Centerlines and Connecter Arcs Arcs generated as part of edgematch between DLG and WODDB data Arcs generated to connect a discontinuous channel Non Stream Features (HYDZ codes in WODDB SUBJ_HYD field) Other Width 3 Data Type Character Width 15 Data Type Character  Field Name SPATIALSOURCE   5. Field Verification Date: Used to track the ground-truthing of stream channels. This is the date in which the stream was actually verified to exist on the ground. No entry connotes no field verification has been done. Day:Month:Year Field Name FVDATE 6. EPA Reach Number: Many agency databases are linked to this identifier, therefore in the interest of coordination and interagency cooperation the Reach Number will be included here. There have been concerns with QC and credibility of this number within WODDB. Therefore, the WODDB Reach Numbers will not be retained. Instead, these will be captured using a conflation process from the 1:100,000 Hydrography coverage that contains this information. Streams which are added during the update process and other existing GIS streams that do not have assigned Reach Numbers will not be given a number. Field Name EPAREACHNO 7. Stream Order: A dimensionless measure of the position of a stream in the hierarchy of tributaries. Where two norder streams join, a segment of n+1 order is formed (Stahler, 1957). Recognize there will be a need to update this on some districts where the spatial extent of streams will be expanded during the update. A tool (AML) will be provided to the districts to facilitate stream ordering after the spatial densification process. This tool will not produce accurate results until all gaps have been fixed in the stream coverage. WODDB values for stream order will be converted to this field as part of the conversion effort. The districts will then need to run the stream ordering AML once stream densification and correction has been completed. This AML will need to be run after each future update activity that deletes or adds stream segments. The conversion process will drop the Alpha characters in WODDB and keep just numeric attributes for stream order. This will remove other water body types and put them into a new attribute group (see Waterbody Type). Lake and other polygon feature shorelines that are replaced by centerlining will be assigned a stream order by carrying the upstream order number through the new line segment which is created when the double line segments are removed. By providing an Aorder@ to these transformed lakes and ponds it will provide a side benefit; geomorphic position of the lakes, ponds, and wetlands within a given watershed by the order of the stream entering these water bodies. Field Name Width Data Type STREAMORDER 2 Integer 8. Water Body Type: Width 17 Data Type Character Width 8 Data Type Date   Waterbody type refers to the descriptive label assigned to a etc. We will bring over the WODDB codes that existed in codes. We propose to use the Name attribute as appears in to use stream or river code. If the channel is not identified these channels Astreams.@ ST  water source such as a lake, river, guzzler Stream Order and add stream and river the USGS Quad as the definer of whether with a name on the Quad we will consider  Streams. All natural channels of flowing water other than those which have been designated on USGS Quads as being a ""River"". This code therefore includes colloquial names such as gully, wash and creek. These include those channels that flow only intermittently or ephemerally in duration or along only part of a channel valley as defined by interrupted. If there is a double-sided stream, a code is entered in this field within the Lakes Layer and for the centerline and connector arcs within the Streams Layer. Rivers. All natural channels of flowing water which have been named as a ""River"" on the USGS quadrangle. All other natural flowing channels are considered to be streams. Typically these will be the channels or larger branches of a drainage system. If there is a double-sided river, a code is entered in this field within the Lakes Layer and for the centerline and connector arcs within the Streams Layer. Ditches and Canals. A constructed open channel for transporting water from a source of supply to the point of distribution. The distinction between ditches/canals and streams is the man-made construction. Side Channel. These river features are usually associated with complex stream patterns found with multiple channel stream types. This is not a main channel delineation. These are additional channels which are located adjacent to the main channel delineation and are not considered a tributary. We anticipate these channels to be located in the higher order streams particularly where the USGS quads have recorded the persistent island situations. If double-sided sidechannel, code entered in this field within the Lakes Layer and for the centerline and connector arcs within the Streams Layer. Bays, Estuaries, and Ocean. This code should be used to mark the inland extent of tidal influence. Estuaries are tidally-influenced ecological systems where rivers meet the sea and fresh water mixes with salt water. This should be the basis for assigning this code. The break between the estuary and the river will be represented by a closure line in the Lakes Layer. This code will be entered into this field within the Lakes Layer and for centerlines and connector arcs within the Streams Layer. For DLG source data, USGS specifications state that the inland extent of the estuary is defined at the place where a double-line river or stream reaches a width of 1 nautical mile with no further constrictions, if the conformation of the land and water do not otherwise make the division obvious. Within the DLG data, a closure line is also placed to separate the bay, estuary, or ocean from the double line river.  RI  DC  SC  ES   LA  Lakes and Ponds. A naturally occurring body of fresh or saline water which is completely surrounded by land. This is a standing body (not flowing) of water and is treated as polygon data. At this time there is no size threshold therefore lakes and ponds are considered under the same code. Some scale dependent input methods may be problematic for input of very small features. Codes are entered in this field within the Lakes Layer and for the centerline and connector arcs within the Streams Layer. Wetlands. Areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and which, under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands are treated as polygon data. At this time there is no size threshold. Some scale dependent input methods may be problematic for input of very small features. There may be overlap between wetlands polygon data in the Lakes Layer and streams or river within the Streams Layer or with springs/seeps and guzzlers in the points layer . Impoundment. A waterbody created by a man-made structure, such as a dam, built to collect or store water. Reservoirs, dugouts, catchments and impoundments are all included under this category. This is a standing body (not flowing) of water and is treated as polygon data. At this time there is no size threshold. Some scale dependent input methods may be problematic for input of very small features. Codes are entered in this field within the Lakes Layer and for the centerline and connector arcs within the Streams Layer. Impounded Wetland. Impoundments specifically designated for wetlands development. Unclassified Water body. This code is used to represent water bodies that have not been classified. Some WODDB features will initially have this code. It should be replaced as soon as possible with the appropriate waterbody type code. Width 2 Data Type Character  WT  IM  IW UN  Field Name WTRBODYTYPE 9. Hyd Flow:  This was formerly known as Stream Type. It is a streamflow classification. There will be a 2 alpha character entry. The first will classify flow in relation to the expression of flow at the ground surface (space); Interrupted or Continuous. The second will classify flow in terms of the seasonal behavior of a waterbody over time in terms of surface flow (duration). SPACE Classification:   C= I=  Continuous = a channel that does not have interruptions in space. It can be perennial, intermittent or ephemeral. Interrupted = a channel which contains: A. perennial flow with intervening intermittent or ephemeral segments B. intermittent flow with intervening ephemeral segments Groundwater = reaches that represent subsurface flow. These arcs connect reaches with recognized surface flow. The represent an estimate of the subsurface flow location. This code is included to assist stream routing and dynamic segmentation. The default setting for surface flow classification will be C.  G=  TIME Classification: P= S= Perennial = streams which essentially flows year round. Perennial streams are generally associated with a stable water table in the localities through which they flow. Intermittent or seasonal = One that flows only at certain times of the year when it receives water from springs or from some surface source such as melting snow in mountainous areas. During the dry season, the water table is usually below these channels. Ephemeral = One that flows only in the direct response to storm precipitation, and whose channel is at all times above the water table. Unclassified = Unclassified surface flow. This code is used in conduction with the AG@ Space Classification. It is not intended to be a designation for surface flow duration.  E= U=  More complete definitions are found in Meinzer (1923). Two additional codes have been added to HYDFLOW. These are used in lieu of the codes described above and are intended for specific ditches and canals which transport water from one watershed to another. DL= ALOSS@ ditches and canals = ditches or canals which transport water from a contributing 5th field watershed to a receiving watershed.  DG= AGAIN@ ditches and canals = ditches or canals which receive water from an adjacent 5th field watershed. Field Name Width Data Type HYDFLOW 2 Character 10. Plan Flow: One alpha character:   P=  Perennially flowing streams, that is channels which essentially flow year round. Perennial streams are generally associated with a stable water table in the localities through which they flow. Default will be P if HYD FLOW = P. Intermittent flowing streams. These are stream channels which exhibit scour and deposition resulting in a definable channel. This can include ephemeral channels (identified in HYD FLOW) if the channel meets this NWFP definition. ICBEMP Intermittent flowing streams. This code is to be used to meet the Interior Columbia Basin Ecosystem Management Plan (ICBEMP) definition of intermittent. Streams with no associated management activity. Intended for eastern Oregon use. Intended for streams with no associated management activity. These streams will generally have AGU@ HYDFLOW values.  I=  Z= X=  This attribute is necessary for habitat identification, likely areas of Riparian Reserve adjustment and general modeling for Watershed Analysis. Must be separate from HYD FLOW due to mix of definitions. More complete definitions are found in the Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement There may be additions to this dependant on feedback from the Interior Columbia Basin Ecosystem Management Plan effort. Field Name PLANFLOW 11. Individual Species: Width 1 Data Type Character  All fish species included in the database are those species identified by BLM fisheries biologists as present and important in Oregon and Washington. Each species (or subspecies) will be its own field and will be identified by a species code. The species code will consist of a 4-7 letter code using the first two letters of the genus, species, and subspecies (if used) names, e.g. SATR (Salmo trutta) and ONMYIR (Onchorhynchus mykiss iridius). All genus and species names are consistent with Robins, et al. (1991). Species codes are proposed for the item names rather than common names due to the length of the common names (e.g. Columbia Redband Steelhead). The subgroup felt that users could utilize a list to relate to the common name and would also become somewhat familiar with the codes. This listing will be included in the metadata for this theme. The ASteelhead@ name will refer to anadromous forms of Onchorhynchus mykiss. Coastal steelhead (Onchorhynchus mykiss iridius; see Behnke 1992) are in all coastal drainages and from the Columbia River downstream from The Dalles Dam (including all Columbia River tributaries between the Cowlitz and Wind Rivers in Washington and the Willamette and Hood Rivers in Oregon, inclusive). Both winter and summer runs may be present (Busby, et al. 1996). All steelhead in the Columbia River Basin upstream of The Dalles Dam are summer-run, Columbia Redband Steelhead (Onchorhynchus mykiss gairdneri; see Behnke 1992) (Fifteenmile Creek, Oregon are winter-run, and winter steelhead are found in the Klickitat and White Salmon Rivers, Washington). (Busby, et al. 1996).   The names ACoastal Rainbow Trout@, AColumbia Redband Trout@, and AInland Redband Trout@ will refer to all non-anadromous forms of Onchorhynchus mykiss. Coastal Rainbow Trout will represent resident forms of coastal O. mykiss iridius and all hatchery stock. AColumbia Redband Trout@ will represent resident forms of O. mykiss subspecies found upstream of The Dalles Dam within the Columbia River Basin. Inland Redband Trout will represent resident forms of O. mykiss subspecies found in the Oregon desert basins, e.g., Catlow Valley, Klamath Lake and the Warner Lakes basin (Behnke 1992, Busby, et al. 1996). Western Brook Lamprey (Lampetra richardsoni) will include the species commonly referred to as the Pacific brook lamprey (L. pacifica), which are now considered to be conspecific (Robins, et al. 1991). Use reliable field survey information to verify species presence. Acceptable information includes survey data from federal and state agencies (i.e., Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service, Fish and Wildlife Service, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, Oregon Department of Forestry, Washington Department of Game, Tribal data, etc.), adjacent landowners and universities. Examples of acceptable data include stocking records, population surveys, spawning ground counts, and presence/absence surveys. If species presence in any reach is based on best professional estimate, those reaches should be coded as Apresence not verified.@ The attribute coding will provide the following information for each species: AN - anadromous RE - resident FA - fall run (enter XX for resident species) SP - spring run (enter XX for resident species) WI - winter run (enter XX for resident species) SU - summer run (enter XX for resident species) SY - spawning habitat, yes SN - spawning habitat, no VY - species presence verified, yes VN - species presence verified, no Field Name: Width: Data Type: Structure: Species Code (e.g. ONMYIR for Coastal Steelhead) 93 total species items 14 (12 plus 2 spaces for possible future growth) Character Concatenated code 12 characters long, fully populated, if no data then filled with X's. Columns 1-4 contain anadromous vs resident population information; columns 5-8 contain fish run information; columns 9-10 contain spawning information; and columns 11-12 contain fish species verification information.   Example Codes: A few examples are provided below to demonstrate the use of the codes. Note that the occurrence of Spring and/or Fall Runs are mutually exclusive with the occurrence of Winter and/or Summer Runs. Legitimate codes for columns 5-6 are FA, SU, and XX. For columns 7-8 the legitimate codes are SP, WI, and XX. Example Code 1: ANREFASPSYVY where, AN=Anadromous RE=Resident FA=Fall Run SP=Spring Run SY=Spawning/yes VY= Species Presence Verified/yes AN=Anadromous XX=Not Resident FA=Fall Run XX=Not Spring Run SN=Spawning/no VN= Species Presence Verified/no AN=Anadromous XX=Not Resident SU=Summer Run WI=Winter Run SN=Spawning/no VY= Species Presence Verified/yes XX=Not Anadromous RE= Resident XX= not applicable XX= not applicable SY=Spawning/yes VY= Species Presence Verified/yes  Example Code 2:  ANXXFAXXSNVN where,  Example Code 3:  ANXXSUWISNVY where,  Example Code 4:  XXREXXXXSYVY where,  12. Fish Bearing: Field which is coded based on actual or modeled fish presence. This attribute is useful for habitat identification, Riparian Reserve width identification, and general modeling for watershed analysis. A fish-bearing stream is defined in the NWFP by the Apresence of any fish species for any duration of time.@ This attribute may be used with either perennial or intermittent streams. This attribute is related to the fish-bearing nature of the stream reach. It will potentially be populated from two sources including the following: (1) from a modeling effort that uses available information (i.e. gradient, stream order, etc) to identify possible fish bearing streams and (2) from species information in the individual species fields. The population of this field is not dependent on data being present in the individual species fields. Initial default values are PNV for WODDB stream reaches with identified fish in the individual species fields and ANV for all other data.   Use reliable field survey information to verify fish-bearing reaches. Acceptable information includes survey data from federal and state agencies (i.e., Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service, Fish and Wildlife Service, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, Oregon Department of Forestry, Washington Department of Game, Tribal data, etc.), adjacent landowners and universities. Examples of acceptable data include stocking records, population surveys, spawning ground counts, and presence/absence surveys. If the fish-bearing status of any reach is based on best professional estimate, those reaches should be coded as Apresence not verified.@ Often, fish use can be detected using simple observation or sampling, such as angling; if fish are seen or caught, fish presence is verified. However, to verify that fish are not present, more definitive sampling, i.e., electroshocking, should be used.

This field will be initially populated with WODDB names. The intent of this field is for internal BLM use only. The following quote from the U.S. Board on Geographic Names document titled ""Principles, Policies, and Procedures: Domestic Geographic Names"" applies to the use of this field: ""Pursuant to Public Law 80-242, geographic names not in GNIS must be submitted to the Board on Geographic Names for approval before they can be used on federal maps, charts, and other publications."" This field is intended as a repository for unofficial stream names that have not been submitted to and/or approved by the Federal Geographic Names Board. Population of this field meets internal information needs only yet also aids the process of proposing these names to the Geographic Names Board. All uses of information within this field should adhere to the above cited regulation. Users of this information must ensure that it is not portrayed on maps and other products that are or may be distributed or displayed to the public. See notes for Stream Name field. Field Name LSTREAMNAME 3. FPA Buffer Distance: This is the on-the-ground distance (in meters) of the Forest Practices Act buffer on private lands. This may be needed for modeling riparian widths on a watershed basis across ownerships. It can be obtained from the local Forest Practice Officer or modeled from ODF stream class. Field Name FPADIST 4. Federal Buffer Distance: This is the actual Riparian Reserve width using the NWFP determinates (e.g. default site potential tree, 100 year floodplain, unstable/potentially unstable areas). 4 integer field. This is a slope distance expressed in meters. In GIS this must be expressed as a horizontal distance. There needs to be a recognition that slope distances must be converted to horizontal distance prior to populating this field in order to have meaningful buffer distances. For this HYDRO update process, there is no state protocol established on how slope distance is derived. This is a district/local stewards responsibility to document the process used.

Width 1 Data Type Integer  4  IV  Field Name FSSTREAMCLASS 7. Confinement:  Confinement is the ratio of channel valley width (VW) to actual channel width (CW). This is provided for districts use in channel classification/fish habitat analysis. This attribute along with gradient and the Rosgen's stream type have limited application in this interim period as we will still be using the originally defined arcs in WODDB. These arcs do not necessarily conform to the geomorphic setting of the valley and channel. There is no intention at this point to update these arcs to conform to the geomorphic setting. When we migrate to the target system which includes dynamic segmentation; confinement, gradient and Rosgens classification will be defined along relatively short stream segments and therefore will have more utility and confidence. This is intended to be the average confinement for the reach.  The standard format will be a single character, showing confinement as defined by the Washington Forest Practices Board where: C = confined ( VW< 2CW), MC= moderately confined (2CW < VW < 4CW), and U = unconfined (VW > 4CW). Field Name CONFINEMENT 8. Gradient: Channel gradient is the change in elevation per unit of horizontal distance of channel. This is expressed as a whole number percent slope. It will not be entered in classes. This is provided for districts use in channel classification/fish habitat analysis. As explained in the confinement attribute, gradient will have limited utility as it is expressed as an average percent slope over a pre-defined arc (predominately confluence to confluence) which are not based on geomorphic slope breaks. It does provide a reasonable approximation of valley floor gradient. It will be expressed as an absolute value for the reach with a 3 value integer field with no decimals. Field Name Width Data Type Width 2 Data Type Character   GRADIENT 9. Rosgen's Stream Class:  3  Integer  This field will provide districts opportunity to store Rosgen's stream classification information. As explained under confinement this will have limited utility at this time due attributing predetermined arcs. Overwhelming comment suggests there is need for this field. This field will consist of 3 characters; alpha, numeric, alpha corresponding to Rosgen's Level 1 & 2 characterization. The Update team suggests that the Level 1 (1st alpha character) may be the only appropriate entry until the target system and dynamic segmentation is available. For a full description of the 3 character code refer to Rosgen, 1996 (Fig 5-3 provides overview pg 5-6). Field Name ROSGEN 10. Functioning Condition: BLM Functioning Condition Classification.

Water Body Type:  Width 3  Data Type Character  Waterbody type for the Lakes Theme refers to the descriptive label assigned to the body of standing water or wetland. We will bring over the WODDB names that existed. Lacking WODDB, we propose that initially the Name attribute as appears in the USGS Quad as the definer of whether a standing water type would be defined as a impoundment or a natural lake/ pond. If not named or identified on Quad we will consider the water body type as not identified and this will need to be user defined. LA Lakes and Ponds. A naturally occurring body of fresh or saline water which is completely surrounded by land. This is a standing body (not flowing) of water and is treated as polygon data. At this time there is no size threshold therefore lakes and ponds are considered under the same code. Some scale dependent input methods may be problematic for input of very small features. Codes are entered in this field within the Lakes Layer and for the centerline and connector arcs within the Streams Layer. Wetlands. Areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and which, under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands are treated as polygon data. At this time there is no size threshold Some scale dependent input methods may be problematic for input of very small features. There may be overlap between wetlands polygon data in the Lakes Layer and streams or river within the Streams Layer or springs/seeps and guzzlers within the Points layer. Impoundment. A waterbody created by a man-made structure, such as a dam, built to collect or store water. Reservoirs, dugouts, catchments and impoundments are all included under this category. This is a standing body (not flowing) of water and is treated as polygon data. At this time there is no size threshold. Some scale dependent input methods may be problematic for input of very small features. Codes are entered in this field within the Lakes Layer and for the centerline and connector arcs within the Streams Layer. Impounded Wetland. Impoundments specifically designated for wetlands development. Bays, Estuaries, and Ocean. Estuaries are tidally-influenced ecological systems where rivers meet the sea and fresh water mixes with salt water. This should be the  WT  IM  IW ES   basis for assigning this code. The break between the estuary and the river will be represented by a closure line in the Lakes Theme. This code will be entered in this field within the Lakes Layer and for the centerline and connector arcs within the Streams Layer. For DLG source data, USGS specifications state that the inland extent of the estuary is defined at the place where a double-line river or stream reaches a width of 1 nautical mile with no further constrictions, if the conformation of the land and water do not otherwise make the division obvious. Within the DLG data, a closure line is also placed to separate the bay, estuary, or ocean from the double line river. UN Unclassified Waterbody. This code is used to represent water bodies that have not been classified. Some WODDB features will initially have this code. It should be replaced as soon as possible with the appropriate waterbody type code.  The following codes are included for attributing linear features that were captured as double lines. ST Streams. All natural channels of flowing water other than those which have been designated on USGS Quads as being a ""River"". This code therefore includes colloquial names such as gully, wash and creek. These include those channels that flow only intermittently or ephemerally in duration or along only part of a channel valley as defined by interrupted. For the double-sided stream, a code is entered in this field within the Lakes Layer and for the centerline and connector arcs within the Streams Layer. Rivers. All natural channels of flowing water which have been named as a ""River"" on the USGS quadrangle. All other natural flowing channels are considered to be streams. Typically these will be the channels or larger branches of a drainage system. For the double-sided river, a code is entered in this field within the Lakes Layer and for the centerline and connector arcs within the Streams Layer. Ditches and Canals. A constructed open channel for transporting water from a source of supply to the point of distribution. The distinction between ditches/canals and streams is the man-made construction. For the double-sided ditch or canal, a code is entered in this field within the Lakes Layer and for the centerline and connector arcs within the Streams Layer. Side Channel. These river features are usually associated with complex stream patterns found with multiple channel stream types. This is not a main channel delineation. These are additional channels which are located adjacent to the main channel delineation and are not considered a tributary. We anticipate these channels to be located in the higher order streams particularly where the USGS quads have recorded the persistent island situations. For double-sided side channels, this code  RI  DC  SC   is entered in this field within the Lakes Layer and for the centerline and connector arcs within the Streams Layer. Field Name WTRBODYTYPE 5. Fish Bearing: Field which is coded based on actual or modeled fish presence. This attribute is useful for habitat identification, Riparian Reserve width identification, and general modeling for watershed analysis. A fish-bearing stream is defined in the NWFP by the Apresence of any fish species for any duration of time.@ This attribute is related to the fish-bearing nature of the lake. It will potentially be populated from two sources including the following: (1) from a modeling effort that uses available information to identify possible fish bearing lakes and (2) from species information in the individual species fields. The population of this field is not dependent on data being present in the individual species fields. Initial default values are PNV for WODDB lakes with identified fish in the individual species fields and ANV for all other data. Use reliable field survey information to verify fish-bearing lakes. Acceptable information includes survey data from federal and state agencies (i.e., Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service, Fish and Wildlife Service, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, Oregon Department of Forestry, Washington Department of Game, Tribal data, etc.), adjacent landowners and universities. Examples of acceptable data include stocking records, population surveys, spawning ground counts, and presence/absence surveys. If the fish-bearing status of any lake is based on best professional estimate, those lakes should be coded as Apresence not verified.@ Often, fish use can be detected using simple observation or sampling, such as angling; if fish are seen or caught, fish presence is verified. However, to verify that fish are not present, more definitive sampling, i.e., electroshocking, should be used.

Duration:  This item provides an indication of the seasonal extent to which water is present within the waterbody (duration). During some of the year (usually the dry season), there is no surface expression of water.   LP = Perennial = water bodies which essentially contain water year round. LS = Intermittent or Seasonal = one that contains water at certain times of the year when it receives water from springs or from some surface source such as melting snow in mountainous areas. During the dry season, the water table is usually below these water bodies. Field Name DURATION Width 2 Data Type Character  7.

Standing Water Type: The standing water type refers to the geomorphic origin of the water source. 1=Miscellaneous Lakes 2=Reservoirs Lakes not specifically defined in any of the other codes. A (manmade) body of impounded water stored for the purpose of altering the timing of flow for future use (irrigation, flow augmentation, dilution, treatment, stock rearing, power generation, etc). A small body of water occupying a cirque (a deep, steep-walled recess in a mountain caused by glacial erosion) depression dammed by a rock lip, small moraine, or both. A lake owing its existence to the blockade of valley or drainage courses by glacial drift, also called a drift-barrier lake. A lake in a drift depression, made by the wasting away of a detached mass of glacier ice that had been either wholly or partly buried in the drift. A crescent-shaped lake formed in an abandoned river bend which has become separated from the main stream by a change in the course of the river.

A pool of water on the surface of sea ice, or, formed by accumulation of melt water on large glaciers. 9=Beaver Ponds 10=Playa 11=Alkali Impoundment made by beavers to raise the water level above the entrances to their dens. Broad, shallow sheets of water which quickly gather and almost as quickly evaporate, leaving mud flats or playas to mark their sites. A lake formed in low depressions, water evaporation deposits fine sediments and dissolved minerals which form a hard surface if mechanical sediments prevail or a crumbly powdered surface if efflorescent salts are abundant. Lakes on any plain which has its margin on the shore of a large body of water, particularly the sea, and generally represents a strip of recently emerged sea bottom. Lakes formed in excavations resulting from the removal sand and gravel. A lake formed in depressions resulting from the intersection of a fault plane with the surface. A lake formed in a depression in the land surface generally in a limestone region communicating with a subterranean passage developed by solution (afterwards becoming blocked so water is retained) or resulting from solution of gypsum and rock salt or by the collapse of a cavern roof.

Lacking WODDB, we propose that initially the Name attribute as appears in the USGS Quad or the spot symbol (major/minor classification) as the definer of water body type in the HYDPTS Layer. USGS DLG standards allow for waterbody features that have diameter of less that .03 map inches at 1:24,000 scale to be represented as points. In our HYDRO standard, lakes, ponds, and gravel pits are converted to polygons in the Lakes Layer and are not included in the HYDPTS Layer. The polygons are created by buffering the points with a 9.14m buffer. WE SP Wells. A hole dug or drilled into the earth which accesses groundwater. Springs and Seeps. An issue of water flowing from the earth onto the land or into a body of surface water. There is no distinction made between man made/enhanced and those which are natural. Guzzler. A water entrapment or containment structure used primarily to provide water for wildlife and livestock in arid regions.

The 1998 TIGER/Line files are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the Census TIGER data base. The geographic coverage for a single TIGER/Line file is a county or statistical equivalent entity, with the coverage area based on January 1, 1999 legal boundaries. A complete set of 1999 TIGER/Line files includes all counties and statistically equivalent entities in the United States, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, U.S. Minor Outlying Areas, and the Pacific Island Areas. The Census TIGER data base represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts. However, each county-based TIGER/Line file is designed to stand alone as an independent data set or the files can be combined to cover the whole Nation and its territories. The 1999 TIGER/Line files consist of line segments representing physical features and governmental and statistical boundaries. The files contain information distributed over a series of record types for the spatial objects of a county. There are 17 record types, including the basic data record, the shape coordinate points, and geographic codes that can be used with appropriate software to prepare maps. Other geographic information contained in the files includes attributes such as feature identifiers/census feature class codes (CFCC) used to differentiate feature types, address ranges and ZIP Codes, codes for legal and statistical entities, latitude/longitude coordinates of linear and point features, landmark point features, area landmarks, key geographic features, and area boundaries. The 1999 TIGER/Line data dictionary contains a complete list of all the fields in the 17 record types.   Purpose:       In order for others to use the information in the Census TIGER data base in a geographic information system (GIS) or for other geographic applications, the Census Bureau releases to the public extracts of the data base in the form of TIGER/Line files. Various versions of the TIGER/Line files have been released; previous versions include the 1990 Census TIGER/Line files, the 1992 TIGER/Line files, the 1994 TIGER/Line files, the 1995 TIGER/Line files, the 1997 TIGER/Line files and the 1998 TIGER/Line files. The 1999 TIGER/Line files were originally produced for use by the states participating in the verification of Phase 2 of the Census 2000 Redistricting Data Program, Phase 2, the Voting District project (VTDP) and the verification of the Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP).

The remaining attribute information has been examined but has not been fully tested for accuracy.     Logical_Consistency_Report:       The feature network of lines (as represented by Record Types 1 and 2) is compete for census purposes. Spatial objects in TIGER/Line belong to the ""Geometry and topology"" (GT) class of objects in the ""Spatial Data Transfer Standard"" (SDTS) FIPS Publication 173 and are topologically valid. Node/geometry and topology (GT)-polygon/chain relationships are collected or generated to satisfy topological edit requirements. These requirements include: * Complete chains must begin and end at nodes. * Complete chains must connect to each other at nodes. * Complete chains do not extend through nodes. * Left and right GT-polygons are defined for each complete chain element and are consistent throughout the extract process. * the chains representing the limits of the files are free of gaps. The Census Bureau performed automated tests to ensure logical consistency and limits of files. All polygons are tested for closure. The Census Bureau uses its internally developed Geographic Update System to enhance and modify spatial and attribute data in the Census TIGER data base. Standard geographic codes, such as FIPS codes for states, counties, municipalities, and places, are used when encoding spatial entities. The Census Bureau performed spatial data tests for logical consistency of the codes during the compilation of the original Census TIGER data base files. Most of the Codes themselves were provided to the Census Bureau by the USGS, the agency responsible for maintaining FIPS 55. Feature attribute information has been examined but has not been fully tested for consistency.   Completeness_Report:       Data completeness of the TIGER/Line files reflects the contents of the Census TIGER data base at the time the TIGER/Line files (1999 version) were created.   Positional_Accuracy:         Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:         Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:       The information present in these files is provided for the purposes of statistical analysis and census operations only. Coordinates in the TIGER/Line files have six implied decimal places, but the positional accuracy of these coordinates is not as great as the six decimal places suggest. The positional accuracy varies with the source materials used, but generally the information is no better than the established national map Accuracy standards for 1:100,000-scale maps from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS); thus it is NOT suitable for high-precision measurement applications such as engineering problems, property transfers, or other uses that might require highly accurate measurements of the earth's surface. The USGS 1:100,000-scale maps met national map accuracy standards and use coordinates defined by the North American Datum, 1983. For the contiguous 48 States, the cartographic fidelity of most of the 1999 TIGER/Line files, in areas outside the 1980 census Geographic Base File/Dual Independent map Encoding (GBF/DIME) file coverage and selected other large metropolitan areas, compare favorable with the USGS 1:100,000-scale maps. The Census Bureau cannot specify the accuracy of features inside of what was the 1980 GBF/DIME- File coverage or selected metropolitan areas. The Census Bureau added updates to the TIGER/Line files that enumerators annotated on maps sheets prepared from the Census TIGER data base as they attempted to traverse every street feature shown on the Census 2000 map sheets; the Census Bureau also made other corrections from updated map sheets supplied by local participants for Census Bureau programs. The locational accuracy of these updates is of unknown quality. In addition to the Federal, State, and local sources, portions of the files may contain information obtained in part from maps and other materials prepared by private companies. Despite the fact the TIGER/Line data positional accuracy is not as high as the coordinate values imply, the six-decimal place precision is useful when producing maps. The precision allows features that are next to each other on the ground to be placed in the correct position, on the map, relative to each other, without overlap.

Software (TIGER DB routines) written by the Geography Division allows for efficient access to Census TIGER system data. TIGER/Line files are extracted from the Census TIGER data base by county or statistical equivalent area. Census TIGER data for a given county or statistical equivalent area is then distributed among 17 fixed length record ASCII files, each one containing attributes for either line, polygon, or landmark geographic data types. The Bureau of the Census has released various versions of the TIGER/Line files since 1988, with each version having more updates (feature and feature names, address ranges and ZIP Codes, coordinate updates, revised field definitions, etc.) than the previous version.

Level   An attribute of reaches which defines main paths and tributaries within the  stream network.  All connected reaches having the same Level are considered to be  part of the same main stem river.  Level is defined by giving a value of '1' to streams  that flow directly into the oceans, gulf, or Great Lakes, then by incrementing the level  by 1 for all tributaries that flow directly into these streams.  Each additional  set of tributaries becomes the next higher level.  Level is sometimes though of as  being the reverse of stream order.  Level is stored in the attribute table in records having an ATTYPE of STL.  Unnetworked reaches have a level of 428.     Lock Chamber  An enclosure on a waterway used to raise and lower vessels as they pass from one level to another.  A 0-D, 1-D, or 2-D basic feature.     Mainframe   The EPA IBM mainframe computer on which RF3 was developed and stored and on which  other EPA attributes will be stored and maintained.     Major Inflow   The point at which a reach of a given level flows into a reach of the same level.  Because both reaches have the same level, the contributing reach is said to  be the 'Major' inflow to the downstream reach.     Major Outflow   The point at which a reach of a given Level flows out to a reach of the same level.    Most often associated with Lake/Pond features where the reach associated with the  lake/pond is said to be a major outflowing point to the downstream reach.     Minor Inflow   The point at which a reach of  a given Level flows into a reach of a lower Level.   Usually associated with tributaries flowing into a 2-D stream/river or tributaries  flowing into a lake/pond.     Minor Outflow   The point at which a reach of  a given Level flows out to a reach of a higher level.   Most often associated with Lake/Pond features having more than one outflowing reach.   The outflowing reach having the same Level as the Lake/Pond will be the Major Outflow.  All other outflowing reaches will be Minor Outflows.     Mudpot  A pool of mud from which gas or vapors issue.  A 0-D basic feature.     National Hydrographic Dataset A collection of digital hydrography files that identify and describe surface water features.  NHD combines USEPA RF3 and USGS DLG files.

Pigtail   An artificial   path basic feature in a 2-D stream/river which connects a tributary  to the main artificial path in the 2-D stream/river.  Pigtails are part of the  same reach defined on the tributary.  Pigtails only exist in wide rivers, not in lake/ponds.     Pipeline  A closed conduit, with pumps, valves, and control devices, for conveying fluids, gases, or finely divided solids.  A 1-D basic feature.     Playa  The flat area at the lowest part of an undrained desert basin, generally devoid of vegetation. A 2-D basic feature.     Polygon   A 2-D object in ARC/INFO that may compose a 2-D basic feature or a portion of a 2-D  basic feature.  Polygons can also exist where there is no 2-D basic feature.     Rapids  An area of swift current in a stream or river, characterized by standing waves or by boulders and rocks.  A 0-D, 1-D, or 2-D basic feature.       Reach  Reaches are sections of streams, lakes, reservoirs, estuaries, etc. that are linked to form a skeletal structure representing the branching patterns of surface water drainage systems. The criterion governing reach delineation is that a reach should end where a significant change in hydrological characteristics occurs, e.g., depth, width, slope, and/or elevation.  This criterion attempts to define reaches with relatively uniform hydrological attributes.     Reach Code    The unique identifier for every reach.  The reach code is an attribute stored in the attribute table in records having an ATTYPE of RCH.  The reach code is a 14 digit number made up of the 8-digit  cataloging unit in which it falls and a sequentially assigned segment number within  the CU.     Reef  A chain of rocks or coral at or near the surface of the water.  A  1-D basic feature.     Relationship     The way in which two features are associated or affiliated.  Relationships between  features are stored in the .REL table.  There are only two possible types of relationships  in the NHD: 'is composed of' where compound features (reaches) are said to be composed of basic features; and 'flows' where reaches are related to each other by means  of their flow.  The ability to navigate up and down through the reach file is accomplished  by means of the flow relationship.   Reservoir  A constructed basin formed to contain water or other liquids.  A  0-D or 2-D basic feature.     RF1  (Reach File 1)  First US digital reach file.  Developed by USEPA in 1982.      RF2  (Reach File 2)  Follow-up to RF1, developed by USEPA in 1988.  Added reaches to RF1 from the GNIS dataset.      RF3  (Reach File 3)  The final reach file, includes data from the 1988 DLG 1:100,000 scale reach data.  The first national hydrographic dataset to support modeling and unique feature identifiers.      RF3'' (RF3 Double Prime)     The dataset representing RF3 in the blind and visual passes.  RF3'' is a hybrid database  that contains reaches, flow attributes, names, level, etc.  RF3'' is incorporated  into the DLGF dataset during the blind and visual pass production processes.  RF3''  is a temporary dataset that only exists during production.       RF3-Alpha   Interim dataset used to produce RF3"".      Rock  A concreted mass of stony material.  A 0-D basic feature.     ROID (Reach Object ID)   The unique internal identifier assigned to all reaches in RF3''.  The ROID is used  as an object identifier to link a reach object to its atttributes in the attribute  table.  The ROID is used in the blind and visual pass to move reaches into the DLGF  data structure, but is not part of the final NHD database.      RTFC (Reach Tile Foid)    A unique internal number assigned to every reach in a quad.  The RTFC is composed  of the quad identifier and a sequentially assigned unique number for each reach.   The RTFC is generated in a post-blind pass production step when all reaches that  conflated to DLGF are given RTFC numbers.  During the visual pass, new RTFC numbers are generated  when manual conflation occurs and when new reaches are added to the dataset.     Sea/Ocean  The great body of salt water that covers much of the earth.  A 2-D basic feature.     Shoreline  A naturally occurring line of contact between a body of water and the land.

Publication Information :     Publication Place :  Washington, DC  Publisher :      U.S. Department of Commerce U.S.Bureau of the Census Geography Division              Description :     Abstract :      1990 Census, Census County Divisions(CCDs).   This data set was extracted from the 2000 TIGER/Line Redistricting File.  The geographic coverage for a single TIGER/Line file is a county or statistical equivalent entity, with the coverage area based on January 1, 2000 legal boundaries.  This data set contains extracts from all of Washington State's 39 Counties.    Purpose :  Statistical enumeration, cartographic display and analysis.  Supplemental Information :      Census County Divisions (CCDs) are areas delineated by the U.S. Census Bureau, in cooperation with state officials and local officials for statistical purposes. CCDs have no legal function and are not governmental units. CCD boundaries usually follow visible features and in most cases, coincide with census tract boundaries. The name of each CCD is based on a place, county, or well-known local name that identifies its location. CCDs exist where:      1)  There are no legally established minor civil divisions (MCDs).  2)   The legally established MCDs do not have governmental or administrative purposes.  3)   The boundaries of the MCDs change frequently.  4)   The MCDs are not generally known to the public.   CCDs have been established for 21 states including Washington.  The Census Bureau continually updates their TIGER Database.  In the update process the points, lines, and polygons are repositioned.  Because of the repositioning of various TIGER line segments the boundaries included may not correspond to those derived from previous versions of the TIGER files.

Publication Information :     Publication Place :  Washington, DC  Publisher :      U.S. Department of Commerce U.S.Bureau of the Census Geography Division              Data Quality Information   Section Index     Attribute Accuracy :     Attribute Accuracy Report :      The data represent boundaries used for enumeration in the 1990 Census.   The Census Bureau check for accuracy against Federal information Processing Standards (FIPS), FIPS Publication 6-4, and FIPS-55 at the 100% level for the codes and base names.  The remaining attribute information has been examined but has not been fully tested for accuracy.  The data represent entities in Washington State only.     Completeness Report :  The data represent the 245 Census County Divisions prepared for State of Washington as of January 1st, 1990.  Positional Accuracy :     Horizontal Positional Accuracy :     Horizontal Positional Accuracy Report :      The information present in these files is provided for the purposes of statistical analysis and census operations only.  Coordinates in the TIGER/Line files have six implied decimal places, but the positional accuracy of these coordinates is not as great as the six decimal places suggest.  The positional accuracy varies with the source materials used, but generally the information is no better than the established national map Accuracy standards for 1:100,000-scale maps from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS); thus it is NOT suitable for high-precision measurement applications such as engineering problems, property transfers, or other uses that might require highly accurate measurements of the earth's surface.  The USGS 1:100,000-scale maps met national map accuracy standards and use coordinates defined by the North American Datum, 1983.  For the contiguous 48 States, the cartographic fidelity of most of the Redistricting Census 2000 TIGER/Line files, in areas outside the 1980 census Geographic Base File/Dual Independent map Encoding (GBF/DIME) file coverage and selected other large metropolitan areas, compare favorable with the USGS 1:100,000-scale maps.  The Census Bureau cannot specify the accuracy of features inside of what was the 1980 GBF/DIME-File coverage or selected metropolitan areas.  The Census Bureau added updates to the TIGER/Line files that enumerators annotated on maps sheets prepared from the Census TIGER data base as they attempted to traverse every street feature shown on the Census 2000 map sheets; the Census Bureau also made other corrections from updated map sheets supplied by local participants for Census Bureau programs.  The locational accuracy of these updates is of unknown quality.  In addition to the Federal, State, and local sources, portions of the files may contain information obtained in part from maps and other materials prepared by private companies.  Despite the fact the TIGER/Line data positional accuracy is not as high as the coordinate values imply, the six-decimal place precision is useful when producing maps.  The precision allows features that are next to each other on the ground to be placed in the correct position, on the map, relative to each other, without overlap.

The 1995 TIGER/Line files are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the Census TIGER data base.  The geographic coverage for a single TIGER/Line  file is a county or statistical equivalent  entity, with the coverage area based on January 1, 1995 legal boundaries.  A  complete set of 1995 TIGER/Line files includes all counties and statistically  equivalent entities in the United States, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Marian Islands, U.S. Minor Outlying Areas,  and the Pacific Island Territories. The Census TIGER data base represents a  seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts.  However, each  county-based TIGER/Line file is designed to stand alone as an independent data  set or the files can be combined to cover the whole Nation and its territories. The 1995 TIGER/Line files consist of line segments representing physical  features and governmental and statistical boundaries.  The files contain  information distributed over a series of record types for the spatial objects  of a county.  There are 17 record types, including the basic data record, the  shape coordinate points, and geographic codes that can be used with appropriate software to prepare maps.  Other geographic information contained in the files  includes attributes such as feature identifiers/census feature class codes  (CFCC) used to differentiate feature types, address ranges and ZIP Codes, codes for legal and statistical entities, latitude/longitude coordinates of linear  and point features, landmark point features, area landmarks, key geographic  features, and area boundaries. The 1995 TIGER/Line data dictionary contains a  complete list of all the fields in the 17 record types.  Purpose: In order for others to use the information in the Census TIGER data  base in a geographic information system (GIS) or for other geographic  applications, the Census Bureau releases to the public extracts of the data  base in the form of TIGER/Line files.  Various versions of the TIGER/Line files have been released; previous versions include the 1990 Census TIGER/Line files  (version 0003), the 1992 TIGER/Line files (version 0005), and the 1994  TIGER/Line files (version 0021). The 1995 (version 0024) TIGER/Line  files were originally produced to support Phase I of the Census 2000 Redistricting Data  Program.  Maintenance_and_Update_Frequency: TIGER/Line files are extracted from the  Census TIGER data base when needed for geographic programs required to support  the census and survey programs of the Census Bureau.  No changes or updates  will be made to the 1995 TIGER/Line files. Future releases of TIGER/Line files  will reflect updates made to the Census TIGER data base and will be released  under a revised version numbering system (based on the month and year the data is extracted).  Data_Quality_Information: Attribute_Accuracy: Attribute_Accuracy_Report: Accurate against Federal Information Processing  Standards (FIPS), FIPS Publication 6-4, and FIPS-55 at the 100% level for the codes and base names. The remaining attribute information has been examined but has not been fully tested for accuracy. Logical_Consistency_Report: The feature network of lines (as represented by  Record Types 1 and 2) is complete for census purposes.  Spatial objects in  TIGER/Line belong to the ""Geometry and Topology""(GT) class of objects in the  ""Spatial Data Transfer Standard"" (SDTS) FIPS Publication 173 and are  topologically valid.  Node/geometry and topology (GT)-polygon/chain  relationships are collected or generated to satisfy topological edit  requirements.  These requirements include:   Complete chains must begin and end at nodes.   Complete chains must connect to each other at nodes.   Complete chains do not extend through nodes.   Left and right GT-polygons are defined for each complete chain element and     are consistent throughout the extract process.   The chains representing the limits of the file are free of gaps. The Census Bureau performed automated tests to ensure logical consistency and limits of files.  All polygons are tested for closure.  Some polygons in  the TIGER/Line files may be so small that the polygon internal point has been manually placed on a node that defines the polygon perimeter.  These small polygons have been detected, and corrections will be incorporated in the Census TIGER data base in the future.  The Census Bureau uses its internally developed Geographic Update System to enhance and modify spatial and attribute data in  the Census TIGER data base.  Standard geographic codes, such as FIPS codes for  states, counties, municipalities, and places, are used when encoding spatial  entities. The Census Bureau performed spatial data tests for logical consistency of the codes during the compilation of the original Census TIGER data base  files.  Most of the codes themselves were provided to the Census Bureau by the  USGS, the agency responsible for maintaining FIPS 55.  Feature attribute  information has been examined but has not been fully tested for consistency. Completeness_Report: Data completeness of the TIGER/Line files reflects the  contents of the Census TIGER data base at the time the TIGER/Line files (1995  version) were created. Positional_Accuracy: Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy: Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: The information present in these files is provided for the purposes of  statistical analysis and census operations only.  Coordinates in the TIGER/Line files have six implied decimal places, but the positional accuracy of these  coordinates is not as great as the six decimal places suggest. The positional  accuracy varies with the source materials used, but generally the information is no better than the established National Map Accuracy standards for  1:100,000-scale maps from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS); thus it is NOT  suitable for high-precision measurement applications such as engineering  problems, property transfers, or other uses that might require highly accurate  measurements of the earth's surface. The USGS 1:100,000-scale maps meet national map accuracy standards and use coordinates defined by the North American Datum, 1983. For the contiguous 48 States, the cartographic fidelity of most of the  1995 TIGER/Line files, in areas outside the 1980 census Geographic Base  File/Dual Independent Map Encoding (GBF/DIME) file coverage and selected other  large metropolitan areas, compare favorably with the USGS 1:100,000-scale maps. The Census Bureau cannot specify the accuracy of features inside of what was the 1980 GBF/DIME-Files coverage or selected metropolitan areas.  The Census Bureau  added updates to the TIGER/Line files that enumerators annotated on map sheets  prepared from the Census TIGER data base as they attempted to traverse every  street feature shown on the 1990 census map sheets; the Bureau also made other  corrections from updated map sheets supplied by local participants for Census  Bureau programs.  The locational accuracy of these updates is of unknown  quality.  In addition to the Federal, State, and local sources, portions of the  files may contain information obtained in part from maps and other materials  prepared by private companies.  Despite the fact that TIGER/Line data positional  accuracy is not as high as the coordinates values imply, the six-decimal place  precision is useful when producing maps.  The precision allows features that are next to each other on the ground to be placed in the correct position, on the  map, relative to each other, without overlap.  Entity_and_Attribute_Information: Overview_Description: Entity_and_Attribute_Overview: The TIGER/Line files contain data describing three major types of  features/entities; Line Features -  1) Roads  2) Railroads  3) Hydrography  4) Miscellaneous transportation features and selected power lines and pipe      lines   5) Political and statistical boundaries  Landmark Features -  1) Point landmarks, e.g., schools and churches.  2) Area landmarks, e.g., Parks and cemeteries.  3) Key geographic locations (KGLs), e.g., apartment buildings and factories. Polygon features -  1) Geographic entity codes for areas used to tabulate the 1990 census      statistical data and current geographic areas   2) Locations of area landmarks  3) Locations of KGLs  The line features and polygon information form the majority of data in the  TIGER/Line files. Some of the data/attributes describing the lines include  coordinates, feature identifiers (names), CFCCs (used to identify the most  noticeable characteristic of a feature), address ranges, and geographic entity codes.  The TIGER/Line files contain point and area labels that describe  landmarks features and provide locational reference.  Area landmarks consist of a feature name or label and feature type assigned to a polygon or group of  polygons.  Landmarks may overlap or refer to the same set of polygons.  The Census TIGER data base relates information to points or  0-cells, lines or  1-cells, and polygons or 2-cells.  The number preceding the cell identifies the dimensionality of the objects; for instance, a line segment has a single  dimension, length.  Each of these objects build on the others to form  higher-level objects. The 0-cells form the end points of 1-cells.  The 1-cells connect at 0-cells and form closed figures that partition space into polygons or 2-cells.  The spatial objects in TIGER/Line files embody both geometry (coordinate  location and shape) and topology (the relationship between points, lines  objects, and polygons) and therefore belong to the ""Geometry and Topology"" (GT) class of objects in the SDTS.  In the SDTS, nodes represent point objects  (0-cells) that identify the start and end position of lines or 1-dimensional  objects (1-cells) called chains.  The chains in the TIGER/Line files are  complete chains because they form GT-polygon boundaries and intersect other  chains only at nodes.  Topological chains that do not contain polygon  information are network chains used to form GT-rings.  Data users may choose not to use GT-polygon or geographic entity codes and consider the TIGER/Line files a source of network chain data.  The TIGER/Line files contain point landmark data that are not included in the Census TIGER data base topology.  Point landmarks are entity points that mark the location of points of interest and are not connected to complete chains or  GT-polygons.  A polygon identification code is used to link a landmark to a  GT-polygon."

OGRIP sponsored the study, known as the Ohio Digital  Orthophotography Project (ODOP), to establish a statewide plan for orthophoto  mapping. The goal of ODOP is to present a planning tool that will help guide the  orthophoto mapping efforts of county and municipal organizations in Ohio. By  following a common approach in the acquisition of orthophotography, local level  agencies can satisfy their own requirements and contribute to a consistent  geographic information framework for the entire state.   The recommendations set forth in this report concentrate on the geographic  information needs of county and local level organizations in Ohio with respect  to orthophoto mapping. Orthophotography requirements for regional, state, and  federal organizations will largely be met through the National Digital  Orthophotography Program (NDOP) state-federal partnership that has been  established in Ohio. Under this program, 1”=1,000’ (1:12,000 scale) Digital  Orthophoto (Quarter) Quadrangle (DOQ) coverage for the entire state will be  generated by the end of 1998. The geographic information needs of county and  municipal organizations will require more accurate, larger scale orthophoto  coverage than will be generated under NDOP. Nevertheless, until the large scale  orthophotography coverage suggested in this document is realized, the NDOP will  produce the most current, most accurate statewide map base available in Ohio.  Because the needs of regional and state agencies are reflected in the NDOP  initiative, the ODOP effort has focused on the requirements of county and  municipal level organizations.   It is impossible in a broad study such as ODOP, to accommodate the specific  orthophotography requirements of every local level organization in the state.  Moreover, the recommendations are general in nature and do not reflect technical  details such as aerial photography specifications, production methods, geodetic  control requirements, and digital elevation model accuracy and so on.  Nevertheless, the guidelines set forth in this report provide an objectively  determined rationale for orthophoto mapping in Ohio’s counties. Of course,  organizations are not compelled to follow these recommendations. However, it is  hoped the wisdom of conforming to a common approach will be sufficient  justification for many local level agencies to voluntarily adopt the ODOP  guideline. By cooperating in a coherent plan for large scale orthophotography,  county and local organizations can satisfy their own requirements and contribute  to a geographic information framework that will benefit the entire state.   The ODOP study was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, several Ohio  organizations were contacted to discover their orthophotography and geographic  information requirements. The purpose of this part of the study was to uncover  the orthophotography applications and requirements of wide range of  organizations in Ohio. Insight gained from this needs assessment study was then  used to develop recommendations for orthophoto mapping in Ohio, which was the  focus of the second phase of the ODOP study.   The present document constitutes the final report for the ODOP study and thus  incorporates information from both the needs assessment and guideline phases.  After a brief introduction to orthophotography, the various uses and needs for  orthophotography in Ohio are presented. This discussion also presents general  recommendations concerning the kind of orthophotography that should be acquired  in the state. The final two sections set forth the rationale for specific  orthophotography coverage recommendations on a county by county basis.  Individual maps showing the resulting county suggestions are provided in  Appendix 1. A copy of the document generated for the first phase of the study  has been reproduced as Appendix 6 of this report.   INTRODUCTION TO  ORTHOPHOTOGRAPHY   An orthophoto is an aerial photograph that has the geometric properties of a  map. Thus, orthophotographs can be used as maps to make measurements and  establish accurate geographic locations of features. Orthophotos are generated  from aerial photographs through a process known as orthorectification. A normal  (that is, unrectified) aerial photograph does not show features in their correct  locations due to displacements caused by the tilt of the camera and terrain  relief (see Figure 1). Orthorectification transforms the central projection of  the photograph into an orthogonal view of the ground, thereby removing the  distorting affects of tilt and terrain relief as shown in Figure 2.     Generation of an orthophoto map from an aerial photograph requires  information on the location of the camera and its orientation in space as well  as a model of the terrain elevation. If the terrain is very flat, then ground  elevation data may not be required. In such situations, orthophoto maps can be  produced by a process called simple (perspective) rectification that only  removes the effect of tilt. However in most cases, it necessary to perform the  more involved orthorectification process to obtain an accurate map.     Orthophoto maps are relatively inexpensive to produce and provide more data  than conventional line maps. Since they do not require as much time and effort  to produce as traditional maps, orthophotos represent a good way to obtain and  maintain up-to- date geographic information. Orthophoto maps do not contain many  of the non-visible features and attributes, such as political boundaries, street  names and route numbers, place names and address ranges, that often appear on  map documents. Nevertheless, orthophotography is a good foundation upon which to  assemble and represent these kinds of spatial data from various sources.  Applications for orthophotography include a broad range of activities such as  parcel mapping and tax assessment, infrastructure management, resource analysis,  drainage studies, and E-911 operations mapping.   Many ortho mapping projects today involve the creation of digital  orthoimagery which can be displayed and manipulated in a computer. Instead of a  hard copy photographic map document, a digital ortho is a computer data file  consisting of a collection of numbers. Each number represents the brightness  (photographic gray tone) of a small patch of the ground. The numbers for these  small patches are displayed on a computer screen as square cells called  “pixels.” The ground size of this patch (or pixel) is the resolution of the  digital orthophoto. For example, 1 meter resolution means that each pixel in the  image roughly corresponds to a square patch on the ground that is 1 meter on a  side. Digital orthophotography today is typically produced by scanning  conventional film-based aerial photographs. The resulting digital photographs  are then transformed in a computer into an orthorectified image map. It is  likely that satellite sources will become an increasingly important source of  data for orthophoto mapping.   It is important to note that digital orthos are not GIS databases; they are  collections of pixels that may require further processing to obtain useful  spatial information to support decision making. For example, extracting the road  network centerlines from the orthoimage (as shown in Figure 3) can be time  consuming, difficult work.     The most significant characteristics of orthophotography that affect its use  and value are scale * , accuracy and resolution. In the case of hard copy  orthophotos scale largely determines accuracy and resolution. What can be seen  in the imagery (resolution) and how accurately features can be located on the  ground are direct functions of the final representation scale. Digital  orthophotos can, in principle, be displayed at any scale one chooses. But, the  resolution (pixel size) limits what features can be seen and the accuracy  defines how correctly those features can be located on the ground. By  convention, whether digital or conventional hard copy, the larger the scale of  the ortho, the better its resolution and accuracy. Because of the close  connection between scale, accuracy, and resolution, scale is typically the  single, most important parameter in setting orthophoto mapping  specifications.   There are, of course, many other technical characteristics that users need to  consider when undertaking an orthophoto mapping project. Most of these factors,  geodetic control, flying height, and photogrammetric methods for example, depend  on the final scale, resolution and accuracy desired. Other significant choices  the user must make include the format (digital or hard copy) and whether black  and white or color orthophotography is needed.   ORTHOPHOTO NEEDS IN  OHIO   This section presents results from the needs assessment phase of the ODOP  study. The purpose of this part of the study was to discover the  orthophotography requirementsof a broad range of users of geographic information  in Ohio. A copy of the preliminary report for the first phase is reproduced in  Appendix 6.   The investigation in this phase of the ODOP study was based on a series of  conversations with individuals from a variety of organizations in Ohio. During  the interviews, individuals were asked to describe the geographic information  and orthophotography requirements of their organizations. Although the survey  was hardly exhaustive, the organizations contacted (see list provided in  Appendix 4) constitute a fairly broad and representative cross section of GIS  data users in the state. It is likely, therefore, that the information gleaned  from these contacts provides a good indication of the orthophoto mapping needs  in Ohio.   Uses for  Orthophotography   It is apparent there is a wide variety of experience with orthophotography in  Ohio. Some users are sophisticated and have well-developed applications for  their orthophoto map coverage. Others are just beginning to explore the  possibility of implementing GIS in their organizations and may not fully  understand orthophotography and its value. Several specific applications for  orthophotography coverage were identified by the organizations contacted in this  study. The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) intends to use 1:12,000  (1”=1000’) scale DOQs produced under the NDOP in the process of converting soil  survey information into digital form. The DOQs serve as the basis for accurately  georeferencing the digitized soil maps. Ohio’s Department of Natural Resources  plans to use DOQs to map the roads and other facilities for which it is  responsible. DOQs can be employed by electric utilities in mapping power  transmission facilities. However, since its physical facilities can span several  states, availability of uniform coverage for a single state may fail to fully  meet a utility’s needs.   At the regional level, orthophotography can be employed by planning  organizations to support land use modeling and forecasting activities. County  emergency management agencies use orthophotos for E-911 mapping and can use them  on an operational basis to support fire and police dispatching. Another  significant application for orthophoto mapping in Ohio is determination of  Current Agricultural Use Value (CAUV), a program aimed at retaining agricultural  land by providing tax relief to farmers.   The dominant reason for acquiring orthophotography in Ohio, especially at the  county level, is modernization of land records for property appraisal. County  engineers and auditors obtain orthophotography to create and maintain accurate  parcel maps that are used by auditors in assessing the value of real estate. In  many countywide tax mapping projects, orthophotography is the geographic  foundation upon which data from various sources (existing tax maps, plats, and  deeds) are combined to produce computerized parcel maps. Orthophotos are used in  a similar way to update and maintain digital tax maps once they have been  established. Property assessors also use orthophotography in the appraisal  process to analyze characteristics (such as driveway quality, decks, in-ground  pools and landscaping) that influence the value of a parcel. Orthophotography  acquired for tax mapping purposes is often tapped by county engineers and  municipal agencies for drainage analyses, preliminary road design,  infrastructure mapping and other applications.   Orthophotography  Requirements   It is apparent that many different kinds of orthophotography coverage will be  necessary to meet the needs of the various applications discussed above. A  county or municipal agency will typically require very accurate, large-scale  orthophotos over a small area while the needs of state or federal agency can be  met with less accurate, smaller scale coverage that spans the entire state.  Factors that were of concern (at least implicitly) to organizations contacted in  the ODOP study included the following:       Cost     Coverage area     Scale     Resolution (ground size of pixels in digital orthos)     Timeliness (date of imagery, repeat coverage)     Spatial accuracy and image quality     Format (digital vs. hard copy and computer file structure)     Storage and processing requirements (especially for digital orthos)     Source imagery (camera, film, and sensor characteristics, and image    scale)     Mapping units (file or sheet size and geographic extent)     Geographic reference system (projection, datum, and units)     Digital elevation model (DEM)     Geodetic control   Several of these items were important because of their connection to other  factors. For example, whether or not an organization cares about geodetic  control it is, nonetheless, a critical issue in an orthophoto mapping project.  Of course, cost was the major concern for users contacted in the study. After  cost, organizations absolutely require orthophoto maps that cover the geographic  area in which they are interested.   The single technical factor that limits and defines virtually all other  requirements in orthophotography use and production is the scale of coverage.  Since scale largely prescribes the accuracy and resolution of the  orthophotography, it strongly influences how it is produced. Thus, issues  ranging from the characteristics of the source imagery (film, camera, flying  height, satellite sensor) to photogrammetric methods, elevation modeling, and  geodetic control requirements are affected by the choice of scale. Most of the  organizations contacted in this study (with the exception of mapping firms) were  not very concerned with the various technical implications from the scale chosen  for an orthophoto mapping project. In fact, very few organizations could  identify precise requirements concerning the accuracy, resolution and other  characteristics of the orthophotography for their applications. From the user’s  perspective then, scale is the major factor of interest in setting  orthophotography requirements.   Organizations interested  in statewide coverage preferred relatively small-scale orthophotography. In  general 1:12,000 DOQs, which have 1 meter pixel resolution and are accurate to  about 33 feet, will satisfy the needs of federal and state agencies in Ohio.  Larger scale, higher resolution digital orthophotography might even be less  useful to these organizations. The reason is that with better resolution and  larger scales, the volume of data increases significantly too which can pose  problems when handling and processing orthophotography on a statewide basis.  Moreover, the higher accuracy of larger scale data is not needed.   Planning agencies have a regional scope of interest and seem to make use of  whatever spatial data that are available and affordable. As a consequence, they  use data of varying scales and accuracies, ranging from 1:100,000 to 1:4,800. In  at least one transportation planning context where housing counts and building  sizes must be accurately measured, aerial photography at a scale of 1:4,800  (1”=400) was employed. Therefore, for organizations with a regional focus,  orthophotography scales from 1:12,000 to 1:4,800 should be adequate.   At the county level in Ohio orthophotography coverage is acquired primarily  for tax mapping. Typical scales ranged from 1:4,800 (1”=400’) in rural counties  to 1”=100’ (1:1,200) scale in urban counties. In densely populated, urban areas  1:1,200 (1”=100’) scale coverage is common. In the case of digital  orthophotography, pixel resolutions of 1/2 to 1 foot are typical for these  areas. Whether digital or hard copy, the achievable accuracy for these maps is  typically in the neighborhood of 1 to 3 feet. Orthophotography for tax mapping  in Ohio’s rural counties was no smaller than 1”=400’ (1:4,800) scale. The  spatial accuracy of such coverage is roughly 13 feet with pixel resolutions of 1  to 2 feet. Often, countywide 1:4,800 scale orthophotography was supplemented  with 1”=200’ or 1”=100’ coverage for cities, villages, and other areas of  interest (such as airports, interstate highway interchanges, and scenic river  corridors). The resolution of the 1”=200’ scale orthophotography is about 1 foot  with achievable accuracies in the range of 3-7 feet.   Where large scale (1:1,200 and greater) orthophotography is obtained, it can  fulfill many of the operational and primary information source needs of other  agencies.   For urban infrastructure applications it is desirable to be able to see 6”  valve covers and manhole covers so that very high resolution (6” pixels and  larger) data are desired. Maps at scales of 1”=50’ (1:600) are often sought by  city engineers and officials working at the municipal level.   Other organizations will take advantage of whatever orthophotography data are  available. Emergency management agencies, for example, would like to be able to  see the front porch of a house but can accept and use orthoimagery at  1:12,000-scale as an operational tool in their day-to-day work. In building and  maintaining E-911 systems, the imagery must enable individuals to identify  individual houses so that scales smaller than 1:4,800 and ground resolutions  worse than 2 foot pixels are not acceptable. Planners, foresters and soil  scientists can generally utilize orthophoto data at scales of 1:12,000.   The foregoing discussion of requirements with respect to scale, resolution  and accuracy is summarized Table 1. From the table, it is clear that a range of  scales is necessary to meet the needs of the various users of orthophotography  in Ohio. In particular, orthophoto scales ranging from 1:4,800 up to 1:1,200 are  needed to support tax mapping activities at the county level.     After cost and scale, the timeliness of the data was very important. In at  least one situation, it was deemed important to acquire photography for the  entire study area at precisely one time. High resolution, large-scale  orthoimagery obtained over a span of two years was not acceptable. There are  situations where older data may be important, to identifying changes over time,  but most users prefer data that are as up-to-date as practical. Another aspect  of timeliness concerns the season in which the source imagery is acquired. Users  interested in vegetation will prefer summer flights while for general mapping  purposes “leaf off” aerial photography acquired in the fall or spring (before or  after snow cover) during the middle of the day (high sun angle) is preferred.  For county tax mapping applications, leaf off, high sun angle imagery was  typical.   The recent trend among the counties contacted was to obtain digital  orthophotography as opposed to conventional orthophoto maps on mylar. In fact, a  county lacking sophisticated GIS capability even opted for delivery of digital  orthophotos. Until the ability to use the computerized orthos is obtained, the  organization can use hard copy documents generated by their vendor. Counties  that had acquired hard copy orthophotography at one time are updating it with  digital coverage. Of course, NDOP, 1:12,000 DOQ data sought by state and federal  agencies is in digital form. Digital orthoimagery does offer several advantages  over traditional physical orthophoto map documents. Exact duplicates of the data  can be made, distributed and used without degrading or jeopardizing the original  copy. Digital imagery can be viewed and analyzed on a computer and thus can be  more extensively and effectively used than a hard copy map. On the other hand,  hard copy orthophotography does not require any investment in computer systems  just to view the data. In addition, storage and distribution of digital  orthophotography can be troublesome due to the large data volumes involved.  However, the technology required to view, analyze, store and distribute digital  orthophotos is becoming more affordable and available. And, it is likely that  geographic information in general, and orthophoto data in particular, will  increasingly come from digital sources. For these reasons, it is quite likely  that virtually all future orthophoto mapping in Ohio will soon be in digital  form.   Users for the most part, did not express much interest in the specific file  format and structure for their digital data. There are many different image file  formats to chose from when storing, using, and transferring digital  orthophotography. As a consequence, problems may be encountered when the data  are transferred among different software packages running on various hardware  platforms. In order to minimize these difficulties, organizations should strive  to acquire and use orthophotography in “democratic” file formats. One very  commonly used, publicly available (non-proprietary), format that most systems  can read and write is the Tagged Image File Format (TIFF).   Several users indicated that black and white orthophotography was adequate  for their applications. However, at least two counties in Ohio have acquired  color orthophotography. The reason may be that color photography is more readily  understood and appreciated by the public. While color imagery is more  aesthetically pleasing than black and white photography and can provide more  data for interpretation and analysis, it is more expensive to produce and (in  the case of digital data) triples the data volume. Other users interested in  soils and vegetation may prefer orthophotography based on black and white  infrared, color, or color infrared source imagery. In most county tax mapping  situations, black and white data should suffice. In any case, digital  orthophotography was typically represented using 256 gray levels (8 bits) per  band.   With the notable exception of the federal Department of Agriculture, most of  the organizations contacted preferred data on the Ohio State Plane Coordinate  System (OSPCS) projection using the U.S. survey foot as the base unit. (This  last fact may explain the prevalence of scales 1:1,200, 1:2,400, . . .,  1:12,000, 1:24,000 and the complete absence of metric scales of 1:5,000,  1:10,000 and so on.) However, state agencies may be under federal mandates to  use metric units and may prefer metric mapping. The geodetic datum, whether NAD  27 or NAD 83 did not seem to be a significant issue but most organizations  described orthophotography projects on the newer datum.   Digital elevation models  (DEMs) are an integral component of orthophoto mapping. However, DEMs produced  for orthorectification are generally not suitable for other applications, such  as contour interpolation or earth volume computations. Of course, DEMs of  sufficient accuracy for these applications can be created as part of an  orthophoto project and used in the rectification process. In this case, there  will be a significant increase in the cost of the orthophotography attributable  to the enhanced DEM. Unless accurate elevation data are specifically desired, it  is usually not necessary to undergo the added expense of generating high quality  DEMs for orthophoto production.   Other items in the list above were noted by only a few of the organizations  contacted in the study. Principal decisions made by users concentrated on scale  (and hence accuracy and resolution), timeliness (when to acquire coverage), and  format (digital or hard copy). For the most part organizations, especially at  the county level, tended to defer to their vendors or consultants in  establishing specifications for their orthophoto mapping endeavors.   Recommendations   From the foregoing discussion of requirements, it is possible to distill  several general recommendations concerning future orthophoto mapping projects in  Ohio. These recommendations are set forth in the following list.                   Format       Digital orthophotography; TIFF file format.           Timeliness       Current, leaf-off, high sun angle imagery to        satisfy general mapping requirements           Source imagery       Black and white imagery, 256 (8 bit) gray levels        per band           Geographic        reference system*       Datum: North American Datum 1983 (1986)         Projection: Ohio State Plane Coordinate System  Units: U.S. Survey        Feet   ORTHOPHOTOGRAPHY COVERAGE PLAN FOR  OHIO   As noted above, scale is the principal factor of interest to organizations in  setting their orthophotography requirements. The accuracy and resolution of the  data are fairly well established once the project scale is chosen. In this  section, specific recommendations as to where various scales of orthophotography  coverage are needed in Ohio. Since the needs of federal, state, and regional  organizations will be largely met through NDOP and the resulting 1:12,000 DOQ  data, the following suggestions focus on orthophotography requirements at the  county level. More specifically, they are aimed at satisfying the needs of the  parcel mapping community. Orthophotography coverage scales contemplated under  this plan range from 1:1,200 in cities to 1:4,800 for rural areas.   To develop a detailed orthophoto mapping plan it was necessary to adopt a  tiling system to partition Ohio into map units of manageable size. This tiling  system is based on the Ohio State Plane Coordinate System (OSPCS) and is  described in Appendix 2. Under this plan, individual map tiles are square blocks  ranging from 10,000’ to 2,500’ feet on a side and correspond to the three  coverage scales as shown in Table 2. These blocks comprised the basic mapping  units in which the coverage plan was developed.     There are no formal widely-used standards for parcel mapping and,  consequently, no guidelines for the underlying orthophotography. Densely settled  urban counties are typically mapped with large scale (that is, 1”=100’)  orthophotography coverage. A good deal of the land in such territory is covered  by man-made structures, buildings and roads. Land values are relatively high  and, therefore, parcel sizes tend to be small. Development tends to occur in or  near these built-up regions. By contrast, orthophotography for rural counties is  usually 1”=400’ (1:4,800) scale, with larger scale coverage 1”=200’ or 1”=100’  for the cities and towns. Rural areas in Ohio are characterized by agricultural  and forested land, low population densities, relatively large parcel sizes and  minimal development activity. Cities, villages and other settlements located in  rural territory possess essentially the same characteristics--small parcels,  higher land values, and built-up landscapes--as urban centers. Therefore, it is  reasonable to acquire 1”=100’ scale orthophotos for the urban portions of rural  counties.   Between the extremes of urban (built-up) and rural territory, there are  regions near urban centers that are undergoing significant growth and  development. These areas change fairly rapidly as agricultural or forested lands  are transformed to residential, commercial, industrial and other uses.  Orthophotography coverage for regions likely to undergo development in the near  future is a good foundation for keeping track of and mapping information as  changes occur on the landscape. For this reason, 1”=200’ scale coverage should  be acquired for such territory. More expensive, larger scale (1”=100’) coverage  in such areas is not justified until the anticipated development actually  occurs.   One potential objective basis for deciding orthophotography coverage scale is  parcel size. In areas with small parcels, lots with as little as 30’ frontage,  1”=100’ scale orthoimagery is appropriate. A lot with a 30’ frontage will be  less than 5/16” wide on a 1”=100’ (1:1,200) map. Moreover, the 1-3’ accuracy is  a significant fraction of the parcel’s dimension. Less expensive 1”=200’  orthophotography coverage is sufficient in locations where lots are no smaller  than 60’ wide. In rural areas, where parcels are generally an acre or more in  size, 1:4,800 (1”=400’) orthophotography is adequate. A one acre square parcel  will be more than 1/2” in size on a 1”=400 (1:4,800) map and the 10-15’ accuracy  would be no more than about 7% of the parcel’s dimension. These ideas are  summarized in Table 3. There are many other factors (beyond parcel size) that  influence decisions concerning orthoimagery coverage. Particular natural or  cultural features, such as a scenic river, airport or industrial development  site may warrant larger scale, more accurate coverage than the surrounding  landscape.     The foregoing discussion can be distilled into the following recommendation  for orthophotography coverage in Ohio.       Agricultural, forested, and non-urban land in rural areas 1”=400’     Suburban territory and areas about to undergo development 1”=200’     Urban centers and cities and villages in rural areas 1”=100’   Decisions concerning orthophoto mapping scales will be influenced by the  amount of money available and the uses and may deviate significantly from these  recommendations. A rural county may opt for uniform orthophotography coverage at  1”=400’ because it can not afford larger scale coverage for its towns and  villages. While 1”=100’ orthos may be optimal for a rural county seat, 1”=200’  coverage be the best that can be afforded. On the other hand, a non-urban county  may decide to acquire 1”=200’ or 1”=100’ scale coverage because it can afford  the cost and can justify the applications for which it will be used.   To more directly guide the acquisition of orthophotography in Ohio, the ODOP  effort developed a statewide coverage plan for local government. The goal of the  plan is to provide county and local organizations with an indication of the  scales of orthophoto mapping appropriate for their regions. In particular, a  detailed map for each county in the state was generated and included in this  report in Appendix 1. Each of these maps shows the specific 1”=100’ (2,500’ x  2,500’), 1”=200 (5,000’ x 5,000’), and 1”=400’ (10,000’ x 10,000’) map tiles  that the county will require to satisfy the orthophotography coverage  recommendations set forth above. Generation of these orthophoto coverage  recommendation maps was based on a fairly simple spatial model based on data  from the U.S. Census Bureau. A complete description of the modeling process used  to produce the county recommendations is provided in the next section.   While the model provides a good indication of where the various scales of  digital orthophotography are appropriate in Ohio, it is based on a fairly  general analysis of Census data. There are probably some areas for which the  model does not yield very good results. For this reason, it is very important to  note that the results should be viewed as a preliminary indication of the kind  of orthophotography coverage a county should acquire. The maps in Appendix 1 are  a good starting point from which a more detailed analysis--based knowledge of  local geography, demographics, development trends and mapping needs--of  orthophotography requirements be undertaken.   ORTHOPHOTOGRAPHY COVERAGE PLAN  MODEL   This section of the report describes how the orthophoto coverage plan maps in  Appendix 1 were produced. A fairly simple model, based on geographic and  demographic information from the U.S. Bureau of the Census, was used to generate  the actual orthophotography coverage plan for Ohio. The aim of this process was  to define the regions for which the three recommended orthophotography scales  (1”=100’, 1”=200’, and 1”=400’) are appropriate.   The spatial model consisted of two parts and took into account urban and  rural geography, population, housing, and other factors. In addition, the model  reflected anticipated population growth by county from the 1990 Census through  the year 2005. The first phase of the model determined the areas in Ohio where  1:1,200 (1”=100’) orthophotography coverage is needed and the second step  identified locations where 1”=200’ (1:2,400) and 1”=400’ (1:4,800) coverage  should be acquired. Results from the two analyses were then combined to obtain a  statewide coverage plan that incorporated all three of the recommended  orthophotography scales--1”=100’ (1:1,200), 1”=200’ (1:2,400), and 1”=400’  (1:4,800). Several  maps   were produced to provide reference information and to illustrate the results of  the modeling process.  These  maps are included at the end of this section . Words that appear in italics  are technical terms used by the U.S. Bureau of the Census and are explained in  more detail in Appendix 5.   Population Growth in  Ohio   An important factor in deciding the proper scale for orthophotography  coverage is the extent to which an area will undergo significant growth and  development in the near future. For this reason, population growth was used as a  parameter in the modeling. Population projections by county and year were  obtained from the  Ohio Department of  Development’s web page  (http://www.ohiobiz.com/globe/research/article6.htm).  Since orthophoto mapping will need to be updated frequently, 2005 was chosen as  the final year for the growth projection. And, because 1990 Census data are  being used in the analysis, 1990 was selected as the base year.   These data were used to produce the  map  entitled, “Population  Growth,” that reflects county population change between 1990 and 2005.  Projections were classed into low (less than 4%), moderate (between 4 and 12%),  and high (more than 12%) growth counties. Note that many counties in Ohio will  grow very little between 1990 and 2005; in fact several counties will actually  lose population according to the projections. While some of increases in the  high growth counties involve small numbers of people, the impact of a 12% change  is, nevertheless, significant.   Locating 1:1,200 Orthophotography  Coverage   Large-scale (1”=100’) orthophotography is appropriate for densely settled,  urban areas that have relatively high population densities, small land parcels  and high land values. A reasonable description of such territory in Ohio is  provided by the U.S. Census Bureau’s classification of urban/rural geography.  For this reason, a map of urban territory based on the  1995 TIGER/Line® Files  *  was chosen as the basis for locating where 1”=100’ scale orthophotography  coverage is required in the state. Some smaller, yet fairly densely settled  places may not be included in the urban areas. Since they should also be mapped  at 1”=100’ scale, the urban areas were merged with places to produce the map entitled “Urban Areas and  Places .” Regions where the urban and place categories overlap were treated  as urban in the subsequent analysis.   The extent of the urban areas and places was then expanded to reflect the  fact that most of the growth and development since the 1990 census probably is  and, will likely continue to be, in the vicinity of urban territory and places.  As shown in the  “Sphere of  Influence Model” map , boundaries of the urban areas and places were expanded  by different distances depending on the projected growth in population. In high  growth counties (expected to increase 12% or more between 1990 and 2005), the  boundary of the urban territory was extended by a 3 mile buffer while boundaries  of places (not part of urban territory) were only expanded a distance of 0.75  miles. The distances by which the boundaries of the urban areas and places were  buffered in the low and moderate growth counties (less than 4% and 4-12% between  1990 and 2005, respectively) are provided in Table 4.     The urban area and places were “buffered” in accordance with the values in  Table 4 and the results combined to produce the final “Sphere of Influence  Model” map. Shaded areas on this map represent the land in Ohio that should be  mapped with 1”=100’ (1:1,200) digital orthophotography. Since the shaded area on  the map encompasses the territory designated as urban by the Census Bureau, the  balance of the state is therefore, rural. For this reason, the unshaded areas on  the “Sphere of Influence Model” map were tentatively labeled for coverage at  1:4,800 (1”=400) scale.   Locating 1:2,400 and 1:4,800  Orthophotography Coverage   Small-scale (1:4,800) orthophotography is adequate for rural areas with  relatively low population density, large parcels and low land values. Suburban  areas with moderately sized parcels and territory near urban centers likely to  undergo development in the near future are good candidates for 1”=200’ (1:2,400)  orthophotography. Census tract data pertaining to housing unit and population  density, aggregate value (single family housing units), and method of sewage  disposal were chosen as the basis for determining where 1:2,400 scale coverage  is appropriate. Population and housing density relate to how built-up an area is  and the aggregate value provides an indication of the relative value of land  parcels. The method of sewage disposal is an indicator of growth because sewer  access influences where new development can occur.   Tract level data from the 1990  Census of Population  and Housing Summary Tape Files 1A and 3A *  were linked to a map of census  tract boundaries derived from the 1995 TIGER/Line® Files for Ohio. Population  count, housing unit count, and aggregate value figures by tract were divided by  tract land area to obtain areal averages. Because sewage information comes from  sample data, a “percent sewers” value was calculated by dividing the public  sewer item by the sum of the three disposal methods--public sewer, septic tank  or cesspool, and other means. As a result, population and housing unit density  information, together with the average per square mile housing unit values and  percent sewer figures by census tract were generated.   These derived data were then analyzed and compared with well-formulated  orthophotography coverage plans for a few counties (Delaware, Franklin, and  Licking) to come up with threshold criteria for deciding whether a particular  census tract should be mapped with 1:2,400 (1”=200’) orthophotography. Tracts in  high and moderate growth counties, should be mapped at 1”=200’ if any three of  the following conditions are satisfied:       Housing unit density > 50 per square mile     Population density > 100 per square mile     Aggregate value > $1,000,000 per square mile     Percent sewers > 30%   Otherwise, 1”=400’ (1:4,800) orthophotography is adequate for the particular  census tract. For tracts located in low growth counties (less than 4% growth  between 1990 and 2005), 1:2,400 (1”=200’) orthoimagery should be acquired if any  three of the following conditions are met:       Housing unit density > 100 per square mile     Population density > 200 per square mile     Aggregate value > $2,000,000     Percent sewers > 50%   Thus for low growth counties, if any two of these conditions are not met,  then 1:4,800 (1”=400) orthophoto mapping is appropriate. Four maps indicating  where these criteria are independently satisfied are provided in a sheet  labeled,  “Census Tract  Analysis Model.”  A final map, also labeled “Census Tract Analysis Model,”  shows the respective tracts where the 1:2,400 criteria are met and those tracts  that default to 1:4,800 (where two or fewer conditions are met). Urban areas are  also shown on this map for reference purposes and will be mapped at 1:1,200  scale.   Combined Model--Digital  Orthophoto Plan   The maps representing the “Sphere of Influence Model” (used to locate 1”=100’  coverage) and the “Census Tract Analysis Model” (used to locate 1”=200’ and  1”=400’ orthophotography) were combined to develop the final digital orthophoto  plan. Any location where the two models were in conflict were resolved by  choosing the larger scale coverage. Thus, for example, if the sphere of  influence model indicated 1:1,200 scale and the census tract model showed  1:2,400 scale for a particular area, 1:1,200 orthophotography was selected.     To make the digital orthophoto plan more useful to county and local level  organizations, the results of the combined model were “gridded” according to the  10,000’, 5,000’, and 2,500’ square blocks of the tiling system (Appendix 2). In  this way, specific map sheets and scales were identified to generate the  individual county plans provided in Appendix 1. A map entitled, “Digital  Orthophoto Plan” shows the final scale recommendations for Ohio. Imposing the  2,500’, 5,000’, and 10,000’ tiles on the combined model generally increased the  areas of 1:1,200 and 1:2,400 orthophotography coverage. This effect is  illustrated in Figure 3 and arises from the decision to avoid multi-scale  coverage for a single location.        CONCLUSION   The investigation of orthophotography in Ohio and the recommendations  presented in this report have focused primarily on the needs of county level  organizations. In particular, the digital orthophoto plan addressed the  orthophotography needs of the tax mapping community. Of course, many of the  requirements of other county and local level organizations will also be met with  coverage specifically generated for tax appraisal. The reason for this focus is  the fact that many of the orthophotography requirements of regional, state and  federal agencies will be met as a result of 1:12,000 Digital Orthophoto  (Quarter) Quad production under the National Digital Orthophoto Program  (NDOP).   For the most part, the guidelines developed in the report attempted to  reflect the circumstances and mapping activities of counties in Ohio. It is  hoped the county by county coverage recommendations in Appendix 1 closely  emulate the kind of decisions that would be made by county level organizations  concerning orthophotography coverage. While the resulting digital orthophoto  plan for Ohio may not perfectly reflect the conditions in a particular county,  it does provide an objectively determined basis upon which counties can evaluate  their large-scale orthophoto mapping requirements.   The importance of carefully analyzing requirements is apparent when the  comparative cost of mapping Ohio in accordance to the suggested plan is  considered. By combining cost figures for black and white digital orthophoto  mapping with the recommended number of maps required at each scale, an overall  price tag for the plan can be determined as shown in Table 5. The $15.4 million  figure represents a very rough estimate of the cost for orthophotography  coverage acquired on a county by county basis across Ohio. If 1:1,200 scale  orthophotography for the entire state were acquired at one time, the cost would  be about $27.5 million (assuming the 189,643 tiles could be produced for $145  per tile or roughly $645 per square mile).     Clearly, the $15.4 million estimate is far less expensive than the $27.5  million cost of blanketing the state with large scale coverage. While these  estimates are only suggestive, the comparison underscores the need to match the  orthophoto map coverage to genuine requirements of the counties.        APPENDIX 1   RECOMMENDED DIGITAL ORTHOPHOTOGRAPHY  COVERAGE BY  COUNTY   The Appendix is presented in PDF version which can be downloaded.  Adobe Acrobat  Reader  is required to view PDF  files.   This appendix  presents recommended orthophotography coverage plan maps for each county in  Ohio.  The maps set forth the specific 1:1,200 (dark shading), 1:2,400 (light  shading), and 1:4,800 (no shading) scale map tiles that will satisfy basic  parcel mapping requirements in each county. Towns and villages are shown in  white on top of the darkly shaded 1:1,200 scale map tiles. Note that these white  areas require 1:1,200 scale coverage. Interstate, U.S., and state highways are  also included for reference.   The 10,000’ Ohio State Plane Coordinate System (OSPCS) grid ticks along the  boundary can be used to identify specific map sheets in accordance with the  suggested naming convention. OSPCS easting and northing values are provided for  the tick marks in one of the four corners of each map. Easting values for the  ticks increase (in increments of 10,000’) to the east (right) while northing  values for the tick marks increase (in increments of 10,000’) to the north (up).  For example, the southeastern most 10,000’ tile in Madison county is identified  as S 175 061 000.          *  In mapping, scale indicates  the relationship between the size of the “reduced earth” projected on the piece  of paper and the size of the actual earth. This relationship is most precisely  represented by a fraction, such as 1:4,800. However, scale is often expressed as  an equation, such as 1”=400’, signifying that 1” on the map (roughly)  corresponds to 400’ on the ground. The two forms are numerically equivalent and  are used interchangeably.   *  State agencies in Ohio may  prefer a different projection and measurement unit. More information concerning  the geographic reference system is provided in Appendix 3. A detailed tiling  plan for individual map sheets based on the OSPCS grid is developed in Appendix  2.   *  TIGER/Line® Files, 1995  [machine-readable data file]/prepared by the Bureau of the Census-- Washington,  DC, 1996   *  Census of Population and  Housing, 1990: Summary Tape File 1 on CD-ROM (Ohio) [machine-readable data  files]/prepared by the Bureau of the Census.--Washington: The Bureau [producer  and distributor], 1991; and Census of Population and Housing, 1990: Summary Tape  File 3 on CD-ROM (Ohio) [machine-readable data files]/prepared by the Bureau of  the Census.--Washington: The Bureau [producer and distributor], 1992.

The 1998 TIGER/Line files are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the Census TIGER data base. The geographic coverage for a single TIGER/Line file is a county or statistical equivalent entity, with the coverage area based on January 1, 1999 legal boundaries. A complete set of 1999 TIGER/Line files includes all counties and statistically equivalent entities in the United States, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, U.S. Minor Outlying Areas, and the Pacific Island Areas. The Census TIGER data base represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts. However, each county-based TIGER/Line file is designed to stand alone as an independent data set or the files can be combined to cover the whole Nation and its territories. The 1999 TIGER/Line files consist of line segments representing physical features and governmental and statistical boundaries. The files contain information distributed over a series of record types for the spatial objects of a county. There are 17 record types, including the basic data record, the shape coordinate points, and geographic codes that can be used with appropriate software to prepare maps. Other geographic information contained in the files includes attributes such as feature identifiers/census feature class codes (CFCC) used to differentiate feature types, address ranges and ZIP Codes, codes for legal and statistical entities, latitude/longitude coordinates of linear and point features, landmark point features, area landmarks, key geographic features, and area boundaries. The 1999 TIGER/Line data dictionary contains a complete list of all the fields in the 17 record types.   Purpose:       In order for others to use the information in the Census TIGER data base in a geographic information system (GIS) or for other geographic applications, the Census Bureau releases to the public extracts of the data base in the form of TIGER/Line files. Various versions of the TIGER/Line files have been released; previous versions include the 1990 Census TIGER/Line files, the 1992 TIGER/Line files, the 1994 TIGER/Line files, the 1995 TIGER/Line files, the 1997 TIGER/Line files and the 1998 TIGER/Line files. The 1999 TIGER/Line files were originally produced for use by the states participating in the verification of Phase 2 of the Census 2000 Redistricting Data Program, Phase 2, the Voting District project (VTDP) and the verification of the Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP).

The remaining attribute information has been examined but has not been fully tested for accuracy.     Logical_Consistency_Report:       The feature network of lines (as represented by Record Types 1 and 2) is compete for census purposes. Spatial objects in TIGER/Line belong to the ""Geometry and topology"" (GT) class of objects in the ""Spatial Data Transfer Standard"" (SDTS) FIPS Publication 173 and are topologically valid. Node/geometry and topology (GT)-polygon/chain relationships are collected or generated to satisfy topological edit requirements. These requirements include: * Complete chains must begin and end at nodes. * Complete chains must connect to each other at nodes. * Complete chains do not extend through nodes. * Left and right GT-polygons are defined for each complete chain element and are consistent throughout the extract process. * the chains representing the limits of the files are free of gaps. The Census Bureau performed automated tests to ensure logical consistency and limits of files. All polygons are tested for closure. The Census Bureau uses its internally developed Geographic Update System to enhance and modify spatial and attribute data in the Census TIGER data base. Standard geographic codes, such as FIPS codes for states, counties, municipalities, and places, are used when encoding spatial entities. The Census Bureau performed spatial data tests for logical consistency of the codes during the compilation of the original Census TIGER data base files. Most of the Codes themselves were provided to the Census Bureau by the USGS, the agency responsible for maintaining FIPS 55. Feature attribute information has been examined but has not been fully tested for consistency.   Completeness_Report:       Data completeness of the TIGER/Line files reflects the contents of the Census TIGER data base at the time the TIGER/Line files (1999 version) were created.   Positional_Accuracy:         Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:         Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:       The information present in these files is provided for the purposes of statistical analysis and census operations only. Coordinates in the TIGER/Line files have six implied decimal places, but the positional accuracy of these coordinates is not as great as the six decimal places suggest. The positional accuracy varies with the source materials used, but generally the information is no better than the established national map Accuracy standards for 1:100,000-scale maps from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS); thus it is NOT suitable for high-precision measurement applications such as engineering problems, property transfers, or other uses that might require highly accurate measurements of the earth's surface. The USGS 1:100,000-scale maps met national map accuracy standards and use coordinates defined by the North American Datum, 1983. For the contiguous 48 States, the cartographic fidelity of most of the 1999 TIGER/Line files, in areas outside the 1980 census Geographic Base File/Dual Independent map Encoding (GBF/DIME) file coverage and selected other large metropolitan areas, compare favorable with the USGS 1:100,000-scale maps. The Census Bureau cannot specify the accuracy of features inside of what was the 1980 GBF/DIME- File coverage or selected metropolitan areas. The Census Bureau added updates to the TIGER/Line files that enumerators annotated on maps sheets prepared from the Census TIGER data base as they attempted to traverse every street feature shown on the Census 2000 map sheets; the Census Bureau also made other corrections from updated map sheets supplied by local participants for Census Bureau programs. The locational accuracy of these updates is of unknown quality. In addition to the Federal, State, and local sources, portions of the files may contain information obtained in part from maps and other materials prepared by private companies. Despite the fact the TIGER/Line data positional accuracy is not as high as the coordinate values imply, the six-decimal place precision is useful when producing maps. The precision allows features that are next to each other on the ground to be placed in the correct position, on the map, relative to each other, without overlap.

Software (TIGER DB routines) written by the Geography Division allows for efficient access to Census TIGER system data. TIGER/Line files are extracted from the Census TIGER data base by county or statistical equivalent area. Census TIGER data for a given county or statistical equivalent area is then distributed among 17 fixed length record ASCII files, each one containing attributes for either line, polygon, or landmark geographic data types. The Bureau of the Census has released various versions of the TIGER/Line files since 1988, with each version having more updates (feature and feature names, address ranges and ZIP Codes, coordinate updates, revised field definitions, etc.) than the previous version.

The 1998 TIGER/Line files are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the Census TIGER data base. The geographic coverage for a single TIGER/Line file is a county or statistical equivalent entity, with the coverage area based on January 1, 1999 legal boundaries. A complete set of 1999 TIGER/Line files includes all counties and statistically equivalent entities in the United States, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, U.S. Minor Outlying Areas, and the Pacific Island Areas. The Census TIGER data base represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts. However, each county-based TIGER/Line file is designed to stand alone as an independent data set or the files can be combined to cover the whole Nation and its territories. The 1999 TIGER/Line files consist of line segments representing physical features and governmental and statistical boundaries. The files contain information distributed over a series of record types for the spatial objects of a county. There are 17 record types, including the basic data record, the shape coordinate points, and geographic codes that can be used with appropriate software to prepare maps. Other geographic information contained in the files includes attributes such as feature identifiers/census feature class codes (CFCC) used to differentiate feature types, address ranges and ZIP Codes, codes for legal and statistical entities, latitude/longitude coordinates of linear and point features, landmark point features, area landmarks, key geographic features, and area boundaries. The 1999 TIGER/Line data dictionary contains a complete list of all the fields in the 17 record types.   Purpose:       In order for others to use the information in the Census TIGER data base in a geographic information system (GIS) or for other geographic applications, the Census Bureau releases to the public extracts of the data base in the form of TIGER/Line files. Various versions of the TIGER/Line files have been released; previous versions include the 1990 Census TIGER/Line files, the 1992 TIGER/Line files, the 1994 TIGER/Line files, the 1995 TIGER/Line files, the 1997 TIGER/Line files and the 1998 TIGER/Line files. The 1999 TIGER/Line files were originally produced for use by the states participating in the verification of Phase 2 of the Census 2000 Redistricting Data Program, Phase 2, the Voting District project (VTDP) and the verification of the Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP).

The remaining attribute information has been examined but has not been fully tested for accuracy.     Logical_Consistency_Report:       The feature network of lines (as represented by Record Types 1 and 2) is compete for census purposes. Spatial objects in TIGER/Line belong to the ""Geometry and topology"" (GT) class of objects in the ""Spatial Data Transfer Standard"" (SDTS) FIPS Publication 173 and are topologically valid. Node/geometry and topology (GT)-polygon/chain relationships are collected or generated to satisfy topological edit requirements. These requirements include: * Complete chains must begin and end at nodes. * Complete chains must connect to each other at nodes. * Complete chains do not extend through nodes. * Left and right GT-polygons are defined for each complete chain element and are consistent throughout the extract process. * the chains representing the limits of the files are free of gaps. The Census Bureau performed automated tests to ensure logical consistency and limits of files. All polygons are tested for closure. The Census Bureau uses its internally developed Geographic Update System to enhance and modify spatial and attribute data in the Census TIGER data base. Standard geographic codes, such as FIPS codes for states, counties, municipalities, and places, are used when encoding spatial entities. The Census Bureau performed spatial data tests for logical consistency of the codes during the compilation of the original Census TIGER data base files. Most of the Codes themselves were provided to the Census Bureau by the USGS, the agency responsible for maintaining FIPS 55. Feature attribute information has been examined but has not been fully tested for consistency.   Completeness_Report:       Data completeness of the TIGER/Line files reflects the contents of the Census TIGER data base at the time the TIGER/Line files (1999 version) were created.   Positional_Accuracy:         Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:         Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:       The information present in these files is provided for the purposes of statistical analysis and census operations only. Coordinates in the TIGER/Line files have six implied decimal places, but the positional accuracy of these coordinates is not as great as the six decimal places suggest. The positional accuracy varies with the source materials used, but generally the information is no better than the established national map Accuracy standards for 1:100,000-scale maps from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS); thus it is NOT suitable for high-precision measurement applications such as engineering problems, property transfers, or other uses that might require highly accurate measurements of the earth's surface. The USGS 1:100,000-scale maps met national map accuracy standards and use coordinates defined by the North American Datum, 1983. For the contiguous 48 States, the cartographic fidelity of most of the 1999 TIGER/Line files, in areas outside the 1980 census Geographic Base File/Dual Independent map Encoding (GBF/DIME) file coverage and selected other large metropolitan areas, compare favorable with the USGS 1:100,000-scale maps. The Census Bureau cannot specify the accuracy of features inside of what was the 1980 GBF/DIME- File coverage or selected metropolitan areas. The Census Bureau added updates to the TIGER/Line files that enumerators annotated on maps sheets prepared from the Census TIGER data base as they attempted to traverse every street feature shown on the Census 2000 map sheets; the Census Bureau also made other corrections from updated map sheets supplied by local participants for Census Bureau programs. The locational accuracy of these updates is of unknown quality. In addition to the Federal, State, and local sources, portions of the files may contain information obtained in part from maps and other materials prepared by private companies. Despite the fact the TIGER/Line data positional accuracy is not as high as the coordinate values imply, the six-decimal place precision is useful when producing maps. The precision allows features that are next to each other on the ground to be placed in the correct position, on the map, relative to each other, without overlap.

Software (TIGER DB routines) written by the Geography Division allows for efficient access to Census TIGER system data. TIGER/Line files are extracted from the Census TIGER data base by county or statistical equivalent area. Census TIGER data for a given county or statistical equivalent area is then distributed among 17 fixed length record ASCII files, each one containing attributes for either line, polygon, or landmark geographic data types. The Bureau of the Census has released various versions of the TIGER/Line files since 1988, with each version having more updates (feature and feature names, address ranges and ZIP Codes, coordinate updates, revised field definitions, etc.) than the previous version.

Abstract:       TIGER, TIGER/Line, and Census TIGER are registered trademarks of the        U.S. Census Bureau.  ZCTA is a trademark of the U.S. Census Bureau.        The UA Census 2000 TIGER/Line files are an extract of selected        geographic and cartographic information from the Census TIGER database.         The geographic coverage for a single TIGER/Line file is a county or        statistical equivalent entity, with the coverage area based on January        1, 2000 legal boundaries.  A complete set of UA Census 2000 TIGER/Line        files includes all counties and statistically equivalent entities in        the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas as of January 1,       2000.  The UA Census 2000 TIGER/Line files do not include a file for        Broomfield County, CO which became effective November 15, 2001.  The        Census TIGER database represents a seamless national file with no        overlaps or gaps between parts.  However, each county-based TIGER/Line        file is designed to stand alone as an independent data set or the files        can be combined to cover the whole Nation.  The UA Census 2000        TIGER/Line files consist of line segments representing physical        features and governmental and statistical boundaries.  The boundary       information in the TIGER/Line files are for statistical data        collection and tabulation purposes only; their depiction and        designation for statistical purposes does not constitute a        determination of jurisditional authority or rights of ownership or        entitlement.  The files contain information distributed over a series        of record types for the spatial objects of a county.  There are 17        record types, including the basic data record, the shape coordinate        points, and geographic codes that can be used with appropriate software         to prepare maps.  Other geographic information contained in the files        includes attributes such as feature identifiers/census feature        class codes (CFCC) used to differentiate feature types, address        ranges and ZIP Codes, codes for legal and statistical entities,        latitude/longitude coordinates of linear and point features,        landmark point features, area landmarks, key geographic features,        and area boundaries.  The UA Census 2000 TIGER/Line data dictionary        contains a complete list of all the fields in the 17 record types.     Purpose:       In order for others to use the information in the Census TIGER        database in a geographic information system (GIS) or for other        geographic applications, the Census Bureau releases to the public        extracts of the database in the form of TIGER/Line files.  Various        versions of the TIGER/Line files have been released; previous        versions include the 1990 Census TIGER/Line files, the 1992        TIGER/Line files, the 1994 TIGER/Line files, the 1995 TIGER/Line        files, the 1997 TIGER/Line files, the 1998 TIGER/Line files, the        1999 TIGER/Line files, the Redistricting Census 2000 TIGER/Line        files, and the Census 2000 TIGER/Line files.

Time_Period_of_Content:     Time_Period_Information:       Single_Date/Time:         Calendar_Date: 2000     Currentness_Reference: 2000   Status:     Progress: Complete     Maintenance_and_Update_Frequency:       TIGER/Line files are extracted from the Census TIGER database when        needed for geographic programs required to support the census and        survey programs of the U.S. Census Bureau.  No changes or updates        will be made to the UA Census 2000 TIGER/Line files.  Future releases        of TIGER/Line files will reflect updates made to the Census TIGER        database and will be released under a version numbering system        based on the month and year the data is extracted.

Native_Data_Set_Environment:     TIGER/Line files are created and processed in a VMS environment.       The environment consists of two Alpha Server 8400s clustered together      running OpenVMS version 6.2-1H3 used for production operations.  The      Census TIGER system is driven by DEC Command language (DCL) procedures      which invoke C software routines to extract selected geographic and      cartographic information (TIGER/Line files) from the operational      Census TIGER database. Data_Quality_Information:   Attribute_Accuracy:     Attribute_Accuracy_Report:       Accurate against Federal information Processing Standards (FIPS),        FIPS Publication 6-4, and FIPS-55 at the 100% level for the codes        and base names.  The remaining attribute information has been        examined but has not been fully tested for accuracy.   Logical_Consistency_Report:     The feature network of lines (as represented by Record Types 1 and 2)      is complete for census purposes.  Spatial objects in TIGER/Line belong      to the ""Geometry and Topology"" (GT) class of objects in the ""Spatial      Data Transfer Standard"" (SDTS) FIPS Publication 173 and are      topologically valid.  Node/geometry and topology (GT)-polygon/chain      relationships are collected or generated to satisfy topological edit     requirements.  These requirements include:     * Complete chains must begin and end at nodes.     * Complete chains must connect to each other at nodes.     * Complete chains do not extend through nodes.     * Left and right GT-polygons are defined for each complete chain      element and are consistent throughout the extract process.     * The chains representing the limits of the files are free of gaps.     The Census Bureau performed automated tests to ensure logical      consistency and limits of files.  All polygons are tested for closure.       The Census Bureau uses its internally developed Geographic Update      System to enhance and modify spatial and attribute data in the Census      TIGER database.  Standard geographic codes, such as FIPS codes for      states, counties, municipalities, and places, are used when encoding      spatial entities.  The Census Bureau performed spatial data tests for      logical consistency of the codes during the compilation of the original      Census TIGER database files.  Most of the Codes themselves were provided      to the Census Bureau by the USGS, the agency responsible for maintaining      FIPS 55. Feature attribute information has been examined but has not been     fully tested for consistency.   Completeness_Report:     Data completeness of the TIGER/Line files reflects the contents of the      Census TIGER database at the time the TIGER/Line files (UA Census 2000      version) were created.   Positional_Accuracy:     Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:       Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:         The information present in these files is provided for the purposes          of statistical analysis and census operations only.  Coordinates          in the TIGER/Line files have six implied decimal places, but          the positional accuracy of these coordinates is not as great as           the six decimal places suggest.  The positional accuracy varies          with the source materials used, but generally the information is          no better than the established national map Accuracy standards          for 1:100,000-scale maps from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS);          thus it is NOT suitable for high-precision measurement applications          such as engineering problems, property transfers, or other uses          that might require highly accurate measurements of the earth's          surface.  The USGS 1:100,000-scale maps met national map accuracy          standards and use coordinates defined by the North American Datum,          1983.  For the contiguous 48 States, the cartographic fidelity of          most of the UA Census 2000 TIGER/Line files, in areas outside the          1980 census Geographic Base File/Dual Independent map Encoding          (GBF/DIME) file coverage and selected other large metropolitan          areas, compare favorably with the USGS 1:100,000-scale maps.  The          Census Bureau cannot specify the accuracy of features inside of          what was the 1980 GBF/DIME-File coverage or selected metropolitan          areas.  The Census Bureau added updates to the TIGER/Line files that          enumerators annotated on maps sheets prepared from the Census          TIGER database as they attempted to traverse every street feature          shown on the Census 2000 map sheets; the Census Bureau also made          other corrections from updated map sheets supplied by local          participants for Census Bureau programs.  The locational accuracy          of these updates is of unknown quality.  In addition to the Federal,          State, and local sources, portions of the files may contain          information obtained in part from maps and other materials prepared          by private companies.  Despite the fact the TIGER/Line data positional          accuracy is not as high as the coordinate values imply, the six-         decimal place precision is useful when producing maps.  The precision          allows features that are next to each other on the ground to be placed          in the correct position, on the map, relative to each other, without          overlap.

Process_Step:       Process_Description:         In order for others to use the information in the Census TIGER          database in a GIS or for other geographic applications, the          Census Bureau releases periodic extracts of selected information          from the Census TIGER database, organized as topologically          consistent networks.  Software (TIGER DB routines) written by          the Geography Division allows for efficient access to Census          TIGER system data.  TIGER/Line files are extracted from the          Census TIGER database by county or statistical equivalent          area.  Census TIGER data for a given county or statistical         equivalent area is then distributed among 17 fixed length          record ASCII files, each one containing attributes for either          line, polygon, or landmark geographic data types.  The Census          Bureau has released various versions of the TIGER/Line files         since 1988, with each version having more updates (feature          and feature names, address ranges and ZIP Codes, coordinate          updates, revised field definitions, etc.) than the previous          version.

Polygon features -       1) Geographic entity codes for areas used to tabulate the Census        2000 census statistical data and 1990 geographic areas       2) Locations of area landmarks       3) Locations of KGLs       The line features and polygon information form the majority of        data in the TIGER/Line files.  Some of the data/attributes        describing the lines include coordinates, feature identifiers        (names), CFCCs (used to identify the most noticeable        characteristic of a feature), address ranges, and geographic        entity codes.  The TIGER/Line files contain point and area        labels that describe landmark features and provide locational        reference.  Area landmarks consist of a feature name or label        and feature type assigned to a polygon or group of polygons.         Landmarks may overlap or refer to the same set of polygons.       The Census TIGER database uses collections of spatial objects        (points, lines, and polygons) to model or describe real-world        geography.  The Census Bureau uses these spatial objects to        represent features such as streets, rivers, and political        boundaries and assigns attributes to these features to identify        and describe specific features such as the 500 block of Market        Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

They include files for all counties and statistically equivalent entities in the United States, as well as files for Puerto Rico and the Island Territories. The TIGER/Line files are released by county or statistically equivalent entity based on the latest available governmental unit boundaries. Since the 1990 Census, there have been several changes to the universe of county or statistically equivalent entities. In Alaska the Skagway-YakutatAngoon Census Area has become Skagway-Hoonah-Angoon Census Area and Yakutat Borough. Also in Alaska, Denali Borough was created from parts of Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area and Southeast Fairbanks Census Area. These changes have resulted in the creation of separate TIGER/Line files for the new county equivalents. Dade County, Florida officially changed its legal name to Miami-Dade County, Florida. This resulted in the ""renaming"" of the TIGER/Line file. The portion of Yellowstone National Park in Montana that the U.S. Census Bureau had been showing as a statistical equivalent of a county legally is contained within Gallatin and Park Counties, Montana. As a result, a separate TIGER/Line file no longer exists for that portion of the Yellowstone National Park in Montana. The City of South Boston, Virginia no longer is an independent city (statistical equivalent of a county) and is now part of Halifax County, Virginia and appears in the Halifax County, Virginia TIGER/Line file.  Census TIGER, TIGER, TIGER/Line, TIGER/SDTS, TIGER/Census Tract Street Index, TIGER/CTSI, CTSI, TIGER/Census Tract Comparability, and TIGER/GICS are registered trademarks of the U.S. Census Bureau; ZCTATM is a trademark of the U.S. Census Bureau. As such, these names cannot be used as or within the proprietary product names of any commercial product including or otherwise relevant to U.S. Census Bureau data, and may only be used to refer to the nature of such product. The U. S. Census Bureau requests that any repackaging of the TIGER/Line data (and documentation) and other files accompanying it for distribution include a conspicuously-placed statement to this effect on the product's cover, the first page of the website, or elsewhere of comparable visibility. Further, U.S. Census Bureau trademarks, when used in reference to the nature of the product, should be accompanied by the  (registered) symbol or TM symbol, where convenient.  Introduction I-1   The TIGER/Line files contain data only and do not include display or mapping software. The TIGER/Line files are typically used in conjunction with geographic information system, or similar, software. The U.S. Census Bureau first released the TIGER/Line files in 1988. Since that time, it has released several versions of the files, with each successive version being improved through increased editing and updating of address ranges and features. A brief discussion of the changes that occurred in the 1994, 1995, 1997, and 1998 TIGER/Line files, and the 1999 TIGER/Line files are summarized below.  Changes in the Post 1994 TIGER/Line File Versions 1999 TIGER/Line Files No record types were added or deleted between the 1998 and 1999 versions of the TIGER/Line files. However, there are some field name, file name, and content changes. Field names in the 1999 TIGER/Line files have been updated to be consistent with the field names that will be part of the geographic header used in all Census 2000 data files including the Summary Level files. The U.S. Census Bureau is using the 1999 TIGER/Line files to exchange data with local partners participating in U.S. Census Bureau programs. Data users should NOT use the information contained in fields identified as 2000 (TENTATIVE) as the Census 2000 geographic codes. This data is subject to change. Fields identified as 2000 (TENTATIVE) are intended for use by program participants only. Field Definition Changes On several record types the Census Bureau has merged the FIPS State Code for File and FIPS County Code for File fields into one field called File Code with a field name of FILE. This change affects Record Types 5, 7, 8, 9, A, H, I, P, R, and S. Fourteen field names have changed on Record Type 1. The FIPS 55 Code (American Indian/Alaska Native Area), Current Left and FIPS 55 Code (American Indian/Alaska Native Area), Current Right have become FIPS 55 Code (American Indian/Alaska Native Area/Hawaiian Home  I-2 VTDP/PSAP/TAZ Verification TIGER/Line  Files   Land), Current Left and FIPS 55 Code (American Indian/Alaska Native Area/Hawaiian Home Land), Current Right. Their field names have changed from FAIRL and FAIRR to AIANHHL and AIANHHR. Although Hawaiian Home Land codes appear in these fields in the 1999 TIGER/ Line files, Census 2000 is the first census for which Hawaiian Home Land data will be available from the U.S. Census Bureau. The American Indian Trust Land Flag, Current Left and American Indian Trust Land Flag, Current Right have become American Indian/Hawaiian Home Land Indicator, Current Left and American Indian/Hawaiian Home Land Indicator, Current Right. Their field names have changed from TRUSTL and TRUSTR to AIHHTLIL and AIHHTLIR. Field names FMCDL and FMCDR have been changed to COUSUBL and COUSUBR. FSMCDL and FSMCDR have been renamed SUBMCDL and SUBMCDR. FPLL and FPLR have been renamed PLACEL and PLACER. CTL and CTR have become TRACT90L and TRACT90R and BLKL and BLKR have been renamed BLOCK90L and BLOCK90R. On Record Type 3 the Census Use 3 and 4 fields have been replaced by Census American Indian Tribal Subdivision Code, 2000 (TENTATIVE) Left and Census American Indian Tribal Subdivision Code, 2000 (TENTATIVE ) Right with field names AITSCEL and AITSCER. Deleted from Record Type 3 are the Voting District Code, 1990 Left and Voting District Code, 1990 Right fields and the Reserved Space 2 field. These fields have been replaced by FIPS 55 Code (American Indian Tribal Subdivision), 2000 (TENTATIVE) Left occupying columns 102 through 106 and FIPS 55 Code (American Indian Tribal Subdivision), 2000 (TENTATIVE) Right occupying columns 107 through 111. The field names for these fields are AITSL and AITSR. The Census American Indian/Alaska Native Code, 1990 Left and Census American Indian/Alaska Native Code, 1990 Right fields on Record Type 3 have become Census Code (American Indian/Alaska Native Area/Hawaiian Home Land), 1990 Left and Census Code (American Indian/Alaska Native Area/Hawaiian Home Land), 1990 Right. Their field names have changed from AIR90L and AIR90R to AIANHHCE90L and AIANHHCE90R. The American Indian Trust Land Flag, 1990 Left and American Indian Trust Land Flag, 1990 Right have become the American Indian/Hawaiian Home Land Trust Land Indicator, 1990 Left and American Indian/Hawaiian Home Land Trust Land Indicator, 1990 Right. The field names have changed from  Introduction I-3   TRUST90L and TRUST90R to AIHHTLI90L and AIHHTLI90R. The Census American Indian/Alaska Native Area Code, Current Left and Census American Indian/Alaska Native Area Code, Current Right have become Census Code (American Indian/Alaska Native Area/Hawaiian Home Land), Current Left and Census Code (American Indian/Alaska Native Area/ Hawaiian Home Land), Current Right. The field names have changed from AIRL and AIRR to AIANHHCEL and AIANHHCER. Although Hawaiian Home Land codes appear in the current fields in the 1999 TIGER/Line files, Census 2000 is the first census for which Hawaiian Home Land data will be available from the U.S. Census Bureau. The U.S. Census Bureau has renamed most of the field names on Record Type 3. COUN90L and COUN90R have become COUNTY90L and COUNTY90R, FMCD90L and FMCD90R have become COSUB90L and COSUB90R, FPL90L and FPL90R were renamed COUSUB90L and COUSUB90R, FPL90L and FPL90R are now PLACE90L and PLACE90R, CTBNA90L and CTBNA90R have become TRACT90L and TRACT90R, BLK90L and BLK90R were renamed BLOCK90L and BLOCK90R, and FANRCL and FANRCR have become ANRCL and ANRCR. On Record Type A, the Census Urbanized Area Code, 2000 field (which was blank) has become Public Use Microdata Area 1% File, 1990 with a field name of PUMA1. The PUMA1 field is blank in the 1999 TIGER/Line files. The 1990 Traffic Analysis Zone codes have been replaced by the 2000 (TENTATIVE) codes. The Census Transportation Planning Package Area Code field has been eliminated and replaced by Reserved Space 5. The FIPS 55 Code (American Indian/Alaska Native Area), 1990 has become FIPS 55 Code (American Indian/Alaska Native Area/Hawaiian Home Land), 1990. Its field name has changed from FAIR to AIANHH90. The Census American Indian/Alaska Native Area Code, 1990 has become the Census Code (American Indian/Alaska Native Area/Hawaiian Home Land), 1990. The field name has changed from AIR90 to AIANHHCE90. No Hawaiian Home Land codes appear in these fields in the 1999 TIGER/ Line files as Census 2000 is the first census for which Hawaiian Home Land data will be available from the U.S. Census Bureau.  I-4 VTDP/PSAP/TAZ Verification TIGER/Line  Files   Several other field names have changed on Record Type A. FMCD has become COUSUB90, FPL was renamed PLACE90, CTBNA90 has become TRACT90, BLK90 is now BLOCK90, URBFLAG was renamed UR90, and COUN90 has become COUNTY90. The Census Bureau has deleted the Census Alaska Native Regional Corporation Code from Record Type C. The columns formerly occupied by the Census Alaska Native Regional Corporation Code, along with the Census Use 5 and Name fields on Record Type C have been reconfigured. New to Record Type C is the American Indian Tribal Subdivision Code, with a field name of AITSCE, occupying columns 50 through 52. The remaining two columns of the former Census Use 5 field have been added to the Names field which now has a record length of 60 and occupies columns 53 through 112. Record Type C in the 1999 TIGER/Line files includes, for the first time, the census tract numbers formatted to display as a ""name."" The census tract name drops the leading and trailing zeros and, where a census tract suffix exists, adds the decimal point. For example, census tract 000100 will have a name of ""1"" and census tract 003201 will have a name of ""32.01."" The census tract number associated with the census tract name shares a field on Record Type C with the Voting District Code. As a result, the field name has changed from VTD to VTDTRACT. The FIPS Code and Name Relations Applicable Year field has become the FIPS Code, Name, and/or Attribute Data Applicable Year field with a field name change from FIPSYR to DATAYR. The Census American Indian/ Alaska Native Area Code field has become the Census American Indian/ Alaska Native Area/Hawaiian Home Land Code field. Its field name has changed from AIR to AIANHHCE. The Census Urbanized Area Code field has become the Census Urban Area/Urban Growth Area Code field with a field name change from UA to UAUGA. For information on Urban Growth Areas refer to Chapter 4. The Legal/Administrative/Statistical Area Description Code is now the Legal/Statistical Area Description Code. Its field name has changed from LASAD to LSADC. Also changed is the field name PDC which has become PLACEDC.  Introduction I-5   Most of the geographic codes on Record Type S in the 1999 TIGER/Line files now reflect 2000 (TENTATIVE) codes and not current or 1990 geography. The information in fields identified as 2000 (TENTATIVE) are subject to change. The U.S. Census Bureau is using these fields to exchange data with local partners participating in U.S. Census Bureau programs. Do not use this information as the Census 2000 geographic codes. On Record Type S, the FIPS Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area Code, Current field has become the FIPS Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area/Metropolitan Statistical Area Code, 2000 (TENTATIVE). Its field name has changed from CMSA to MSACMSA. The FIPS Metropolitan Area Code, Current has become the FIPS Primary Metropolitan Area Code, 2000 (TENTATIVE). Its field name has changed from MA to PMSA. The FIPS 55 Code (American Indian/Alaska Native Area), Current field on Record Type S has become the FIPS 55 Code (American Indian/Alaska Native Area/Hawaiian Home Land), 2000 (TENTATIVE). The field name has changed from FAIR to AIANHH. The Census American Indian/Alaska Native Area Code, Current field has become the Census Code (American Indian/Alaska Native Area/Hawaiian Home Land), 2000 (TENTATIVE) field. The field name has changed from AIR to AIANHHCE. The American Indian Trust Land Flag, Current field has become the American Indian/Hawaiian Home Land Indicator, 2000 (TENTATIVE). Its field name has changed from TRUST to AIHHTLI. The Census Alaska Native Regional Corporation Code field has been deleted and replaced by Reserved Space 6. On Record Type S, the U.S. Census Bureau has renamed several fields. FCCITY has become CONCIT, FMCD is now COUSUB, FSMCD was renamed SUBMCD, FPL has become PLACE, and CT has become TRACT. All these fields now contain 2000 (TENTATIVE) geographic codes. The Census Block Number, 1990 field has become Census Block Number, 2000. Its field name has changed from BLK to BLOCK. This field is blank in the 1999 TIGER/Line files. The FIPS State Code and FIPS County Code fields now contain 2000 (TENTATIVE) geographic codes. The State Senate District Code and State House District Code fields on Record Type S have been changed to State Legislative District Code (Upper Chamber), 2000 (TENTATIVE) and State Legislative District Code  I-6 VTDP/PSAP/TAZ Verification TIGER/Line  Files   (Lower Chamber), 2000 (TENTATIVE). Their field names have changed from STSENATE and STHOUSE to SLDU and SLDL. The Voting District Code field, which was blank in earlier versions of the TIGER/Line files now contains 2000 (TENTATIVE) codes. The CENSUS Use 7 field on Record Type S has become the Oregon Urban Growth Area, 2000 (TENTATIVE) field with a field name of UGA. Refer to Chapter 4 for more information about Urban Growth Areas. Reserved Space 7 has been replaced by Census Block Group, 2000 (TENTATIVE). Its field name is BLKGRP. Three other field names have changed. COUNCOL was renamed COUNTYCOL, BLKCOL has become BLOCKCOL, and ZCTA has become ZCTA5. Address Ranges and ZIP Codes The 1999 TIGER/Line files contain improvements in address range information resulting from Census 2000 preparations. In addition, ZIP Codes were updated in selected areas. Internal Points The U.S. Census Bureau has recalculated the internal points for polygons. In previous versions of the TIGER/Line files, some of the internal points fell on or outside the boundary of the polygon rather than within the polygon. Depending on the precision of a particular software or hardware system, this caused some data users to find internal points outside the correct polygon. The recalculation of the polygon internal points should resolve many of these problems. However, the internal point for very small or irregularly shaped polygons may still fall on the boundary of the polygon. Boundary and Area Changes Since the 1990 census, the U.S. Census Bureau has shifted and reshaped some line features, including boundary lines. The shape and area of the 1990 geographic entities depicted in the 1999 TIGER/Line files may differ from earlier versions of the TIGER/Line files, but represent the entities as they existed for the 1990 census. The inventory of 1990 census tabulation entities remain the same as in 1990.  Introduction I-7   1998 TIGER/Line Files The 1998 TIGER/Line files had the same structure as the 1997 TIGER/ Line files; there were no record additions or deletions. However, there were some field name, file name, and content changes including corrections to the data format information appearing in Chapter 6. Field Definition Changes There were two field name changes on Record Type 1. The U.S. Census Bureau renamed the CTBNAL and CTBNAR field names as CTL and CTR. There were several changes to the fields on Record Type 3. Reserved spaces two and three in the 1997 TIGER/Line files were replaced in the 1998 TIGER/Line files by FIPS 55 Code (ANRC), Current Left and FIPS 55 Code (ANRC), Current Right. Reserved spaces four and five were converted to Census Use fields and reserved space 6 was renumbered. The U.S. Census Bureau renamed the VTDL and VTDR field names as VTD90L and VTD90R. Two changes occurred on Record Type A. The Reserved Space 1 field was replaced by Census Urbanized Area Code, 2000 with a field name of UA. This field is blank in the 1998 TIGER/Line files. The Census Urbanized Area Code, 1990 field name was changed from UA to UA90. The length of the Name of Geographic Area field on Record Type C was changed from 66 characters to 58 characters and comprised columns 55 through 112. The FIPS Code and Name Relationship Applicable Year field was expanded from two characters to four characters, using columns 11 through 14. As a result, the FIPS 55 Code occupied columns 15 through 19, the FIPS Class Code occupied columns 20 through 21, the Census Place Description Code appeared in column 22, the Legal/Administrative Statistical Area Description Code occupied columns 23 through 24, the Entity Type Code appeared in column 25, the Metropolitan Area Code occupied columns 26 through 29, the School District Code occupied columns 30 through 34, the Census American Indian/Alaska Native Area Code occupied columns 35 through 38, and the Census Voting District Code occupied columns 39 through 44. The Census Urbanized Area Code was expanded from four characters to five characters, using columns 45 through 49. The U.S. Census Bureau added a two character Census Alaska Native Regional  I-8 VTDP/PSAP/TAZ Verification TIGER/Line  Files   Corporation Code in columns 50 and 51 and the remaining characters freed by the change to the Name of Geographic Area field were replaced with a Census Use 5 field in columns 50 through 52. The U.S. Census Bureau made a number of field name changes on Record Type S for the 1998 TIGER/Line files. The field names CMSAMSA and PMSA were changed to CMSA and MA. The field names STATECU and COUNTYCU were renamed STATE and COUNTY. The BLK00 field name was renamed BLK and VTD00 was renamed VTD. The Census Tract/BNA Code, 2000 field on the 1997 TIGER/Line files became Census Tract Code, 1990 on the 1998 TIGER/Line files with a field name change from CTBNA00 to CT. Reserved Space 10 became Census Use 6. The length of the State Senate District Code and State House District Code fields in Record Type S was changed from six characters to three characters. The six characters freed by this change became Census Use 7 and Reserved Space 7 fields. On Record Type S, reserved spaces 11 through 14 and the filler occupying columns 103 through 120 were restructured. The 1998 TIGER/Line files allocated these columns to FIPS Collection State Code, 2000; FIPS Collection County Code, 2000; Collection Block Number, 2000; Collection Block Number Suffix, 2000; Zip Code Tabulation Area, 2000; and Reserved Space 8. Boundary and Area Changes Since the 1990 census, the U.S. Census Bureau shifted and reshaped some line features, including boundary lines. The shape and area of the 1990 geographic entities depicted in the 1998 TIGER/Line files may have differed from earlier versions of the TIGER/Line files, but represented the entities as they existed for the 1990 census. The inventory of 1990 census tabulation entities remained the same as it was in 1990.  1997 TIGER/Line Files The 1997 TIGER/Line files had the same structure as the 1995 TIGER/ Line files; there were no record additions or deletions. However, there were some field name, file name, and content changes.  Introduction I-9   Field Definition Changes The U.S. Census Bureau redefined the concept of version. The four-digit version code no longer is a number that represents a fixed version that can be referenced nationwide. The version code is a four-digit number that represents the month and year (mmyy) the file is extracted from the Census TIGER data base. Adjacent counties in a state may have different version codes if they were extracted at different points in time. There were several changes to the fields on Record Type 3. The reserved spaces one through four in the 1995 TIGER/Line files contain four 1990 American Indian and Alaska Native area census code and American Indian trust land flag fields in the 1997 TIGER/Line files. These four fields are: Census American Indian/Alaska Native Area Code, 1990 Left (column positions 58 through 61); Census American Indian/Alaska Native Area Code, 1990 Right (column positions 62 through 65); American Indian Trust Land Flag, 1990 Left (column position 66); and American Indian Trust Land Flag, 1990 Right (column position 67). Deleted from Record Type 3 in the 1997 TIGER/Line files were the Census Alaska Native Regional Corporation Codes, Current Left and Census Alaska Native Regional Corporation Codes, Current Right. As a result of these deletions, reserved space filled columns 86 through 107 of the 1997 TIGER/Line files and the reserved space fields on the record were renumbered and reconfigured. Two changes occurred on Record Type A. The School District Code, Middle School field, in columns 60 through 64 of the 1995 TIGER/Line files were eliminated and replaced with Reserved Space 1 in the 1997 TIGER/Line files. Reserved Space 9 in the 1995 TIGER/Line files (columns 95 through 98) was replaced with the Census American Indian/Alaska Native Area Code, 1990 in the 1997 TIGER/Line files. The length of the RS 9 field in Record Type A was changed from nine characters to four characters. The five characters freed by this change were used for the 1990 state and county codes and are the source for determining the 1990 census tabulation codes.  I-10 VTDP/PSAP/TAZ Verification TIGER/Line  Files   There were changes to Record Type C in the 1997 TIGER/Line files. The 1995 TIGER/Line files had ten characters in columns 23 through 32 which contained the Census Alaska Native Regional Corporation Code, FIPS Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area/Metropolitan Statistical Area Code, and the FIPS Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area Code. The 1997 TIGER/Line files allocated these columns to Entity Type Code, Metropolitan Area Code, and School District Code. We standardized the file suffix names that appear inside the compressed files (tgrxxxxx.zip). This suffix now will consistently be .rtn where n is the record type. In examining the record layouts in Chapter 6, we corrected information concerning the valid existence of blank values and data formats. Address Ranges and ZIP Codes Address ranges were edited for or other inconsistencies and ZIP Codes were updated in selected Because of time constraints during the various operations needed create the 1997 TIGER/Line files, the U.S. Census Bureau did not new ZIP+4 information. overlaps areas. to add  Boundary and Area Changes Since the 1990 census, the U.S. Census Bureau shifted and reshaped some line features, including boundary lines. The shape and area of the 1990 geographic entities depicted in the 1997 TIGER/Line files may differ from earlier versions of the TIGER/ Line files, but continue to represent the entities as they existed for the 1990 census. The inventory of 1990 census tabulation entities remains the same as it was in 1990. Change in Naming Standards for Record Type 1 The U.S. Census Bureau changed its naming standards in Record Type 1 affecting the data in the Feature Direction, Prefix (FEDIRP), Feature Name (FENAME), Feature Type (FETYPE), and Feature Direction, Suffix (FEDIRS) fields. In previous TIGER/Line products, directional prefixes and suffixes could appear for any type of line feature. For the TIGER/Line 1997, only road features, those features with a Census Feature Class Code (CFCC) in the A class, should have feature directional data in the directional fields. Other types of chains representing other types of features (for example, hydrologic features in CFCC class H) no longer are standardized to show directional information.  Introduction I-11   The U.S. Census Bureau also modified the extraction of feature directional, name, and type information to improve the standardization of road feature information. The improvement parses a greater number of road chains into the correct feature identifier fields.  Known Problems and Anomalies in TIGER/Line    1997  Missing ZIP+4 Records Data users may note a significant reduction in the number of ZIP+4 Add On Codes in Record Type Z (ZIP4L and ZIP4R fields) for the 1997 TIGER/Line files in some areas. This reduction occurred as a result of operations to update the TIGER data base in preparation for Census 2000. These operations may have replaced address ranges or changed the 5-digit ZIP Code, but did not automatically update or transfer the ZIP+4 codes to the new ranges. Because the Add On codes are valid for specific 5-digit ZIP Codes and address ranges, the previous Add On codes may no longer apply to the new address ranges and thus were not retained. In nearly all situations, an automated match between the Census TIGER data base and the USPS ZIP+4 file was the source of ZIP+4 Add On Codes in TIGER products. With update operations for Census 2000 underway for large portions of the nation, we had not yet performed this automated match to refresh these codes. Future public sale releases of TIGER/Line files will contain refreshed codes that will reflect a more current USPS ZIP+4 file for the address range improvements that we are now making. Address Anomalies in Puerto Rico and Queens County, N.Y. The TIGER/Line files contain some address range coverage for Puerto Rico. However, use of this information for geocoding purposes may be problematic and the data user should proceed with caution. These address ranges are preliminary attempts at using Puerto Rico address ranges in U.S. Census Bureau files. Due to the lack of software or resources to handle some of the more unique aspects of addressing in Puerto Rico, the address ranges were entered without the standard edits and quality checks used in other parts of the United States. Improvements in software and address standardization for Puerto Rico are expected in the future. At present, there are inconsistencies, overlaps, and duplication of address ranges. Address ranges may lack alpha character prefixes or I-12 VTDP/PSAP/TAZ Verification TIGER/Line  Files   have hyphenated prefixes. The files also lack the community names used in a four-line address that the U.S. Postal Service requires to avoid duplicate addresses. Errors in the reference files, and other factors may limit the usefulness of this product for geocoding purposes. Address range data for Queens County, NY in TIGER/Line 1997 did not show a consistent use of hyphenated and non-hyphenated addressing. The U.S. Census Bureau intends to correct this in future public sale versions of TIGER products. Road Feature Anomalies The U.S. Census Bureau extracts TIGER/Line files from the TIGER data base which is continually updated. During the update process for some 1997 TIGER/Line files errors caused anomalies to be introduced into some chains represented in Record Types 1 and 2. For these cases road features may appear in the 1997 TIGER/Line files unconnected to other road features (so-called floating features) or severely skewed in relation to surrounding line features of any type. This problem was not discovered during the normal U.S. Census Bureau correction operations. The U.S. Census Bureau will fix these disconnected or skewed features in future public sale versions of TIGER products. The following county files have the greatest likelihood of road feature anomalies: FIPS 01073 06071 08069 13121 17077 21001 21065 21095 21131 21175 21203 24003  County name, State Jefferson, AL San Bernardino, CA Larimer, CO Fulton, GA Jackson, IL Adair, KY Estill, KY Harlan, KY Leslie, KY Morgan, KY Rockcastle, KY Anne Arundel, MD  FIPS 04013 06073 13089 13135 18097 21011 21067 21109 21165 21189 22017 24035  County name, State Maricopa, AZ San Diego, CA DeKalb, GA Gwinnett, GA Marion, IN Bath, KY Fayette, KY Jackson, KY Menifee, KY Owsley, KY Caddo, LA Queen Anne's, MD  Introduction I-13   FIPS 26093 26125 26161 34003 36055 42003 42019 42125 45031 45071 47037 48453 50007 50021  County name, State Livingston, MI Oakland, MI Washtenaw, MI Bergen, NJ Monroe, NY Allegheny, PA Butler, PA Washington, PA Darlington, SC Newberry, SC Davidson, TN Travis, TX Essex, VT Rutland, VT  FIPS 26115 26147 26163 36029 37119 42007 42071 42129 45057 46099 48229 50003 50015 55025  County name, State Monroe, MI St. Clair, MI Wayne, MI Erie, NY Mecklenburg, NC Beaver, PA Lancaster, PA Westmoreland, PA Lancaster, SC Minnehaha, SD Hudspeth, TX Bennington, VT Lamoille, VT Dane, WI  1995 TIGER/Line Files No record types were added or deleted between the 1994 and 1995 versions of the TIGER/Line files. However, there were field definition and coordinate datum changes, as well as address information improvements, in the 1995 TIGER/Line files. Field Definition Changes The CENID field was changed from numeric to alphanumeric in the 1995 TIGER/Line files to permit a wider range of entries within the same field length. Address Ranges and ZIP Codes Address ranges were edited for overlaps or other inconsistencies and ZIP Codes were updated in selected areas. The street names and address ranges in the Census TIGER data base were compared to those in the ZIP+4 file of the US Postal Service. If a street name and address range did not have a ZIP+4 code, the code was copied from the ZIP+4 file to the Census TIGER data base. The consistency of highway names and feature identifiers also was improved. Boundary and Area Changes The 1994 TIGER/Line files were included for American Samoa because the U.S. Census Bureau received no updates for this area. Since the 1990 census, U.S. Census Bureau shifted and reshaped  I-14 VTDP/PSAP/TAZ Verification TIGER/Line  Files   some line features, including boundary lines. This realignment of features could have been associated with corporate boundary corrections and changes. The shape and area of the geographic entities depicted in the 1995 TIGER/Line files may have differed from earlier versions of the TIGER/Line files, but represented the entities as they existed for the 1990 census. The inventory of census tabulation entities remained the same as it was in 1990. With the exception of Hawaii, Record Type 1 no longer contained census designated place (CDP) information. Since CDPs are defined at the time of each decennial census and are valid only for the presentation of decennial census data, the CDP complete chain information was removed from Record Type 1 which contained only current geography, but retained on Record Type 3 which had 1990 geography. Because Hawaii did not have independently-defined incorporated place boundaries, it used CDP boundaries as substitutes for these legal boundaries. Thus, its CDP complete chain information was retained on Record Type 1. Coordinates For the 48 contiguous states, the District of Columbia, Alaska, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, the coordinates in the 1995 TIGER/Line files were in the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). In all previous versions, the coordinate datum for the above areas was NAD27. Regional datums were used for Hawaii and the Island Territories in the Pacific.  1994 TIGER/Line Files The format and structure of the TIGER/Line files changed between the 1992 and the 1994 versions. In the 1994 TIGER/Line files, there were field definition changes and additional record types that accommodated new information or information that was previously supplied separately in other U.S. Census Bureau products. New Record Types The 1994 TIGER/Line files included five new record types--9, C, H, S, and Z. Record Type 9 contained key geographic locations (KGLs). A KGL was a particular type of point landmark with residential or economic significance. Record Type 9 provided the linkage between a building (KGL) with a unique identity and ZIP+4 Code, and the building's address that used its number and street name.  Introduction I-15   Record Type C replaced information that was supplied separately in the TIGER/Geographic NameTM files. Record Type C provided a unique list of all geographic entities with their code, name, and status. The FIPS Year field had three values, 90 for geographic names and codes valid for the 1990 census, 94 for geographic names and codes valid for the current year, and blank when the geographic names and codes were the same for 1990 and 1994. Multiple records for the same geographic entity showed its change or correction over time. Record Type H described the history of TIGER/Line IDs when complete chains were split or merged. Two fields (HIST and SOURCE) on Record Type H were not yet maintained in the Census TIGER data base and were blank. Record Type S had geographic area codes for polygons. It was similar to Record Type A (which also had geographic area codes for polygons) and was linked to Record Type P. There was a Record Type S for every polygon in Record Type P. Several fields were reserved for use by participants in U.S. Census Bureau programs. The WATER field had two values, 0 for land or 1 for water. The Congressional District codes for the current Congress (in this case, the 103rd) were moved to Record Type S. The current Congressional District code, when combined with the 1990 state codes, created valid geographic areas. When only current state geographic codes were combined, nonexistent geographic areas may have resulted. The fields for the 101st and 103rd Congressional District codes in Record Type A were replaced with those designated for the 106th and 108th. However, these fields were blank in the 1994 TIGER/Line files. Record Type Z linked a Postal +4 Add-On code to an address range in either Record Type 1 or Record Type 6. TLID fields were matched on these records. If the RTSQ field on Record Type 6 contained a 0, the Postal +4 Add-On codes applied to the address ranges in Record Type 1. If the RTSQ field contained a number greater than 0, the Postal +4 AddOn codes applied to the address ranges in the Record Type 6 that had the identical RTSQ value.  I-16 VTDP/PSAP/TAZ Verification TIGER/Line  Files   Deleted Record Types In the 1994 TIGER/Line files, Record Types F and G were deleted because they were no longer used. Record Type F showed geographic codes as of January 1, 1990 that were corrected to resolve questions raised by local officials about the 1990 census data tabulations. Record Type G showed geographic codes (generally as of January 1, 1992) for those situations where geographic entities reported boundary changes during the U.S. Census Bureau's annual survey of governmental units. In the 1994 TIGER/Line files, information previously reported in Record Type G became implicit in the current geographic codes in Record Types 1 and S. Field Definition Changes The geographic area codes on Record Type 1 represented current geography rather than the 1990 census tabulation geography. The census tract and block remained as 1990 geography. In a few Type 1 records, the current state and county, when combined with the 1990 census tract and block, created nonexistent geographic areas. To avoid nonexistent geographic areas, it was important not to mix the 1990 geographic codes with the current geographic codes. The 1990 state, county, place, census tract, and census block codes all were found on Record Type 3. Record Type 3 no longer identified 1980 geographic area codes or contained census codes for places, minor civil divisions, and sub-minor civil divisions. These fields were replaced with the 1990 geographic areas that previously appeared in Record Type 1. Current geographic areas included on Record Type 3 were the Alaska Native Regional Corporations and the American Indian/Alaska Native Areas (AIANAs). Census Alaska Native Regional Corporation codes were eliminated from Record Type 1 and replaced by four fields. Two fields were reserved for census use. Two fields carried American Indian Trust Land Flags and contained two values, an ""I"" for individual trust land or a ""T"" for tribal trust land. The trust land flag more accurately portrayed the American Indian areas. Record Type 7 excluded key geographic locations (KGLs). These appeared in the new Record Type 9.  Introduction I-17   Address Ranges and ZIP Codes The 1994 TIGER/Line files contained improvements in address information. Address ranges were edited for overlaps or other inconsistencies and ZIP Codes were updated in selected areas. Coordinates In the 1994 TIGER/Line files, NAD27 was the coordinate datum used for the 48 contiguous states, the District of Columbia, Alaska, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. Regional datums were used for Hawaii and the Island Territories in the Pacific. The accuracy of the feature coordinates in Alaska was improved by shifting them in relation to a sample of points of known higher accuracy.  How to Use This Documentation The structure of this documentation is based on data content rather than record type content. For instance, information on addresses may appear in one section, but cross-references to other related sections also are included. In order to make the document easier to use as a reference, the text contains some repetition from section to section.  Chapter 1 Chapter 1 describes the basic concepts about the Census TIGER data base and the TIGER/Line products. It discusses the topology in the Census TIGER data base, the terminology used to describe the geographic data, and the record types that make up the TIGER/Line files. Chapter 1 also describes the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Spatial Data Transfer Standard (SDTS) nomenclature for geographic objects.  Chapter 2 Chapter 2 discusses the principle identification numbers forming the basis for record linkage discussed throughout the documentation.  Chapter 3 Chapter 3 discusses the attributes for the line, polygon, and landmark geographic objects.  I-18 VTDP/PSAP/TAZ Verification TIGER/Line  Files   Chapter 4 Chapter 4 defines the types of geographic entities and entity codes that appear in the TIGER/Line files. It also identifies the fundamental relationships among the different types of geographic entities.  Chapter 5 Chapter 5 summarizes the data quality aspects of the information in the Census TIGER data base using the SDTS quality modules.  Chapter 6 Chapter 6 lists the contents of the TIGER/Line file record types and provides a detailed description of the data fields in each. Use Chapter 6 in conjunction with Chapters 3 and 4 to locate the positions of specific data fields in the TIGER/Line files.

Introduction I-19    Chapter 1: Overview and Geographic Concepts Overview What Is TIGER? The U.S. Census Bureau's Census TIGER System automates the mapping and related geographic activities required to support the decennial census and sample survey programs of the U.S. Census Bureau starting with the 1990 decennial census. The Census TIGER System provides support for the following:  Creation and maintenance of a digital geographic data base that includes complete coverage of the United States, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands of the United States, and the Pacific Island Territories  Production of maps from the Census TIGER data base for all U.S. Census Bureau enumeration and publication programs  Ability to assign individual addresses to geographic entities and census blocks based on polygons formed by features such as roads and streams The design of the Census TIGER data base adapts the theories of topology, graph theory, and associated fields of mathematics to provide a disciplined, mathematical description for the geographic structure of the United States and its territories. The topological structure of the Census TIGER data base defines the location and relationship of streets, rivers, railroads, and other features to each other and to the numerous geographic entities for which the U.S. Census Bureau tabulates data from its censuses and sample surveys. It is designed to ensure that there is no duplication of features or areas. The building of the Census TIGER data base involved a variety of encoding techniques such as automated map scanning, manual map digitizing, standard data keying, and sophisticated computer file matching. The goal was to provide automated access to, and retrieval of, relevant geographic information about the United States and its territories.  Overview and Geographic Concepts 1- 1   TIGER Data Base Extracts In order for others to use the information in the Census TIGER data base in a geographic information system (GIS) or for other geographic applications, the U.S. Census Bureau releases periodic extracts of the data base, including the TIGER/Line files, to the public. Various versions of the TIGER/Line files have been released; previous versions include the 1990 Census TIGER/Line files, and the 1992, 1994, 1995, 1997 and 1998 TIGER/Line files. The 1992 TIGER/Line files were produced to satisfy a requirement of the U.S. Department of Education and incorporated all of the updates and revisions since the production of the 1990 TIGER/Line files. The 1994 TIGER/Line files were produced to support the programs of the U.S. Department of Transportation, Bureau of Transportation Statistics. The 1995 TIGER/Line files were originally produced to support Phase I of the Census 2000 Redistricting Data Program. The 1997 TIGER/Line files were originally produced to support the Phase I Verification of the Census 2000 Redistricting Data Program and the Census 2000 Participant Statistical Areas Program Delineation. The 1998 TIGER/Line files were originally produced to support the Census 2000 Redistricting Data Program, Phase 2, the Voting District Project (VTDP) and the Census 2000 Traffic Analysis Zone (TAZ) Program.  Relationship of TIGER/Line    to 1990 Census Statistical Data  What makes the TIGER extract products particularly valuable in the GIS environment and to the data user community is the direct linkage between the 1990 decennial census data products and the Census TIGER data base extracts. The digital description in the TIGER data base of the Nation's legal and statistical entities includes Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) codes and, for American Indian/Alaska Native Areas only, U.S. Census Bureau codes so entities can be easily matched with the 1990 census data. Please refer to the U.S. Census Bureau Publication, 1990 Census of Population and Housing Tabulation and Publication Program, for a description of the Public Law (PL) 94-171 data files, Summary Tape Files (STFs), and other sources of data from the 1990 census.  1-2 VTDP/PSAP/TAZ Verification TIGER/Line Files   1999 TIGER/Line Files The 1999 TIGER/Line files include files for all counties and statistically equivalent entities in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. The 1999 TIGER/Line files consist of line segments that represent physical features, and legal and statistical boundaries. The files consist of 17 separate record types, including the basic data record, the shape coordinate points (feature shape records), and geographic area codes that can be used with appropriate software to prepare maps.  Related Files Summary Tape Files (STFs) provide 1990 statistical data for a wide range of subject headings and geographic entities compatible with the TIGER/ Line files. These files are available on tape and CD-ROM. PL 94-171 Program (1990) data files provide selected 1990 population data for small area geography (state, county, county subdivision, place, census tract/block numbering area, block group, and block) and are compatible with the TIGER/Line files. These files are available on tape and CD-ROM. The TIGER/Line 103rd Congressional District File contains just the features that form the boundaries of the districts of the 103rd Congress. The file follows the format of Record Types 1 and 2 of the 1992 TIGER/ Line files. This is a national data set, by state, on one CD-ROM. North American Statistical Areas Boundary Files (Prototype), were produced by a joint research initiative between the Geography Divisions of Statistics Canada and the United States Bureau of the Census. The goal of the files is to provide data users with a convenient, unified, geographical framework that will help facilitate cross-border spatial studies. The files are in TIGER/Line format and contain geographic coordinates, various attribute information, and most importantly, geographic identification codes that can be used as links to census data from Canada and the United States.  Overview and Geographic Concepts 1- 3   County-Based Files The geographic coverage for a TIGER/Line file is a county or statistically equivalent entity. See Appendix A for a list of state and county codes and Chapter 4 for a description of county equivalent entities. The county files have a coverage area based on the latest legal boundaries obtained in response to the U.S. Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS). Since the 1990 Census, there have been several changes to the universe of county or statistically equivalent entities. Such changes result in the creation of new separate TIGER/Line files that did not exist for the 1990 Census or the disappearance of TIGER/Line files that existed for previous versions if a county or equivalent becomes part of surrounding or adjacent counties. Even though the Census TIGER data base represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, the countybased TIGER/Line files are designed to stand alone as an independent data set. The files can be combined to cover the whole Nation and its territories (see the Single-Side Flags and County Boundaries section in Chapter 3).  The Data Content of the TIGER/Line Files The TIGER/Line files contain data describing three major types of features:  Line features 1) Roads 2) Railroads 3) Hydrography 4) Miscellaneous transportation features and selected power lines and pipe lines 5) Boundaries   Landmark features 1) Point landmarks such as schools and churches 2) Area landmarks such as parks and cemeteries 3) Key geographic locations (KGLs) such as apartment buildings and factories   Polygon features 1) Geographic entity codes for areas used to tabulate the 1990 census statistical data and current geographic areas 2) Locations of area landmarks 3) Locations of KGLs  1-4 VTDP/PSAP/TAZ Verification TIGER/Line Files   The line feature and polygon information form the majority of data in the TIGER/Line files. Some of the data describing the lines include coordinates, feature identifiers (names), feature classification codes, address ranges, and geographic entity codes. Chapter 3 details these data items; Chapter 4 defines the geographic entities and codes. The TIGER/Line files contain point and area labels that describe landmark features. These features provide locational references for field staff and map users. Area landmarks consist of a feature name or label and feature type assigned to a polygon or group of polygons. Landmarks may overlap or refer to the same set of polygons. See Chapter 3 for more information on landmark data.  Topology and Spatial Objects in the TIGER/Line Files Spatial Objects in the TIGER/Line Files The Census TIGER data base uses a collection of spatial objects, points, lines, and polygons, to model or describe real-world geography. The U.S. Census Bureau uses these spatial objects to represent features such as streets, and assigns attributes to these features to identify and describe specific features such as the 500 block of Market Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The TIGER/Line files contain information about the spatial objects distributed over a series of record types. Users of the TIGER/Line files may need to link information from several record types to find all the attributes of interest that belong to one spatial object. The final section of this chapter includes a description of the record types.  Topology Topology explains how points, lines, and areas relate to each other and is used as the foundation for organizing spatial objects in the Census TIGER data base. The Census TIGER data base uses points, lines, and areas to provide a disciplined, mathematical description of the features of the earth's surface. Spatial objects in the Census TIGER data base are interrelated. A sequence of points define line segments, and line segments connect to define polygons.  Overview and Geographic Concepts 1- 5   Topology provides a basic language for describing geographic features. The Census TIGER data base relates information to points or 0-cells, lines or 1-cells, and polygons or 2-cells. The number preceding the cell identifies the dimensionality of the object; for instance, a line segment has a single dimension, length. Each of these objects builds on the others to form higher-level objects. The 0-cells form the end points of 1-cells. The 1-cells connect at 0-cells and form closed figures that partition space into polygons or 2-cells.  Terminology The terms point, line segment, and polygon are familiar, but general terms that may have different meanings to data users working with a variety of different applications and data sets. The TIGER/Line file documentation uses the terminology from the Spatial Data Transfer Standard (SDTS). Since the first release of the TIGER/Line files, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has coordinated the development and release of the SDTS, now a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS). The SDTS specifies a series of terms and definitions for spatial objects. Why use the SDTS terminology? Even though the TIGER/Line files do not follow the SDTS format, the TIGER/Line documentation will use these terms and definitions in order to promote a common language for describing geographic data and to facilitate the transition to the SDTS. The spatial objects in TIGER/Line belong to the ""Geometry and  Topology"" (GT) class of objects in SDTS. The definitions are from FIPS Publication 173, Spatial Data Transfer Standard (SDTS) (August 28, 1992) Section 2-2, ""Classification and Intended Use of Objects,"" pp. 11-20. Node ""A zero-dimensional object that is a topological junction of two or more links or chains, or an end point of a link or chain,"" is a node.  1-6 VTDP/PSAP/TAZ Verification TIGER/Line Files   Entity Point ""A point used for identifying the location of point features (or areal features collapsed to a point), such as towers, buoys, buildings, places, etc."" Complete Chain ""A chain [a sequence of non-intersecting line segments] that explicitly references left and right polygons and start and end nodes."" The shape points combine with the nodes to form the segments that make a complete chain. Network Chains ""A chain that explicitly references start and end nodes and not left and right polygons."" GT-Polygon ""An area that is an atomic two-dimensional component of a two-dimensional manifold, [which is defined as] one and only one planar graph and its two-dimensional objects."" GT-polygons are elementary polygons that are mutually exclusive and completely exhaust the surface.  Spatial Objects The spatial objects in the TIGER/Line files embody both geometry (coordinate location and shape) and topology (the relationship between points, line objects, and polygons) and therefore belong to the geometry and topology (GT) class of objects in the SDTS. In the SDTS, nodes represent point objects (0-cells) that identify the start and end position of lines or 1-dimensional objects (1-cells) called chains. The chains in the TIGER/ Line files are complete chains because they form polygon boundaries and intersect other chains only at nodes. Topological chains that do not contain polygon information are network chains. Data users may choose not to use the polygon or geographic entity codes and consider the TIGER/ Line files a source of network chain data. Figure 1-1 illustrates the relationship between nodes and complete chains. The figure shows two complete chains forming a central road; a start and end node define each complete chain. Complete chains that meet at an intersection share the same node. As the figure suggests, complete chains may consist of one or more line segments that describe the shape and position of the complete chain. Shape points define the  Overview and Geographic Concepts 1- 7   Figure 1-1 Basic TIGER/Line File Topology The illustration below shows a generalized block that consists of three GT-polygons (GT stands for geometry and topology). The block contains a point landmark (Parkside School) inside GT-polygon 2 and an area landmark (Friendship Park) that is coextensive with GT-polygon 3.  Entity Point/Point Landmark location (entity points are independent of the GT-polygon complete chain topology)  Start Node  School Ave There are two shape points on the complete chain that extends from the start node to the end node.  Parkside School  GT-POLYGON 2  GT-POLYGON 1  End Node  Friendship Park This complete chain does not form a polygon boundary.  GT-POLYGON 3  Park Ave  Actual Street Curb Location Node--A zero-dimensional object that incorporates topology and geometry. Each marks the intersection or end point of a complete chain.  Shape Point-- A zero-dimensional object that defines the curvature of a complete chain, but is not required to describe the topology of the complete chain (unlike nodes at intersections or end points). Point Landmark--An entity point that identifies the location of a point landmark. Polygon Interior Points--A point associated with, and inside of, a polygon. Complete Chain--A one-dimensional object having topological and geometric characteristics.  1-8 VTDP/PSAP/TAZ Verification TIGER/Line Files   line segments and are not part of the topology of the TIGER/Line files. Shape points and the resulting line segments are attributes of the complete chains. When complete chains link node to node and form a closed figure (a 2-cell), a GT-polygon results. The GT-polygon containing Friendship Park in Figure 1-1 is bounded by five complete chains that share five nodes. GT-polygons are elementary units; they are not subdivided into smaller polygons. The polygons completely encompass the area they represent and there is no gap or overlap between adjacent polygons. The geographic entities and area landmarks in the TIGER/Line files are associated with one, or a set of GT-polygons. The TIGER/Line files contain point landmark data that are not included in the Census TIGER data base topology. Point landmarks are entity points that mark the location of points of interest and are not connected to complete chains or GT-polygons. The following table summarizes the terms for spatial objects in the TIGER/Line files: Point (0-cell) Topology Non-topology Attribute Node Entity Point Shape Point Line (1-cell) Complete Chain or Network Chain Polygon (2-cell) GT-polygon  Features The Census TIGER data base uses the term feature to informally describe spatial objects more complex than nodes, complete chains, or GT-polygons. For instance, Main Street is a feature that may consist of a series of complete chains with the same name. The Census TIGER data base contains complete chains, but does not contain features or link complete chains to features.  Overview and Geographic Concepts 1- 9   Left- and Right-Side Data Fields If one is standing on a complete chain at the start node facing the end node, data listed in the fields carrying a right qualifier would be found to the right of the complete chain. Notice the position of the start and end nodes for the road in the central section of Figure 1-1; the rightside of the complete chain corresponds to GT-polygon 1 and the leftside corresponds to GT-polygon 2. From the information contained in this basic record, data users can collect the complete chains necessary to construct intersecting polygons and features.  Single-Layer Topology All spatial objects in the TIGER/Line files exist in a single data layer that includes roads, hydrography, railroads, boundary lines, and miscellaneous features; they are topologically linked. For instance, nodes mark the intersections of roads and rivers. Subsurface features such as tunnels or above surface features such as bridges also create nodes when they cross surface features even though there is no direct realworld connection.  Introduction to the TIGER/Line    File Structure  The 1999 TIGER/Line files are extracts of selected information from the Census TIGER data base, organized as topologically consistent networks. The records in these TIGER/Line files represent features traditionally found on a paper map. Each complete chain is classified by codes that describe the type of feature it represents. The 1999 TIGER/Line files consist of 17 record types that collectively contain geographic information (attributes) such as address ranges and ZIP Codes and their Add-On codes for street complete chains, names, feature classification codes, codes for legal and statistical entities, latitude/ longitude coordinates of linear and point features, landmark features, area landmarks, key geographic features, and area and polygon boundaries. Some counties or county equivalents do not require all of the 17 record types and therefore have less than 17 files. If the types of data contained in Record Types 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, and Z are not appropriate for a given county or county equivalent, then the U.S. Census Bureau does not include files for those record types. 1-10 VTDP/PSAP/TAZ Verification TIGER/Line  Files   The file for each county (or equivalent) is identified by the state and county FIPS code after the ""tgr"" in the file name (for example, tgr42107.rt1). The suffixes used for the record type files have been changed to make it easier to identify each record type file (when working with uncompressed versions of the county files). The suffix consistently is .rtn where n is the record type. The TIGER/Line data dictionary in Chapter 6 contains a complete list of all the fields in the 17 record types. Separate chapters cross-list the fields by feature attribute and geographic entity type. The next section provides a summary of 1999 TIGER/Line file record types.  1999 TIGER/Line File Record Types Record Type 1 -- Complete Chain Basic Data Record Record Type 1 provides a single record for each unique complete chain in the TIGER/Line files. The basic data record contains the end nodes for the complete chain. This record also contains address ranges and ZIP Codes (for most areas of the country where a street name/house numbering system existed at the time of data extraction from the Census TIGER data base) and the current census geographic entity codes for each side of the complete chain. Additional feature identifier, address range, and ZIP Code data related to Record Type 1 are found on Record Types 4, 5, 6, and Z. Additional current and 1990 geographic entity codes related to Record Type 1 are found on Record Type 3.  Record Type 2 -- Complete Chain Shape Coordinates Record Type 2 provides an additional series of latitude and longitude coordinate values describing the shape of each complete chain in Record Type 1 that is not a straight line segment. That is, not all complete chains in Record Type 1 have shape points and therefore not all have an associated Record Type 2. Where a complete chain in Record Type 1 is not a straight line, Record Type 2 may have a many-to-one relationship with Record Type 1.  Overview and Geographic Concepts 1- 11   Record Type 3 -- Complete Chain Geographic Entity Codes Record Type 3 includes the current U.S. Census Bureau geographic area codes for the American Indian/Alaska Native areas including Tribal jurisdiction statistical areas (TJSAs), Tribal designated statistical areas (TDSAs), and Alaska Native Village statistical areas (ANVSAs); and the Alaska Native Regional Corporations. It also includes 1990 geographic codes for a variety of geographic area types. In the 1994 and later TIGER/Line files, all references to the 1980 geographic area codes have been eliminated. In addition, many fields have been replaced with the geographic area codes that were used to tabulate the 1990 census. These codes were previously in Record Type 1. Record Type 3 has a one-to-one relationship with Record Type 1. To identify the 1990 census state and county codes for a complete chain, one must use Record Type 3.  Record Type 4 -- Index to Alternate Feature Identifiers Record Type 4 provides an index to alternate feature names associated with the complete chain (Record Type 1). A Record Type 4 will not exist for a Record Type 1 that has only one name. A complete chain can have more than one alternate name. Record Type 4 has a many-toone relationship with Record Type 1 and a many-to-one relationship with Record Type 5.  Record Type 5 -- Complete Chain Feature Identifiers Record Type 5 contains a list of all unique feature names for complete chains in the TIGER/Line files. Each name (or feature identifier) has an identification code number (FEAT). Record Type 5 has a one-to-many relationship with Record Type 4 and a one-to-many relationship with Record Type 9.  Record Type 6 -- Additional Address Range and ZIP Code Data Record Type 6 provides additional address range information for a street complete chain when the information cannot be presented as a single address range (for example, the house/building numbers are not uniformly arranged to form an address range). Record Type 6 appears only for those counties that have address ranges and ZIP Code information 1-12 VTDP/PSAP/TAZ Verification TIGER/Line  Files   in the Census TIGER data base. There is no assurance that the address ranges provided on Record Type 6 will cover fewer addresses than the address ranges appearing on Record Type 1. Data users must use Record Type 6 to obtain the entire picture of the potential address ranges along a complete chain. The address ranges used for geocoding along corporate corridors and corporate offset limits appear only in Record Type 6. Record Type 6 has a many-to-one relationship with Record Type 1 and a one-toone relationship with Record Type Z.  Record Type 7 -- Landmark Features Record Type 7 contains the area and point landmarks from the Census TIGER data base. If Record Type 7 represents an area landmark rather than a point landmark, then a one-to-one relationship exists with Record Type 8. If a county file has no landmarks, empty files for Record Types 7 or 8 will exist for that county. Record Type 7 now excludes all key geographic locations (KGLs) that contain an actual or imputed address and have a ZIP+4 Add-On code. These will now appear in Record Type 9.  Record Type 8 -- Polygons Linked to Area Landmarks Record Type 8 links the polygon identification codes with the area landmark identification codes. If a county file does not have any area landmarks in Record Type 7, there will be no Type 8 records. Record Type 8 has a manyto-many relationship with Record Type P.  Record Type 9 -- Key Geographic Location Features Record Type 9 consists only of KGLs in the Census TIGER data base that have an actual or imputed address and a ZIP+4 Add-On code. This record type lists the names and structure numbers of special geocoding addresses such as named apartment buildings, shopping centers, and airports. If the structure number of the special geocoding address is a street address, then the FEAT field links Record Type 9 to Record Type 5 where the street name associated with the address is listed. The KGLs contained in this record type are not included in Record Types 7 or 8, and have no LAND (landmark identification number). Record Type 9 has a many-to-one relationship with Record Type P.  Overview and Geographic Concepts 1- 13   Record Type A -- Polygon Geographic Entity Codes Record Type A contains a record for each polygon represented by Record Type P in the TIGER/Line files. The U.S. Census Bureau provides the basic 1990 census geographic entity codes--state, county, county subdivision, place, American Indian/Alaska Native Areas, census tract/BNA, block-- on this record type to assist data users who are interested only in polygon information. Record Type A also includes the school district codes, and urban/rural classification information, as well as fields for the 106th and 108th Congressional Districts (the 108th field is blank for this release).  Record Type C -- Geographic Entity Names Record Type C provides a unique list of all geographic codes, their associated name, and some entity attributes in a flat (nonhierarchical) file. It contains a Data Year field that may have several values: 1990 for geographic names and codes valid for the 1990 census, 199n (where 199n is the year of extraction from the Census TIGER data base) for geographic names and codes valid for the current year, blank when the geographic names and codes are the same as for 1990 and 199n, or 2000 when the geographic names and codes reference 2000 (TENTATIVE) geographic entities. Information in fields with a DATAYR equal to 2000 are subject to change. Data users should not use this information as the Census 2000 geographic codes. Multiple records for the same geographic entity show its change or correction over time. Record Type C is linked to other record types (1, 3, A, S) through geographic area codes.  Record Type H -- TIGER/Line ID History Record Type H provides the history of each TIGER/Line ID when complete chains (Record Type 1) are split or merged, but the source of the change will be blank for this version. Record Type H shows the TLIDs of the complete chains in existence after the split or prior to the merge.  Record Type I -- Link Between Complete Chains and Polygons Record Type I links Record Type 1, the complete chain basic data, to Record Type P, the polygon internal point. The Record Type I to Record Type 1 link (TLID) may be used to link complete chain attributes and other data record types (2, 3, 4, 6, H, and Z) to each other. The Record I  1-14 VTDP/PSAP/TAZ Verification TIGER/Line  Files   to Record Type P link (CENID and POLYID) may be used to link polygon attributes and other data record types (8, 9, A, and S) to each other. Record Type I has a one-to-one relationship with Record Type 1, but a many-toone relationship with Record Type P. When Record Type I is linked to a single-sided Record Type 1 (county boundary), it will provide only the left- or the right-polygon identifier.  Record Type P -- Polygon Internal Point There is a Record Type P for every polygon in the TIGER/Line files. Record Type P has a one-to-many relationship with Record Type I and identifies the internal point coordinates for each polygon. See the Internal Points section in Chapter 3. The TIGER/Line files include all complete chains and polygons in the Census TIGER data base. The topology of the Census TIGER data base ensures that a one-to-one relationship exists between the polygons constructed from Record Types 1 and 2 and Record Type P.  Record Type R -- TIGER/Line ID Record Number Range Record Type R contains the range of unique complete chain record numbers (TLIDs) assigned to a census file in a nationwide scheme. Record Type R has the lowest (minimum allowable), and the highest (maximum allowable) record numbers for the range. Numbers are assigned to complete chains beginning at the lowest value. The current number is the highest record number for the census file used. Each TIGER/Line file consists of an entire county or statistical equivalent. In the Census TIGER data base, the county or statistical equivalent may be split into many partitions. The U.S. Census Bureau assigns permanent record numbers to each of these partitions. These record numbers are found in Record Type R. Record Type R is not directly linked to any other record type.  Record Type S -- Polygon Additional Geographic Entity Codes Record Type S contains a record for each polygon represented by Record Type P in the TIGER/Line files. Record Type S contains geographic area codes that identify polygons. Most of the geographic area codes reflect  Overview and Geographic Concepts 1- 15   2000 (TENTATIVE) geography and are subject to change. The U.S. Census Bureau is using these fields to exchange data with local partners participating in U.S. Census Bureau programs. Data users should not use this information as the Census 2000 geographic codes. Fields identified as 2000 (TENTATIVE) are intended for use by program participants only.  Record Type Z -- ZIP+4 Codes Record Type Z provides Postal +4 Add-On codes that make ZIP+4 codes out of the ZIP Codes on Type 1 and Type 6 records. Record Type Z has a one-to-one relationship with Record Type 1 and a one-to-one relationship with Record Type 6.  The Relationship Between Spatial Objects and TIGER/Line  Record Types The TIGER/Line files do not have specific record types for each spatial object. Nodes, for example, do not have a separate record type; node coordinates appear with other data in Record Type 1. Defining a complete chain requires information from Record Types 1, 2, and I. Record Types 1 and 2 alone describe the set of network chains. GT-polygons require the combined information of Record Types 1, 2, I, and P. See Chapter 3 for a discussion on how to link data using different types of spatial objects.  Linkages Between Record Types All the record types except Record Type R contain fields (such as TLID, FEAT, CENID, POLYID, LAND, or a geographic area code) that are used to link together data from the record types. Chapter 2 discusses the TLID, CENID, POLYID, and LAND identification codes in detail. Figure 1-2 shows the record linkage keys. When different record types have a common key with the same data, a linkage can be made between the records. Some of the links are direct, while others are indirect and require a connection through an intermediate record type. An entire TIGER/Line file can be navigated using the record linkage keys.  1-16 VTDP/PSAP/TAZ Verification TIGER/Line  Files   Linkages may be made to data external to a TIGER/Line file. Record Types 1, 3, and A contain geographic area code keys--the current or 1990 census geographic entity codes--that may be linked to the U.S. Census Bureau's statistical data (the PL 94-171 data and the several Summary Tape Files or STFs). For the PL 94-171 data and STFs based on 1990 census data, one must use Record Type 3 or Record Type A. With geographic information systems for processing and display, data users can use the geographic area codes to link data tabulations with the geographic data.

All record types have a 4-character field for the version code. For releases after TIGER/Line 1995, including this release, the version code is assigned as ""MMYY"" which represents the month and year that the file was created. The month and year are currently extracted from the system date as each county file is created. This means that county files created for the same program are likely to have different version codes. Adjacent counties in a state may have different version codes if they were extracted at different points in time. This will make it easier for users to determine the latest version of the data if they have several versions of the TIGER/Line files for a county. The version codes for earlier releases of the TIGER/Line files are as follows: 0000 -- TIGER/Line Precensus Files, 1990 0002 -- TIGER/Line Initial Voting District Codes Files, 1990 0003 -- TIGER/Line Files, 1990 0005 -- TIGER/Line Files, 1992 0021 -- TIGER/Line Files, 1994 0024 -- TIGER/Line Files, 1995 0697 to 1098 -- TIGER/Line  Files, 1997 1298 to 0499 -- TIGER/Line  Files, 1998  TIGER/Line Identification Number (TLID) The TIGER/Line files use a permanent 10-digit TIGER/Line record identification number (TLID) to uniquely identify a complete chain for the Nation.  TLID Codes The 10-digit TLID will not exceed the value 231  1 (2,147,483,647) and will represent the same complete chain in all versions of this file, beginning with the TIGER/Line Precensus Files, 1990. The minimum value is 100,001.  Version Code and Identification Numbers 2-1   Topological changes to the complete chain will cause the TLIDs to change. For instance, when updates split an existing complete chain, each of the new parts receives a new TLID; the old TLID is not reused. As distributed, TIGER/Line files are grouped by county (or equivalent). A complete chain representing a segment of the boundary between two neighboring counties will have different TLID codes even though the complete chain represents the exact same feature on the ground. See the section, User-Defined Changes to the TIGER/Line Files, in this chapter. Record Type R contains the range of unique complete chain record numbers assigned to a census file in a nationwide scheme. Record Type R has the lowest (minimum) and the highest (maximum) record numbers for the range. Permanent record numbers are assigned within each partition of the Census TIGER data base. Numbers are assigned to complete chains beginning at the minimum value and increasing the current value by one until it reaches the maximum value. Record Type H, which first appeared in the 1994 version, shows the history of a particular TLID, whether combined or split, and its predecessors or successors.  TLID Record Locations The TLID field appears in columns 6 through 15 of the following record types:     Record Record Record Record Type Type Type Type 1 2 3 4  Record Type 6  Record Type I  Record Type Z  The TLID field appears in columns 11 through 20 in Record Type H.  TLID Record Linkages The TLID field provides a key for linking records containing primary attributes describing the complete chain or the geographic entity codes associated with the left and the right sides of the complete chain. Record Type I contains the key fields required to link the TLID and the GT-polygon identification fields, CENID and POLYID. See Figure 1-2 in Chapter 1.  2-2 VTDP/PSAP/TAZ Verification TIGER/Line Files   TLID Sort Sequence Each record type is a separate file. The records in each record type do not have an overall sort sequence. Data users may wish to sort the file by TLID in order to facilitate record linkages.  User-Defined Changes to the TIGER/Line    Files  TLID as a Standard Identification Number Users should store the record number and the version code associated with each complete chain in their local systems to ensure their ability to match records with earlier or later versions of the TIGER/Line files. The record and version numbers of each complete chain provide an important link to the corresponding complete chain in the Census TIGER data base. This key will allow users to transfer new information from later U.S. Census Bureau TIGER/Line releases into their data base, and to provide the U.S. Census Bureau with readily usable updates, should they wish to do so.  Feature Changes Users should assign a new record number (TLID) and a version number with a value greater than 5000 to each new complete chain they create in order to avoid duplicating a U.S. Census Bureau-assigned record number that may appear elsewhere in the national file. Users should create a new record for each new complete chain, including those formed when a new intersection splits an existing complete chain. If a complete chain has been assigned different feature identifiers, attributes, and/or coordinate positions without being merged with or split from another complete chain, it is a modified complete chain and does not need a new TLID. Users may wish to mark these changes; the U.S. Census Bureau will use this information to identify changes more quickly and accurately. Users should assign a version code equal to 4999 for all deleted complete chain and landmark records. This version code will allow the U.S. Census Bureau to positively identify all user deletions. Users may assign or reassign polygon and landmark identification numbers in any manner that uniquely identifies each within a file.  Version Code and Identification Numbers 2-3   TIGER/Line Polygon Identification Numbers (CENID, POLYID) The U.S. Census Bureau uses two fields, the census file identification code (CENID) and the polygon identification code (POLYID), to uniquely identify GT-polygons. The CENID is a U.S. Census Bureau alphanumeric identifier used to uniquely number the GT-polygons within its TIGER partitions. Since the partitions may include only a portion of a county, the TIGER/Line files may contain multiple CENIDs. The polygon identification number (POLYID) is a temporary number assigned to every polygon in the Census TIGER data base. Although this number is part of the data base design, it is a dynamic number and can change between different versions of the TIGER/Line files. The Census TIGER data base does not contain permanent identifiers for GT-polygons as it does for complete chains. POLYID is unique only within CENID; in cases where a TIGER/Line file contains more than one CENID, the POLYID may not be unique within that file. Within each CENID, the value for the POLYID starts with ""1"" and increments sequentially until all polygons are numbered.  CENID and POLYID Codes In the 1992 and 1994 versions of the TIGER/Line files, the CENID is a 5-digit numeric code. In the 1995, 1997, 1998, and the 1999 TIGER/Line files, the CENID is a 5-character alpha-numeric code to allow for a wider range of codes without increasing field length. Record Type R contains a list of all valid CENIDs used in each county TIGER/Line file. The POLYID code is an integer identification number, without leading zeros, applied to each GT-polygon. The POLYID with a value of 1 refers to the universal polygon, the polygon that refers to all space outside a county coverage area and is excluded from Record Types A, I, P, and S. The range of POLYID numbers in a county file may contain gaps or skipped numbers resulting from the use of one partition (CENID) for more than one TIGER/Line county file. POLYID numbers also may  2-4 VTDP/PSAP/TAZ Verification TIGER/Line Files   duplicate in a single TIGER/Line  file as they are unique only within CENID. A single TIGER/Line file may contain CENID information from many other census files. Either the CENIDL and POLYIDL, or CENIDR and POLYIDR fields in Record Type I will have a blank value where the complete chain is a county boundary.  CENID and POLYID Record Locations The CENID and POLYID fields appear in the following record types:  Record Type 8 -- Records exist only for area landmark GT-polygons  Record Type 9 -- Records exist for all KGLs  Record Type A -- Records exist for all GT-polygons  Record Type I -- Contains left- and right-side CENIDs and POLYIDs associated with each complete chain  Record Type P -- Records exist for all GT-polygons  Record Type R -- Contains only CENID; Record Type R lists the minimum and maximum possible TLIDs, and the highest TLID from each census file (CENID) used to generate the current version of the TIGER/Line  files.  Record Type S -- Records exist for all GT-polygons  CENID and POLYID Record Linkages The TIGER/Line files use both the CENID and POLYID fields to link all of the polygon record types together (Record Types A, P, and S), to link the GT-polygons to the associated complete chains, and to link area landmarks to GT-polygons (see Figure 1-2, in Chapter 1). The CENID and POLYID fields link the geographic area codes in Record Types A and S to Record Type P which contains the coordinates for an internal point in the GT-polygon. The TIGER/Line files include a Type A and a Type S record for each Type P record. Record Type I provides a link between the GT-polygon records and the record types containing complete chain attributes (Record Types 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6). Each Type I record identifies a complete chain by TLID with  Version Code and Identification Numbers 2-5   a left- and right-side GT-polygon. Here CENIDL and POLYIDL contain the CENID and POLYID codes for the GT-polygon on the left side of the line. Likewise, CENIDR and POLYIDR contain the CENID and POLYID codes for the GT-polygon on the right side of the line. There is a Type I record for each Type 1 record. All CENID and POLYID codes appear in Record Type I. To find all of the complete chains that form the boundary of a specific GT-polygon, search Record Type I for a match with either the left or the right CENID and POLYID. Where the left and the right CENID and POLYID codes are the same, the complete chain is internal to the GT-polygon (e.g., a dead-end street). Record Type 8 provides a link between the GT-polygons and the landmark feature records. See the section, TIGER/Line Landmark Identification Numbers, in this chapter.  CENID and POLYID Sort Sequence The POLYID codes appear in numeric sequence by alphanumeric CENID in Record Types 9, A, P, and S. There is no systematic CENID or POLYID sequence in Record Type I.  TIGER/Line Landmark Identification Numbers (LAND) The landmark feature identification number (LAND) is a 10-digit number that uniquely identifies both point and area landmarks within each county file. LAND is not a permanent number; the U.S. Census Bureau assigns LANDs each time a new version of the TIGER/Line files is produced. Within each county, LANDs are assigned beginning with ""1"" and are incremented sequentially until all features are numbered. In rare situations, Record Type 7 may list the same LAND number more than once if the landmark has more than one feature name. Each name appears as a separate data record in Record Type 7. These data records describe the same landmark and have the same LAND.  2-6 VTDP/PSAP/TAZ Verification TIGER/Line Files   Overlapping landmarks (e.g., a pond located in a park) may cause more than one name to be assigned to a GT-polygon. However, overlapping landmarks are separate features with different LANDs.  LAND Codes The LAND is an integer number that does not contain leading zeros. It is assigned during the extraction of the data and is not a permanent number. There may be gaps in the sequence of the LANDs in Record Type 7 because of the way this information is extracted.  LAND Record Locations The LAND field appears in the following record types:  Record Type 7 -- Landmark attributes  Record Type 8 -- Linkage record containing the LAND and the CENID and POLYID fields  LAND Record Linkages Record Type 8 links each area landmark's LAND with a CENID and POLYID. Each area landmark will have one or more Type 8 records that together identify all of the GT-polygons that make up the landmark.  LAND Sort Sequence Record Type 7 and 8 contain records sorted in ascending order by LAND. In Record Type 8, each LAND is repeated for each GT-polygon covered by the area landmark.  Version Code and Identification Numbers 2-7    Chapter 3: Attributes of Geographic Objects Line Features Line features consist of one or more complete chains that share common attributes such as feature identifiers, address ranges, and census feature class descriptions.  Feature Identifiers The feature identification fields contain either a general type label or a specific proper name assigned to a complete chain that identifies the feature. Each complete chain that is a part of a named feature, such as US Highway 1, has the same feature identifier. The TIGER/Line files use several related data fields to provide a structured description of the feature identifier:     Feature Feature Feature Feature Direction Prefix (e.g., N Adams Ave) Name (e.g., US Highway 1 , Jefferson St) Type (Roosevelt Blvd, Mangosteen River ) Direction Suffix (e.g., Providence St NE)  Most named street/highway features have a feature type. Numerous exceptions exist; for example, Broadway consists of a feature name with no type specified. Do not confuse feature types that form proper names with the census feature classification scheme. In the Census TIGER data base, feature names are assigned to line features independently of the census feature class codes (CFCCs) of the line features. For example, major airports usually have an express highway leading to the terminal area. This highway does not have an interstate highway name such as I-95, but may have the CFCC of an interstate highway (A11) because it has the same characteristics as an interstate highway (limited access with separated, multiple lanes). The feature identifiers of line features that are roads may include either a direction prefix or suffix. Some may have both a direction prefix and suffix.  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3-1   The feature name fields for line features that are roads may contain both a name and a feature type. For all hydrography and non-road features, the feature type will follow the feature name in the feature name field. In some instances, the feature type is commonly considered part of the name and is combined with the feature name in the TIGER/Line files to avoid confusion; for example, US Hwy 1. The Census TIGER System identifies US Hwy as a feature type used as a prefix to the name and 1 as the feature name. The feature types, such as US Highway, State Highway, and Interstate that normally precede the name appear in the name field. Generic feature identifiers have a name listed in the names field, but do not have a feature type or direction. Some examples of generic names include ramp, power line, and reservoir. Generic feature identifiers are selectively added to features that do not have proper names. In most cases, complete chains without proper names have no feature identifier. The TIGER/Line files do not support a data level above the complete chain that allows the construction of higher level objects (features). Complete chains with the same name may represent separate features; for example, a county may contain several Main Streets located in different geographic entities (e.g., towns or cities) scattered throughout the county. The ability to group chains together to include the entire length of a street feature, such as US Route 66, depends on the uniqueness of the identifiers and the consistency of the feature identifiers along the length of the feature. The U.S. Census Bureau makes no guarantee that the complete chains have uniform names or contain all of the known feature identifiers. The U.S. Census Bureau has taken steps to improve the consistency of feature identifiers and to add feature identifiers to fill in gaps along street features. The U.S. Census Bureau also has eliminated some alternate spellings in favor of the spelling confirmed by the ZIP+4 file of the U.S. Postal Service. The census feature class codes (CFCCs) may vary for chains with the same feature identifier. For example, the most frequent CFCC for a state highway is A21, but the complete chains marking the location of State Highway 32 may have a CFCC of A01, A21, or A31 (see the Census Feature Class Codes section in this chapter).  3-2 VTDP/PSAP/TAZ Verification TIGER/Line Files   The TIGER/Line file structure allows up to 4,996 feature identifiers for a complete chain. The primary feature identifier appears in Record Type 1. For street features, the primary feature identifier is usually the name most commonly associated with the address range. Up to five alternate feature identifiers are cross-referenced in each Type 4 record, and a single complete chain can have up to 999 Type 4 records. Alternate feature identifiers include highway designation numbers for named streets, former names, and alternate spellings where source material provided conflicting data. Where the complete chain represents a limited access highway, the highway type and route designator, such as I-95, should ideally become the primary name, and the local designation, such as Cross County Expressway or Capital Beltway, should become the alternate name. However, this is not always true in the TIGER/Line files. The primary and alternate feature identifiers can be independent of each other. There is no assurance that the same combination of primary and alternate feature identifiers will appear together in a sequence of complete chains. There also is no assurance that a feature identifier will consistently appear as the primary identifier; it might be recorded as an alternate feature identifier for some complete chains and a primary feature identifier for others. During TIGER improvement operations, the U.S. Census Bureau has taken steps to make the Interstate highway route designator the primary feature identifier for Interstate highways, and the common street name used in mail delivery the primary name on all other roads. The order of identifiers follows this hierarchy: Interstate highway, common name, US highway, county highway, with town and township road at the bottom of the list. Record Type 5 contains a record for each feature identifier used as either a primary or an alternate name. The TIGER/Line files link the alternate names in Record Type 5 to Record Type 1 through the use of the alternate feature identification code index that forms Record Type 4. See the Feature Identifier Record Linkage section in this chapter.

Feature names contain upper- and lower-case characters. The feature name is truncated if it is over 30 characters long. The Census Bureau is no longer using codes to represent the diacritical marks. Beginning with the 1999 TIGER/Line files, the Census Bureau is using the ISO 8859-1 character set, commonly referred to as Latin-1, to identify characters with diacritical marks. ISO 8859-1 is not ASCII or ""extended ASCII,"" but rather ASCII compatible in that the first 127  3-4 VTDP/PSAP/TAZ Verification TIGER/Line Files   character codes of ISO 8859-1 are identical to ASCII. ISO 8859-1 uses the space left vacant by ASCII in the 8 bit range to represent additional characters. The following 16 characters from the ISO 8859-1 may appear in the 1999 TIGER/Line files: Character                 Name A-Acute Accent a-Acute Accent E-Acute Accent e-Acute Accent I-Acute Accent i-Acute Accent N-Tilde n-Tilde O-Acute Accent o-Acute Accent U-Acute Accent u-Acute Accent U-Diaresis u-Diaresis A Ring a Ring ISO (dec, hex) 193,c1 225,e1 201,c9 233,e9 205,cd 237,ed 209,d1 241,f1 211,d3 243,f3 218,da 250,fa 220,dc 252,fc 197,c5 229,e5  In the 1998 and earlier TIGER/Line files the Census Bureau used the following codes to represent diacritical marks: ] [ # Preceding character has an acute accent () Preceding character has a dieresis () Preceding character has a tilde (~)  The feature name field may contain abbreviations to represent some feature types. See Appendix D--Standard Abbreviations.  Feature Types The feature type field for road features consists of a 4-character text string. For all hydrography and non-road features, the feature type will follow the feature name in the feature name field. The abbreviations in Appendix D--Standard Abbreviations may appear in the feature type field or the feature name field. Attributes of Geographic Objects 3-5   Data Limitations and Notes In earlier versions of the TIGER/Line files, users did not find many roads with alternate names in the GBF/DIME-File coverage areas; if an alternate name was provided, it usually represented another local name and not a route number. TIGER improvement operations have since added route identifiers to many of these areas. Corporate Corridors and Corporate Offset Boundaries A corporate corridor is a narrow, linear part of an incorporated place (or in a few instances, another legal entity). The corporate corridor includes the street and/or right-of-way, or a portion of the street and/or right-ofway within the incorporated place. It excludes from the incorporated place those structures such as houses, apartments, or businesses that front along the street or road. A corporate limit offset boundary exists where the incorporated place lies on one side of the street and may include all or part of the street or right-of-way, but excludes from the incorporated place, the structures located along that side of the street. See Figure 4-4 in Chapter 4. To facilitate address coding, the Census TIGER data base contains duplicate street name and address ranges on complete chains with a CFCC of F11 (nonvisible offset boundary) or F12 (nonvisible corporate corridor). The duplicate street names for the F11 and F12 features are on Record Type 5; the duplicate address ranges are on Record Type 6. Record Type 1 will not contain feature identifiers for complete chains with CFCCs of F11 or F12.  Feature Identifier Record Linkage Record Type 4 provides the link required to find any alternate feature identifiers belonging to a complete chain. Record Type 4 cross-references each TLID with an Alternate Feature ID code (FEAT) assigned to each record in Record Type 5. Record Type 5 contains all feature identifiers including those that are used only as primary identifiers. However, only the FEATs for complete chains that have alternate feature identifiers appear in Record Type 4. Complete chains that have no alternate feature identifier will have no Type 4 record.  3-6 VTDP/PSAP/TAZ Verification TIGER/Line Files   To find the alternate feature identifiers for a complete chain, begin by determining the TLID for the complete chain. Then search for this TLID in Record Type 4. If the complete chain has any alternate feature identifiers, Record Type 4 should provide at least one record. Once found, the Record Type 4 entries will each contain from one to five FEAT numbers. The FEAT fields are blank when no further alternative identifiers exist. The first FEAT field (FEAT1) should always have a valid FEAT number. Finally, find the records in the Record Type 5 file that match the FEAT codes from Record Type 4. The TIGER/Line file provides a record sequence number to identify multiple Type 4 records that might exist for one TLID. Even though Record Type 5 contains all feature identifiers, Record Type 4 contains only references for alternate feature identifiers. Data users cannot link all of the names in Record Type 5 to all of the associated complete chains in Record Type 1 by using Record Type 4.

A FEAT is assigned sequentially, beginning with 1, to each feature identifier in Record Type 5. The FEAT is not a permanent identification number. TLID is the record identifier for the complete chain. See Chapter 2 for a full discussion of TLIDs.  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3-7   RTSQ is a 3-digit integer that uniquely identifies multiple Type 4 records with the same TLID. RTSQ equals 1 for the first occurrence of a TLID in Record Type 4 and can reach a maximum of 999 for subsequent occurrences.  Address Ranges and ZIP Codes    The TIGER/Line files contain address ranges, not individual addresses. The term address range refers to the first possible structure number and the last possible structure number along a complete chain side relative to the direction in which the complete chain is coded. The address ranges in the TIGER/Line files are predominantly potential ranges that include the full range of possible structure numbers even though the actual structures might not exist. The address numbers used to create the address ranges are commonly known as city-style addresses. A city-style address minimally consists of a structure number, street name, and a 5-digit ZIP Code; for example, 213 Main St 90210. In the TIGER/Line files, the ZIP Codes usually appear only on those complete chains that have address ranges identified. However, they may appear on some road features without the address ranges. An address range also may have the full 9-digit ZIP Code that includes the USPS's 4-digit ZIP+4 Add-On code. The U.S. Census Bureau has added the Postal Add-On code to the Census TIGER data base using an automated match to the USPS's AMS II ZIP+4 file. The codes in the TIGER/Line files are the street-level codes the USPS has assigned to address ranges. The USPS may assign more specific codes to companies and buildings, and to apartments, floors, or suites within buildings. Some address coding software that uses the AMS II ZIP+4 file may provide the more specific codes. However, the TIGER/Line files contain only the more general codes. Usually the ZIP+4 Add-On code is not required to uniquely identify an address range. There are a few situations where a street name and address range legitimately appear more than once in the same 5-digit ZIP Code. Usually the USPS distinguishes these duplicates by using different postal station names. However, the Postal Add-On code will  3-8 VTDP/PSAP/TAZ Verification TIGER/Line Files   uniquely identify these cases. Puerto Rico is a special case because many addresses were uniquely assigned within an urbanizacion (a community or development) and could duplicate another address in a different urbanizacion with the same 5-digit ZIP Code. To resolve this problem, the USPS added an additional line to the address to identify the urbanizacion. The 9-digit ZIP Code also may serve to uniquely identify these address ranges. We do not yet have all of these 9-digit ZIP Codes in the Census TIGER data base.  Address Ranges Complete chains in the TIGER/Line files have one end point labeled as the start node and the other end point labeled as the end node. The start and end nodes also are referred to as from and to. The start node always corresponds to the beginning of the complete chain identified by the start node coordinates FRLAT and FRLONG. The order of the addresses follows the sequence of the nodes on the complete chain; the nodes may not be related to the low to high orientation of the address range. The start address may be higher or lower than the end address for a complete chain. Structure numbers usually, but not always, systematically increase or decrease while moving along a street in a set direction from one complete chain to the next (see Figure 3-1). Record Type 1 contains the initial address ranges for the left and the right sides of a complete chain. A complete chain side may have multiple address ranges. Often this occurs when address ranges are split to accommodate different 9-digit ZIP Codes. The TIGER/Line files use Record Type 6 to store any additional ranges as required. The Type 1 record will hold the ranges with the largest sequence of numbers. However, Record Type 6 may hold a significant number of additional ranges. Data users must use Record Type 6 to obtain the entire picture of the possible address ranges along a complete chain. In Record Types 1 and 6, both the left- and the right-side address ranges have a start and an end address range field that can contain a maximum of 11-alphanumeric characters. The address range fields are right-justified. Each address range in the TIGER/Line files has only one parity. Only oddnumbered addresses are contained within an address range with odd start  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3-9   Figure 3-1 TIGER/Line Address Range Basics The TIGER/Line  files contain potential address ranges for city-style addresses. The complete chain (between the start node and the end node) in the diagram below has two address ranges; the left side has odd-numbered addresses and the right side has the complementary even-numbered addresses. Potential address ranges along a complete chain have values that encompass the addresses of existing structures, as well as those not yet built.  Actual Address  Potential Address Range  101  105  107  113  101-119 Start Node  Oak Ave  100-118  LEFT RIGHT  End Node  100  102  104  106  108  110  Record Type 1 contains separate data fields for both the start and end of each address range.

Likewise, only even-numbered addresses belong to an address range with even start and end structure numbers. The value zero is not used as a valid address range end value. Generally, the left and the right sides of a complete chain have opposite parities. If both odd and even addresses exist on the same side of a complete chain, the TIGER/Line files provide both an even and an odd parity range for that side of the complete chain. One of the ranges appears in Record Type 1, while the other range appears separately in Record Type 6. Some address ranges may include single value ranges, such as 16-16, referred to as include addresses. These include addresses are anomalies; they may have a parity different than the prevailing address range on the complete chain side, or appear as an outlier from an adjoining range that does not fit within the range belonging to the complete chain where it is located. For example, the location of 16 Osage St falls on the predominantly odd-numbered left side of the complete chain with the address range 1-99. The range 16-16 will appear as an additional include range on the left side of the street. The even address range 2-98 on the right side of the street must exclude the number 16 structure number; the right address range becomes two ranges, 2-14 and 18-98. Outliers follow the same pattern. For example, 10 Persimmon St may appear on the side of the complete chain with the range 100-198 and not on the complete chain with the range 2-98. As before, 10-10 would become an additional range added to the complete chain with the range 100-198, and the address range 2-98 would become two ranges, 2-8 and 12-98. Because include address ranges require complex edits that may involve several complete chains, the U.S. Census Bureau cannot guarantee that all address duplication has been identified and eliminated. Some basic characteristics of address ranges are as follows:  The TIGER/Line files generally contain only those city-style address ranges used for mail delivery. They do not show rural route and post office box addresses. They may contain structure numbers assigned in select areas for use by local emergency services, but not for mail delivery. The TIGER/Line files do include address ranges and ZIP Codes in some small places where the USPS provides only post office box service, not street delivery. These address ranges represent the structure numbers collected during the 1990 census field operations, while  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3-11   the ZIP Codes represent the post office boxes. The address ranges in these areas do not have Postal Add-On codes since the USPS does not use them for street delivery.  Gaps may exist between multiple ranges for a single complete chain. A gap may be significant, since any numbers missing from one complete chain may actually appear on another complete chain in the case of address anomalies such as out-of-parity or out-of-sequence addresses (see Figure 3-2).  In a few rare cases, address ranges can include numbers with alphabetic characters. These characters help uniquely identify addresses within a county. For instance, certain unincorporated areas of Genesee County, Michigan add a letter G prefix to the address number. The characters are consistently placed within the address range field; for example, the letter G maintains a consistent column placement in the range G1 to G99 (see Figure 3-3).  Address ranges exist only for street features, and in some cases, corporate corridor and corporate offset boundary features.  Address ranges (consisting of a unique combination of structure number, ZIP Code, feature name, feature type, and directional) should not overlap; addresses should belong to only one range. The U.S. Census Bureau edits the address ranges to locate possible overlaps, but cannot guarantee that all possible overlap situations have been identified.  Address ranges in the TIGER/Line files are usually associated with both the primary and alternate feature identifiers. Caution: Address range overlaps may occur if primary address ranges are linked to alternate feature identifiers that identify route numbers. Some address systems use a hyphen to separate avenue numbers, private road designators, and grid cell numbers from the structure numbers; for example, 10-01 Reynolds St uses a hyphen to separate the avenue number from the structure number. See the Introduction chapter for more information on known anomalies.  3-12 VTDP/PSAP/TAZ Verification TIGER/Line  Files   Figure 3-2 TIGER/Line Multiple and Out-of-Sequence Address Ranges The TIGER/Line  files can accommodate complex address situations by using more than one address range. A complete chain may contain both odd and even ranges, provided the ranges are not duplicated elsewhere. Whenever there is more than one address range per side for a complete chain, the additional address ranges go into Record Type 6. The TLID field links the two record types. Record Type 6 has a sequence field (RTSQ) that allows more than one Record Type 6 to . have the same TLID. The largest address ranges are put on Record Type 1 and the smaller ranges on Record Type 6. The complete chain in the diagram below has two address ranges on each side. This situation results when a structure with an even-numbered address (150-150) is built on the odd-numbered side of the street.  113  121  123  125  150  199  LEFT Start Node  121-199, 150-150 120-148, 152-198  Oak Ave End Node  RIGHT  110  120  122  124  126  128  130  There is a gap (150-150) in the the even-numbered addresses.

The intersection splits the existing complete chain and produces two new complete chains connected by a new node located at the intersection point. The update program divides the old address ranges among the two new complete chains and imputes the address range ends at the new node. The impute process allocates either all or part of each original address range to each of the new complete chains in proportion to their lengths (see Figures 3-4 and 3-5). For each side of the original complete chain, the process considers all address ranges appearing on each side and determines the overall low and high address. The process assumes the addresses are evenly distributed over the length of the complete chain, and applies the proportion of complete chain lengths to the overall address ranges to calculate a split point address for each side. Address ranges that fall entirely above or below the split point address are moved intact to one of the new complete chains. The process divides any address ranges that contain the split point address and allocates each part to one of the new complete chains. The new address range ends created from the split are imputed values and have an impute flag. Some intermediate address range ends also may carry the impute flag. These address range ends fall between the overall high and low address for complete chain sides that have more than one address range. The impute flags on these range ends often mark splits created by adding different ninedigit ZIP Codes to parts of the original address range. These impute flags are not significant and should be disregarded. The impute flags identify address ranges that have been through the impute process. Each record in the TIGER/Line files contains four separate 1-character impute flag fields, one for each address range end.  ZIP Codes The ZIP Code is an attribute of the address ranges. The TIGER/Line files have a five-character ZIP Code field containing a numeric code with leading zeros. Both the left- and right-side address ranges share Attributes of Geographic Objects 3-15   Figure 3-4 TIGER/Line Address Range Imputes--Before Split The Census TIGER  data base uses impute flags to indicate that the one or both ends of an address range are based on calculations rather than known values. Imputed address situations generally occur when a complete chain with existing address ranges becomes split by a new complete chain. The illustration below shows the address ranges on Chestnut Ave before a split. All impute flags for this complete chain are set at zero. Figure 3-5 shows the address ranges after the split.

Address ranges that fall entirely above or below the split point belong to one of the two new complete chains and do not get an impute flag.

Each address range belonging to a complete chain can have a different ZIP Code. Where ZIP Code boundaries follow a street, the complete chain may have different left- and right-side ZIP Codes, or different ZIP Codes along its length. Because the Census TIGER data base identifies only one ZIP Code for each address range record, address ranges with different ZIP Codes must appear in separate records. The address range(s) with one ZIP Code will appear in Record Type 1, and the address range(s) with the other ZIP Code(s) will appear in Record Type 6. For example, one complete chain making up Duke Street is a ZIP Code boundary; the left-side range 1-99 has a ZIP Code of 12345, and the right-side range 2-98 has a ZIP Code of 54321. The range 1-99 with a ZIP Code of 12345 will appear in Record Type 1, and the rightside range fields will be blank. The range 2-98 with a ZIP Code of 54321 will appear in Record Type 6, and the left-side range fields will be blank. If the complete chain had additional address ranges with a ZIP Code of either 12345 or 54321, these additional address ranges would appear with one of the existing ranges or as additional Type 6 records. For example, a right-side range of 150-198 with a ZIP Code of 12345 could appear on the Type 1 record with the left-side range of 1-99. However, a right-side range of 150-198 with a ZIP Code of 54321 could not appear on the Type 6 record with the range 2-98. Instead, the range would have to appear in a second Type 6 record. Since the ZIP Codes in the TIGER/Line file relate to mail delivery along addressed streets, they are not true area features. It is possible that a polygon may contain addresses associated with more than one delivery ZIP Code.  Postal Add-On Code The TIGER/Line files have a 4-character Postal ZIP+4 Add-On code which is located on Record Type Z. Record Type Z may link to a left- or right-side address range in Record Type 1 or in Record Type 6. By using the TLID fields, data users can match the Postal +4 Add-On codes on Record Type Z to an address range in either Record Type 1 or Record Type 6. If the RTSQ field on Record Type 6 contains a 0, the postal +4 Add-On codes apply to the address ranges in Record Type 1. If the RTSQ field contains a number greater than 0, the Postal +4 Add-On codes apply 3-18 VTDP/PSAP/TAZ Verification TIGER/Line  Files   to the address ranges in the Record Type 6 that have the identical RTSQ value. The first two characters of the Postal +4 Add-On code indicate the USPS sector code; the last two characters represent the USPS segment code. As stated earlier, the U.S. Census Bureau used an automated match process to assign the Add-On codes to the address ranges in the Census TIGER data base. The match utilized only the street type records from the AMS II ZIP+4 file. These records identify a single Add-On code for a range of addresses. The ZIP+4 file also contains company and high-rise building records that supply specific codes to companies, buildings, and floors or suites within buildings. The U.S. Census Bureau did not match these codes to the Census TIGER data base because it was not practical to add all of the building features to the Census TIGER data base. Also, it was not feasible to split the address ranges for individual building-level codes. The match process attempted to relate the 5-digit ZIP Code, street name identifier, and address ranges for each feature in the Census TIGER data base to the corresponding street type record in the AMS II ZIP+4 file of the USPS. A match was not always possible because the process could not identify a single match between features with a high degree of confidence. Where successful, the process added the Postal Add-On codes to the address ranges in the Census TIGER data base. The process split these ranges if the Add-On codes covered only part of the range. Splits of this type occurred because the potential address ranges used by the U.S. Census Bureau differed from those used by the USPS. The USPS assigned different Add-On codes for each range of addresses along a block side. For example the 100, 200, and 300 numbered addresses received different Add-On codes even though they appeared on the same block side. The Add-On codes also may appear on more than one complete chain. This results because of differences in potential address ranges, and because the U.S. Census Bureau recognizes complete chain breaks and intersections not recognized by the USPS.  Address Information and Key Geographic Locations (KGLs) KGLs represent a special class of address information. They provide a geocoding tool like address ranges, but also identify a spatial object similar to a landmark. The U.S. Census Bureau uses KGLs to identify named  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3-19   buildings where the use of the feature name enhances the ability to geocode addresses. These cases include airports, shopping centers, schools, condominiums, hotels, and apartment complexes. The U.S. Census Bureau uses KGLs in situations where the address range along a street does not geocode to the correct block. Thus, greater accuracy in geocoding is provided when the KGL address is used than when the address range on the complete chain is used. In the TIGER/Line files, each KGL usually has a street address, CFCC, KGL feature name, and ZIP Code. The street feature identifier associated with the address of the KGL is obtained by linking the FEAT field to Record Type 5 which contains the list of all street name identifiers. The KGLs are independent of the address range on the complete chain; the geocoding link for the KGL is the GT-polygon. In most cases, one of the complete chains that forms the boundary of the GT-polygon will contain the KGL address. However, this relationship is not true for all KGLs. In order to locate the street segment with the KGL address, use the previously linked street name identifier from Record Type 5. The ZIP Codes may not be the same. Even though the KGLs appear to identify specific structures, the KGL descriptions do not include location coordinates. In most cases, the U.S. Census Bureau can determine the general location of the KGL, but cannot provide a specific location with any certainty.  Address Information Methodology Pre-1992 Address Ranges Before the 1990 census, the Census TIGER data base contained address ranges only for the area covered by 1980 Geographic Base File/Dual Independent Map Encoding (GBF/DIME) files and a few file extension areas prepared in conjunction with 1980 census activities. These ranges were used to geocode a list of addresses to geographic areas for use in the 1990 questionnaire mail-out. For the 1990 census, the Bureau purchased the list of addresses from commercial vendors for the geographic areas where the Census TIGER data base included address ranges. To verify the accuracy of the addresses, the  3-20 VTDP/PSAP/TAZ Verification TIGER/Line  Files   U.S. Census Bureau began with an initial assignment of residential addresses to the 1990 census tracts and blocks. Clerical review of the results of the assignment process provided additional address range updates. If an address range in the TIGER/Line file prepared for the 1990 census was incorrect, the U.S. Census Bureau implemented procedures to ensure that the error did not adversely affect the accuracy or the quality of the 1990 census. Later, in field operations, enumerators verified, corrected, and updated the list of addresses assigned to each block. They walked the perimeter and all interior streets of each block and checked the address list against their observations.  1992 TIGER/Line Expanded Addresses In the 1992 TIGER/Line Files, the U.S. Census Bureau expanded the address range coverage for the entire United States by creating new ranges based on the Address Control File (ACF) used in the 1990 decennial census. The ACF was a master list of addresses geocoded to the census block level. For each block, the individual structure addresses were grouped by feature identifier and sorted into numerical order to extract an actual range. The order of the addresses along the complete chains bordering the block, relative to the start and end nodes of the complete chains, came from the order of addresses for the street feature as a whole (i.e., the collection of linked complete chains with the same feature identifier). Likewise, the overall parity of the street feature set the standard for identifying and editing anomalies along the complete chains. To maintain confidentiality of individual addresses, the U.S. Census Bureau converted the actual range to a potential range. This was accomplished by expanding the actual range to complete a hundred range, splitting the difference between coverage gaps, and in some cases disguising the range by the random addition or subtraction of addresses. Where a complete chain in the Census TIGER data base contained both an ACF-derived address range and a pre-existing address range, only the pre-existing address range was extracted for the 1992 TIGER/Line files. This extraction process was followed on each side of a complete chain. No attempt was made to resolve differences between the two sources (the  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3-21   pre-existing or the ACF-derived). The ACF-derived address range may have created overlaps with pre-existing address ranges on the adjoining complete chains.  Post-1992 Expanded Addresses What had been true for addresses in the 1992 TIGER/Line files was modified for the 1994, 1995, 1997, 1998, and the 1999 versions of the files. The pre-existing address ranges in the Census TIGER data base and the ACF address ranges were matched to determine their comparability. Then, a rematch process was performed similar to the process used for the 1992 TIGER/Line files. Using more sophisticated processing, the address ranges were merged to create better address range coverage. In the merge process, the ACF range became the base address range, and the pre-existing address range in the Census TIGER data base was used to make the address range coverage more complete. The merged range is the address range in the 1999 TIGER/Line files. In addition to the address merge process, the U.S. Census Bureau ran an address range edit. The edits fixed some orientation and parity reversals along a street feature. They also identified overlapping address ranges of different complete chains that had the same street identifier and ZIP Code. Where all of the overlapping addresses were geocoded to the same 1990 census block, only one instance of the address was retained in the TIGER/ Line files. If overlapping addresses were geocoded to a different census block, none of these overlapping addresses were entered into the TIGER/ Line files. For this reason, street features that had address ranges in the past may show no ranges or incomplete ranges in the latest versions of the TIGER/Line files. Both primary and alternate feature identifiers can be used in geocoding, but great care should be used with the alternate identifiers. In the case of corporate corridors and corporate limit offset boundaries, the alternate address linked to the boundary should be used for geocoding rather than the primary range linked to the street (see the Corporate Corridors and Corporate Limit Offset Boundaries section in this chapter).  3-22 VTDP/PSAP/TAZ Verification TIGER/Line  Files   Orientation edits attempted to standardize the low to high orientation of address ranges along a chain of street feature complete chains with the same feature identifier. Complete chains with address ranges that were specifically identified as orientation anomalies were automatically excluded. The edit determined the majority orientation for the street feature chain and reversed the low and high values on any range that deviated from the majority. The edit only created street feature chains that included adjacent complete chains; discontiguous street feature chains were edited as separate pieces. Therefore, the from-to orientation of the complete chains may be inconsistent along a feature chain. The parity edits attempted to place the even- and odd-parity ranges consistently on the same side of a feature chain. Chains with address ranges that were specifically identified as known anomalies were automatically excluded. Because address geocoding could be affected, the parity fix required a feature chain with a minimum of four complete chains and a majority parity representing 70 percent of the address ranges. As a result, smaller feature chains remained unaltered. For the 1994 TIGER/Line files, the U.S. Census Bureau conducted a general ZIP Code clean-up and staff added new ZIP Codes created since the 1990 census. These updates had a significant impact on parts of Michigan, California, and central Florida. Nationwide, automated processes eliminated illegal codes not recognized by the USPS as ZIP Codes, and clerical operations began eliminating the scatter of incorrectly applied ZIP Codes. Nearly all 3-digit ZIP Code anomalies have been corrected. For the 1995 TIGER/Line files, the U.S. Census Bureau edited address ranges for overlaps or other inconsistencies and ZIP Codes were updated in selected areas. The street names and address ranges in the Census TIGER data base were compared to those in the ZIP+4 file of the U.S. Postal Service. If a street name and address range did not have a ZIP+4 code, the code was copied from the ZIP+4 file to the Census TIGER data base. The consistency of highway names and feature identifiers also was improved.

The 1999 TIGER/Line files may not contain all delivery ZIP Codes and contain few non-delivery ZIP Codes. The distribution of ZIP Codes in the TIGER/Line files may not reflect the exact USPS ZIP Code service area.  Limitations Users of the address ranges in the TIGER/Line files should check for address range overlaps, gaps, odd/even reversals, and other situations that may be incorrect. While the U.S. Census Bureau continues to edit for, and correct these situations, it is possible that some still exist.  Corporate Corridors and Corporate Limit Offset Boundaries A corporate corridor is a narrow, linear part of an incorporated place (or in a few instances, another legal entity). The corporate corridor includes the street and/or right-of-way, or a portion of the street and/or right-ofway within the incorporated place. It excludes from the incorporated place those structures such as houses, apartments, or businesses that front along the street or road. A corporate limit offset boundary exists where the incorporated place lies on one side of the street and may include all or part of the street and/or right-of-way, but not the structures located on that side of the street. See the Places section in Chapter 4.  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3-25   To facilitate the coding of addresses to the correct geographic entity, the Census TIGER data base contains duplicate street name and address ranges on complete chains with a CFCC of F11 (nonvisible offset boundary) or F12 (nonvisible corporate corridor). The duplicate street names for the F11 and F12 features are on Record Type 5; the duplicate address ranges are on Record Type 6. Complete chains with CFCCs of F11 or F12 will not contain the duplicate names or address ranges in Record Type 1. Record Type 1 does not indicate that the street or right-of-way lies within a corporate corridor or offset boundary. Therefore, the address ranges lie outside the corporate corridor or offset boundary and are encoded on either side of these lines. Data users planning to geocode addresses in areas with these boundary types must identify the duplicate feature identifiers and ranges from Record Types 5 and 6 (the names and address ranges for CFCC F11 and F12 features), locate the street feature with those ranges, and remove the street feature's address ranges and geographic codes from the geocoding process.  Record Linkages The TIGER/Line files store address range information in two record types. Record Type 1 contains the basic complete chain attributes, including one basic address range. Record Type 6 stores the additional ranges when the complete chain has more than one range on one or both sides. The TLID field links Record Types 1 and 6. Since a complete chain can have more than one set of address ranges, multiple Type 6 records can exist with the same TLID. The TIGER/Line files distinguish these records with a record sequence number (RTSQ). All Type 6 records that have the same TLID appear sequentially in the file even though the records are not sorted by TLID. The TIGER/Line files do not contain a field indicating whether a Type 6 record exists for a specific TLID; the user must scan any existing records in Record Type 6 for a TLID match.  Boundaries of Geographic Entities The TIGER/Line files store geographic codes as either a polygon or complete chain attribute. In the case of state and county level geography, and some other areas, the codes appear in both complete chain and  3-26 VTDP/PSAP/TAZ Verification TIGER/Line  Files   polygon record types. Refer to Chapter 4 for descriptions of geographic areas, and to Chapter 6 for the data dictionary that describes the record type fields.  Record Linkages and Boundary Extraction The codes assigned to the complete chain belong to the areas referenced by the left and the right sides of a complete chain. Only those features that have different geographic codes on the left and the right sides of a line become boundary features. Information from multiple TIGER/Line data fields is required to uniquely identify the boundary of some geographic entities. For instance, both the census block and census tract/BNA codes are required to identify a block boundary. Block 101 in census tract 2101 could neighbor block 101 in census tract 2998. Be sure to use both the basic number and the suffix when extracting either census tract or block boundaries. Data users who have combined TIGER/Line files should include the 1990 state/statistical equivalent and 1990 county/statistical equivalent codes to extract 1990 census tract/BNA boundaries. The extraction of boundary features from polygon attribute codes requires making a link between the polygon and the complete chain data records, then identifying the features with different left- and right-side geographic codes. For a description of the record linkage process, see the Polygon Features section in this chapter. Boundary rings consist of multiple complete chains that are sequentially linked together and connected to form a closed ring. The process of linking all of the boundary complete chains that outline the same geographic entity requires the extraction of all complete chains that have that entity's code on either the left or the right side (but not both). Linking the chains together will form a polygon; each polygon may represent one of the GT-polygons described in Record Types A, P, and S, or a collection of these GT-polygons. Caution: Some types of geographic areas must end at a county/file boundary while others can continue into adjoining counties/files. For example, MCDs stop at a county boundary, whereas incorporated places can exist in several counties (See the Record Linkages/Feature Chaining section in this chapter).  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3-27   Single-Side Flags and County Boundaries The 1999 TIGER/Line files use current counties/statistical equivalents as the basis for the file coverage area, not the boundaries as they existed for the 1990 census. This means that a county or county-equivalent file may not cover the exact same area as it did in 1990. Any legal changes or boundary corrections that occurred since 1990 could have resulted in a piece of land moving from one county, or county equivalent, to another. County boundary features are duplicated between adjoining pairs of counties so that each file is complete. However, the complete chains that constitute the boundary features contain only the geographic entity codes and address ranges relevant to each county-based TIGER/Line file. The geographic entity codes are blanked out on the outside edge of the county, even though some of these fields must normally have a non-blank code. The TIGER/Line file identifies these complete chains with a 1-character, single-side segment flag in the SIDE1 field of Record Type 1. When combining several TIGER/Line files to form a state or regional data set, the data user will need to eliminate duplicate boundary lines. Because each one of the duplicate boundary complete chains has either the left- or right-side geographic entity codes and address ranges, the elimination process will need to combine the codes and address ranges from both lines. The same situation applies to the polygon identification codes. Record Type I contains CENIDs and POLYIDs for GT-polygons within the county. If the GT-polygon is in the adjacent county, the CENID and POLYID fields are blank.  Single-Side Flag Record Location Record Type 1 Field Name SIDE1 Description Single-Side Complete Chain Code  Single-Side Flag Codes 1-- The complete chain is a county boundary; either the left or the right side is blank blank -- The complete chain is not a county boundary; neither left nor right side is blank  3-28 VTDP/PSAP/TAZ Verification TIGER/Line  Files   Census Feature Class Codes ( CFCCs) A census feature class code (CFCC) is used to identify the most noticeable characteristic of a feature. The CFCC is applied only once to a chain or landmark with preference given to classifications that cover features that are visible to an observer and a part of the ground transportation network. Thus, a road that also is the boundary of a town would have a CFCC describing its road characteristics, not its boundary characteristics. The CFCC, as used in the TIGER/Line files, is a three-character code. The first character is a letter describing the feature class; the second character is a number describing the major category; and the third character is a number describing the minor category.  Feature Class A, Road The definition of a divided highway has been the source of considerable discussion. Earlier specifications have defined a divided road as having ""... opposing traffic lanes that are physically separated by a median strip no less than 70 feet wide in former GBF/DIME areas or no less than 200 feet wide in non-GBF/DIME areas."" This definition caused confusion in the proper coding of interstates having narrow medians. To clarify the situation, the U.S. Census Bureau now uses the term divided to refer to a road with opposing traffic lanes separated by any size median, and separated to refer to lanes that are represented in the Census TIGER data base as two distinct complete chains. Earlier operations may have depicted widely separated lanes as a single line in the data base or created separate lines when the median was small, depending on the available source used during the update. The term, rail line in center, indicates that a rail line shares the road rightof-way. The rail line may follow the center of the road or be directly next to the road; representation is dependent upon the available source used during the update. The rail line can represent a railroad, a street carline, or other carline.  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3-29   Primary Highway With Limited Access Interstate highways and some toll highways are in this category (A1) and are distinguished by the presence of interchanges. These highways are accessed by way of ramps and have multiple lanes of traffic. The opposing traffic lanes are divided by a median strip. The TIGER/Line files may depict these opposing traffic lanes as two distinct lines in which case, the road is called separated.

A cartographic landmark is identified for use by an enumerator while working in the field. A land-use area is identified in order to minimize enumeration efforts in uninhabited areas or areas where human access is restricted. A key geographic location is identified in order to more accurately geocode and enumerate a place of work or residence.

Only those GT-polygons associated with an area landmark have a CFCC. Most CFCCs in the feature classification scheme apply only to complete chains. In a few instances, the same feature code may apply to complete chains as well as to point and area landmarks. Only those features required for census operational purposes are classified and inserted into the Census TIGER data base. Therefore, not all features in a county will appear in the TIGER/Line files. Since features are classified with only a single code, a road that also is a boundary will have only the CFCC of a road even though a CFCC for a boundary exists in the classification scheme.  CFCC Record Location Record Type 1 7 9  Field Name CFCC CFCC CFCC  Description Code assigned to the complete chain Code assigned to a point or area landmark Code assigned to a key geographic location  Points Describing the Complete Chain The TIGER/Line files describe the spatial/geometric position and shape of a complete chain using shape points and nodes; see the section entitled Topology in Chapter 1. Latitude and longitude coordinate fields identify the shape points and nodes. The Census TIGER data base does not support node identification numbers.  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3-43   Nodes Nodes are topological objects that mark the end location of each complete chain. Every chain has two nodes, a start node and an end node (using the Spatial Data Transfer Standard, or SDTS, terminology). Earlier releases of the TIGER/Line files refer to these nodes as the from node and the to node. The order of the nodes establishes the left and the right sides of the line and sets the sequencing order for the shape points. The node coordinates are stored in Record Type 1.  Shape Points The U.S. Census Bureau uses the term shape points to describe the nontopological points that describe the position and shape of a chain. Shape points exist only where required; straight-line complete chains require no shape points. Shape points are associated only with one complete chain and are listed in order from start node to end node. The TIGER/Line files store shape points in Record Type 2 and link them to the nodes in Record Type 1 using the TLID. The shape points for a chain can fill several Type 2 records.  Coordinates for Nodes and Shape Points Coordinates are expressed in Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) notation, where a positive latitude represents the Northern Hemisphere and a negative longitude represents the Western Hemisphere. All coordinates are expressed as a signed integer with six decimal places of precision implied (see the section, Positional Accuracy, in Chapter 5). Actual Latitude 15 Deg. S to 72 Deg. N Longitude 64 Deg. W to 131 Deg.

The coordinate datum for the above areas was NAD27 in all previous versions of the files prior to 1995. Regional datums are used in all versions of the TIGER/Line files for Hawaii and the Island Territories in the Pacific.  3-44 VTDP/PSAP/TAZ Verification TIGER/Line  Files   Coordinate Values All nodes have non-zero coordinates within the range specified in the Coordinates for Nodes and Shape Points section on the previous page. Shape point coordinates are expressed in the same manner. However, unused Record Type 2 fields are zero-filled and begin with a ""+"" sign.

Point 10, Longitude Point 10, Latitude  Record Linkages/Feature Chaining Plotting a complete chain requires using the nodes from Record Type 1 and all of the shape point records in Record Type 2 with the same TLID, if any. Plot the start node first, then search Record Type 2 for any matching records. If there is a match, the record will contain from 1 to 10 shape points. If all 10-point fields are filled with non-zero values, there may be an additional matching Type 2 record. Type 2 records are not sorted by TLID, but all records with the same TLID should appear together in sequence by the record sequence number (RTSQ). Plot the shape points from all Type 2 records and end the complete chain by plotting the end node. Street features may consist of multiple complete chains that are sequentially linked together. Linking all of the features with the same name requires the extraction of all Type 1 and Type 2 records with the same feature identifiers in Record Types 1 and 5.  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3-45   Boundary generation requires the extraction of all features that have different left and right geographic codes. The placement of the complete chains into a boundary-ring sequence requires a procedure to match the end of one complete chain to the beginning or end of the next complete chain. The complete chains will probably not have the same to-from or start-end orientation down the length of the street or boundary. Therefore, the procedure must reverse the order of the nodes and shape points that form some complete chains to achieve a correct and consistent sequence of nodes and shape points. Since the nodes that identify the ends of the complete chains do not have an identification number, the procedure must match the nodes based on the latitude and longitude coordinates. This might facilitate the match by combining the coordinates into a single peano key code composed of alternating latitude and longitude digits. Sorting nodes using the peano key will cluster nodes that are spatially close together.  Polygon Features The TIGER/Line files contain identification and geographic codes for each GT-polygon in the Census TIGER data base. These GT-polygons are the smallest areas identified in the TIGER/Line files. Geographic entities and area landmarks have specific identification codes and form more complex polygons. The TIGER/Line files link these features to GT-polygons, but do not directly identify the more complex polygons. GT-polygons are building blocks that form features. They are not features and do not have their own feature name or CFCC. However, GT-polygons may be a part of many area landmark features that have their own feature name and CFCC. GT-polygons have unique GT-polygon identification codes (CENID and POLYID), a set of geographic entity codes, and an internal point location. Refer to Chapter 2 for more information on GT-polygon identification codes and Chapter 4 for a description of the geographic entities in the TIGER/Line files.  3-46 VTDP/PSAP/TAZ Verification TIGER/Line  Files   Information and record linkage keys for GT-polygons are distributed over several record types:       Record Record Record Record Record Record Type Type Type Type Type Type P A 8 9 I S -- -- -- -- -- -- provides the GT-polygon internal point location provides the 1990 census geographic entity codes and areas links GT-polygons to area landmarks links GT-polygons to key geographic location features links GT-polygons to complete chains provides Census 2000 (TENTATIVE) geographic entity codes and areas  Updates to the Census TIGER data base include new street and boundary complete chains that create new GT-polygons. Thus, each version of the TIGER/Line files will have a single, unique set of GT-polygons, each with a corresponding Record Type A, S, and P. The CENID and POLYID identification codes link records together, but are not permanent GT-polygon identification codes.  Geographic Entity Codes Geographic entity codes can be attributes of a set of polygons, a complete chain, or both. Refer to Chapter 6 for the data dictionary that describes the record type fields and to Chapter 4 for descriptions of geographic areas.  Internal Points The internal point is a point location within each GT-polygon that is unique to that GT-polygon. The TIGER/Line files exclude the internal points from the node-complete chain-polygon topology; do not confuse the internal point with a centroid. In a polygon with an irregular shape, such as a doughnut or crescent shape, the true centroid could fall outside the polygon. Unlike true centroids, the internal points should always fall within the GT-polygon or on the GT-polygon boundary. Some of the GT-polygons (approximately 400 nationwide) are so small that the internal point may be identical to a point on one of the lines bounding the GT-polygon, or identical to one of the nodes. Depending upon the precision of a particular software or hardware system, the data user may find the internal point outside the correct GT-polygon, or find that a GT-polygon may contain two internal points.  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3-47   Changes to the shape and location of complete chains forming polygon boundaries will change the polygon internal point coordinates even though the topology of the polygon remains the same. Such changes complicate the matching, using internal point coordinates, of polygons from different versions of the TIGER/Line files. All internal points have non-zero coordinates. Coordinates are expressed in standard FIPS PUB 70 notation. See the Coordinates for Nodes and Shape Points section in this chapter. GT-Polygon Internal Point Coordinates Record Locations Record Type P P Field Name POLYLONG POLYLAT Description Polygon Internal Point Longitude Polygon Internal Point Latitude  Record Linkages The topological network of complete chains divides the surface area of geographic entities into GT-polygons. There is a one-to-one relationship between the GT-polygons constructed from Record Types 1 and 2 and those appearing in Record Type P. In constructing the GT-polygons from Record Types 1 and 2, users are cautioned to be sure their software has the necessary coordinate precision and does not snap together complete chains that are merely close. Record Type I provides a direct link from each complete chain in the TIGER/Line file to its adjoining GT-polygons. It contains both the TLID and the polygon identification codes for each side of the GT-polygon. Record Type I facilitates the transfer of polygon geographic codes to the complete chain, but also provides the link back from polygon to complete chain. In this case, finding all complete chains associated with a GT-polygon is more difficult. The procedure involves searching every Type I record to locate all instances where a CENID and POLYID appear on either the left or the right side of a complete chain. Area landmarks also must link to the GT-polygons in order to establish their geographic location. Record Type 8 provides the link from GT-polygon to area landmark. See the Area Landmark Locations section in this chapter.  3-48 VTDP/PSAP/TAZ Verification TIGER/Line  Files   Landmark Features The U.S. Census Bureau includes landmarks in the Census TIGER data base for locating special features and to help enumerators during field operations. Some of the more common landmark types include airports, cemeteries, parks, and educational facilities. The U.S. Census Bureau added landmark features on an as-needed-basis and made no attempt to ensure that all instances of a particular feature were included. The absence of a landmark does not mean that the living quarters, e.g., hospitals and group quarters associated with the landmark were excluded from the 1990 enumeration. The address list used for the census was maintained apart from the landmark data. Landmarks with a ZIP Code and an address are called key geographic locations (KGLs). A landmark can be either a point, line, or area type. In some cases, the Census TIGER data base permits a choice of types. For instance, an airport or airfield might appear as a point, line, or area; the approach depends on the size of the feature and the depiction of the feature in the source document. Line they Area that features such as airfields could appear as one or more complete chains; are not identified in the landmark record types. See the Point, Line, and Landmark CFCCs section in this chapter to identify the possible codes could appear as complete chains.  In addition to landmark data, the TIGER/Line files contain the CFCCs and names for bodies of water including ponds, lakes, oceans, and the area covered by large streams represented as double-line drainage. These water areas have 1990 census block numbers ending in 99. See Chapter 4 for a complete description of census blocks covering land and water. Landmark and water features can overlap. The most common situation is a park or other special land-use feature that includes a lake or pond. In this case, the GT-polygon covered by the lake or pond belongs to a water landmark feature and a park landmark feature. Other kinds of landmarks can overlap as well. Area landmarks can contain point landmarks; these are not linked in the TIGER/Line files.  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3-49   Record Type 7 contains point and area landmarks. Most water areas are identified as an area landmark whether named or not. The other land marks may be identified only by a census feature class code and may not have a name. During the extraction of this data, the U.S. Census Bureau assigned a temporary landmark identification number (LAND) to each landmark record. Record Type 8 uses the LAND to link the area landmark records in Record Type 7 to the GT-polygons. Record Type 7 and Record Type 8 exist only when the county file contains landmark features or water fea-tures. Record Type 9 contains the KGLs in the Census TIGER data base. The KGLs are linked by the CENID and POLYID to the GT-polygons.  Point, Line, and Area Landmark CFCCs All landmarks, including KGLs, have a CFCC. In the Census TIGER data base the CFCCs of the complete chains forming the polygon boundary are independent of the CFCCs assigned to the area landmark or the water feature filling the polygon.

The text string includes upper- and lower-case characters. The feature name may carry an imbedded feature type (e.g., River, Military Reservation, Garden, Park, and Lake). The U.S. Census Bureau has not standardized or edited the feature types or names for landmarks in the Census TIGER data base in all areas. 3-52 VTDP/PSAP/TAZ Verification TIGER/Line  Files   The U.S. Census Bureau does not guarantee that the landmarks or water areas are consistently identified in the TIGER/Line files. Area landmarks added to the Census TIGER data base in different update actions with the same name and CFCC will produce separate landmark records in the TIGER/Line files. The landmark records may contain variant spellings of the feature name or different CFCCs even though they refer to the same feature. These differences could result in the fragmentation of a large landmark. For instance, a water body could have the name Lake Redmond with a CFCC of H31, while another part could have the same name, but a CFCC of H30, and still a third part could have the name York County Reservoir. Because area landmarks can overlap, it is possible, although not likely, for one polygon to belong to several landmarks. Area landmarks and water area labels can have alternate names. Each feature name will appear as a separate Type 7 record, but each record will have the same LAND. Type 7 Records with the same LAND will have the same landmark or water area label. Each unique combination of primary and alternate names becomes a separate landmark record even though the primary name and the CFCCs match the adjoining landmark features. The TIGER/Line files do not show all water bodies as landmark records. Using Record Type 7 (area landmarks) and Record Type 8 (polygons linked to area landmarks) will not necessarily provide all water areas. Record Type S contains a water flag (WATER) to identify polygons associated with water bodies. Water bodies are identified with a value of 1 in the WATER field. Key geographic location names uniquely identify the landmark separately from its street address; for example, Springfield Towers instead of 1605 Main St. Landmark Feature Record Locations Record Type 7 9 Field Name LANAME KGLNAME Description Landmark name Key geographic location name  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3-53   Landmark Feature Name Codes The LANAME and KGLNAME field may include any ASCII text string. The fields can be blank where the feature is unnamed.  Point Landmark Locations The TIGER/Line files identify the location of point landmarks with a single coordinate point. The presence of coordinate data in Record Type 7 distinguishes point landmarks from area landmarks that have blank coordinate fields. Coordinates Coordinates are expressed in standard FIPS PUB 70 notation. For additional information, see the Coordinates for Nodes and Shape Points section in this chapter. Point Landmark Coordinate Record Locations Record Type Field Name Description  7 7  LALONG LALAT  Longitude Latitude  Coordinate Values All point landmarks have non-zero coordinates within the range specified above. The coordinate fields for area landmarks are blank-filled.  Area Landmark Locations To find the location of each area landmark, link the basic landmark description in Record Type 7 to all of the elementary polygons that belong to the landmark. Record Type 8 serves as a bridge between these two record types. The TIGER/Line files provide a Type 8 record for each polygon linked to a specific landmark. Polygons belonging to multiple landmarks appear once for each landmark. The TIGER/Line files use the LAND and the polygon identification codes (CENID and POLYID) to actually make the link. See Chapter 2 for a description of the LAND, CENID, and POLYID codes and fields. Locate the polygons for an area landmark by searching Record Type 8 for all of the CENIDs and POLYIDs with the specified LAND. Record Type 8 is in LAND sort sequence. Once the polygons are linked to the area landmark, use Record Type I to locate the complete chains that 3-54 VTDP/PSAP/TAZ Verification TIGER/Line  Files   form the landmark's polygon boundaries. Record Type I contains a record for all complete chains and identifies the polygons located on either side of the complete chains. The search procedure must look for all instances of Record Type I and evaluate the left- and right-side polygon identifiers for a possible match. Data users may need to eliminate complete chains that are internal to the polygon and landmark, depending on the application.  KGLs To find the location of KGLs, link the description in Record Type 9 to the elementary polygon in which the KGL is found. Use the polygon identification codes (CENID and POLYID) to make the link. If the address of the KGL is a street address, use the FEAT field (alternate feature ID code) to link to the feature identifier in Record Type 5.  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3-55    Chapter 4: Geographic Entities Overview The 1999 TIGER/Line files contain the boundaries of legal, administrative, and statistical areas. Some boundaries are those that were in effect as of the tabulation of the 1990 census, others are updated boundaries, and still others are 2000 (TENTATIVE) boundaries. The U.S. Census Bureau is using the 1999 TIGER/Line files to exchange data with local partners participating in U.S. Census Bureau programs. Data users should NOT use the boundaries of any legal, administrative, or statistical areas identified as 2000 (TENTATIVE) as the Census 2000 geographic boundaries; these boundaries are subject to change. Fields identified as 2000 (TENTATIVE) are intended for use by program participants only. The legal areas shown in the files are:              States and their statistical equivalents--1990, current, and 2000 (TENTATIVE) Counties and their statistical equivalents--1990, current, and 2000 (TENTATIVE) Minor civil divisions (MCDs) --1990 , current, and 2000 (TENTATIVE) Sub-minor civil divisions (Puerto Rico only)--current and 2000 (TENTATIVE) Consolidated cities--2000 (TENTATIVE) only Incorporated places--1990, current, and 2000 (TENTATIVE) American Indian reservations (both federally and state-recognized)--1990, current, and 2000 (TENTATIVE) American Indian trust lands--current and 2000 (TENTATIVE) American Indian tribal subdivisions--2000 (TENTATIVE) only Alaska Native Regional Corporations--current only Hawaiian home lands--2000 (TENTATIVE) only Oregon urban growth areas--2000 (TENTATIVE) only Congressional districts--current only  The administrative areas shown in the files are:     Voting districts--2000 (TENTATIVE) only State legislative districts--2000 (TENTATIVE) only School districts--current only Traffic analysis zones--2000 (TENTATIVE) only  Geographic Entities 4-1   The statistical areas included in the files are:  Census areas (statistical county equivalents in Alaska)--1990, current, and 2000 (TENTATIVE)  Census county divisions and unorganized territories (statistical county subdivisions)--1990, current, and 2000 (TENTATIVE)  Census designated places (statistical place equivalents)--1990 and 2000 (TENTATIVE)  Place (remainder) entities (statistical place equivalents within consolidated cities)--2000 (TENTATIVE) only  American Indian/Alaska Native statistical areas 1 ) Alaska Native village statistical areas--1990 and 2000 (TENTATIVE) 2 ) Tribal designated statistical areas--1990 and 2000 (TENTATIVE) 3 ) Tribal jurisdiction statistical areas--1990 only 4 ) Oklahoma tribal statistical areas--2000 (TENTATIVE) only  Census tracts--1990 and 2000 (TENTATIVE)  Block numbering areas--1990 only  Census block groups--2000 (TENTATIVE) only  Census blocks--1990 and Census 2000 collection  Urban areas--1990 only  Metropolitan areas: 1 ) Consolidated metropolitan statistical areas--2000 (TENTATIVE) only 2 ) Metropolitan statistical areas--2000 (TENTATIVE) only 3 ) Primary metropolitan statistical areas--2000 (TENTATIVE) only  Geographic entities tabulated by the U.S. Census Bureau generally are hierarchical; Figure 4-1 shows the progression of geographic areas from the Nation to the block level. See Appendix F for a count of legal, administrative, and statistical entities. The TIGER/Line files identify geographic areas using the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) codes or, for American Indian/Alaska Native area/Hawaiian home lands only, U.S. Census Bureau-assigned codes. The TIGER/Line files depict geographic areas in two ways:  The assignment of codes to the left and the right sides of the complete chains (Record Types 1 and 3)  The identification of codes that belong to each GT-polygon (Record Types A and S)  4-2 VTDP/PSAP/TAZ Verification TIGER/Line Files   Figure 4-1 Hierarchical Relationship of Geographic Entities  Nation  States AIANHHs  UAs SLDs CDs UGAs Counties School Districts VTDs County Subdivisions Sub-MCDs Census Tracts ANRCs Places TAZs  BGs  Blocks  AIANHH: American Indian/Alaska Native Area/Hawaiian Home Land ANRC: Alaska Native Regional Corporation BG: Block Group CD: Congressional District MCD: Minor Civil Division SLD: State Legislative District TAZ: Traffic Analysis Zone UA: Urbanized Area UGA: Urban Growth Area VTD: Voting District  Geographic Entities 4-3   The TIGER/Line files identify some geographic entities in both the complete chain and polygon records for certain boundary vintages. This chapter provides detailed information on the record types and fields for the geographic entities.  Boundary and Area Changes The boundaries identified as current for some legal areas are updated boundaries collected since 1990 as part of the U.S. Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey, or as part of the 1990 Count Quality Review correction process. The boundaries of all states, all counties and their statistical equivalents, all MCDs, and all incorporated places are those that were legally in effect as of the latest Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS). This may vary by county record or the date of extraction from the Census TIGER data base. Since the 1990 Census, there have been several changes to the universe of county or statistically equivalent entities. In Alaska the Skagway-YakutatAngoon Census Area has become Skagway-Hoonah-Angoon Census Area and Yakutat Borough. Also in Alaska, Denali Borough was created from parts of Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area and Southeast Fairbanks Census Area. These changes have resulted in the creation of separate TIGER/Line files for the new county equivalents. Dade County, Florida officially changed its legal name to Miami-Dade County, Florida. This resulted in the ""renaming"" of the TIGER/Line file. The portion of Yellowstone National Park in Montana that the U.S. Census Bureau had been showing as a statistical equivalent of a county legally is contained within Gallatin and Park Counties, Montana. As a result, a separate TIGER/Line file no longer exists for that portion of the Yellowstone National Park in Montana. The City of South Boston, Virginia no longer is an independent city (statistical equivalent of a county) and is now part of Halifax County, Virginia and appears in the Halifax County, Virginia TIGER/Line file. For all other legal areas and nearly all statistical areas, except those identified as 2000 (TENTATIVE) or current, the boundaries shown were those in effect at the time of the 1990 census whether the data are identified as 1990 or current. Because unorganized territories and census designated places occupy the same level of geography as legal MCDs and incorporated places, updates to the legal boundaries may affect the current boundaries for some of these entities, including the elimination of some of the statistical entities. 4-4 VTDP/PSAP/TAZ Verification TIGER/Line Files   The metropolitan area data that appears on Record Type S are based on the latest available designations by the Office of Management and Budget, and are not the metropolitan areas for which the U.S. Census Bureau tabulated data in 1990. The metropolitan area information on Record Type C, however, shows both 1990 and current codes and names. In a few cases, the U.S. Census Bureau made statistical area boundary changes in order to correct errors. The 1999 TIGER/Line files contain boundaries identified as 2000 (TENTATIVE). The U.S. Census Bureau is using the 1999 TIGER/Line files to exchange data with local partners participating in U.S. Census Bureau programs. Boundaries identified as 2000 (TENTATIVE) are subject to change and data users should not use these boundaries as the Census 2000 geographic boundaries. Fields identified as 2000 (TENTATIVE) are intended for use by program participants only. Since the release of the 1990 Census TIGER/Line files, the U.S. Census Bureau shifted and reshaped some line features including the lines forming some boundaries. These changes involved the realignment of complete chains associated with a legal or statistical area boundary. The shape and area of the 1990 geographic entities portrayed in the 1995, 1997, 1998, and 1999 TIGER/Line files may differ from earlier TIGER/Line versions, but the inventory of 1990 census tabulation entities remains the same. Changes in the shape and location of complete chains will change the polygon internal point locations. See the Internal Points section in Chapter 3.  Codes for Entities Appendix A is a list of FIPS state and county codes. A list of valid codes and names for other legal entities does not appear in the documentation for the TIGER/Line files. The TIGER/Line files include Record Type C which lists the geographic codes and names plus some attribute data (FIPS 55 class code, census place description code, legal/statistical area description code; and entity type) for certain entities. The codes and names are identified as 1990, current, 2000 (TENTATIVE), or all three. The FIPS Code, Name, and/or Attribute Data Applicable Year field (field name DATAYR) may have four values: 1990 for geographic names and codes valid for the 1990 census, 199n (where 199n is the year of extraction from the Census TIGER data base) for geographic Geographic Entities 4-5   names and codes valid for the current year, 2000 for 2000 (TENTATIVE) geographic names and codes, and blank when the geographic names and codes are same for 1990, 199n, and 2000 (TENTATIVE). Multiple records for the same geographic entity show its change over time. Record Type C contains the TIGER/Geographic NameTM files that the U.S. Census Bureau produced as a companion to the 1992 TIGER/Line files. Record Type C also replaces the TIGER Geographic Reference FileNames (GRF-N), 1990. The documentation and paper or file versions of the FIPS codes are available for sale from the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), U.S. Department of Commerce, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161. The telephone number is (703) 605-6000. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) maintains the FIPS 55 codes. Information about FIPS codes is available from USGS's Geographic Names Section at (703) 648-4547. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) maintains an In ternet World Wide Web site of FIPS codes and information. The URL for this site is http://www.itl.nist.gov/div897/pubs/index.htm. The FIPS publications include:  FIPS PUB 5-2, Codes for Identification of States, the District of Columbia and the Outlying Areas of the United States, and Associated Areas  FIPS PUB 6-4, Counties and Equivalent Entities of the United States, Its Possessions, and Associated Areas  FIPS PUB 8-5, Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs)--including CMSAs, PMSAs, and NECMAs  FIPS PUB 55-3 , Codes for Named Populated Places, Primary County Divisions, and Other Locational Entities of the United States, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and the Pacific Island Territories  The U.S. Census Bureau uses the codes in FIPS PUB 55-3 to identify both legal and statistical entities for county subdivisions, places, and American Indian/Alaska Native area/Hawaiian home lands. FIPS PUB 55-3 includes many more entity records than those for which the U.S. Census Bureau tabulates data. The FIPS 55 codes are state-based. American Indian reservations in more than one state will have a different FIPS 55 code for each state portion of the single reservation. The 1994, 1995, 1997, 1998, and 1999 versions of the TIGER/Line files do not contain the census codes for places, county subdivisions, and sub-MCDs that were available in earlier versions of the TIGER/Line files. A description of the 4-6 VTDP/PSAP/TAZ Verification TIGER/Line Files   U.S. Census Bureau's codes that are assigned to higher-level geographic entities (county subdivisions, sub-minor civil divisions, consolidated cities, and places) appears in the geographic identification coding scheme (GICS) product, TIGER/GICS. The TIGER/GICS contains FIPS and U.S. Census Bureau codes, names and attributes, and demographic data for the higher-level geographic entities included in the 1990 census.  Entity Type Codes The U.S. Census Bureau uses the Entity Type Code field on Record Type C to identify what legal or statistical entity a FIPS or Census code references. For example, the FIPS codes for both places and county subdivisions appear in the FIPS PUB 55-3 Code field. The Entity Type Code field identifies whether the FIPS code references a place or a county subdivision.

Record Type C links the geographic entity codes appearing in a TIGER/Line file to the name of the geographic entity associated with that code. Multiple records for the same geographic  Geographic Entities 4-7   entity may appear in a TIGER/Line file. The FIPS Code, Name, and/or Attribute Data Applicable Year field (field name DATAYR) identifies the names and codes as 1990, current, 2000 (TENTATIVE), or all three. Refer to the section on Codes for Entities in this chapter for information on the four possible DATAYR values.  Geographic Entities The U.S. Census Bureau is using the 1999 TIGER/Line files to exchange data with local partners participating in U.S. Census Bureau programs. Data users should NOT use the information contained in fields identified as 2000 (TENTATIVE) as the Census 2000 geographic codes or boundaries. This data is subject to change. Fields identified as 2000 (TENTATIVE) are intended for use by program participants only.  American Indian Areas, Alaska Native Areas, and Hawaiian Home Lands (AIANHHs) There are both legal and statistical American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian entities for which the U.S. Census Bureau provides data. The legal entities consist of federally recognized American Indian reservations and offreservation trust land areas, the tribal subdivisions that can divide these entities, state recognized American Indian reservations, Alaska Native Regional Corporations (ANRCs), and Hawaiian home lands (HHLs). The statistical entities are Alaska Native village statistical areas (ANVSAs), Oklahoma tribal statistical areas (OTSAs), tribal designated statistical areas (TDSAs), and state designated American Indian statistical areas (SDAISAs). Legal tribal subdivisions can exist within the statistical Oklahoma tribal statistical areas. In all cases, these areas are mutually exclusive in that no American Indian, Alaska Native, or Hawaiian home lands can overlap another tribal entity, except for tribal subdivisions, which subdivide some American Indian entities, and Alaska Native village statistical areas (ANVSAs), which exist within Alaska Native Regional Corporations (ANRCs). In some cases where more than one tribe claims jurisdiction over an area, the U.S. Census Bureau creates a joint-use area as a separate entity to define this area of dual claims. The American Indian, Alaska Native, and Hawaiian home lands (AIANHHs) are represented in the TIGER/Line files by a 5-character numeric FIPS code field, a 4-character numeric census code field (except for American Indian 4-8 VTDP/PSAP/TAZ Verification TIGER/Line Files   Tribal subdivsions which have a 3-character numeric census code field), and a single alphabetic character American Indian/Hawaiian home land trust land indicator field. FIPS codes are assigned in alphabetical sequence within state; because of this the FIPS code is different in each state for American Indian entities in more than one state. The census codes are assigned in alphabetical order nationwide, except that joint-use areas appear at the end of the code range. The U.S. Census Bureau assigns the 3-character American Indian tribal subdivision code alphabetically in order and unique within each reservation, associated off-reservation trust land, and Oklahoma tribal statistical area (OTSA). The TIGER/Line files use multiple fields to identify the legal and statistical AIANHHs: Legal Entities  Alaska Native Regional Corporations (ANRCs) are corporate entities established under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1972 (PL 92-203) as amended by Public Law 94-204, to conduct business and nonprofit operations for Alaska Natives. Alaska is divided into 12 ANRCs that cover all of the state of Alaska except for the Annette Islands Reserve (an American Indian reservation). A thirteenth ANRC represents Alaska Native who do not live in Alaska and do not identify with any of the 12 corporations. Because this thirteenth ANRC does not have boundaries, it does not appear in the TIGER/Line files. ANRC boundaries have been established by the Department of the Interior in cooperation with Alaska Natives. Each ANRC is designed to include Alaska Natives with a common heritage and common interests. The U.S. Census Bureau offers representatives of the 12 nonprofit ANRCs the opportunity to review and update the ANRC boundaries. The U.S. Census Bureau first provided data for ANRCs for the 1990 census.  American Indian reservations (AIRs) are legal entities having boundaries established by treaty, statute, and/or executive or court order and are recognized by the federal government as territory in which American Indian tribes have primary governmental jurisdiction. The areas identified as American Indian reservations include entities with other designations, such as pueblo, colony, and community. The U.S. Census Bureau contacts representatives of American Indian tribal governments to identify the areas and boundaries for federal reservations. State reservations are lands held in trust by state governments for the use and benefit of a given tribe. State governments provide the names and boundaries for state reservaGeographic Entities 4-9   tions. Lands that are administered jointly and/or are claimed by two tribes are called ""joint-use areas,"" and are treated as separate American Indian reservations for census purposes. Federal reservations may cross state boundaries, and federal and state reservations may cross county, county subdivision, and place boundaries. The U.S. Census Bureau first reported data for American Indian reservations in the 1970 census.  American Indian trust lands included in the census are the off-reservation lands that constitute the territory over which American Indian tribes have primary jurisdiction. Trust land is property associated with a particular American Indian reservation or tribe, held in trust by the Federal Government. Trust lands may be either tribal (held in trust for the tribe) or individual (held in trust for an individual member of the tribe). Trust lands recognized in U.S. Census Bureau data tabulations are always ""offreservation""; that is, they comprise all tribal and individual trust lands located outside of a reservation boundary. They are identified by representatives of the reservations or tribes. The U.S. Census Bureau first reported data for off-reservation tribal trust lands in the 1980 census and for individual trust lands in the 1990 census. The Census Bureau does not report data for restricted or fee-paid lands or for native allotments (unless such lands are within a reservation). Trust lands are assigned the same code as the reservation with which they are associated. Trust lands not associated with a reservation are assigned codes based on the tribal name. Because AIRs and trust lands share the same code, the 1990 and 1992 TIGER/Line files did not distinguish between AIRs and trust lands. Beginning with the 1994 TIGER/Line files, American Indian trust lands are flagged in a separate field.  American Indian Tribal Subdivisions are administrative subdivisions of federally recognized American Indian reservations, off-reservation trust lands, and Oklahoma tribal statistical areas. Tribal subdivisions are called areas, chapters, communities, districts, and so forth. These entities are internal units of self-government or administration that serve social, cultural, and/or economic purposes for American Indians on reservations and/or off-reservation trust lands. The U.S. Census Bureau obtains the boundary and name information for tribal subdivisions from tribal governments. The U.S. Census Bureau first reported data for American  4-10 VTDP/PSAP/TAZ Verification TIGER/Line  Files   Indian tribal subdivisions in 1980 when it identified them as ""American Indian subreservation areas."" The U.S. Census Bureau did not provide data for American Indian tribal subdivisions in 1990.  Hawaiian Home Lands (HHLs) are lands held in trust for Native Hawaiians by the State of Hawaii, pursuant to the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920. The U.S. Census Bureau obtains the names and boundaries of the HHLs from state officials. HHLs are a new geographic entity for Census 2000. Statistical Entities  Alaska Native village statistical areas (ANVSAs) represent the concentrated settled area of each Alaska Native village (ANV) which constitute tribes, bands, clans, villages, communities, or associations established as part of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1972 (PL 92-203), as amended by Public Law 94-204. Because ANVs usually have no definite legal boundaries and often include many square miles of land used by Alaska Natives for hunting and fishing, the U.S. Census Bureau established ANVSAs for purposes of data presentation. ANVSAs are delineated or reviewed by officials of the ANV or the Alaska Native Regional Corporation (ANRC) in which the ANV is located. An ANVSA may not overlap the boundary of another ANVSA, an American Indian reservation, or a tribal designated statistical area (TDSA). The U.S. Census Bureau first provided data for ANVSAs for the 1990 census.  Oklahoma tribal statistical areas (OTSAs) are statistical areas identified and delineated for the U.S. Census Bureau by federally recognized American Indian tribes in Oklahoma that do not have a reservation in that state. An OTSA encompasses an area that is generally defined by the boundary of a former reservation in Oklahoma that had legally established boundaries, but was dissolved preceding the establishment of Oklahoma as a state in 1907. If tribal officials of adjacent OTSAs delineate an area of overlap, the U.S. Census Bureau calls this area a ""joint-use area"" and treats it as a separate OTSA for census purposes. OTSAs may cross the boundaries of Oklahoma and include territory in a neighboring state, but not area within any reservation. OTSAs replace the tribal jurisdiction statistical areas (TJSAs) of the 1990 census. The U.S. Census Bureau first reported data for these former reservations in 1980, when it defined a single all-encompassing geographic area called the ""Historic Areas of Oklahoma."" Geographic Entities 4-11    State designated American Indian statistical areas (SDAISAs) are statistical entities for state recognized American Indian tribes that do not have a state recognized land base (reservation). SDAISAs are identified and delineated for the U.S. Census Bureau by a state liaison identified by the Governor's office. SDAISAs generally encompass a compact and contiguous area that contains individuals who identify with a state recognized American Indian tribe and in which there is identifiable tribal activity. A SDAISA may not be located in more than one state unless the tribe is recognized by both states, and it may not include area within a reservation, off-reservation trust land, Alaska Native village statistical area (ANVSA), tribal designated statistical area (TDSA), or Oklahoma tribal statistical area (OTSA). The U.S. Census Bureau established SDAISAs as a new geographic statistical area for Census 2000 to differentiate between state recognized tribes without a land base and federally recognized tribes without a land base. In 1990, all such tribes had been identified as tribal designated statistical areas (TDSAs).  Tribal designated statistical areas (TDSAs) are statistical areas identified and delineated for the U.S. Census Bureau by federally recognized American Indian tribes that do not have a land base (reservation or off-reservation trust land). A TDSA encompasses a compact and contiguous area that contains individuals who identify with the federally recognized American Indian tribe and in which there is identifiable tribal activity. A TDSA may be located in more than one state, but it may not include area within a reservation, off-reservation trust land, Alaska Native village statistical area (ANVSA), state designated American Indian statistical area (SDAISA), or Oklahoma tribal statistical area (OTSA). The U.S. Census Bureau first reported data for TDSAs in 1990, when both federally and state recognized tribes could identify and delineate TDSAs. For Census 2000, TDSAs now apply only to federally recognized tribes. State recognized tribes without a land base, including those that were TDSAs in 1990, are identified as state designated American Indian statistical areas (SDAISAs), a new geographic entity for Census 2000.  Tribal jurisdiction statistical areas (TJSAs) are 1990 geographic areas delineated for 1990 census data tabulation purposes in Oklahoma by federally recognized tribes that did not have a legally defined reservation. The 1990 TJSAs have been replaced for Census 2000 by Oklahoma tribal statistical areas (OTSAs). 4-12 VTDP/PSAP/TAZ Verification TIGER/Line  Files   AIANHH Code Record Locations Record Type 1 1 1 1 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 A A C C C C Field Name AIANHHL AIANHHR A IHHTLIL A IHHTLIR AIANHHCE90L AIANHHCE90R AIHHTLI90L A IHHTLI90R AIANHHCEL AIANHHCER ANRCL ANRCR AITSCEL AITSCER AITSL AITSR AIANHH90 AIANHHCE90 ENTITY AIANHHCE AITSCE NAME Description FIPS 55 Code (American Indian/Alaska Native Area/ Hawaiian Home Land), Current Left FIPS 55 Code (American Indian/Alaska Native Area/ Hawaiian Home Land), Current Right American Indian/Hawaiian Home Land Trust Land Indicator, Current Left American Indian/Hawaiian Home Land Trust Land Indicator, Current Right Census Code (American Indian/Alaska Native Area/ Hawaiian Home Land),1990 Left Census Code (American Indian/Alaska Native Area/ Hawaiian Home Land),1990 Right American Indian/Hawaiian Home Land Trust Land Indicator, 1990 Left American Indian/Hawaiian Home Land Trust Land Indicator, 1990 Right Census Code (American Indian/Alaska Native Area/ Hawaiian Home Land), Current Left Census Code (American Indian/Alaska Native Area/ Hawaiian Home Land), Current Right FIPS 55 Code (ANRC), Current Left FIPS 55 Code (ANRC), Current Right Census Code (American Indian Tribal Subdivision), 2000 (TENTATIVE) Left Census Code (American Indian Tribal Subdivision), 2000 (TENTATIVE) Right FIPS 55 Code (American Indian Tribal Subdivision), 2000 (TENTATIVE) Left FIPS 55 Code (American Indian Tribal Subdivision), 2000 (TENTATIVE) Right FIPS 55 Code (American Indian/Alaska Native Area/ Hawaiian Home Land), 1990 Census Code (American Indian/Alaska Native Area / Hawaiian Home Land), 1990 Entity Type Code Census American Indian/Alaska Native Area / Hawaiian Home Land Code Census American Indian Tribal Subdivision Code Name of Geographic Area  Geographic Entities 4-13   AIANHH Code Record Locations (cont.)

The Land Management Information Center at Minnesota Planning assists state and local government to effectively use geographic information in public policy-making and operations. To fulfill this mission in part, LMIC provides public access to the data sets listed in the Minnesota Geographic Data Catalog 2000. The Land Management Information Center's homepage on the World Wide Web is http:// www.lmic.state.mn.us. The site links to the data catalog, as well as to available online data sets, documentation and status maps, information about Datanet, EPPL7, documentation standards and the Minnesota Governor's Council on Geographic Information. Upon request, the Minnesota Geographic Data Catalog 2000 will be made available in an alternative format, such as Braille, large print or audio tape.

The data sets listed in the catalog are routinely used by the Land Management Information Center at Minnesota Planning and others for a wide range of purposes, from helping site pipelines and assessing the effects of power plant emissions to managing inventories. LMIC has prepared this catalog to help geographic data users identify and obtain the information they need. Geographic data is information that can be mapped. Such data connects attributes that describe a certain condition, such as population, elevation or the width of a pipeline, to that condition's location on the surface of the Earth. This data can be used with software applications, called geographic information systems, for spatial analysis. Many functions of government require accurate, complete and current information about the land. In response, a wide variety of public data has been developed and maintained by federal, state and local government agencies. This data also is used by academic institutions, businesses and nonprofit organizations, and the general public. When properly gathered and organized, this data can be readily shared, thereby minimizing the need for different organizations to invest in collecting the same information. results will be compromised if these characteristics are not matched in each data set. Each of these geographic data characteristics is briefly summarized here.  Map projection It is impossible to represent the curved surface of the earth on the flat surface of a map without introducing some error. A map projection is a mathematical description of the transformation that allows cartographers to measure and control that error. Because many of the data sets described in this catalog were derived from printed maps, characteristics of each map's projection are carried over into the electronic data. The two most common map projections found in Minnesota are the Lambert Conformal Conic Projection and the Transverse Mercator Projection. A special version of the latter, called the Universal Transverse Mercator, is possibly the most widely used projection for statewide mapping in Minnesota. Nearly all the data available from LMIC is in this UTM projection. The UTM system divides the Earth into 60 north-south strips, called zones. Each zone is numbered and extends almost from the North to the South Pole. Each is 6-degrees longitude wide and centered around a line of longitude called the central meridian. For more information on the UTM system, see http://mapping.usgs.gov/ mac/isb/pubs/factsheets/fs15799.html Minnesota lies almost entirely within UTM Zone 15; its central meridian -- 93 degrees west longitude -- runs north and south roughly through Hibbing, St. Paul and Austin. Unfortunately, the east and west extremes of the state fall outside Zone 15: the tip of the Arrowhead reMinnesota's Land Management Information Center 1  Minnesota Geographic Data Catalog 2000 organizes data into seven categories: administrative and political boundaries, census geography, physical and biological, remote sensing, transportation and utilities, U.S. Geological Survey base data and data collections. Each entry contains essential information about the data's source, its original map scale if applicable, file format, the area each file covers, how much of the state is covered and how the data may be obtained. An index is included on page 31.  CONSIDERATIONS WHEN USING GEOGRAPHIC DATA Map projection, datum, coordinate system, precision, Y-coordinate shift and data format are important characteristics of geographic data sets that affect their appropriate and meaningful use. When more than one type of data is used to produce a map or to perform geographic analysis,   gion around Grand Portage is within UTM Zone 16, and a strip of western Minnesota from Kittson County down to Rock County falls within UTM Zone 14. This three-zone partitioning creates continuity problems across the seams when data sets spanning zones are used together. To overcome this inconvenience, most data sets from LMIC have been reorganized into a single zone -- UTM Zone 15 Extended -- to cover the entire state.  lis.html or contact the Minnesota Department of Transportation Geodetic Unit at 651-296-8804.  Horizontal datum Since the Earth is not a perfect sphere, distortions in its shape present knotty problems in accurately locating places. To solve this dilemma, cartographers measure location from a smooth mathematical surface -- a reference ellipsoid -- that closely fits the Earth's mean sea level. A variety of ellipsoids, customized to fit specific parts of the Earth, have been developed over time. When a specific ellipsoid is accepted as the basis for mapping over all or a large portion of the Earth, it is referred to as the horizontal datum. An ellipsoid called Clarke 1866 had been accepted as the standard datum for detailed mapping in North America for most of the 20th century. This datum is referred to as the North American Datum of 1927, or NAD27. Almost all U.S. Geological Survey quadrangle maps for Minnesota are cast on the NAD27. When these maps are digitized, the geometric qualities of the datum are captured. The advent of highly accurate measurement using satellites has allowed for further refinement of the Earth's horizontal datum. A modern ellipsoid, the Geodetic Reference System of 1980 -- or GRS80 -- capitalizes on advances in space technology. Based on GRS80, the North American Datum of 1983 -- NAD83 -- has become the standard for an increasing amount of new mapping in Minnesota. In digital form, data can be readily transformed between NAD27 and NAD83. Most data from LMIC is in NAD83.  Precision How accurately a point can be recorded in a data file depends on how much space in the file is allocated to store the x and y coordinates for that point. Precision refers to the number of digits reserved to store location coordinates in a geographic data set. Higher precision does not necessarily mean higher accuracy; rather, it simply means that space is available to store more accu-  WHAT'S NEW IN THE 2000 CATALOG Visit the Minnesota clearinghouse for catalog updates at http://www.lmic.state.mn.us/chouse.html Many more data sets are free online.

But, because they are designed to reference a sphere, latitude and longitude are sometimes difficult to work with on flat maps and in the computer files created from those maps. Thus, rectangular coordinate systems have been developed to store location information in geographic data sets. UTM Cartesian -- x, y -- coordinates are recorded in meters. The x-coordinate measures the number of meters east or west of a central meridian; the y-coordinate measures the number of meters north or south of the Equator. Most data available from LMIC is in UTM coordinates. Other examples of rectangular coordinate systems include State Plane coordinates and county coordinates. For more information on converting coordinates between UTM, Minnesota State Plane and Minnesota county coordinates, see http://rocky.dot.state.mn.us/LIS/ 2 Minnesota Geographic Data Catalog 2000   rate values, if careful measurements are taken. Two levels of precision are common in geographic data sets: single precision coordinates store up to seven significant digits, while double precision coordinates can store up to 15. Some GIS software can use only single precision data. Coordinate precision will be an important consideration if data is to be processed with this type of software.  Y-coordinate shift The UTM coordinate system records y-coordinate values between 4 million and 5 million meters in Minnesota. Their size requires that more than seven digits be used to maintain accuracy. To accommodate GIS software that can only use single precision files, a fixed number is often subtracted from each y-coordinate, producing a controlled shift or offset in the data. The standard offset in Minnesota is 4.7 million meters. The need for y-coordinate shifted data is diminishing as more robust software is developed. Most data sets from LMIC are in double precision, unshifted form. Data formats Data sets may be available as vector or raster files. Vector means that geographic features are represented by x,y coordinates. Features can be symbolized by points, lines or polygons (areas). Raster means that data values are assigned to grid cells. A group of grid cells with the same value represents a feature, for example, a lake. Most vector data sets from LMIC are available in ARC/INFO export or shapefile formats, and most raster data sets are in EPPL7, ERDAS or GeoTIFF formats. Each data set description in this catalog lists all available formats. Note: ArcView users can now download a free extension from LMIC to view EPPL7 format files directly in ArcView. See http:// www.mnplan.state.mn.us/EPPL7/whatsnew/arcview.htm  The Land Management Information Center has contributed to the work of the Minnesota Governor's Council on Geographic Information to help develop a metadata format specifically designed for geographic data. The Minnesota Geographic Metadata Guidelines provide a convenient template to help anyone working with GIS to document their own data. A copy of these guidelines can be found at http://www.lmic.state.mn.us/gc/stds/ metadata.htm or by calling LMIC at 651-296-1211. To help make it easier for data creators to gather metadata, many software tools have been developed that allow users to concentrate on the content of their documentation rather than on format. DataLogr is one of those helpful tools. A Windows-based metadata entry tool, DataLogr is simple to operate and does not require additional software. It produces structured files that follow the Minnesota Geographic Metadata Guidelines and that can be output in a variety of formats, including HTML that can be viewed on-screen, printed out or put on a web site. DataLogr was developed by IMAGIN, a nonprofit consortium of Michigan agencies, and is available from LMIC at no charge to government, academic and nonprofit organizations within Minnesota. This offering is made possible through the generous contributions of the Metropolitan Council, the Forest Resources Council through the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources and LMIC. For-profit organizations in Minnesota can obtain the software for $85. The software is shipped with an output file formatting utility, detailed users guide and helpful information about data documentation with examples. To obtain more information or a copy of DataLogr, see http://www.lmic.state.mn.us/chouse/datalogr.html or contact LMIC at 651-296-1211 or clearinghouse@mnplan.state.mn.us.  DOCUMENTING DATA An integral part of any geographic data set is a wellorganized description of its content. This type of explanatory information is called metadata -- a written record of the most important facts about a data set. Metadata is critical to data creators who need to organize data and keep track of when it was created and what it contains. Metadata is equally important to those sharing data who need clear and complete information about data they are considering using. Well-designed metadata answers seven questions: What is this data about; where did it come from; when was it gathered? What is its quality? How is it organized? Where is the data set located on the earth's surface? What kind of features does this data set describe; in how much detail? How is this data set distributed? Who put this documentation together?  FINDING D ATA Today, finding a library book located in a neighboring county or across the country is almost as easy as finding a book on a shelf of your neighborhood library. This convenience is made possible through an automated catalog that allows patrons to search for and find library resources electronically. The online catalog contains descriptive information -- metadata -- about the title, author, subject and location of millions of publications. A simple search at a library computer terminal can quickly locate the closest copy of a particular book or article. In some cases, an order to have the book delivered to the local library can be placed immediately, or an electronic version of the article can be instantaneously delivered. Wouldn't it be convenient if GIS professionals could find the data they need as easily as they can find a book? A new Internet service -- GeoGateway, the search tool of the Minnesota Geographic Data Clearinghouse -- attempts to do just that. The GeoGateway uses structured meta-  Minnesota's Land Management Information Center  3   data, such as that produced through DataLogr, as its electronic catalog. Users of the GeoGateway identify the geographic area they are interested in, the theme of data they desire and the individual data libraries they would like to search. Information is returned identifying available data and how it may be obtained. In many cases, users can immediately download the data they discover. Data libraries at the Land Management Information Center, Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, Arrowhead Regional Development Commission, U.S. Geological Survey, Natural Resources Conservation Service and U.S. Bureau of the Census are only a few sources for the hundreds of data sets that can be found about Minnesota and the Upper Midwest region through the GeoGateway. To search for data using the GeoGateway, visit the LMIC web site at http://www.lmic.state.mn.us/chouse.html and click on the GeoGateway link. Detailed metadata describ-  ing most of the data sets listed in this catalog is now available. LMIC's web site also contains links to the National Geospatial Data Clearinghouse, for users who wish to find digital geographic data from all over the world; to Data Finder, a similar search tool focused on data within the Twin Cities metropolitan area; and to the Data Deli, a data delivery site developed by the Minnesota DNR.

This data is analyzing issues within geographic areas, such as political jurisdictions, districts. a single line could be coded as a county and census tract boundary, and also as a river. Using these line codes, GIS users can select features they want to analyze. The census distributes these files in TIGER format, and publishes a data users' guide that explains format and translates codes. Although line files can be complicated, they are sometimes the only source for geocode address information. Note: Many areas, particularly rural parts of the state, do not have complete address information. Private vendors may also be a valuable alternate source for this data since many of them have repackaged the data to make it easier to use. Source: U.S. Geological Survey quadrangles, census DIME files, field transcriptions Scale: 1:100,000 and various State coverage: Full Format: TIGER/Line File unit: County Distributor: U.S. Bureau of the Census Customer Services Office, http://www.census.gov or 301-457-4100  Census data can be organized into two main categories: 1) information about the location and shape of areas; such as counties, tracts and blocks, and 2) information about demographic and economic characteristics of those areas; such as population, housing and income. These two categories may be thought of as census geography and census statistics. Within a state, the U.S. Bureau of the Census delineates four units of census geography: counties are divided into census tracts, which are made up of block groups. Block groups are further subdivided into individual blocks (see diagram on page 10). All census geography areas lie completely within a single county. A different type of area, the minor civil division, is often related to census geography. In Minnesota, MCDs refer to townships and cities. They can cross county boundaries and can contain a number of census blocks, block groups and, if large enough, census tracts. The U.S. Bureau of the Census provides a single vector data set composed of a variety of geographic features -- roads, streams, railroads -- together with boundaries for all census geography areas. That collection is called a TIGER/Line file. TIGER stands for topologically integrated geographic encoding and referencing. Although filled with an assortment of valuable information, TIGER/Line files are quite large and can be difficult to work with. As a convenience to GIS users, Minnesota's Legislative GIS Office and the Land Management Information Center have refined the TIGER/Line files prepared for the 1990 decennial census by creating separate data files for each level of census geography. In addition, files for MCDs, school districts and legislative and congressional districts within Minnesota are also available. Below are descriptions of TIGER/Line files, census geography data separated by area and sources for census statistics. For information on raster versions of census geography, see page 26.  The Land Management Information Center distributes a version of the data set described above in ARC/INFO format that includes 1992 file updates and corrections, primarily additional address range information. The U.S. Bureau of the Census has prepared more recent updates, but these have not been incorporated into LMIC files.

In this section, environmental data is subdivided into six categories: ECOLOGICAL REGIONS lists state areas with similar natural resource characteristics. ELEVATION describes Minnesota's topography. GEOLOGY and HYDROGEOLOGY includes geological structures and associated subsurface water features. LAND USE shows how agriculture, urbanization, forests and other land characteristics are distributed. SOILS describes the state's wide variety. SURFACE WATER lists locations of streams, lakes, wetlands and watersheds. ECOLOGICAL REGIONS Aquatic Ecoregion Boundaries -- Minnesota Pollution Control Agency The national Aquatic Ecoregion map by Omernik of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is based on land use, soils, land surface form and potential natural vegetation. Aquatic ecoregions are used to categorize stream and lake characteristics. The Pollution Control Agency recompiled Minnesota's ecoregions based on Minnesota Department of Natural Resources minor watershed boundaries. Based on the results, the Land Management Information Center created the ecoregion file.

Documentation: http://lucy.lmic.state.mn.us/metadata/ drg24dnr.html Price: Free via online link in documentation  The Land Management Information Center does not distribute paper copies of U.S. Geological Survey topographic maps, although it managed a multi-year effort to complete statewide coverage. The 1:24,000-scale maps may be located and ordered using the USGS Map Finder application, accessed via http:// edcwww.cr.usgs.gov/srord-link.html. Map Finder's search methods include entering the name of a populated place or a zip code or clicking on a map. Maps of all scales may also be ordered directly from private vendors (see Maps in MAP  Minnesota's Land Management Information Center 23   U. S. Geological Survey Base Data  the yellow pages); from the Minnesota Geological Survey's Map Sales Office at http://www.geo.umn.edu/mgs or 612627-4782; or by calling USGS at 888-ASK-USGS. A fold-out map, Index to Topographic and Other Map Coverage, shows the state's quadrangle boundaries and names at standard USGS map series scales: 1:24,000; 1:100,000; 1:250,000. The index also describes a number of survey map products. Single copies are available at no charge from LMIC, or order free copies of any state's index from USGS either online at http://edcwww.cr.usgs.gov/ Webglis/catindex.html or by calling 888-ASK-USGS. Quadrangle map boundaries. LMIC generated three quadrangle boundary data files by calculating U.S. Geological Survey quadrangle corners based on the latitude/ longitude calculating algorithm provided in ARC/INFO and casting them on the UTM Zone 15 extended projection. One file is available for each quadrangle delineation. Note: Using these standard boundary files to create data or divide existing data into smaller file units will help users produce seamless data sets that register to other files available from LMIC and other Minnesota state agencies.

CD collections conveniently group many individual data sets described in this catalog. Datanet offers online reports and maps of summarized social, economic and demographic statistics for Minnesota. The following CD collections have been designed to be used with ArcView, EPIC2000 and EPPL7 GIS software. Other software packages may also be able to use the files that are in shapefile, ERDAS or GeoTIFF format. A free extension that allows ArcView users to directly display EPPL7 raster files may be downloaded from http:// www.mnplan.state.mn.us/EPPL7. That site also contains information about EPPL7 and EPIC2000, the Windowsbased interface to many of the spatial analysis capabilities of EPPL7.

The data themes cover a wide range of physical and biological variables along with administrative, census, political and transportation data. The data collection unit for most of the variables is the 40-acre parcel. Files have been subdivided into 100-meter by 100-meter grid cells and spatially corrected to provide improved geographic reference; however, this processing step does not improve the original 40-acre resolution accuracy. The data set is designed for use in regional and statewide planning, not for site-specific decision-making. Note: The original 40-acre variables comprise a data set called MLMIS (Minnesota Land Management Information System); the data set that includes spatially corrected variables was renamed MGC100 (Minnesota GeoCorrected to 100 meters).

Datanet integrates data about social, economic and demographic conditions in Minnesota in one location. It focuses on providing the summarized statistical information that is necessary for monitoring changing conditions, identifying emerging issues and measuring progress toward statewide goals. Information is presented in tables that integrate and enhance the value of the data, and menu options allow the user to create customized reports. Users can select from numerous geographic areas, time periods and data categories. The service is free. Datanet has also developed two new mapping applications for census tract data and for reported crimes. The Census Tract Finder allows Internet users to generate a report of summary census statistics for any census tract within the seven-county Twin Cities metropolitan area. A map with reference features is provided to make it easier to locate a particular tract. By the time Census 2000 data is available, the map will cover more cities beyond the metro area. The Justice Database: Reported Crimes Mapping Interface is a prototype application that allows users to create statewide maps of a number of offense categories using countylevel data.  The following data is used to redraw Minnesota's legislative districts. This law requires the U.S. Bureau of the Census to provide redistricting data in a geographic format requested by state governments.

They include files for all counties and statistically equivalent entities in the United States, as well as files for Puerto Rico and the Island Territories. The TIGER/Line files are released by county or statistically equivalent entity based on the latest available governmental unit boundaries. Since the 1990 Census, there have been several changes to the universe of county or statistically equivalent entities. In Alaska the SkagwayYukutat-Angoon Census Area has become Skagway-Hoonah-Angoon Census Area and Yukutat Borough. Also in Alaska, Denali Borough was created from parts of Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area and Southeast Fairbanks Census Area. Dade County, Florida officially changed its legal name to Miami-Dade County, Florida. The portion of Yellowstone National Park in Montana that the Census Bureau has been showing as a statistical equivalent of a county legally is contained within Gallatin and Park Counties, Montana. The City of South Boston, VA no longer is an independent city (statistical equivalent of a county) and is now part of Halifax County, VA. The TIGER/Line files contain data only and do not include display or mapping software. The TIGER/Line files are typically used in conjunction with geographic information system, or similar, software.  Census TIGER, TIGER, TIGER/Line, TIGER/SDTS, TIGER/Census Tract Street Index, TIGER/CTSI, CTSI, TIGER/Census Tract Comparability, and TIGER/GICS are registered trademarks of the U.S. Bureau of the Census; ZCTA is a trademark of the U.S. Bureau of the Census. As such, these names cannot be used as or within the proprietary product names of any commercial product including or otherwise relevant to Census Bureau data, and may only be used to refer to the nature of such product. The Census Bureau requests that any repackaging of the TIGER/Line data (and documenta-tion) and other files accompanying it for distribution include a conspicuously-placed statement to this effect on the product's cover, the first page of the website, or elsewhere of comparable visibility. Further, Census Bureau trademarks, when used in reference to the nature of the product, should be accompanied by the  (registered) symbol or  symbol, where convenient.  Introduction I-1   The US Bureau of the Census first released the TIGER/Line files in 1988. Since that time, it has released several versions of the files, with each successive version being improved through increased editing and updating of address ranges and features. A brief discussion of the changes that occurred in the 1994, 1995 and 1997 TIGER/Line files, and the 1998 TIGER/Line files are summarized below.  Changes in the Post 1994 TIGER/Line File Versions 1994 TIGER/Line Files The format and structure of the TIGER/Line files changed between the 1992 and the 1994 versions. In the 1994 TIGER/Line files, there were field definition changes and additional record types that accommodated new information or information that was previously supplied separately in other Census Bureau products. New Record Types The 1994 TIGER/Line files included five new record types9, C, H, S, and Z. Record Type 9 contained key geographic locations (KGLs). A KGL was a particular type of point landmark with residential or economic significance. Record Type 9 provided the linkage between a building (KGL) with a unique identity and ZIP+4 Code, and the buildings address that used its number and street name. Record Type C replaced information that was supplied separately in the TIGER/Geographic Name files. Record Type C provided a unique list of all geographic entities with their code, name, and status. The FIPS Year field had three values, 90 for geographic names and codes valid for the 1990 census, 94 for geographic names and codes valid for the current year, and blank when the geographic names and codes were the same for 1990 and 1994. Multiple records for the same geographic entity showed its change or correction over time. Record Type H described the history of TIGER/Line IDs when complete chains were split or merged. Two fields (HIST and SOURCE) on Record Type H were not yet maintained in the Census TIGER data base and were blank.  I-2 1998 TIGER/Line Files   Record Type S had geographic area codes for polygons. It was similar to Record Type A (which also had geographic area codes for polygons) and was linked to Record Type P. There was a Record Type S for every polygon in Record Type P. Several fields were reserved for use by participants in Census Bureau programs. The WATER field had two values, 0 for land or 1 for water. The Congressional District codes for the current Congress (in this case, the 103rd) were moved to Record Type S. The current Congressional District code, when combined with the 1990 state codes, created valid geographic areas. When only current state geographic codes were combined, nonexistent geographic areas may have resulted. The fields for the 101st and 103rd Congressional District codes in Record Type A were replaced with those designated for the 106th and 108th. However, these fields were blank in the 1994 TIGER/Line files. Record Type Z linked a Postal +4 Add-On code to an address range in either Record Type 1 or Record Type 6. TLID fields were matched on these records. If the RTSQ field on Record Type 6 contained a 0, the Postal +4 Add-On codes applied to the address ranges in Record Type 1. If the RTSQ field contained a number greater than 0, the Postal +4 AddOn codes applied to the address ranges in the Record Type 6 that had the identical RTSQ value. Deleted Record Types In the 1994 TIGER/Line files, Record Types F and G were deleted because they were no longer used. Record Type F showed geographic codes as of January 1, 1990 that were corrected to resolve questions raised by local officials about the 1990 census data tabulations. Record Type G showed geographic codes (generally as of January 1, 1992) for those situations where geographic entities reported boundary changes during the Census Bureaus annual survey of governmental units. In the 1994 TIGER/Line files, information previously reported in Record Type G became implicit in the current geographic codes in Record Types 1 and S. Field Definition Changes The geographic area codes on Record Type 1 represented current geography rather than the 1990 census tabulation geography. The census tract and block remained as 1990 geography. In a few Type 1 records, the current state and county, when combined  Introduction I-3   with the 1990 census tract and block, created nonexistent geographic areas. To avoid nonexistent geographic areas, it was important not to mix the 1990 geographic codes with the current geographic codes. The 1990 state, county, place, census tract, and census block codes all were found on Record Type 3. Record Type 3 no longer identified 1980 geographic area codes or contained census codes for places, minor civil divisions, and sub-minor civil divisions. These fields were replaced with the 1990 geographic areas that previously appeared in Record Type 1. Current geographic areas included on Record Type 3 were the Alaska Native Regional Corporations and the American Indian/Alaska Native Areas (AIANAs). Census Alaska Native Regional Corporation codes were eliminated from Record Type 1 and replaced by four fields. Two fields were reserved for census use. Two fields carried American Indian Trust Land Flags and contained two values, an I for individual trust land or a T for tribal trust land. The trust land flag more accurately portrayed the American Indian areas. Record Type 7 excluded key geographic locations (KGLs). These appeared in the new Record Type 9. Address Ranges and ZIP Codes The 1994 TIGER/Line files contained improvements in address information. Address ranges were edited for overlaps or other inconsistencies and ZIP Codes were updated in selected areas. Coordinates In the 1994 TIGER/Line files, NAD27 was the coordinate datum used for the 48 contiguous states, the District of Columbia, Alaska, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. Regional datums were used for Hawaii and the Island Territories in the Pacific. The accuracy of the feature coordinates in Alaska was improved by shifting them in relation to a sample of points of known higher accuracy.  I-4 1998 TIGER/Line Files   1995 TIGER/Line Files No records types were added or deleted between the 1994 and 1995 versions of the TIGER/Line files. However, there were field definition and coordinate datum changes, as well as address information improvements, in the 1995 TIGER/Line files. Field Definition Changes The CENID field was changed from numeric to alphanumeric in the 1995 TIGER/Line files to permit a wider range of entries within the same field length. Address Ranges and ZIP Codes Address ranges were edited for overlaps or other inconsistencies and ZIP Codes were updated in selected areas. The street names and address ranges in the Census TIGER data base were compared to those in the ZIP+4 file of the US Postal Service. If a street name and address range did not have a ZIP+4 code, the code was copied from the ZIP+4 file to the Census TIGER data base. The consistency of highway names and feature identifiers also was improved. Boundary and Area Changes The 1994 TIGER/Line files were included for American Samoa because the Census Bureau received no updates for this area. Since the 1990 census, the Bureau shifted and reshaped some line features, including boundary lines. This realignment of features could have been associated with corporate boundary corrections and changes. The shape and area of the geographic entities depicted in the 1995 TIGER/Line files may have differed from earlier versions of the TIGER/Line files, but represented the entities as they existed for the 1990 census. The inventory of census tabulation entities remained the same as it was in 1990. With the exception of Hawaii, Record Type 1 no longer contained census designated place (CDP) information. Since CDPs are defined at the time of each decennial census and are valid only for the presentation of decennial census data, the CDP complete chain information was removed from Record Type 1 which contained only current geography, but retained on Record Type 3 which had 1990 geography. Because Hawaii did not have independently-defined incorporated place boundaries, it used CDP boundaries as substitutes for these legal boundaries. Thus, its CDP complete chain information was retained on Record Type 1.  Introduction I-5   Coordinates For the 48 contiguous states, the District of Columbia, Alaska, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, the coordinates in the 1995 TIGER/Line files were in the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). In all previous versions, the coordinate datum for the above areas was NAD27. Regional datums were used for Hawaii and the Island Territories in the Pacific.  1997 TIGER/Line Files The 1997 TIGER/Line files had the same structure as the 1995 TIGER/ Line files; there were no record additions or deletions. However, there were some field name, file name, and content changes. Field Definition Changes The Census Bureau redefined the concept of version. The four-digit version code no longer is a number that represents a fixed version that can be referenced nationwide. The version code is a four-digit number that represents the month and year (mmyy) the file is extracted from the Census TIGER data base. Adjacent counties in a state may have different version codes if they were extracted at different points in time. There were several changes to the fields on Record Type 3. The reserved spaces one through four in the 1995 TIGER/Line files contain four 1990 American Indian and Alaska Native area census code and American Indian trust land flag fields in the 1997 TIGER/Line files. These four fields are: Census American Indian/Alaska Native Area Code, 1990 Left (column positions 58 through 61); Census American Indian/Alaska Native Area Code, 1990 Right (column positions 62 through 65); American Indian Trust Land Flag, 1990 Left (column position 66); and American Indian Trust Land Flag, 1990 Right (column position 67). Deleted from Record Type 3 in the 1997 TIGER/Line files were the Census Alaska Native Regional Corporation Codes, Current Left and Census Alaska Native Regional Corporation Codes, Current Right. As a result of these deletions, reserved space filled columns 86 through 107 of the 1997 TIGER/Line files and the reserved space fields on the record were renumbered and reconfigured.  I-6 1998 TIGER/Line Files   Two changes occurred on Record Type A. The School District Code, Middle School field, in columns 60 through 64 of the 1995 TIGER/ Line files were eliminated and replaced with Reserved Space 1 in the 1997 TIGER/Line files. Reserved Space 9 in the 1995 TIGER/Line files (columns 95 through 98) was replaced with the Census American Indian/Alaska Native Area Code, 1990 in the 1997 TIGER/Line files. The length of the RS 9 field in Record Type A was changed from nine characters to four characters. The five characters freed by this change were used for the 1990 state and county codes and are the source for determining the 1990 census tabulation codes. There were changes to Record Type C in the 1997 TIGER/Line files. The 1995 TIGER/Line files had ten characters in columns 23 through 32 which contained the Census Alaska Native Regional Corporation Code, FIPS Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area/Metropolitan Statistical Area Code, and the FIPS Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area Code. The 1997 TIGER/Line files allocated these columns to Entity Type Code, Metropolitan Area Code, and School District Code. We standardized the file suffix names that appear inside the zipped archive. This suffix now consistently be .rtn where n is the record type. In examining the record layouts in Chapter 6, we corrected information concerning the valid existence of blank values and data formats. Address Ranges and ZIP Codes Address ranges were edited for overlaps or other inconsistencies and ZIP Codes were updated in selected areas. Because of time constraints during the various operations needed to create the 1997 TIGER/Line files, the Census Bureau did not add new ZIP+4 information. Boundary and Area Changes Since the 1990 census, the Census Bureau shifted and reshaped some line features, including boundary lines. The shape and area of the geographic entities depicted in the 1997 TIGER/ Line files may differ from earlier versions of the TIGER/Line files, but continue to represent the entities as they existed for the 1990 census. The inventory of census tabulation entities remains the same as it was in 1990.  Introduction I-7   Change in Naming Standards for Record Type 1 The Census Bureau changed its naming standards in Record Type 1 affecting the data in the Feature Direction, Prefix (FEDIRP), Feature Name (FENAME), Feature Type (FETYPE), and Feature Direction, Suffix (FEDIRS) fields. In previous TIGER/Line products, directional prefixes and suffixes could appear for any type of line feature. For the TIGER/Line 1997, only road features, those features with a Census Feature Class Code (CFCC) in the A class, should have feature directional data in the directional fields. Other types of chains representing other types of features (for example, hydrologic features in CFCC class H) no longer are standardized to show directional information. The Census Bureau also modified the extraction of feature directional, name, and type information to improve the standardization of road feature information. The improvement parses a greater number of road chains into the correct feature identifier fields.  Known Problems and Anomalies in TIGER/Line 1997 Missing ZIP+4 Records Data users may note a significant reduction in the number of ZIP+4 Add On Codes in Record Type Z (ZIP4L and ZIP4R fields) for the 1997 TIGER/Line files in some areas. This reduction occurred as a result of operations to update the TIGER data base in preparation for Census 2000. These operations may have replaced address ranges or changed the 5-digit ZIP Code, but did not automatically update or transfer the ZIP+4 codes to the new ranges. Because the Add On codes are valid for specific 5-digit ZIP Codes and address ranges, the previous Add On codes may no longer apply to the new address ranges and thus were not retained. In nearly all situations, an automated match between the Census TIGER data base and the USPS ZIP+4 file was the source of ZIP+4 Add On Codes in TIGER products. With update operations for Census 2000 underway for large portions of the nation, we had not yet performed this automated match to refresh these codes. Future public sale releases of TIGER/Line files will contain refreshed codes that will reflect a more current USPS ZIP+4 file for the address range improvements that we are now making.  I-8 1998 TIGER/Line Files   Address Anomalies in Puerto Rico and Queens County, N.Y. The TIGER/Line files contain some address range coverage for Puerto Rico. However, use of this information for geocoding purposes may be problematic and the data user should proceed with caution. These address ranges are preliminary attempts at using Puerto Rico address ranges in Census Bureau files. Due to the lack of software or resources to handle some of the more unique aspects of addressing in Puerto Rico, the address ranges were entered without the standard edits and quality checks used in other parts of the United States. Improvements in software and address standardization for Puerto Rico are expected in the future. At present, there are inconsistencies, overlaps, and duplication of address ranges. Address ranges may lack alpha character prefixes or have hyphenated prefixes. The files also lack the community names used in a four-line address that the U.S. Postal Service requires to avoid duplicate addresses. Errors in the reference files, and other factors may limit the usefulness of this product for geocoding purposes. Address range data for Queens County, NY in TIGER/Line 1997 did not show a consistent use of hyphenated and non-hyphenated addressing. The Census Bureau intends to correct this in future public sale versions of TIGER products. Road Feature Anomalies The Census Bureau extracts TIGER/Line files from the TIGER data base which is continually updated. During the update process for some 1997 TIGER/Line files errors caused anomalies to be introduced into some chains represented in Record Types 1 and 2. For these cases road features may appear in the 1997 TIGER/Line files unconnected to other road features (so-called floating features) or severely skewed in relation to surrounding line features of any type. This problem was not discovered during the normal Census Bureau correction operations. The Census Bureau will fix these disconnected or skewed features before the release of future public sale versions of TIGER products.  Introduction I-9   The following county files have the greatest likelihood of road feature anomalies: FIPS 01073 06071 08069 13121 17077 21001 21065 21095 21131 21175 21203 24003 26093 26125 26161 34003 36055 42003 42019 42125 45031 45071 47037 48453 50007 50021  County name, State Jefferson, AL San Bernardino, CA Larimer, CO Fulton, GA Jackson, IL Adair, KY Estill, KY Harlan, KY Leslie, KY Morgan, KY Rockcastle, KY Anne Arundel, MD Livingston, MI Oakland, MI Washtenaw, MI Bergen, NJ Monroe, NY Allegheny, PA Butler, PA Washington, PA Darlington, SC Newberry, SC Davidson, TN Travis, TX Essex, VT Rutland, VT  FIPS 04013 06073 13089 13135 18097 21011 21067 21109 21165 21189 22017 24035 26115 26147 26163 36029 37119 42007 42071 42129 45057 46099 48229 50003 50015 55025  County name, State Maricopa, AZ San Diego, CA DeKalb, GA Gwinnett, GA Marion, IN Bath, KY Fayette, KY Jackson, KY Menifee, KY Owsley, KY Caddo, LA Queen Anne's, MD Monroe, MI St. Clair, MI Wayne, MI Erie, NY Mecklenburg, NC Beaver, PA Lancaster, PA Westmoreland, PA Lancaster, SC Minnehaha, SD Hudspeth, TX Bennington, VT Lamoille, VT Dane, WI  1998 TIGER/Line Files The 1998 TIGER/Line files have the same structure as the 1997 TIGER/ Line files; there were no record additions or deletions. However, there were some field name, file name, and content changes including corrections to the data format information appearing in Chapter 6.  I-10 1998 TIGER/Line Files   Field Definition Changes There are two field name changes on Record Type 1. The Census Bureau renamed the CTBNAL and CTBNAR field names as CTL and CTR. There have been several changes to the fields on Record Type 3. The reserved spaces two and three in the 1998 TIGER/Line files contain the FIPS 55 Code (ANRC), Current Left and FIPS 55 Code (ANRC), Current Right. Reserved spaces four and five have been converted to Census Use fields and reserved space 6 renumbered. The Census Bureau has renamed the VTDL and VTDR field names as VTD90L and VTD90R. Two changes have occurred on Record Type A. The Reserved Space 1 field has been replaced by Census Urbanized Area Code, 2000 with a field name of UA. This field is blank in the 1998 TIGER/Line files. The Census Urbanized Area Code, 1990 field name has been changed from UA to UA90. The length of the Name of Geographic Area field on Record Type C has been changed from 66 characters to 58 characters and now comprises columns 55 through 112. The FIPS Code and Name Relationship Applicable Year field has been expanded from two characters to four characters, using columns 11 through 14. As a result, the FIPS 55 Code now occupies columns 15 through 19, the FIPS Class Code occupies columns 20 through 21, the Census Place Description Code appears in column 22, the Legal/Administrative Statistical Area Description Code occupies columns 23 through 24, the Entity Type Code appears in column 25, the Metropolitan Area Code occupies columns 26 through 29, the School District Code occupies columns 30 through 34, the Census American Indian/Alaska Native Area Code occupies columns 35 through 38, and the Census Voting District Code occupies columns 39 through 44. The Census Urbanized Area Code has been expanded from four characters to five characters, using columns 45 through 49. The Census Bureau has added a two character Census Alaska Native Regional Corporation Code in columns 50 and 51 and the remaining characters freed by the change to the Name of Geographic Area field have been replaced with Census Use 5 in columns 50 through 52.  Introduction I-11   The Census Bureau has made a number of field name changes on Record Type S for the 1998 TIGER/Line files. The field names CMSAMSA and PMSA have been changed to CMSA and MA. The field names STATECU and COUNTYCU have been renamed STATE and COUNTY. The BLK00 field name has been renamed BLK and VTD00 has been renamed VTD. The Census Tract/BNA Code, 2000 on the 1997 TIGER/Line files has become Census Tract Code, 1990 on the 1998 TIGER/Line files with a field name change from CTBNA00 to CT. Reserved Space 10 has become Census Use 6. The length of the State Senate District Code and State House District Code fields in Record Type S have been changed from six characters to three characters. The six characters freed by this change have become Census Use 7 and Reserved Space 7 fields. On Record Type S, reserved spaces 11 through 14 and the filler occupying columns 103 through 120 have been restructured. The 1998 TIGER/ Line files allocate these columns to FIPS collection State Code, 2000; FIPS Collection County Code, 2000; Collection Block Number, 2000; Collection Block Number Suffix, 2000; Zip Code Tabulation Area, 2000; and Reserved Space 8. Boundary and Area Changes Since the 1990 census, the Census Bureau shifted and reshaped some line features, including boundary lines. The shape and area of the geographic entities depicted in the 1998 TIGER/ Line files may differ from earlier versions of the TIGER/Line files, but continue to represent the entities as they existed for the 1990 census. The inventory of census tabulation entities remains the same as it was in 1990.  How to Use This Documentation The structure of this documentation is based on data content rather than record type content. For instance, information on addresses may appear in one section, but cross-references to other related sections also are included. In order to make the document easier to use as a reference, the text contains some repetition from section to section.  I-12 1998 TIGER/Line Files   Chapter 1 Chapter 1 describes the basic concepts about the Census TIGER data base and the TIGER/Line products. It discusses the topology in the Census TIGER data base, the terminology used to describe the geographic data, and the record types that make up the TIGER/Line files. Chapter 1 also describes the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Spatial Data Transfer Standard (SDTS) nomenclature for geographic objects.  Chapter 2 Chapter 2 discusses the principle identification numbers forming the basis for record linkage discussed throughout the documentation.  Chapter 3 Chapter 3 discusses the attributes for the line, polygon, and landmark geographic objects.  Chapter 4 Chapter 4 defines the types of geographic entities and entity codes that appear in the TIGER/Line files. It also identifies the fundamental relationships among the different types of geographic entities.  Chapter 5 Chapter 5 summarizes the data quality aspects of the information in the Census TIGER data base using the SDTS quality modules.  Chapter 6 Chapter 6 lists the contents of the TIGER/Line file record types and provides a detailed description of the data fields in each. Use Chapter 6 in conjunction with Chapters 3 and 4 to locate the positions of specific data fields in the TIGER/Line files.

I-14 1998 TIGER/Line Files   Chapter 1: Overview and Geographic Concepts Overview What Is TIGER? The Bureaus Census TIGER System automates the mapping geographic activities required to support the decennial census survey programs of the Census Bureau starting with the 1990 census. The Census TIGER System provides support for the and related and sample decennial following:   Creation and maintenance of a digital geographic data base that includes complete coverage of the United States, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands of the United States, and the Pacific Island Territories  Production of maps from the Census TIGER data base for all Census Bureau enumeration and publication programs  Ability to assign individual addresses to geographic entities and census blocks based on polygons formed by features such as roads and streams The design of the Census TIGER data base adapts the theories of topology, graph theory, and associated fields of mathematics to provide a disciplined, mathematical description for the geographic structure of the United States and its territories. The topological structure of the Census TIGER data base defines the location and relationship of streets, rivers, railroads, and other features to each other and to the numerous geographic entities for which the Census Bureau tabulates data from its censuses and sample surveys. It is designed to ensure that there is no duplication of features or areas. The building of the Census TIGER data base involved a variety of encoding techniques such as automated map scanning, manual map digitizing, standard data keying, and sophisticated computer file matching. The goal was to provide automated access to, and retrieval of, relevant geographic information about the United States and its territories.  TIGER Data Base Extracts In order for others to use the information in the Census TIGER data base in a geographic information system (GIS) or for other geographic  Overview and Geographic Concepts 1- 1   applications, the Census Bureau releases periodic extracts of the data base, including the TIGER/Line files, to the public. Various versions of the TIGER/Line files have been released; previous versions include the 1990 Census TIGER/Line files, and the 1992, 1994, 1995 and 1997 TIGER/ Line files. The 1992 TIGER/Line files were produced to satisfy a requirement of the US Department of Education and incorporated all of the updates and revisions since the production of the 1990 TIGER/Line files. The 1994 TIGER/Line files were produced to support the programs of the US Department of Transportation, Bureau of Transportation Statistics. The 1995 TIGER/Line files were originally produced to support Phase I of the Census 2000 Redistricting Data Program. The 1997 TIGER/Line files were originally produced to support the Phase I Verification of the Census 2000 Redistricting Data Program and the Census 2000 Participant Statistical Areas Program Delineation.  Relationship of TIGER/Line    to 1990 Census Statistical Data  What makes the TIGER extract products particularly valuable in the GIS environment and to the data user community is the direct linkage between the 1990 decennial census data products and the Census TIGER data base extracts. The digital description in the TIGER data base of the Nations legal and statistical entities includes Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) codes and, for American Indian/Alaska Native Areas only, Census Bureau codes so entities can be easily matched with the 1990 census data. Please refer to the Census Bureau Publication, 1990 Census of Population and Housing Tabulation and Publication Program, for a description of the Public Law (PL) 94-171 data files, Summary Tape Files (STFs), and other sources of data from the 1990 census.  1998 TIGER/Line Files The 1998 TIGER/Line files include files for all counties and statistically equivalent entities in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. The 1998 TIGER/Line files consist of line segments that represent physical features, and legal and statistical boundaries. The files consist of 17 separate record types, including the basic data record, the shape coordinate points (feature shape records), and geographic area codes that can be used with appropriate software to prepare maps. 1-2 1998 TIGER/Line Files   Related Files Summary Tape Files (STFs) provide 1990 statistical data for a wide range of subject headings and geographic entities compatible with the TIGER/ Line files. These files are available on tape and CD-ROM. PL 94-171 Program data files provide selected population data for small area geography (state, county, county subdivision, place, census tract/ block numbering area, block group, and block) and are compatible with the TIGER/Line files. These files are available on tape and CD-ROM. The TIGER/Line 103rd Congressional District File contains just the features that form the boundaries of the districts of the 103rd Congress. The file follows the format of Record Types 1 and 2 of the 1992 TIGER/ Line files. This is a national data set, by state, on one CD-ROM. TIGER/Line 1990 County Files provide the coordinates for the boundaries of all counties and statistically equivalent entities. This is a national data set, by state, on one CD-ROM. The files follow the format of Record Types 1 and 2 of the 1992 TIGER/Line files. The boundaries for the states and statistically equivalent areas are for the legal limits. As such, coastal states show a boundary that is three miles offshore and do not contain additional records that depict the shoreline. The same holds true for interior water; a boundary in the Chesapeake Bay will be shown, but the shore-line will not. TIGER/Line1990 Census Tract/Block Numbering Area Files provide the coordinates and associated feature attributes for the boundaries of all census tract/block numbering areas (CT/BNAs). This is a national data set, by state, on one CD-ROM. The files follow the format of Record Types 1 and 2 of the 1992 TIGER/Line files. North American Statistical Areas Boundary Files (Prototype), were produced by a joint research initiative between the Geography Divisions of Statistics Canada and the United States Bureau of the Census. The goal of the files is to provide data users with a convenient, unified, geographical framework that will help facilitate cross-border spatial studies. The files are in TIGER/Line format and contain geographic  Overview and Geographic Concepts 1- 3   coordinates, various attribute information, and most importantly, geographic identification codes that can be used as links to census data from Canada and the United States. TIGER/Line American Indian/Alaska Native Areas File provides the coordinates for the boundaries of all American Indian and Alaska Native areas (AIANAs) shown in the 1990 census. This file follows the format of Record Types 1 and 2 of the 1992 TIGER/Line files and covers the Nation. TIGER/Line 1990 County Subdivision Files provide the coordinates for the boundaries of all county subdivisions (such as minor civil divisions, census county divisions, and unorganized territory). This is a national data set, by state, on one CD-ROM. The files follow the format of Record Types 1 and 2 of the 1992 TIGER/Line files. TIGER/Line 1990 Place Files provide the aries of all incorporated places (including census designated places (CDPs). This is a one CD-ROM. The files follow the format the 1992 TIGER/Line files. coordinates for the boundconsolidated cities) and national data set, by state, on of Record Types 1 and 2 of  County-Based Files The geographic coverage for a TIGER/Line file is a county or statistically equivalent entity. See Appendix A for a list of state and county codes and Chapter 4 for a description of county equivalent entities. The county files have a coverage area based on the latest legal boundaries obtained in response to the Census Bureaus Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS). Even though the Census TIGER data base represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, the county-based TIGER/Line files are designed to stand alone as an independent data set. The files can be combined to cover the whole Nation and its territories (see the Single-Side Flags and County Boundaries section in Chapter 3).  1-4 1998 TIGER/Line Files   The Data Content of the TIGER/Line Files The TIGER/Line files contain data describing three major types of features:  Line features 1) Roads 2) Railroads 3) Hydrography 4) Miscellaneous transportation features and selected power lines and pipe lines 5) Boundaries   Landmark features 1) Point landmarks such as schools and churches 2) Area landmarks such as parks and cemeteries 3) Key geographic locations (KGLs) such as apartment buildings and factories   Polygon features 1) Geographic entity codes for areas used to tabulate the 1990 census statistical data and current geographic areas 2) Locations of area landmarks 3) Locations of KGLs  The line feature and polygon information form the majority of data in the TIGER/Line files. Some of the data describing the lines include coordinates, feature identifiers (names), feature classification codes, address ranges, and geographic entity codes. Chapter 3 details these data items; Chapter 4 defines the geographic entities and codes. The TIGER/Line files contain point and area labels that describe landmark features. These features provide locational references for field staff and map users. Area landmarks consist of a feature name or label and feature type assigned to a polygon or group of polygons. Landmarks may overlap or refer to the same set of polygons. See Chapter 3 for more information on landmark data.  Overview and Geographic Concepts 1- 5   Topology and Spatial Objects in the TIGER/Line Files Spatial Objects in the TIGER/Line Files The Census TIGER data base uses a collection of spatial objects, points, lines, and polygons, to model or describe real-world geography. The Census Bureau uses these spatial objects to represent features such as streets, and assigns attributes to these features to identify and describe specific features such as the 500 block of Market Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The TIGER/Line files contain information about the spatial objects distributed over a series of record types. Users of the TIGER/Line files may need to link information from several record types to find all the attributes of interest that belong to one spatial object. The final section of this chapter includes a description of the record types.  Topology Topology explains how points, lines, and areas relate to each other and is used as the foundation for organizing spatial objects in the Census TIGER data base. The Census TIGER data base uses points, lines, and areas to provide a disciplined, mathematical description of the features of the earths surface. Spatial objects in the Census TIGER data base are interrelated. A sequence of points define line segments, and line segments connect to define polygons. Topology provides a basic language for describing geographic features. The Census TIGER data base relates information to points or 0-cells, lines or 1-cells, and polygons or 2-cells. The number preceding the cell identifies the dimensionality of the object; for instance, a line segment has a single dimension, length. Each of these objects builds on the others to form higher-level objects. The 0-cells form the end points of 1-cells. The 1-cells connect at 0-cells and form closed figures that partition space into polygons or 2-cells.  1-6 1998 TIGER/Line Files   Terminology The terms point, line segment, and polygon are familiar, but general terms that may have different meanings to data users working with a variety of different applications and data sets. The TIGER/Line file documentation uses the terminology from the Spatial Data Transfer Standard (SDTS). Since the first release of the TIGER/Line files, the US Geological Survey (USGS) has coordinated the development and release of the SDTS, now a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS). The SDTS specifies a series of terms and definitions for spatial objects. Why use the SDTS terminology? Even though the TIGER/Line files do not follow the SDTS format, the TIGER/Line documentation will use these terms and definitions in order to promote a common language for describing geographic data and to facilitate the transition to the SDTS. The spatial objects in TIGER/Line belong to the Geometry and  Topology (GT) class of objects in SDTS. The definitions are from FIPS Publication 173, Spatial Data Transfer Standard (SDTS) (August 28, 1992) Section 2-2, Classification and Intended Use of Objects, pp. 11-20. Node A zero-dimensional object that is a topological junction of two or more links or chains, or an end point of a link or chain, is a node. Entity Point A point used for identifying the location of point features (or areal features collapsed to a point), such as towers, buoys, buildings, places, etc. Complete Chain A chain [a sequence of non-intersecting line segments] that explicitly references left and right polygons and start and end nodes. The shape points combine with the nodes to form the segments that make a complete chain.  Overview and Geographic Concepts 1- 7   Network Chains A chain that explicitly references start and end nodes and not left and right polygons. GT-Polygon An area that is an atomic two-dimensional component of a two-dimensional manifold, [which is defined as] one and only one planar graph and its two-dimensional objects. GT-polygons are elementary polygons that are mutually exclusive and completely exhaust the surface.  Spatial Objects The spatial objects in the TIGER/Line files embody both geometry (coordinate location and shape) and topology (the relationship between points, line objects, and polygons) and therefore belong to the geometry and topology (GT) class of objects in the SDTS. In the SDTS, nodes represent point objects (0-cells) that identify the start and end position of lines or 1-dimensional objects (1-cells) called chains. The chains in the TIGER/ Line files are complete chains because they form polygon boundaries and intersect other chains only at nodes. Topological chains that do not contain polygon information are network chains. Data users may choose not to use the polygon or geographic entity codes and consider the TIGER/ Line files a source of network chain data. Figure 1-1 illustrates the relationship between nodes and complete chains. The figure shows two complete chains forming a central road; a start and end node define each complete chain. Complete chains that meet at an intersection share the same node. As the figure suggests, complete chains may consist of one or more line segments that describe the shape and position of the complete chain. Shape points define the line segments and are not part of the topology of the TIGER/Line files. Shape points and the resulting line segments are attributes of the complete chains. When complete chains link node to node and form a closed figure (a 2-cell), a GT-polygon results. The GT-polygon containing Friendship Park in Figure 1-1 is bounded by five complete chains that share five nodes. GT-polygons are elementary units; they are not subdivided into smaller polygons. The polygons completely encompass the area  1-8 1998 TIGER/Line Files   Figure 1-1 Basic TIGER/Line File Topology The illustration below shows a generalized block that consists of three GT-polygons (GT stands for geometry and topology). The block contains a point landmark (Parkside School) inside GT-polygon 2 and an area landmark (Friendship Park) that is coextensive with GT-polygon 3.  Entity Point/Point Landmark location (entity points are independent of the GT-polygon complete chain topology)  Start Node  School Ave There are two shape points on the complete chain that extends from the start node to the end node.

GT-POLYGON 3  Park Ave  Actual Street Curb Location Node--A zero-dimensional object that incorporates topology and geometry. Each marks the intersection or end point of a complete chain.  Shape Point-- A zero-dimensional object that defines the curvature of a complete chain, but is not required to describe the topology of the complete chain (unlike nodes at intersections or end points). Point Landmark--An entity point that identifies the location of a point landmark. Polygon Interior Points--A point associated with, and inside of, a polygon. Complete Chain--A one-dimensional object having topological and geometric characteristics.  Overview and Geographic Concepts 1-9   they represent and there is no gap or overlap between adjacent polygons. The geographic entities and area landmarks in the TIGER/Line files are associated with one, or a set of GT-polygons. The TIGER/Line files contain point landmark data that are not included in the Census TIGER data base topology. Point landmarks are entity points that mark the location of points of interest and are not connected to complete chains or GT-polygons. The following table summarizes the terms for spatial objects in the TIGER/Line files: Point (0-cell) Topology Non-topology Attribute Node Entity Point Shape Point Line (1-cell) Complete Chain or Network Chain Polygon (2-cell) GT-polygon  Features The Census TIGER data base uses the term feature to informally describe spatial objects more complex than nodes, complete chains, or GT-polygons. For instance, Main Street is a feature that may consist of a series of complete chains with the same name. The Census TIGER data base contains complete chains, but does not contain features or link complete chains to features.  Left- and Right-Side Data Fields If one is standing on a complete chain at the start node facing the end node, data listed in the fields carrying a right qualifier would be found to the right of the complete chain. Notice the position of the start and end nodes for the road in the central section of Figure 1-1; the rightside of the complete chain corresponds to GT-polygon 1 and the leftside corresponds to GT-polygon 2. From the information contained in this basic record, data users can collect the complete chains necessary to construct intersecting polygons and features.  1-10 1998 TIGER/Line Files   Single-Layer Topology All spatial objects in the TIGER/Line files exist in a single data layer that includes roads, hydrography, railroads, boundary lines, and miscellaneous features; they are topologically linked. For instance, nodes mark the intersections of roads and rivers. Subsurface features such as tunnels or above surface features such as bridges also create nodes when they cross surface features even though there is no direct realworld connection.  Introduction to the TIGER/Line    File Structure  The 1998 TIGER/Line files are extracts of selected information from the Census TIGER data base, organized as topologically consistent networks. The records in these TIGER/Line files represent features traditionally found on a paper map. Each complete chain is classified by codes that describe the type of feature it represents. The 1998 TIGER/Line files consist of 17 record types that collectively contain geographic information (attributes) such as address ranges and ZIP Codes and their Add-On codes for street complete chains, names, feature classification codes, codes for legal and statistical entities, latitude/longitude coordinates of linear and point features, landmark features, area landmarks, key geographic features, and area and polygon boundaries. Up to 17 separate files exist for each county or county equivalent; one for each of the 1998 TIGER/Line record types that exist for a county or county equivalent. Some counties or county equivalents do not require all of the 17 record types and therefore have less than 17 files. If the types of data contained in Record Types 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, and Z are not appropriate for a given county or county equivalent, then the Census Bureau does not include files for those record types. The file for each county (or equivalent) is identified by the state and county FIPS code after the tgr in the file name (for example, tgr42107.rt1). The suffixes used for the record type files have been changed to make it easier to identify each record type file (when working with uncompressed versions of the county files). The suffix consistently is .rtn where n is the record type.  Overview and Geographic Concepts 1- 11   The TIGER/Line data dictionary in Chapter 6 contains a complete list of all the fields in the 17 record types. Separate chapters cross-list the fields by feature attribute and geographic entity type. The next section provides a summary of 1998 TIGER/Line file record types.  1998 TIGER/Line File Record Types Record Type 1 -- Complete Chain Basic Data Record Record Type 1 provides a single record for each unique complete chain in the TIGER/Line files. The basic data record contains the end nodes for the complete chain. This record also contains address ranges and ZIP Codes (for most areas of the country where a street name/house numbering system existed at the time of data extraction from the Census TIGER data base) and the current census geographic entity codes for each side of the complete chain. Additional feature identifier, address range, and ZIP Code data related to Record Type 1 are found on Record Types 4, 5, 6, and Z. Additional current and 1990 geographic entity codes related to Record Type 1 are found on Record Type 3.  Record Type 2 -- Complete Chain Shape Coordinates Record Type 2 provides an additional series of latitude and longitude coordinate values describing the shape of each complete chain in Record Type 1 that is not a straight line segment. That is, not all complete chains in Record Type 1 have shape points and therefore not all have an associated Record Type 2. Where a complete chain in Record Type 1 is not a straight line, Record Type 2 may have a many-to-one relationship with Record Type 1.  Record Type 3 -- Complete Chain Geographic Entity Codes Record Type 3 includes the 1990 voting district (VTD) codes provided to the Census Bureau for the 1990 Census Redistricting Data Program. It also includes the current Census Bureau geographic area codes for the American Indian/TJSA/TDSA/ANVSA areas, and the Alaska Native Regional Corporations. It also includes 1990 geographic codes for a variety of geographic area types.  1-12 1998 TIGER/Line Files   In the 1994 and later TIGER/Line files, all references to the 1980 geographic area codes have been eliminated. In addition, many fields have been replaced with the geographic area codes that were used to tabulate the 1990 census. These codes were previously in Record Type 1. Record Type 3 has a one-to-one relationship with Record Type 1. To identify the 1990 census state and county codes for a complete chain, one must use Record Type 3.  Record Type 4 -- Index to Alternate Feature Identifiers Record Type 4 provides an index to alternate feature names associated with the complete chain (Record Type 1). A Record Type 4 will not exist for a Record Type 1 that has only one name. A complete chain can have more than one alternate name. Record Type 4 has a many-toone relationship with Record Type 1 and a many-to-one relationship with Record Type 5.  Record Type 5 -- Complete Chain Feature Identifiers Record Type 5 contains a list of all unique feature names for complete chains in the TIGER/Line files. Each name (or feature identifier) has an identification code number (FEAT). Record Type 5 has a oneto-many relationship with Record Type 4 and a one-to-many relationship with Record Type 9.  Record Type 6 -- Additional Address Range and ZIP Code Data Record Type 6 provides additional address range information for a street complete chain when the information cannot be presented as a single address range (for example, the house/building numbers are not uniformly arranged to form an address range). Record Type 6 appears only for those counties that have address ranges and ZIP Code information in the Census TIGER data base. There is no assurance that the address ranges provided on Record Type 6 will cover fewer addresses than the address ranges appearing on Record Type 1. Data users must use Record Type 6 to obtain the entire picture of the potential address ranges along a complete chain. The address ranges used for geocoding along corporate corridors and corporate offset limits appear only in Record Type 6. Record Type 6 has a many-to-one relationship with Record Type 1 and a one-toone relationship with Record Type Z.  Overview and Geographic Concepts 1- 13   Record Type 7 -- Landmark Features Record Type 7 contains the area and point landmarks from the Census TIGER data base. If Record Type 7 represents an area landmark rather than a point landmark, then a one-to-one relationship exists with Record Type 8. If a county file has no landmarks, empty files for Record Types 7 or 8 will exist for that county. Record Type 7 now excludes all key geographic locations (KGLs) that contain an actual or imputed address and have a ZIP+4 Add-On code. These will now appear in Record Type 9.  Record Type 8 -- Polygons Linked to Area Landmarks Record Type 8 links the polygon identification codes with the area landmark identification codes. If a county file does not have any area landmarks in Record Type 7, there will be no Type 8 records. Record Type 8 has a many-to-many relationship with Record Type P.  Record Type 9 -- Key Geographic Location Features Record Type 9 consists only of KGLs in the Census TIGER data base that have an actual or imputed address and a ZIP+4 Add-On code. This record type lists the names and structure numbers of special geocoding addresses such as named apartment buildings, shopping centers, and airports. If the structure number of the special geocoding address is a street address, then the FEAT field links Record Type 9 to Record Type 5 where the street name associated with the address is listed. The KGLs contained in this record type are not included in Record Types 7 or 8, and have no LAND (landmark identification number). Record Type 9 has a many-to-one relationship with Record Type P.  Record Type A -- Polygon Geographic Entity Codes Record Type A contains a record for each polygon represented by Record Type P in the TIGER/Line files. The Census Bureau provides the basic 1990 census geographic entity codesstate, county, county subdivision, place, American Indian/Alaska Native Areas, census tract/BNA, block on this record type to assist data users who are interested only in polygon information. Record Type A also includes the Census Transportation Planning Package Area code, school district codes, and urban/rural classification information, as well as fields for the 106th and 108th Congressional Districts (the 108th field is blank for this release).  1-14 1998 TIGER/Line Files   Record Type C -- Geographic Entity Names Record Type C provides information previously supplied in the TIGER/Geographic NameTM files. A unique list of all geographic codes, their associated name, and some entity attributes is supplied for data users in a flat (nonhierarchical) file. It contains a FIPS Year field that may have three values: 1990 for geographic names and codes valid for the 1990 census, 199n (where 199n is the year of extraction from the Census TIGER data base) for geographic names and codes valid for the current year, or blank when the geographic names and codes are the same as for 1990 and 199n. Multiple records for the same geographic entity show its change or correction over time. Record Type C is linked to other record types (1, 3, A, S) through geographic area codes.  Record Type H -- TIGER/Line ID History Record Type H provides the history of each TIGER/Line ID when complete chains (Record Type 1) are split or merged, but the source of the change will be blank for this version. Record Type H shows the TLIDs of the complete chains in existence after the split or prior to the merge.  Record Type I -- Link Between Complete Chains and Polygons Record Type I links Record Type 1, the complete chain basic data, to Record Type P, the polygon internal point. The Record Type I to Record Type 1 link (TLID) may be used to link complete chain attributes and other data record types (2, 3, 4, 6, H, and Z) to each other. The Record I to Record Type P link (CENID and POLYID) may be used to link polygon attributes and other data record types (8, 9, A, and S) to each other. Record Type I has a one-to-one relationship with Record Type 1, but a many-toone relationship with Record Type P. When Record Type I is linked to a single-sided Record Type 1 (county boundary), it will provide only the left- or the right-polygon identifier.  Record Type P -- Polygon Internal Point There is a Record Type P for every polygon in the TIGER/Line files. Record Type P has a one-to-many relationship with Record Type I and identifies the internal point coordinates for each polygon. See the Internal Points section in Chapter 3.  Overview and Geographic Concepts 1- 15   The TIGER/Line files include all complete chains and polygons in the Census TIGER data base. The topology of the Census TIGER data base ensures that a one-to-one relationship exists between the polygons constructed from Record Types 1 and 2 and Record Type P.  Record Type R -- TIGER/Line ID Record Number Range Record Type R contains the range of unique complete chain record numbers (TLIDs) assigned to a census file in a nationwide scheme. Record Type R has the lowest (minimum allowable), and the highest (maximum allowable) record numbers for the range. Numbers are assigned to complete chains beginning at the lowest value. The current number is the highest record number for the census file used. Each TIGER/Line file consists of an entire county or statistical equivalent. In the Census TIGER data base, the county or statistical equivalent may be split into many partitions. The Census Bureau assigns permanent record numbers to each of these partitions. These record numbers are found in Record Type R. Record Type R is not directly linked to any other record type.  Record Type S -- Polygon Additional Geographic Entity Codes Record Type S contains a record for each polygon represented by Record Type P in the TIGER/Line files. Record Type S contains geographic area codes that identify polygons. Most of the geographic area codes reflect current geography as of the time of extraction from the Census TIGER data base. Except for Hawaii, Record Type S contains no CDP information since CDPs are considered part of the 1990 census geography, not current geography.  Record Type Z -- ZIP+4 Codes Record Type Z provides Postal +4 Add-On codes that make ZIP+4 codes out of the ZIP Codes on Type 1 and Type 6 records. Record Type Z has a one-to-one relationship with Record Type 1 and a oneto-one relationship with Record Type 6.  1-16 1998 TIGER/Line Files   The Relationship Between Spatial Objects and TIGER/Line Record Types    The TIGER/Line files do not have specific record types for each spatial object. Nodes, for example, do not have a separate record type; node coordinates appear with other data in Record Type 1. Defining a complete chain requires information from Record Types 1, 2, and I. Record Types 1 and 2 alone describe the set of network chains. GT-polygons require the combined information of Record Types 1, 2, I, and P. See Chapter 3 for a discussion on how to link data using different types of spatial objects.  Linkages Between Record Types All the record types except Record Type R contain fields (such as TLID, FEAT, CENID, POLYID, LAND, or a geographic area code) that are used to link together data from the record types. Chapter 2 discusses the TLID, CENID, POLYID, and LAND identification codes in detail. Figure 1-2 shows the record linkage keys. When different record types have a common key with the same data, a linkage can be made between the records. Some of the links are direct, while others are indirect and require a connection through an intermediate record type. An entire TIGER/Line file can be navigated using the record linkage keys. Linkages may be made to data external to a TIGER/Line file. Record Types 1, 3, A, and S contain geographic area code keysthe current or 1990 census geographic entity codesthat may be linked to the Census Bureaus statistical data (the PL 94-171 data and the several Summary Tape Files or STFs). For the PL 94-171 data and STFs based on 1990 census data, one must use Record Type 3 or Record Type A. With geographic information systems for processing and display, data users can use the geographic area codes to link data tabulations with the geographic data.  Overview and Geographic Concepts 1- 17   Figure 1-2 TIGER/Line File Record Linkage Keys  Record Type C  Geographic Area Code Key  Record Type A Record Type P Record Type S  Record Type 1 Record Type 2 Record Type 3  CENID, POLYID Key  Record Type I  TLID Key  Record Type 6 Record Type H Record Type Z  Record Type 9  Record Type 4  Record Type 8  FEAT Key  LAND Key  Record Type 5  Record Type 7  1-18 1998 TIGER/Line  Files   Chapter 2: Version Code and Identification Numbers Version Code The version code is a numeric code that uniquely identifies a record with a specific release version of the TIGER/Line files. All record types have a 4-character field for the version code. For releases after TIGER/Line 1995, including this release, the version code is assigned as MMYY which represents the month and year that the file was created. The month and year are currently extracted from the system date as each county file is created. This means that county files created for the same program are likely to have different version codes. Adjacent counties in a state may have different version codes if they were extracted at different points in time. This will make it easier for users to determine the latest version of the data if they have several versions of the TIGER/Line files for a county. The version codes for earlier releases of the TIGER/Line files are as follows: 0000 -- TIGER/Line Precensus File, 1990 0002 -- TIGER/Line Initial Voting District Codes File, 1990 0003 -- TIGER/Line Census File, 1990 0005 -- TIGER/Line File, 1992 0021 -- TIGER/Line File, 1994 0024 -- TIGER/Line File, 1995  TIGER/Line  Identification Number (TLID) The TIGER/Line files use a permanent 10-digit TIGER/Line record identification number (TLID) to uniquely identify a complete chain for the Nation.  TLID Codes The 10-digit TLID will not exceed the value 231  1 (2,147,483,647) and will represent the same complete chain in all versions of this file, beginning with the TIGER/Line Precensus Files, 1990. The minimum value is 100,001. Topological changes to the complete chain will cause the TLIDs to change. For instance, when updates split an existing complete chain, each of the new parts receives a new TLID; the old TLID is not reused.  Version Code and Identification Numbers 2-1   As distributed, TIGER/Line files are grouped by county (or equivalent). A complete chain representing a segment of the boundary between two neighboring counties will have different TLID codes even though the complete chain represents the exact same feature on the ground. See the section, User-Defined Changes to the TIGER/Line Files, in this chapter. Record Type R contains the range of unique complete chain record numbers assigned to a census file in a nationwide scheme. Record Type R has the lowest (minimum) and the highest (maximum) record numbers for the range. Permanent record numbers are assigned within each partition of the Census TIGER data base. Numbers are assigned to complete chains beginning at the minimum value and increasing the current value by one until it reaches the maximum value. Record Type H, which first appeared in the 1994 version, shows the history of a particular TLID, whether combined or split, and its predecessors or successors.  TLID Record Locations The TLID field appears in columns 6 through 15 of the following record types:     Record Record Record Record Type Type Type Type 1 2 3 4  Record Type 6  Record Type I  Record Type Z  The TLID field appears in columns 11 through 20 in Record Type H.  TLID Record Linkages The TLID field provides a key for linking records containing primary attributes describing the complete chain or the geographic entity codes associated with the left and the right sides of the complete chain. Record Type I contains the key fields required to link the TLID and the GT-polygon identification fields, CENID and POLYID. See Figure 1-2 in Chapter 1.  2-2 1998 TIGER/Line Files   TLID Sort Sequence Each record type is a separate file. The records in each record type do not have an overall sort sequence. Data users may wish to sort the file by TLID in order to facilitate record linkages.  User-Defined Changes to the TIGER/Line Files TLID as a Standard Identification Number Users should store the record number and the version code associated with each complete chain in their local systems to ensure their ability to match records with earlier or later versions of the TIGER/Line files. The record and version numbers of each complete chain provide an important link to the corresponding complete chain in the Census TIGER data base. This key will allow users to transfer new information from later Census Bureau TIGER/Line releases into their data base, and to provide the Census Bureau with readily usable updates, should they wish to do so.  Feature Changes Users should assign a new record number (TLID) and a version number with a value greater than 5000 to each new complete chain they create in order to avoid duplicating a Census Bureau-assigned record number that may appear elsewhere in the national file. Users should create a new record for each new complete chain, including those formed when a new intersection splits an existing complete chain. If a complete chain has been assigned different feature identifiers, attributes, and/or coordinate positions without being merged with or split from another complete chain, it is a modified complete chain and does not need a new TLID. Users may wish to mark these changes; the Census Bureau will use this information to identify changes more quickly and accurately. Users should assign a version code equal to 4999 for all deleted complete chain and landmark records. This version code will allow the Census Bureau to positively identify all user deletions. Users may assign or reassign polygon and landmark identification numbers in any manner that uniquely identifies each within a file.  Version Code and Identification Numbers 2-3   TIGER/Line  Polygon Identification Numbers (CENID, POLYID) The Census Bureau uses two fields, the census file identification code (CENID) and the polygon identification code (POLYID), to uniquely identify GT-polygons. The CENID is a Census Bureau alphanumeric identifier used to uniquely number the GT-polygons within its TIGER partitions. CENIDs are a recode of the FIPS state and county codes for the partitions (files) that form the national Census TIGER data base. Since the partitions may include only a portion of a county, the TIGER/Line files may contain multiple CENIDs. The polygon identification number (POLYID) is a temporary number assigned to every polygon in the Census TIGER data base. Although this number is part of the data base design, it is a dynamic number and can change between different versions of the TIGER/Line files. The Census TIGER data base does not contain permanent identifiers for GT-polygons as it does for complete chains. POLYID is unique only within CENID; in cases where a TIGER/Line file contains more than one CENID, the POLYID may not be unique within that file. Within each CENID, the value for the POLYID starts with 1 and increments sequentially until all polygons are numbered.  CENID and POLYID Codes In the 1992 and 1994 versions of the TIGER/Line files, the CENID is a 5-digit numeric code. In the 1995, 1997 TIGER/Line files and the 1998 TIGER/Line files, the CENID is a 5-character alpha-numeric code to allow for a wider range of codes without increasing field length. Record Type R contains a list of all valid CENIDs used in each county TIGER/Line file. The POLYID code is an integer identification number, without leading zeros, applied to each GT-polygon. The POLYID with a value of 1 refers to the universal polygon, the polygon that refers to all space outside a county coverage area and is excluded from Record Types A, I, P, and S.  2-4 1998 TIGER/Line Files   The range of POLYID numbers in a county file may contain gaps or skipped numbers resulting from the use of one partition (CENID) for more than one TIGER/Line county file. POLYID numbers also may duplicate in a single TIGER/Line  file as they are unique only within CENID. A single TIGER/Line file may contain CENID information from many other census files. Either the CENIDL and POLYIDL, or CENIDR and POLYIDR fields in Record Type I will have a blank value where the complete chain is a county boundary.  CENID and POLYID Record Locations The CENID and POLYID fields appear in the following record types:  Record Type 8  Records exist only for area landmark GT-polygons  Record Type 9  Records exist for all KGLs  Record Type A  Records exist for all GT-polygons  Record Type I  Contains left- and right-side CENIDs and POLYIDs associated with each complete chain  Record Type P  Records exist for all GT-polygons  Record Type R  Contains only CENID; Record Type R lists the minimum and maximum possible TLIDs, and the highest TLID from each census file (CENID) used to generate the current version of the TIGER/Line files.  Record Type S  Records exist for all GT-polygons  CENID and POLYID Record Linkages The TIGER/Line files use both the CENID and POLYID fields to link all of the polygon record types together (Record Types A, P, and S), to link the GT-polygons to the associated complete chains, and to link area landmarks to GT-polygons (see Figure 1-2, in Chapter 1). The CENID and POLYID fields link the geographic area codes in Record Types A and S to Record Type P which contains the coordinates for an internal point in the GT-polygon. The TIGER/Line files include a Type A and a Type S record for each Type P record.  Version Code and Identification Numbers 2-5   Record Type I provides a link between the GT-polygon records and the record types containing complete chain attributes (Record Types 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6). Each Type I record identifies a complete chain by TLID with a left- and right-side GT-polygon. Here CENIDL and POLYIDL contain the CENID and POLYID codes for the GT-polygon on the left side of the line. Likewise, CENIDR and POLYIDR contain the CENID and POLYID codes for the GT-polygon on the right side of the line. There is a Type I record for each Type 1 record. All CENID and POLYID codes appear in Record Type I. To find all of the complete chains that form the boundary of a specific GT-polygon, search Record Type I for a match with either the left or the right CENID and POLYID. Where the left and the right CENID and POLYID codes are the same, the complete chain is internal to the GTpolygon (e.g., a dead-end street). Record Type 8 provides a link between the GT-polygons and the landmark feature records. See the section, TIGER/Line Landmark Identification Numbers, in this chapter.  CENID and POLYID Sort Sequence The POLYID codes appear in numeric sequence by alphanumeric CENID in Record Types 9, A, P, and S. There is no systematic CENID or POLYID sequence in Record Type I.  TIGER/Line  Landmark Identification Numbers (LAND) The landmark feature identification number (LAND) is a 10-digit number that uniquely identifies both point and area landmarks within each county file. LAND is not a permanent number; the Census Bureau assigns LANDs each time a new version of the TIGER/Line files is produced. Within each county, LANDs are assigned beginning with 1 and are incremented sequentially until all features are numbered. In rare situations, Record Type 7 may list the same LAND number more than once if the landmark has more than one feature name.  2-6 1998 TIGER/Line Files   Each name appears as a separate data record in Record Type 7. These data records describe the same landmark and have the same LAND. Overlapping landmarks (e.g., a pond located in a park) may cause more than one name to be assigned to a GT-polygon. However, overlapping landmarks are separate features with different LANDs.  LAND Codes The LAND is an integer number that does not contain leading zeros. It is assigned during the extraction of the data and is not a permanent number. There may be gaps in the sequence of the LANDs in Record Type 7 because of the way this information is extracted.  LAND Record Locations The LAND field appears in the following record types:  Record Type 7  Landmark attributes  Record Type 8  Linkage record containing the LAND and the CENID and POLYID fields  LAND Record Linkages Record Type 8 links each area landmarks LAND with a CENID and POLYID. Each area landmark will have one or more Type 8 records that together identify all of the GT-polygons that make up the landmark.  LAND Sort Sequence Record Type 7 and 8 contain records sorted in ascending order by LAND. In Record Type 8, each LAND is repeated for each GT-polygon covered by the area landmark.  Version Code and Identification Numbers 2-7    Chapter 3: Attributes of Geographic Objects Line Features Line features consist of one or more complete chains that share common attributes such as feature identifiers, address ranges, and census feature class descriptions.  Feature Identifiers The feature identification fields contain either a general type label or a specific proper name assigned to a complete chain that identifies the feature. Each complete chain that is a part of a named feature, such as US Highway 1, has the same feature identifier. The TIGER/Line files use several related data fields to provide a structured description of the feature identifier:     Feature Feature Feature Feature Direction Prefix Name (e.g., US Type (Roosevelt Direction Suffix (e.g., N Adams Ave) Highway 1 , Jefferson St) Blvd, Mangosteen River ) (e.g., Providence St NE )  Most named street/highway features have a feature type. Numerous exceptions exist; for example, Broadway consists of a feature name with no type specified. Do not confuse feature types that form proper names with the census feature classification scheme. In the Census TIGER data base, feature names are assigned to line features independently of the census feature class codes (CFCCs) of the line features. For example, major airports usually have an express highway leading to the terminal area. This highway does not have an interstate highway name such as I-95, but may have the CFCC of an interstate highway (A11) because it has the same characteristics as an interstate highway (limited access with separated, multiple lanes). The feature identifiers of line features that are roads may include either a direction prefix or suffix. Some may have both a direction prefix and suffix.  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3- 1   The feature name fields for line features that are roads may contain both a name and a feature type. For all hydrography and non-road features, the feature type will follow the feature name in the feature name field. In some instances, the feature type is commonly considered part of the name and is combined with the feature name in the TIGER/Line files to avoid confusion; for example, US Hwy 1. The Census TIGER System identifies US Hwy as a feature type used as a prefix to the name and 1 as the feature name. The feature types, such as US Highway, State Highway, and Interstate that normally precede the name appear in the name field. Generic feature identifiers have a name listed in the names field, but do not have a feature type or direction. Some examples of generic names include ramp, power line, and reservoir. Generic feature identifiers are selectively added to features that do not have proper names. In most cases, complete chains without proper names have no feature identifier. The TIGER/Line files do not support a data level above the complete chain that allows the construction of higher level objects (features). Complete chains with the same name may represent separate features; for example, a county may contain several Main Streets located in different geographic entities (e.g., towns or cities) scattered throughout the county. The ability to group chains together to include the entire length of a street feature, such as US Route 66, depends on the uniqueness of the identifiers and the consistency of the feature identifiers along the length of the feature. The Census Bureau makes no guarantee that the complete chains have uniform names or contain all of the known feature identifiers. The Census Bureau has taken steps to improve the consistency of feature identifiers and to add feature identifiers to fill in gaps along street features. The Census Bureau also has eliminated some alternate spellings in favor of the spelling confirmed by the ZIP+4 file of the US Postal Service. The census feature class codes (CFCCs) may vary for chains with the same feature identifier. For example, the most frequent CFCC for a state highway is A21, but the complete chains marking the location of State Highway 32 may have a CFCC of A01, A21, or A31 (see the Census Feature Class Codes section in this chapter).  3-2 1998 TIGER/Line Files   The TIGER/Line file structure allows up to 4,996 feature identifiers for a complete chain. The primary feature identifier appears in Record Type 1. For street features, the primary feature identifier is usually the name most commonly associated with the address range. Up to five alternate feature identifiers are cross-referenced in each Type 4 record, and a single complete chain can have up to 999 Type 4 records. Alternate feature identifiers include highway designation numbers for named streets, former names, and alternate spellings where source material provided conflicting data. Where the complete chain represents a limited access highway, the highway type and route designator, such as I-95, should ideally become the primary name, and the local designation, such as Cross County Expressway or Capital Beltway, should become the alternate name. However, this is not always true in the TIGER/Line files. The primary and alternate feature identifiers can be independent of each other. There is no assurance that the same combination of primary and alternate feature identifiers will appear together in a sequence of complete chains. There also is no assurance that a feature identifier will consistently appear as the primary identifier; it might be recorded as an alternate feature identifier for some complete chains and a primary feature identifier for others. During TIGER improvement operations, the Census Bureau has taken steps to make the Interstate highway route designator the primary feature identifier for Interstate highways, and the common street name used in mail delivery the primary name on all other roads. The order of identifiers follows this hierarchy: Interstate highway, common name, US highway, county highway, with town and township road at the bottom of the list. Record Type 5 contains a record for each feature identifier used as either a primary or an alternate name. The TIGER/Line files link the alternate names in Record Type 5 to Record Type 1 through the use of the alternate feature identification code index that forms Record Type 4. See the Feature Identifier Record Linkage section in this chapter.

See Appendix DStandard Abbreviations.  Feature Types The feature type field for road features consists of a 4-character text string. For all hydrography and non-road features, the feature type will follow the feature name in the feature name field. The abbreviations in Appendix DStandard Abbreviations may appear in the feature type field or the feature name field. Data Limitations and Notes In earlier versions of the TIGER/Line files, users did not find many roads with alternate names in the GBF/ DIME-File coverage areas; if an alternate name was provided, it usually represented another local name and not a route number. TIGER improvement operations have since added route identifiers to many of these areas. Corporate Corridors and Corporate Offset Boundaries A corporate corridor is a narrow, linear part of an incorporated place (or in a few instances, another legal entity). The corporate corridor includes the street and/or right-of-way, or a portion of the street and/or right-ofway within the incorporated place. It excludes from the incorporated place those structures such as houses, apartments, or businesses that front along the street or road. A corporate limit offset boundary exists where the incorporated place lies on one side of the street and may include all or part of the street or right-of-way, but excludes from the incorporated place, the structures located along that side of the street. See Figure 4-4 in Chapter 4. To facilitate address coding, the Census TIGER data base contains duplicate street name and address ranges on complete chains with a CFCC of F11 (nonvisible offset boundary) or F12 (nonvisible corporate corridor). The duplicate street names for the F11 and F12 features are on Record Type 5; the duplicate address ranges are on Record Type 6. Record Type 1 will not contain feature identifiers for complete chains with CFCCs of F11 or F12.  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3- 5   Feature Identifier Record Linkage Record Type 4 provides the link required to find any alternate feature identifiers belonging to a complete chain. Record Type 4 cross-references each TLID with an Alternate Feature ID code (FEAT) assigned to each record in Record Type 5. Record Type 5 contains all feature identifiers including those that are used only as primary identifiers. However, only the FEATs for complete chains that have alternate feature identifiers appear in Record Type 4. Complete chains that have no alternate feature identifier will have no Type 4 record. To find the alternate feature identifiers for a complete chain, begin by determining the TLID for the complete chain. Then search for this TLID in Record Type 4. If the complete chain has any alternate feature identifiers, Record Type 4 should provide at least one record. Once found, the Record Type 4 entries will each contain from one to five FEAT numbers. The FEAT fields are blank when no further alternative identifiers exist. The first FEAT field (FEAT1) should always have a valid FEAT number. Finally, find the records in the Record Type 5 file that match the FEAT codes from Record Type 4. The TIGER/ Line file provides a record sequence number to identify multiple Type 4 records that might exist for one TLID. Even though Record Type 5 contains all feature identifiers, Record Type 4 contains only references for alternate feature identifiers. Data users cannot link all of the names in Record Type 5 to all of the associated complete chains in Record Type 1 by using Record Type 4.

A FEAT is assigned sequentially, beginning with 1, to each feature identifier in Record Type 5. The FEAT is not a permanent identification number. TLID is the record identifier for the complete chain. See Chapter 2 for a full discussion of TLIDs. RTSQ is a 3-digit integer that uniquely identifies multiple Type 4 records with the same TLID. RTSQ equals 1 for the first occurrence of a TLID in Record Type 4 and can reach a maximum of 999 for subsequent occurrences.  Address Ranges and ZIP Codes    The TIGER/Line files contain address ranges, not individual addresses. The term address range refers to the first possible structure number and the last possible structure number along a complete chain side relative to the direction in which the complete chain is coded. The address ranges in the TIGER/Line files are predominantly potential ranges that include the full range of possible structure numbers even though the actual structures might not exist. The address numbers used to create the address ranges are commonly known as city-style addresses. A city-style address minimally consists of a structure number, street name, and a 5-digit ZIP Code; for example, 213Main St 90210. In the TIGER/Line files, the ZIP Codes usually appear only on those complete chains that have address ranges identified. However, they may appear on some road features without the address ranges.  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3- 7   An address range also may have the full 9-digit ZIP Code that includes the USPSs 4-digit ZIP+4 Add-On code. The Census Bureau has added the Postal Add-On code to the Census TIGER data base using an automated match to the USPSs AMS II ZIP+4 file. The codes in the TIGER/ Line files are the street-level codes the USPS has assigned to address ranges. The USPS may assign more specific codes to companies and buildings, and to apartments, floors, or suites within buildings. Some address coding software that uses the AMS II ZIP+4 file may provide the more specific codes. However, the TIGER/Line files contain only the more general codes. Usually the ZIP+4 Add-On code is not required to uniquely identify an address range. There are a few situations where a street name and address range legitimately appear more than once in the same 5-digit ZIP Code. Usually the USPS distinguishes these duplicates by using different postal station names. However, the Postal Add-On code will uniquely identify these cases. Puerto Rico is a special case because many addresses were uniquely assigned within an urbanizacion (a community or development) and could duplicate another address in a different urbanizacion with the same 5-digit ZIP Code. To resolve this problem, the USPS added an additional line to the address to identify the urbanizacion. The 9-digit ZIP Code also may serve to uniquely identify these address ranges. We do not yet have all of these 9-digit ZIP Codes in the Census TIGER data base.  Address Ranges Complete chains in the TIGER/Line files have one end point labeled as the start node and the other end point labeled as the end node. The start and end nodes also are referred to as from and to. The start node always corresponds to the beginning of the complete chain identified by the start node coordinates FRLAT and FRLONG. The order of the addresses follows the sequence of the nodes on the complete chain; the nodes may not be related to the low to high orientation of the address range. The start address may be higher or lower than the end address for a complete chain. Structure numbers usually, but not always, systematically increase or decrease while moving along a street in a set direction from one complete chain to the next (see Figure 3-1).  3-8 1998 TIGER/Line Files   Figure 3-1 TIGER/Line Address Range Basics The TIGER/Line  files contain potential address ranges for city-style addresses. The complete chain (between the start node and the end node) in the diagram below has two address ranges; the left side has odd-numbered addresses and the right side has the complementary even-numbered addresses. Potential address ranges along a complete chain have values that encompass the addresses of existing structures, as well as those not yet built.  Actual Address  Potential Address Range  101  105  107  113  101-119 Start Node  Oak Ave  100-118  LEFT RIGHT  End Node  100  102  104  106  108  110  Record Type 1 contains separate data fields for both the start and end of each address range.

A complete chain side may have multiple address ranges. Often this occurs when address ranges are split to accommodate different 9-digit ZIP Codes. The TIGER/Line files use Record Type 6 to store any additional ranges as required. The Type 1 record will hold the ranges with the largest sequence of numbers. However, Record Type 6 may hold a significant number of additional ranges. Data users must use Record Type 6 to obtain the entire picture of the possible address ranges along a complete chain. In Record Types 1 and 6, both the left- and the right-side address ranges have a start and an end address range field that can contain a maximum of 11-alphanumeric characters. The address range fields are right-justified. Each address range in the TIGER/Line files has only one parity. Only odd-numbered addresses are contained within an address range with odd start and end structure numbers. Likewise, only even-numbered addresses belong to an address range with even start and end structure numbers. The value zero is not used as a valid address range end value. Generally, the left and the right sides of a complete chain have opposite parities. If both odd and even addresses exist on the same side of a complete chain, the TIGER/Line files provide both an even and an odd parity range for that side of the complete chain. One of the ranges appears in Record Type 1, while the other range appears separately in Record Type 6. Some address ranges may include single value ranges, such as 16-16, referred to as include addresses. These include addresses are anomalies; they may have a parity different than the prevailing address range on the complete chain side, or appear as an outlier from an adjoining range that does not fit within the range belonging to the complete chain where it is located. For example, the location of 16 Osage St falls on the predominantly odd-numbered left side of the complete chain with the address range 1-99. The range 16-16 will appear as an additional include range on the left side of the street. The even address range 2-98 on the right side of the street must exclude the number 16 structure number; the right address range becomes two ranges, 2-14 and 18-98. Outliers follow the same pattern. For example, 10 Persimmon St may appear on the side of the complete chain with the range 100-198 and not on the complete chain with the  3-10 1998 TIGER/Line Files   range 2-98. As before, 10-10 would become an additional range added to the complete chain with the range 100-198, and the address range 2-98 would become two ranges, 2-8 and 12-98. Because include address ranges require complex edits that may involve several complete chains, the Census Bureau cannot guarantee that all address duplication has been identified and eliminated. Some basic characteristics of address ranges are as follows:  The TIGER/Line files generally contain only those city-style address ranges used for mail delivery. They do not show rural route and post office box addresses. They may contain structure numbers assigned in select areas for use by local emergency services, but not for mail delivery. The TIGER/Line files do include address ranges and ZIP Codes in some small places where the USPS provides only post office box service, not street delivery. These address ranges represent the structure numbers collected during the 1990 census field operations, while the ZIP Codes represent the post office boxes. The address ranges in these areas do not have Postal Add-On codes since the USPS does not use them for street delivery.  Gaps may exist between multiple ranges for a single complete chain. A gap may be significant, since any numbers missing from one complete chain may actually appear on another complete chain in the case of address anomalies such as out-of-parity or out-of-sequence addresses (see Figure 3-2).  In a few rare cases, address ranges can include numbers with alphabetic characters. These characters help uniquely identify addresses within a county. For instance, certain unincorporated areas of Genesee County, Michigan add a letter G prefix to the address number. The characters are consistently placed within the address range field; for example, the letter G maintains a consistent column placement in the range G1 to G99 (see Figure 3-3).  Address ranges exist only for street features, and in some cases, corporate corridor and corporate offset boundary features.  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3- 11   Figure 3-2 TIGER/Line Multiple and Out-of-Sequence Address Ranges The TIGER/Line  files can accommodate complex address situations by using more than one address range. A complete chain may contain both odd and even ranges, provided the ranges are not duplicated elsewhere. Whenever there is more than one address range per side for a complete chain, the additional address ranges go into Record Type 6. The TLID field links the two record types. Record Type 6 has a sequence field (RTSQ) that allows more than one Record Type 6 to . have the same TLID. The largest address ranges are put on Record Type 1 and the smaller ranges on Record Type 6. The complete chain in the diagram below has two address ranges on each side. This situation results when a structure with an even-numbered address (150-150) is built on the odd-numbered side of the street.  113  121  123  125  150  199  LEFT Start Node  121-199, 150-150 120-148, 152-198  Oak Ave End Node  RIGHT  110  120  122  124  126  128  130  There is a gap (150-150) in the the even-numbered addresses.

Only a few rare situations require alphabetic characters to uniquely identify an address range.

Inconsistent street numbers may affect the address ranges of other complete chains.  The start-end orientation of address ranges follows the start-end node orientation of the complete chain. Address ranges run from high to low or low to high to be consistent with the actual orientation of address ranges along the street. Single number street addresses appear as a range.

The Census Bureau edits the address ranges to locate possible overlaps, but cannot guarantee that all possible overlap situations have been identified.  Address ranges in the TIGER/Line files are usually associated with both the primary and alternate feature identifiers. Caution: Address range overlaps may occur if primary address ranges are linked to alternate feature identifiers that identify route numbers. Some address systems use a hyphen to separate avenue numbers, private road designators, and grid cell numbers from the structure numbers; for example, 10-01 Reynolds St uses a hyphen to separate the avenue number from the structure number. See the Introduction chapter for more information on known anomalies.  Imputed Address Ranges Imputed address ranges occur during the process of updating the Census TIGER data base when a new complete chain intersects an existing complete chain with address ranges. The intersection splits the existing complete chain and produces two new complete chains connected by a new node located at the intersection point. The update program divides the old address ranges among the two new complete chains and imputes the address range ends at the new node. The impute process allocates either all or part of each original address range to each of the new complete chains in proportion to their lengths (see Figures 3-4 and 3-5). For each side of the original complete chain, the process considers all address ranges appearing on each side and determines the overall low and high address. The process assumes the addresses are evenly distributed over the length of the complete chain, and applies the proportion of complete chain lengths to the overall address ranges to calculate a split point address for each side. Address ranges that fall entirely above or below the split point address are moved intact to one of the new complete chains. The process divides any address ranges that contain the split point address and allocates each part to one of the new complete chains.  3-14 1998 TIGER/Line Files   The new address range ends created from the split are imputed values and have an impute flag. Some intermediate address range ends also may carry the impute flag. These address range ends fall between the overall high and low address for complete chain sides that have more than one address range. The impute flags on these range ends often mark splits created by adding different nine-digit ZIP Codes to parts of the original address range. These impute flags are not significant and should be disregarded. The impute flags identify address ranges that have been through the impute process. Each record in the TIGER/Line files contains four separate 1-character impute flag fields, one for each address range end.  ZIP Codes The ZIP Code is an attribute of the address ranges. The TIGER/Line files have a five-character ZIP Code field containing a numeric code with leading zeros. Both the left- and right-side address ranges share the ZIP Code that appears in the same Type 1 or Type 6 record. Each address range belonging to a complete chain can have a different ZIP Code. Where ZIP Code boundaries follow a street, the complete chain may have different left- and right-side ZIP Codes, or different ZIP Codes along its length. Because the Census TIGER data base identifies only one ZIP Code for each address range record, address ranges with different ZIP Codes must appear in separate records. The address range(s) with one ZIP Code will appear in Record Type 1, and the address range(s) with the other ZIP Code(s) will appear in Record Type 6. For example, one complete chain making up Duke Street is a ZIP Code boundary; the left-side range 1-99 has a ZIP Code of 12345, and the right-side range 2-98 has a ZIP Code of 54321. The range 1-99 with a ZIP Code of 12345 will appear in Record Type 1, and the right-side range fields will be blank. The range 2-98 with a ZIP Code of 54321 will appear in Record Type 6, and the leftside range fields will be blank. If the complete chain had additional address ranges with a ZIP Code of either 12345 or 54321, these additional address ranges would appear with Attributes of Geographic Objects 3- 15   Figure 3-4 TIGER/Line Address Range Imputes--Before Split The Census TIGER  data base uses impute flags to indicate that the one or both ends of an address range are based on calculations rather than known values. Imputed address situations generally occur when a complete chain with existing address ranges becomes split by a new complete chain. The illustration below shows the address ranges on Chestnut Ave before a split. All impute flags for this complete chain are set at zero. Figure 3-5 shows the address ranges after the split.

The overall address range for each complete chain side (1649 to 201 on the left side and 298 to 200 on the right side) and the split points for each of these address ranges (approximately 1088 on the left side and 261 on the right side) are determined by the TIGER System. Address ranges that fall entirely above or below the split point belong to one of the two new complete chains and do not get an impute flag.

For example, a right-side range of 150-198 with a ZIP Code of 12345 could appear on the Type 1 record with the left-side range of 1-99. However, a right-side range of 150-198 with a ZIP Code of 54321 could not appear on the Type 6 record with the range 2-98. Instead, the range would have to appear in a second Type 6 record. Since the ZIP Codes in the TIGER/Line file relate to mail delivery along addressed streets, they are not true area features. It is possible that a polygon may contain addresses associated with more than one delivery ZIP Code.  Postal Add-On Code The TIGER/Line files have a 4-character Postal ZIP+4 Add-On code which is located on Record Type Z. Record Type Z may link to a leftor right-side address range in Record Type 1 or in Record Type 6. By using the TLID fields, data users can match the Postal +4 Add-On codes on Record Type Z to an address range in either Record Type 1 or Record Type 6. If the RTSQ field on Record Type 6 contains a 0, the postal +4 Add-On codes apply to the address ranges in Record Type 1. If the RTSQ field contains a number greater than 0, the Postal +4 Add-On codes apply to the address ranges in the Record Type 6 that have the identical RTSQ value. The first two characters of the Postal +4 Add-On code indicate the USPS sector code; the last two characters represent the USPS segment code. As stated earlier, the Census Bureau used an automated match process to assign the Add-On codes to the address ranges in the Census TIGER data base. The match utilized only the street type records from the AMS II ZIP+4 file. These records identify a single Add-On code for a range of addresses. The ZIP+4 file also contains company and high-rise building records that supply specific codes to companies, buildings, and floors or suites within buildings. The Census Bureau did not match these codes to the Census TIGER data base because it was not practical to add all of the building features to the Census TIGER data base. Also, it was not feasible to split the address ranges for individual building-level codes. The match process attempted to relate the 5-digit ZIP Code, street name identifier, and address ranges for each feature in the Census TIGER data base to the corresponding street type record in the AMS II ZIP+4 file of 3-18 1998 TIGER/Line Files   the USPS. A match was not always possible because the process could not identify a single match between features with a high degree of confidence. Where successful, the process added the Postal Add-On codes to the address ranges in the Census TIGER data base. The process split these ranges if the Add-On codes covered only part of the range. Splits of this type occurred because the potential address ranges used by the Census Bureau differed from those used by the USPS. The USPS assigned different Add-On codes for each range of addresses along a block side. For example the 100, 200, and 300 numbered addresses received different Add-On codes even though they appeared on the same block side. The Add-On codes also may appear on more than one complete chain. This results because of differences in potential address ranges, and because the Census Bureau recognizes complete chain breaks and intersections not recognized by the USPS.  Address Information and Key Geographic Locations (KGLs) KGLs represent a special class of address information. They provide a geocoding tool like address ranges, but also identify a spatial object similar to a landmark. The Census Bureau uses KGLs to identify named buildings where the use of the feature name enhances the ability to geocode addresses. These cases include airports, shopping centers, schools, condominiums, hotels, and apartment complexes. The Census Bureau uses KGLs in situations where the address range along a street does not geocode to the correct block. Thus, greater accuracy in geocoding is provided when the KGL address is used than when the address range on the complete chain is used. In the TIGER/Line files, each KGL usually has a street address, CFCC, KGL feature name, and ZIP Code. The street feature identifier associated with the address of the KGL is obtained by linking the FEAT field to Record Type 5 which contains the list of all street name identifiers. The KGLs are independent of the address range on the complete chain; the geocoding link for the KGL is the GT-polygon. In most cases, one of the complete chains that forms the boundary of the GT-polygon will contain the KGL address. However, this relationship is not true for all KGLs. In order to locate the street segment with the KGL address, use  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3- 19   the previously linked street name identifier from Record Type 5. The ZIP Codes may not be the same. Even though the KGLs appear to identify specific structures, the KGL descriptions do not include location coordinates. In most cases, the Census Bureau can determine the general location of the KGL, but cannot provide a specific location with any certainty.  Address Information Methodology Pre-1992 Address Ranges Before the 1990 census, the Census TIGER data base contained address ranges only for the area covered by 1980 Geographic Base File/Dual Independent Map Encoding (GBF/DIME) files and a few file extension areas prepared in conjunction with 1980 census activities. These ranges were used to geocode a list of addresses to geographic areas for use in the 1990 questionnaire mail-out. For the 1990 census, the Bureau purchased the list of addresses from commercial vendors for the geographic areas where the Census TIGER data base included address ranges. To verify the accuracy of the addresses, the Census Bureau began with an initial assignment of residential addresses to the 1990 census tracts and blocks. Clerical review of the results of the assignment process provided additional address range updates. If an address range in the TIGER/Line file prepared for the 1990 census was incorrect, the Census Bureau implemented procedures to ensure that the error did not adversely affect the accuracy or the quality of the 1990 census. Later, in field operations, enumerators verified, corrected, and updated the list of addresses assigned to each block. They walked the perimeter and all interior streets of each block and checked the address list against their observations.  1992 TIGER/Line Expanded Addresses In the 1992 TIGER/Line Files, the Census Bureau expanded the address range coverage for the entire United States by creating new ranges based on the Address Control File (ACF) used in the 1990 decennial census. The ACF was a master list of addresses geocoded to the census block level. For each block, the individual structure addresses were grouped by feature 3-20 1998 TIGER/Line Files   identifier and sorted into numerical order to extract an actual range. The order of the addresses along the complete chains bordering the block, relative to the start and end nodes of the complete chains, came from the order of addresses for the street feature as a whole (i.e., the collection of linked complete chains with the same feature identifier). Likewise, the overall parity of the street feature set the standard for identifying and editing anomalies along the complete chains. To maintain confidentiality of individual addresses, the Census Bureau converted the actual range to a potential range. This was accomplished by expanding the actual range to complete a hundred range, splitting the difference between coverage gaps, and in some cases disguising the range by the random addition or subtraction of addresses. Where a complete chain in the Census TIGER data base contained both an ACF-derived address range and a pre-existing address range, only the pre-existing address range was extracted for the 1992 TIGER/ Line files. This extraction process was followed on each side of a complete chain. No attempt was made to resolve differences between the two sources (the pre-existing or the ACF-derived). The ACF-derived address range may have created overlaps with pre-existing address ranges on the adjoining complete chains.  Post-1992 Expanded Addresses What had been true for addresses in the 1992 TIGER/Line files was modified for the 1994, 1995, 1997 and the 1998 versions of the files. The preexisting address ranges in the Census TIGER data base and the ACF address ranges were matched to determine their comparability. Then, a rematch process was performed similar to the process used for the 1992 TIGER/Line files. Using more sophisticated processing, the address ranges were merged to create better address range coverage. In the merge process, the ACF range became the base address range, and the pre-existing address range in the Census TIGER data base was used to make the address range coverage more complete. The merged range is the address range in the 1998 TIGER/Line files. In addition to the address merge process, the Census Bureau ran an address range edit. The edits fixed some orientation and parity reversals Attributes of Geographic Objects 3- 21   along a street feature. They also identified overlapping address ranges of different complete chains that had the same street identifier and ZIP Code. Where all of the overlapping addresses were geocoded to the same 1990 census block, only one instance of the address was retained in the TIGER/Line files. If overlapping addresses were geocoded to a different census block, none of these overlapping addresses were entered into the TIGER/Line files. For this reason, street features that had address ranges in the past may show no ranges or incomplete ranges in the latest versions of the TIGER/Line files. Both primary and alternate feature identifiers can be used in geocoding, but great care should be used with the alternate identifiers. In the case of corporate corridors and corporate limit offset boundaries, the alternate address linked to the boundary should be used for geocoding rather than the primary range linked to the street (see the Corporate Corridors and Corporate Limit Offset Boundaries section in this chapter). Orientation edits attempted to standardize the low to high orientation of address ranges along a chain of street feature complete chains with the same feature identifier. Complete chains with address ranges that were specifically identified as orientation anomalies were automatically excluded. The edit determined the majority orientation for the street feature chain and reversed the low and high values on any range that deviated from the majority. The edit only created street feature chains that included adjacent complete chains; discontiguous street feature chains were edited as separate pieces. Therefore, the from-to orientation of the complete chains may be inconsistent along a feature chain. The parity edits attempted to place the even- and odd-parity ranges consistently on the same side of a feature chain. Chains with address ranges that were specifically identified as known anomalies were automatically excluded. Because address geocoding could be affected, the parity fix required a feature chain with a minimum of four complete chains and a majority parity representing 70 percent of the address ranges. As a result, smaller feature chains remained unaltered. For the 1994 TIGER/Line files, the Census Bureau conducted a general ZIP Code clean-up and staff added new ZIP Codes created since the  3-22 1998 TIGER/Line Files   1990 census. These updates had a significant impact on parts of Michigan, California, and central Florida. Nationwide, automated processes eliminated illegal codes not recognized by the USPS as ZIP Codes, and clerical operations began eliminating the scatter of incorrectly applied ZIP Codes. Nearly all 3-digit ZIP Code anomalies have been corrected. The Census Bureau, for the 1995 TIGER/Line files, edited address ranges for overlaps or other inconsistencies and ZIP Codes were updated in selected areas. The street names and address ranges in the Census TIGER data base were compared to those in the ZIP+4 file of the US Postal Service. If a street name and address range did not have a ZIP+4 code, the code was copied from the ZIP+4 file to the Census TIGER data base. The consistency of highway names and feature identifiers also was improved.

The distribution of ZIP Codes in the TIGER/Line files may not reflect the exact USPS ZIP Code service area.  Limitations Users of the address ranges in the TIGER/Line files should check for address range overlaps, gaps, odd/even reversals, and other situations 3-24 1998 TIGER/Line Files   that may be incorrect. While the Census Bureau continues to edit for, and correct these situations, it is possible that some still exist.  Corporate Corridors and Corporate Limit Offset Boundaries A corporate corridor is a narrow, linear part of an incorporated place (or in a few instances, another legal entity). The corporate corridor includes the street and/or right-of-way, or a portion of the street and/or right-ofway within the incorporated place. It excludes from the incorporated place those structures such as houses, apartments, or businesses that front along the street or road. A corporate limit offset boundary exists where the incorporated place lies on one side of the street and may include all or part of the street and/or right-of-way, but not the structures located on that side of the street. See the Places section in Chapter 4. To facilitate the coding of addresses to the correct geographic entity, the Census TIGER data base contains duplicate street name and address ranges on complete chains with a CFCC of F11 (nonvisible offset boundary) or F12 (nonvisible corporate corridor). The duplicate street names for the F11 and F12 features are on Record Type 5; the duplicate address ranges are on Record Type 6. Complete chains with CFCCs of F11 or F12 will not contain the duplicate names or address ranges in Record Type 1. Record Type 1 does not indicate that the street or right-of-way lies within a corporate corridor or offset boundary. Therefore, the address ranges lie outside the corporate corridor or offset boundary and are encoded on either side of these lines. Data users planning to geocode addresses in areas with these boundary types must identify the duplicate feature identifiers and ranges from Record Types 5 and 6 (the names and address ranges for CFCC F11 and F12 features), locate the street feature with those ranges, and remove the street features address ranges and geographic codes from the geocoding process.  Record Linkages The TIGER/Line files store address range information in two record types. Record Type 1 contains the basic complete chain attributes, including one basic address range. Record Type 6 stores the Attributes of Geographic Objects 3- 25   additional ranges when the complete chain has more than one range on one or both sides. The TLID field links Record Types 1 and 6. Since a complete chain can have more than one set of address ranges, multiple Type 6 records can exist with the same TLID. The TIGER/Line files distinguish these records with a record sequence number (RTSQ). All Type 6 records that have the same TLID appear sequentially in the file even though the records are not sorted by TLID. The TIGER/ Line files do not contain a field indicating whether a Type 6 record exists for a specific TLID; the user must scan any existing records in Record Type 6 for a TLID match.  Boundaries of Geographic Entities The TIGER/Line files store geographic codes as either a polygon or complete chain attribute. In the case of state and county level geography, and some other areas, the codes appear in both complete chain and polygon record types. Refer to Chapter 4 for descriptions of geographic areas, and to Chapter 6 for the data dictionary that describes the record type fields.  Record Linkages and Boundary Extraction The codes assigned to the complete chain belong to the areas referenced by the left and the right sides of a complete chain. Only those features that have different geographic codes on the left and the right sides of a line become boundary features. Information from multiple TIGER/ Line data fields is required to uniquely identify the boundary of some geographic entities. For instance, both the census block and census tract/ BNA codes are required to identify a block boundary. Block 101 in census tract 2101 could neighbor block 101 in census tract 2998. Be sure to use both the basic number and the suffix when extracting either census tract or block boundaries. Data users who have combined TIGER/Line files should include the 1990 state/statistical equivalent and 1990 county/statistical equivalent codes to extract 1990 census tract/BNA boundaries. The extraction of boundary features from polygon attribute codes requires making a link between the polygon and the complete chain data records, then identifying the features with different left- and right-side geographic 3-26 1998 TIGER/Line Files   codes. For a description of the record linkage process, see the Polygon Features section in this chapter. Boundary rings consist of multiple complete chains that are sequentially linked together and connected to form a closed ring. The process of linking all of the boundary complete chains that outline the same geographic entity requires the extraction of all complete chains that have that entitys code on either the left or the right side (but not both). Linking the chains together will form a polygon; each polygon may represent one of the GTpolygons described in Record Types A, P, and S, or a collection of these GT-polygons. Caution: Some types of geographic areas must end at a county/file boundary while others can continue into adjoining counties/files. For example, MCDs stop at a county boundary, whereas incorporated places can exist in several counties (See the Record Linkages/Feature Chaining section in this chapter).  Single-Side Flags and County Boundaries The 1998 TIGER/Line files use current counties/statistical equivalents as the basis for the file coverage area, not the boundaries as they existed for the 1990 census. This means that a county or countyequivalent file may not cover the exact same area as it did in 1990. Any legal changes or boundary corrections that occurred since 1990 could have resulted in a piece of land moving from one county, or county equivalent, to another. County boundary features are duplicated between adjoining pairs of counties so that each file is complete. However, the complete chains that constitute the boundary features contain only the geographic entity codes and address ranges relevant to each county-based TIGER/Line file. The geographic entity codes are blanked out on the outside edge of the county, even though some of these fields must normally have a non-blank code. The TIGER/Line file identifies these complete chains with a 1-character, single-side segment flag in the SIDE1 field of Record Type 1.  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3- 27   When combining several TIGER/Line files data set, the data user will need to eliminate Because each one of the duplicate boundary the left- or right-side geographic entity codes elimination process will need to combine the from both lines.  to form a state or regional duplicate boundary lines. complete chains has either and address ranges, the codes and address ranges  The same situation applies to the polygon identification codes. Record Type I contains CENIDs and POLYIDs for GT-polygons within the county. If the GT-polygon is in the adjacent county, the CENID and POLYID fields are blank.

The CFCC is applied only once to a chain or landmark with preference given to classifications that cover features that are visible to an observer and a part of the ground transportation network. Thus, a road that also is the boundary of a town would have a CFCC describing its road characteristics, not its boundary characteristics. The CFCC, as used in The first character is a character is a number character is a number the TIGER/Line files, is a three-character code. letter describing the feature class; the second describing the major category; and the third describing the minor category.  Feature Class A, Road The definition of a divided highway has been the source of considerable discussion. Earlier specifications have defined a divided road as having 3-28 1998 TIGER/Line Files    opposing traffic lanes that are physically separated by a median strip no less than 70 feet wide in former GBF/DIME areas or no less than 200 feet wide in non-GBF/DIME areas. This definition caused confusion in the proper coding of interstates having narrow medians. To clarify the situation, the Census Bureau now uses the term divided to refer to a road with opposing traffic lanes separated by any size median, and separated to refer to lanes that are represented in the Census TIGER data base as two distinct complete chains. Earlier operations may have depicted widely separated lanes as a single line in the data base or created separate lines when the median was small, depending on the available source used during the update. See the list of anomalies in the Introduction chapter. The term, rail line in center, indicates that a rail line shares the road rightof-way. The rail line may follow the center of the road or be directly next to the road; representation is dependent upon the available source used during the update. The rail line can represent a railroad, a street carline, or other carline. Primary Highway With Limited Access Interstate highways and some toll highways are in this category (A1) and are distinguished by the presence of interchanges. These highways are accessed by way of ramps and have multiple lanes of traffic. The opposing traffic lanes are divided by a median strip. The TIGER/Line files may depict these opposing traffic lanes as two distinct lines in which case, the road is called separated.

Only those GT-polygons associated with an area landmark have a CFCC. Most CFCCs in the feature classification scheme apply only to complete chains. In a few instances, the same feature code may apply to complete chains as well as to point and area landmarks. Only those features required for census operational purposes are classified and inserted into the Census TIGER data base. Therefore, not all features in a county will appear in the TIGER/Line files. Since features are classified with only a single code, a road that also is a boundary will have only the CFCC of a road even though a CFCC for a boundary exists in the classification scheme.  CFCC Record Location Record Type 1 7 9  Field Name CFCC CFCC CFCC  Description Code assigned to the complete chain Code assigned to a point or area landmark Code assigned to a key geographic location  3-42 1998 TIGER/Line Files   Points Describing the Complete Chain The TIGER/Line files describe the spatial/geometric position and shape of a complete chain using shape points and nodes; see the section entitled Topology in Chapter 1. Latitude and longitude coordinate fields identify the shape points and nodes. The Census TIGER data base does not support node identification numbers.  Nodes Nodes are topological objects that mark the end location of each complete chain. Every chain has two nodes, a start node and an end node (using the Spatial Data Transfer Standard, or SDTS, terminology). Earlier releases of the TIGER/Line files refer to these nodes as the from node and the to node. The order of the nodes establishes the left and the right sides of the line and sets the sequencing order for the shape points. The node coordinates are stored in Record Type 1.  Shape Points The Census Bureau uses the term shape points to describe the nontopological points that describe the position and shape of a chain. Shape points exist only where required; straight-line complete chains require no shape points. Shape points are associated only with one complete chain and are listed in order from start node to end node. The TIGER/Line files store shape points in Record Type 2 and link them to the nodes in Record Type 1 using the TLID. The shape points for a chain can fill several Type 2 records.  Coordinates for Nodes and Shape Points Coordinates are expressed in Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) notation, where a positive latitude represents the Northern Hemisphere and a negative longitude represents the Western Hemisphere. All coordinates are expressed as a signed integer with six decimal places of precision implied (see the section, Positional Accuracy, in Chapter 5). Actual Latitude 15 Deg. S to 72 Deg. N Longitude 64 Deg. W to 131 Deg. E  TIGER/Line File -15000000 t o +72000000 -64000000 t o -180000000 +179999999 t o +131000000  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3- 43   For the 48 contiguous states, the District of Columbia, Alaska, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, the coordinates in the 1995 and 1997 versions of the TIGER/Line files are in the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). The coordinate datum for the above areas was NAD27 in all previous versions of the files prior to 1995. Regional datums are used in all versions of the TIGER/Line files for Hawaii and the Island Territories in the Pacific.  Coordinate Values All nodes have non-zero coordinates within the range specified in the Coordinates for Nodes and Shape Points section on the previous page. Shape point coordinates are expressed in the same manner. However, unused Record Type 2 fields are zero-filled and begin with a + sign.

Point 10, Longitude Point 10, Latitude  Record Linkages/Feature Chaining Plotting a complete chain requires using the nodes from Record Type 1 and all of the shape point records in Record Type 2 with the same TLID, if any. Plot the start node first, then search Record Type 2 for any matching records. If there is a match, the record will contain from 1 to 10 shape points. If all 10-point fields are filled with non-zero values, there may be an additional matching Type 2 record. Type 2 records are not sorted by TLID, but all records with the same TLID should appear together in  3-44 1998 TIGER/Line Files   sequence by the record sequence number (RTSQ). Plot the shape points from all Type 2 records and end the complete chain by plotting the end node. Street features may consist of multiple complete chains that are sequentially linked together. Linking all of the features with the same name requires the extraction of all Type 1 and Type 2 records with the same feature identifiers in Record Types 1 and 5. Boundary generation requires the extraction of all features that have different left and right geographic codes. The placement of the complete chains into a boundary-ring sequence requires a procedure to match the end of one complete chain to the beginning or end of the next complete chain. The complete chains will probably not have the same to-from or start-end orientation down the length of the street or boundary. Therefore, the procedure must reverse the order of the nodes and shape points that form some complete chains to achieve a correct and consistent sequence of nodes and shape points. Since the nodes that identify the ends of the complete chains do not have an identification number, the procedure must match the nodes based on the latitude and longitude coordinates. This might facilitate the match by combining the coordinates into a single peano key code composed of alternating latitude and longitude digits. Sorting nodes using the peano key will cluster nodes that are spatially close together.  Polygon Features The TIGER/Line files contain identification and geographic codes for each GT-polygon in the Census TIGER data base. These GT-polygons are the smallest areas identified in the TIGER/Line files. Geographic entities and area landmarks have specific identification codes and form more complex polygons. The TIGER/Line files link these features to GT-polygons, but do not directly identify the more complex polygons. GT-polygons are building blocks that form features. They are not features and do not have their own feature name or CFCC. However, GT-polygons may be a part of many area landmark features that have their own feature name and CFCC.  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3- 45   GT-polygons have unique GT-polygon identification codes (CENID and POLYID), a set of geographic entity codes, and an internal point location. Refer to Chapter 2 for more information on GT-polygon identification codes and Chapter 4 for a description of the geographic entities in the TIGER/Line files. Information and record linkage keys for GT-polygons are distributed over several record types:       Record Record Record Record Record Record Type Type Type Type Type Type P -- provides the GT-polygon internal point location A -- provides the 1990 census geographic entity codes and areas 8 -- links GT-polygons to area landmarks 9 -- links GT-polygons to key geographic location features I -- links GT-polygons to complete chains S -- provides current geographic entity codes and areas  Updates to the Census TIGER data base include new street and boundary complete chains that create new GT-polygons. Thus, each version of the TIGER/Line files will have a single, unique set of GT-polygons, each with a corresponding Record Type A, S, and P. The CENID and POLYID identification codes link records together, but are not permanent GT-polygon identification codes.  Geographic Entity Codes Geographic entity codes can be attributes of a set of polygons, a complete chain, or both. Refer to Chapter 6 for the data dictionary that describes the record type fields and to Chapter 4 for descriptions of geographic areas.  Internal Points The internal point is a point location within each GT-polygon that is unique to that GT-polygon. The TIGER/Line files exclude the internal points from the node-complete chain-polygon topology; do not confuse the internal point with a centroid. In a polygon with an irregular shape, such as a doughnut or crescent shape, the true centroid could fall outside the polygon. Unlike true centroids, the internal points should always fall within the GT-polygon or on the GT-polygon boundary.  3-46 1998 TIGER/Line Files   Some of the GT-polygons (approximately 400 nationwide) are so small that the internal point may be identical to a point on one of the lines bounding the GT-polygon, or identical to one of the nodes. Depending upon the precision of a particular software or hardware system, the data user may find the internal point outside the correct GT-polygon, or find that a GT-polygon may contain two internal points. Changes to the shape and location of complete chains forming polygon boundaries will change the polygon internal point coordinates even though the topology of the polygon remains the same. Such changes complicate the matching, using internal point coordinates, of polygons from different versions of the TIGER/Line files. All internal points have non-zero coordinates. Coordinates are expressed in standard FIPS PUB 70 notation. See the Coordinates for Nodes and Shape Points section in this chapter. GT-Polygon Internal Point Coordinates Record Locations Record Type P P Field Name POLYLONG POLYLAT Description Internal point longitude Internal point latitude  Record Linkages The topological network of complete chains divides the surface area of geographic entities into GT-polygons. There is a one-to-one relationship between the GT-polygons constructed from Record Types 1 and 2 and those appearing in Record Type P. In constructing the GT-polygons from Record Types 1 and 2, users are cautioned to be sure their software has the necessary coordinate precision and does not snap together complete chains that are merely close. Record Type I provides a direct link from each complete chain in the TIGER/Line file to its adjoining GT-polygons. It contains both the TLID and the polygon identification codes for each side of the GT-polygon. Record Type I facilitates the transfer of polygon geographic codes to the complete chain, but also provides the link back from polygon to complete chain. In this case, finding all complete chains associated with  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3- 47   a GT-polygon is more difficult. The procedure involves searching every Type I record to locate all instances where a CENID and POLYID appear on either the left or the right side of a complete chain. Area landmarks also must link to the GT-polygons in order to establish their geographic location. Record Type 8 provides the link from GT-polygon to area landmark. See the Area Landmark Locations section in this chapter.  Landmark Features The Census Bureau includes landmarks in the Census TIGER data base for locating special features and to help enumerators during field operations. Some of the more common landmark types include airports, cemeteries, parks, and educational facilities. The Census Bureau added landmark features on an as-needed-basis and made no attempt to ensure that all instances of a particular feature were included. The absence of a landmark does not mean that the living quarters, e.g., hospitals and group quarters associated with the landmark were excluded from the 1990 enumeration. The address list used for the census was maintained apart from the landmark data. Landmarks with a ZIP Code and an address are called key geographic locations (KGLs). A landmark can be either a point, Census TIGER data base permits airport or airfield might appear as depends on the size of the feature the source document. line, or area type. In some cases, the a choice of types. For instance, an a point, line, or area; the approach and the depiction of the feature in  Line features such as airfields could appear as one or more complete chains; they are not identified in the landmark record types. See the Point, Line, and Area Landmark CFCCs section in this chapter to identify the possible codes that could appear as complete chains. In addition to landmark data, the TIGER/Line files contain the CFCCs and names for bodies of water including ponds, lakes, oceans, and the area covered by large streams represented as double-line drainage. These  3-48 1998 TIGER/Line Files   water areas have 1990 census block numbers ending in 99. See Chapter 4 for a complete description of census blocks covering land and water. Landmark and water features can overlap. The most common situation is a park or other special land-use feature that includes a lake or pond. In this case, the GT-polygon covered by the lake or pond belongs to a water landmark feature and a park landmark feature. Other kinds of landmarks can overlap as well. Area landmarks can contain point landmarks; these are not linked in the TIGER/Line files. Record Type 7 contains point and area landmarks. Most water areas are identified as an area landmark whether named or not. The other landmarks may be identified only by a census feature class code and may not have a name. During the extraction of this data, the Census Bureau assigned a temporary landmark identification number (LAND) to each landmark record. Record Type 8 uses the LAND to link the area landmark records in Record Type 7 to the GT-polygons. Record Type 7 and Record Type 8 exist only when the county file contains landmark features or water features. Record Type 9 contains the KGLs in the Census TIGER data base. The KGLs are linked by the CENID and POLYID to the GT-polygons.  Point, Line, and Area Landmark CFCCs All landmarks, including KGLs, have a CFCC. In the Census TIGER data base the CFCCs of the complete chains forming the polygon boundary are independent of the CFCCs assigned to the area landmark or the water feature filling the polygon.

The text string includes upper- and lower-case characters. The feature name may carry an imbedded feature type (e.g., River, Military Reservation, Garden, Park, and Lake). The Census Bureau has not standardized or edited the feature types or names for landmarks in the Census TIGER data base in all areas. The Census Bureau does not guarantee that the landmarks or water areas are consistently identified in the TIGER/Line files. Area landmarks added to the Census TIGER data base in different update actions with the same name and CFCC will produce separate landmark records in the TIGER/Line files. The landmark records may contain variant spellings of the feature name or different CFCCs even though they refer to the same feature. These differences could result in the fragmentation of a large landmark. For instance, a water body could have the name Lake Redmond with a CFCC of H31, while another part could have the same name, but a CFCC of H30, and still a third part could have the name York County Reservoir. Because area landmarks can overlap, it is possible, although not likely, for one polygon to belong to several landmarks. Area landmarks and water area labels can have alternate names. Each feature name will appear as a separate Type 7 record, but each record will have the same LAND. Type 7 Records with the same LAND will have the same landmark or water area label. Each unique combination of primary and alternate names becomes a separate landmark record even though the primary name and the CFCCs match the adjoining landmark features. The TIGER/Line files do not show all water bodies as landmark records. Using Record Type 7 (area landmarks) and Record Type 8 (polygons linked to area landmarks) will not necessarily provide all water areas. Record Type S contains a water flag (WATER) to identify polygons associated with water bodies. Water bodies are identified with a value of 1 in the WATER field.  3-52 1998 TIGER/Line Files   Key geographic location names uniquely identify the landmark separately from its street address; for example, Springfield Towers instead of 1605 Main St. Landmark Feature Record Locations Record Type 7 9 Field Name LANAME KGLNAME Description Landmark name Key geographic location name  Landmark Feature Name Codes The LANAME and KGLNAME field may include any ASCII text string. The fields can be blank where the feature is unnamed.  Point Landmark Locations The TIGER/Line files identify the location of point landmarks with a single coordinate point. The presence of coordinate data in Record Type 7 distinguishes point landmarks from area landmarks that have blank coordinate fields. Coordinates Coordinates are expressed in standard FIPS PUB 70 notation. For additional information, see the Coordinates for Nodes and Shape Points section in this chapter. Point Landmark Coordinate Record Locations Record Type Field Name Description  7 7  LALONG LALAT  Longitude Latitude  Coordinate Values All point landmarks have non-zero coordinates within the range specified above. The coordinate fields for area landmarks are blank-filled.  Area Landmark Locations To find the location of each area landmark, link the basic landmark description in Record Type 7 to all of the elementary polygons that belong to the landmark. Record Type 8 serves as a bridge between these two record types. The TIGER/Line files provide a Type 8 record  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3- 53   for each polygon linked to a specific landmark. Polygons belonging to multiple landmarks appear once for each landmark. The TIGER/Line files use the LAND and the polygon identification codes (CENID and POLYID) to actually make the link. See Chapter 2 for a description of the LAND, CENID, and POLYID codes and fields. Locate the polygons for an area landmark by searching Record Type 8 for all of the CENIDs and POLYIDs with the specified LAND. Record Type 8 is in LAND sort sequence. Once the polygons are linked to the area landmark, use Record Type I to locate the complete chains that form the landmarks polygon boundaries. Record Type I contains a record for all complete chains and identifies the polygons located on either side of the complete chains. The search procedure must look for all instances of Record Type I and evaluate the left- and right-side polygon identifiers for a possible match. Data users may need to eliminate complete chains that are internal to the polygon and landmark, depending on the application.  KGLs To find the location of KGLs, link the description in Record Type 9 to the elementary polygon in which the KGL is found. Use the polygon identification codes (CENID and POLYID) to make the link. If the address of the KGL is a street address, use the FEAT field (alternate feature ID code) to link to the feature identifier in Record Type 5.  3-54 1998 TIGER/Line Files   Chapter 4: Geographic Entities Overview The 1998 TIGER/Line files contain the boundaries of legal, administrative, and statistical areas. Some boundaries are those that were in effect as of the tabulation of the 1990 census, while others are updated boundaries. The legal areas shown in the files are:        States and their statistical equivalents--1990 and current Counties and their statistical equivalents--1990 and current Minor civil divisions (MCDs) --1990 and current Sub-minor civil divisions (Puerto Rico only)--1990 and current Consolidated cities--current only Incorporated places--1990 and current American Indian reservations (both federally and state-recognized)--1990 and current  American Indian trust lands--current only  Alaska Native Regional Corporations--current only  Congressional districts--current only  The administrative areas shown in the files are:  Voting districts--1990 only  School districts--current only  Traffic analysis zones--current only  The statistical areas included in the files are:  Census areas (statistical county equivalents in Alaska)--1990 and current  Census county divisions and unorganized territories (statistical county subdivisions)--1990 and current  Census designated places (statistical place equivalents)--1990 only  Place (remainder) entities (statistical place equivalents within consolidated cities)--1990 and current  American Indian/Alaska Native statistical areas--1990 and current 1) Alaska Native village statistical areas 2) Tribal designated statistical areas 3) Tribal jurisdiction statistical areas  Census tracts and block numbering areas--1990 only  Urbanized areas--1990 only  Census blocks--1990 and Census 2000 collection  Geographic Entities 4- 1    Metropolitan areas: 1) Consolidated metropolitan statistical areas--current only 2) Metropolitan statistical areas--current only 3) Primary metropolitan statistical areas--current only  Geographic entities tabulated by the Census Bureau generally are hierarchical; Figure 4-1 shows the progression of geographic areas from the Nation to the block level. See Appendix F for a count of legal, administrative, and statistical entities. The TIGER/Line files identify geographic areas the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) codes or, in American Indian/Alaska Native Areas only, Census Bureau-assigned codes. The TIGER/Line files depict geographic areas in two ways:  The assignment of codes to the left and the right sides of the complete chains (Record Types 1 and 3)  The identification of codes that belong to each GT-polygon (Record Types A and S) The TIGER/Line files identify some geographic entities in both the complete chain and polygon records for certain boundary vintages. This chapter provides detailed information on the record types and fields for the geographic entities.  Boundary and Area Changes The boundaries identified as current for some legal areas are updated boundaries collected since 1990 as part of the Census Bureaus Boundary and Annexation Survey, or as part of the 1990 County Quality Review correction process. The boundaries of all states, all counties and their statistical equivalents, all MCDs, and all incorporated places are those that were legally in effect as of the latest Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS). This may vary by county record or the date of extraction from the Census TIGER data base. For all other legal areas and nearly all statistical areas, the boundaries shown were those in effect at the time of the 1990 census whether the data are identified as 1990 or current. Because unorganized territories and census designated places occupy the same level of geography as 4-2 1998 TIGER/Line Files   Figure 4-1 Hierarchical Relationship of Geographic Entities  Nation  States AIANAs UAs CDs School Districts VTDs County Subdivisions Sub-MCDs Census Tracts Counties ANRCs Places  BGs  Blocks  Geographic Entities 4-3   legal MCDs and incorporated places, updates to the legal boundaries may affect the current boundaries for some of these entities, including the elimination of some of the statistical entities. The metropolitan area data that appears on Record Type S are based on the latest available designations by the Office of Management and Budget, and are not the metropolitan areas for which the Census Bureau tabulated data in 1990. The metropolitan area information on Record Type C, however, shows both 1990 and current codes and names. In a few cases, the Census Bureau made statistical area boundary changes in order to correct errors. Since the release of the 1990 Census TIGER/Line files, the Census Bureau shifted and reshaped some line features including the lines forming some boundaries. These changes involved the realignment of complete chains associated with a legal or statistical area boundary. The shape and area of the 1990 geographic entities portrayed in the 1995, 1997 and 1998 TIGER/Line files may differ from earlier TIGER/Line versions, but the inventory of 1990 census tabulation entities remains the same. Changes in the shape and location of complete chains will change the polygon internal point locations. See the Internal Points section in Chapter 3.  Codes for Entities Appendix A is a list of FIPS state and county codes. A list of valid codes and names for other legal entities does not appear in the documentation for the TIGER/Line files. The TIGER/Line files include Record Type C which lists the geographic codes and names plus some attribute data (FIPS 55 class code, census place description code, and legal, administrative, or statistical area description code; and entity type) for certain entities. The codes and names are identified as 1990, current, or both. Record Type C contains the TIGER/Geographic NameTM files that the Census Bureau produced as a companion to the 1992 TIGER/Line files. Record Type C also replaces the TIGER Geographic Reference File Names (GRF-N), 1990. The documentation and paper or file versions of the FIPS codes are available for sale from the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), US Department of Commerce, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161. 4-4 1998 TIGER/Line Files   The telephone number is (703) 605-6000. The US Geological Survey (USGS) maintains the FIPS 55 codes. Information about FIPS codes is available from USGS's Geographic Names Section at (703) 648-4547. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) maintains an Internet World Wide Web site of FIPS codes and information. The URL for this site is http://www.itl.nist.gov/div897/pubs/index.htm. The FIPS publications include:  FIPS PUB 5-2, Codes for Identification of States, the District of Columbia and the Outlying Areas of the United States, and Associated Areas  FIPS PUB 6-4, Counties and Equivalent Entities of the United States, Its Possessions, and Associated Areas  FIPS PUB 8-5, Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs)--including CMSAs, PMSAs, and NECMAs  FIPS PUB 55-3 , Codes for Named Populated Places, Primary County Divisions, and Other Locational Entities of the United States, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and the Pacific Island Territories  The Census Bureau uses the codes in FIPS PUB 55-3 to identify both legal and statistical entities for county subdivisions, places, and American Indian/Alaska Native areas. FIPS PUB 55-3 includes many more entity records than those for which the Census Bureau tabulates data. The FIPS 55 codes are state-based. American Indian reservations in more than one state will have a different FIPS 55 code for each state portion of the single reservation. The 1994, 1995, 1997 and 1998 versions of the TIGER/Line files do not contain the census codes for places, county subdivisions, and sub-MCDs that were available in earlier versions of the TIGER/Line files. A description of the Census Bureaus codes that are assigned to higher-level geographic entities (county subdivisions, sub-minor civil divisions, consolidated cities, and places) appears in the geographic identification coding scheme (GICS) product, TIGER/GICS. The TIGER/GICS contains FIPS and Census Bureau codes, names and attributes, and demographic data for the higherlevel geographic entities included in the 1990 census.

The TIGER/Line files use multiple fields to identify a series of legal and statistical AIANAs: Legal Entities  American Indian reservations (AIRs) are legal entities having boundaries established by treaty, statute, and/or executive or court order over which a federally recognized American Indian tribal group has jurisdiction. The areas identified as American Indian reservations include entities with other designations, such as pueblo, colony, and community. AIRs are identified by representatives of the reservations or tribes.  American Indian trust lands associated with Federal Government. reservations or tribes. trust for the tribe) or the tribe). 4-6 1998 TIGER/Line Files  lands included in the census are the off-reservation a specific tribe or a reservation held in trust by the They are identified by representatives of the Trust lands may be either tribal (held in individual (held in trust for an individual member of   Trust lands are assigned the same codes as the associated reservation. Trust lands not associated with a reservation are assigned codes based on the tribal name. The TIGER/Line files did not previously distinguish between AIRs and trust lands because they shared the same code. Beginning with the 1994 TIGER/Line files, American Indian trust lands are flagged in a separate field (previously the Census ANRC field).  Alaska Native Regional Corporations (ANRCs) are corporate entities established by the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (PL 92-203) to conduct business and nonprofit operations for Alaska Natives. The 12 ANRCs have specific boundaries and cover the state of Alaska except for the Annette Islands Reserve (an American Indian reservation). Statistical Entities  Alaska Native village statistical areas (ANVSAs) are 1990 census statistical areas that delineate the settled area of each Alaska Native village (ANV). ANVs represent tribes, bands, clans, villages, communities, and associations that are recognized pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (PL 92-203), but do not have legally recognized boundaries. Officials of Alaska Native Regional Corporations (ANRCs) and other knowledgeable officials delineated the 1990 ANVSAs for the Census Bureau for the purpose of presenting census data for these entities.  Tribal designated statistical areas (TDSAs) are geographic areas that were delineated for 1990 census data tabulation purposes by tribal officials of federally and state-recognized tribes outside of Oklahoma. TDSAs do not have a legally defined reservation or associated trust lands. They define areas that contain population under tribal jurisdiction and/or areas for which the tribe provides benefits and services. TDSAs are defined for data presentation purposes only.  Tribal jurisdiction statistical areas (TJSAs) are geographic areas delineated for 1990 census data tabulation purposes in Oklahoma by federally recognized tribes that do not have a legally defined reservation. TJSAs are areas defined only for data presentation purposes. They generally contain American Indian population over which one or more tribal governments have jurisdiction. They replace the single Historic Areas of Oklahoma (excluding UAs) recognized for the 1980 census.

Also, refer to FIPS PUB 55-3 or the Census Bureaus TIGER/GICS for a list of valid codes and entity names. The type of AIANA area can be identified either by the census code or by the FIPS 55 class code on each entity record in Record Type C. The range of census codes allocated to each AIANA and the valid FIPS 55 class code(s) associated with each are as follows: 4-8 1998 TIGER/Line Files   Type AIR TJSA ANVSA TDSA  Census Code Range 0001 to 4989 5001 to 5989 6001 to 8989 9001 to 9589  Valid FIPS 55 Class D1, D2, D3, D4, D5 D6 E1, E2, E6 D6  Block Groups (BGs) Geographic BGs Block groups are clusters of blocks within the same census tract or BNA; they have the same first digit as their 3-digit 1990 census block numbers. For example, blocks 101, 102, 103,, 199 in census tract 1210.02 belong to BG 1. BGs never cross county or census tract/BNA boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of county subdivisions, places, UAs, VTDs, congressional districts, and AIANAs. BGs generally contain between 250 and 550 housing units. Each BG usually covers a contiguous area. Each census tract/BNA contains at least one BG. BGs are uniquely numbered within census tract/BNA. Tabulation BGs Tabulation block groups are geographic BGs split to present data for every unique combination of county subdivision, place, UA, VTD, congressional district, U/R, and AIANA shown in the data tabulation products. The TIGER/Line files do not have a separate BG data field. Data users can determine the geographic BG by using the first digit of the 1990 census block number in combination with the 1990 state, county, and census tract/BNA number. Users can identify the tabulation BG by using the geographic BG in combination with the codes for the entities listed above. STF 1A and STF 3A present data for both geographic and tabulation BGs. Block Group Number Record Locations See the section, Census Blocks, in this chapter for record locations and field names. The BG is the compilation of all blocks with the same first digit of their block number in a specific 1990 state-county-census tract/BNA combination. All polygons have a non-blank BG number. The left- and right-side complete chain block numbers should not be blank except where they are located along the outside edge of the county boundary. The TIGER/ Line files do not contain codes for areas outside the county file. Geographic Entities 4- 9   BGs have a valid range of 0 through 9. Some BGs beginning with a 0 are in coastal and Great Lakes water. Rather than extending the census tract/ BNA boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the three-mile territorial sea limit, the Census Bureau delineated some census tract/BNA boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore. The Census Bureau assigned a default census tract/BNA number of 0000 and block number of 099 to the offshore areas not included in regularly numbered census tract/ BNA areas.  Census Blocks Census blocks usually are small statistical areas bounded on all sides by visible features such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad tracks, and by invisible boundaries such as property lines, legal limits, and short imaginary extensions of streets and roads. 1990 census blocks never cross county or 1990 census tract/BNA boundaries. In rare instances, parts of a 1990 census block may be discontiguous, but all parts of a 1990 tabulation block will be in the same geographic or governmental unit. Blocks are composed of one or more GT-polygons; that is, several GT-polygons can share the same block number. See Figures 4-2 and 4-3. Census 2000 Collection Blocks Census 2000 uses a set of collection geographic areas for canvassing and administering the census. The collection areas and their hierarchy used in the Census 2000 are different from those used in the 1990 census. Census 2000 collection blocks are unique within collection state and county. The Census 2000 collection blocks generally follow visible features such as roads, rivers, and railroad tracks. 1990 Census Block Numbers 1990 census blocks are numbered uniquely within each 1990 state/county/census tract or BNA. A 1990 census block must be identified by a 3-character basic block number field and a 1-character block suffix field. The suffix field often is blank. The 3-character basic block number identifies the collection block used in the 1990 census field operations. The first digit of the basic 1990 block number identifies the BG.  4-10 1998 TIGER/Line Files   The Census Bureau refers to the combined basic 1990 collection block number and suffix (if a suffix exists) as the tabulation block number. The 1990 tabulation block numbers identified in Record Types 1, 3, A, and S have a 1-character suffix field. The suffix character is blank for whole 1990 collection blocks that also are tabulation blocks. 1990 block numbers with suffixes usually represent 1990 collection blocks that are split in order to identify separate geographic entities that divide the original block. For example, when a city limit runs through 1990 collection block 101, the portion inside the city may be tabulated in block 101A and the portion outside the city in 1990 block 101B. The suffix letters A and B have no correlation to the location of the 1990 block portion to which they are assigned. In other words, in the example above, the portion of 1990 block 101 inside the city could have been assigned a suffix of B, and the portion outside the city, a suffix of A. There is no limit on the number of parts into which a 1990 block can be split. Census 2000 Collection Block Numbers For Census 2000, collection blocks are numbered with a four- or five-character identifier. Census 2000 collection blocks are unique within collection state and county; they do not nest within census tract as they did in 1990. To control the Census 2000 collection block numbers during the collection process, the Census Bureau retains the original state and county codes even if the current state and county changed after the original Census 2000 collection blocks were delineated. The collection state and county codes reflect the boundaries of those areas at the time of collection block numbering. To uniquely identify Census 2000 collection blocks, users must take both the collection state and county code file together with the collection block number and suffix fields. To support its enumeration activities, the Census Bureau assigns a collection block suffix to collection blocks split by road features added to Census TIGER after the assignment of the Census 2000 collection block numbers. The Census Bureau also assigns collection block suffixes to reflect updated American Indian reservation, American Indian trust land, and military installation boundaries. For those Census 2000 collection blocks that are split, the Census Bureau assigns a suffix to each collection block part.

As there is only one number ending in 99 within a 1990 BG, many water polygons can have the same 1990 block number. 1990 water blocks have suffixes if parts of the same 1990 block are located in different geographic entities. Rather than extending the 1990 census tract/BNA boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the three-mile limit, the Census Bureau closed off some 1990 census tract/BNA areas using boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore. The Census Bureau assigned a default 1990 census tract/BNA number of 0000 and 1990 block number of 099 to the offshore areas. 1990 water blocks do not appear in the 1990 census STF files. Census maps and other data files do not display the 1990 block numbers for water areas. The principal purpose for census block numbers assigned to water areas is to identify all areas of the United States and its territories and to allocate the water areas to geographic entities. Water GT-polygons with the same 1990 block number may not be contiguous, but will be in the same geographic area or governmental unit. Changes to shorelines or boundaries made since the release of the 1990 Census TIGER/Line files altered or removed 1990 block boundary features between parts of some 1990 water blocks and changed the 1990 block numbers (the BG designator) for those blocks. Because the 1990 water blocks had no population or housing, the tabulation of the 1990 census was unaffected. Some water blocks in the 1990 Census TIGER/Line files Supplemental CD-ROM may contain census block suffixes that do not match subsequent TIGER/Line file. Census 2000 Collection Water Blocks For Census 2000, the Census Bureau is using a different method for identifying the water areas of census blocks than used in the 1990 census. Any water area located completely with the boundaries of a single land block will have the same block number as that land block. Water area that touches more than one land block is assigned a unique collection block number not associated with any adjacent land block. The Census Bureau is assigning collection water block numbers beginning with 9999 or 99999 and preceding in descending order. For example, the collection water block numbers in a county would be 9999, 9998, 9997, and so forth. In some counties it is possible that the number 4-14 1998 TIGER/Line Files   of land blocks might use enough of the available collection block numbers to reach into 9000 range. For this reason, and because some land blocks include water (ponds and small lakes), no conclusions about whether or not a collection block is all land or all water can be made by looking at the Census 2000 collection block numbers. Data users must use the WATER flag on Record Type S to determine if the GT-polygon is land or water. Current Geography Record Types 1, 3, A, C, and S identify changes (both codes and boundaries) since the 1990 census tabulation for some geographic entities. These records do not show new block numbers. The Census Bureau continues to conduct its annual Boundary and Annexation Survey to identify changes to the boundaries of legal entities. However, the 1990 block numbers remain for new polygons created by the post-census boundary changes. The Census Bureau will not systematically update block numbering to reflect the current geographic boundaries until it assigns the Census 2000 tabulation block numbers.

When first established, census tracts should have relatively homogeneous demographic characteristics. Generally, census tracts have a population size between 2,500 and 8,000 people, and average about 4,000 people. The local data users can delineate census tracts for special land uses, such as military installations and American Indian reservations. BNAs BNAs are statistical areas delineated for the 1990 census by state agencies or the Census Bureau for counties without census tracts. The delineation of BNAs followed the same basic criteria as those for census tracts. Because BNAs appear more often in less populated counties, they may have fewer people than census tracts.  4-16 1998 TIGER/Line Files   Numbering Census tract numbers have a 4-character basic number field and an optional 2-character suffix number field. In printed reports and on mapping products, the Census Bureau uses a decimal point (.) to separate the basic number from the suffix. However, in the TIGER/ Line files and STF data products, the decimal point is implied. The basic number and the suffix appear together in a single 6-character field in Record Types 1, 3, A, and S. A basic number smaller than 1000 will contain leading zeros. Leading zeros are shown on machine-readable products, but are not shown in printed reports and on census maps since leading zeros are not part of the basic number. The TIGER/Line files use the right-most two characters in the census tract/BNA field for the suffix. These two characters are blank if the census tract/BNA number does not have a suffix. Suffixes smaller than 10 have a leading zero. For example, census tract 0077.01 is shown as 007701 in the TIGER/Line files. The Census Bureau uses suffixes to help identify census tract changes for comparison purposes. Local data users have an opportunity to review the existing census tracts before each census. If data users split a census tract, the split parts usually retain the basic number, but receive different suffixes. In a few counties, data users approve major changes to, and renumber, the census tracts. Changes to individual census tract boundaries usually do not result in census tract numbering changes. The Census Bureau documents all changes to census tract boundaries and numbers in the TIGER/Census Tract Comparability File (19801990). Data users are cautioned to examine the census tract boundaries or the comparability file before making comparisons between past data and 1990 data. Boundaries and Boundary Changes Census tract/BNA boundaries generally follow visible physical features and county boundaries. The 1990 census tract or BNA boundary may follow MCD and incorporated place boundaries in New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and the New England States (and occasionally other states) because the boundaries tend to be stable and locally known.  Geographic Entities 4- 17   In a few rare instances, a 1990 census tract or BNA may consist of discontiguous areas. These discontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves discontiguous. Census tracts were last defined in preparation for the 1990 census. Census tracts/BNAs must nest within acounty. New 1990 census tracts/BNAs were created to accommodate updates and corrections to county boundaries following the assignment of block numbers in 1988. This was necessary because existing 1990 census tracts were in place for the 1990census and could not be shifted. At the request of some local data users, the Census Bureau resolved a number of census tract boundary discrepancies. This explains some of the less populated census tracts and the census tracts with basic numbers or suffixes that are seemingly out of range for the county. The Census Bureau generally identified the revised 1990 census tracts/ BNAs with a unique suffix ranging from .70 to .98 (e.g., 1234.98) so data users could easily determine which census tracts/BNAs were affected. The Census Bureau made these changes after the release of the TIGER/ Line Precensus Files, 1990. The census tract boundaries follow legal county boundaries as of January 1, 1990. Because there have been state and/or county boundary changes since 1990, users are cautioned to only use 1990 state and county areas to identify census tracts/BNAs. Census tracts next will be defined for Census 2000. Relationship to Other Geographic Entities The 1990 census tracts and BNAs represent the same level of geography and share the same field in the TIGER/Line files. Census tracts or BNAs entirely cover a county. A county contains either census tracts or BNAs, but not a combination of both. Census BGs and blocks are uniquely numbered within census tracts and BNAs.

The left- and right-side complete chain census tract/BNA numbers are not blank except where they are located along the outside edge of the county boundary. The TIGER/Line files do not contain geographic codes for the area outside of the county file. The TIGER/Line files identify the boundary complete chains by placing a 1 in the single-side segment field in Record Type 1. The Census Bureau assigned a default 1990 census tract/BNA number of 0000 to some coastal and Great Lakes water rather than extend the census tract/ BNA boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the three-mile limit. The Census Bureau closed off some census tract/BNA areas along the shoreline or just offshore, and assigned the default census tract/BNA and special block numbers to the offshore water areas.  Congressional Districts The 1998 TIGER/Line files contain 2-character numeric code fields for the current (106th ), the 106th, and the 108th congressional districts. Congressional districts are numbered uniquely within 1990 state. Users must always combine the 1990 state codes with congressional district codes; corrections to state boundaries since 1990 will create anomalous current state to congressional district relationships. The field for the 108th congressional districts is blank. The current congressional district field always has a value other than blank for all polygons.

The county or MCD and the separately incorporated places within the consolidated city continue to exist. The Census Bureau classifies the separately incorporated places within the consolidated city as place entities and creates a separate place (remainder) record for the portion of the consolidated city not within any other place. Refer to the Places section in this chapter for additional information. Consolidated cities are represented in the TIGER/Line files by a 5-character numeric FIPS code.

See Appendix A list of FIPS codes for county and county-equivalent areas. fields identicounty codes for state and county for a  Census 2000 Collection County Census 2000 uses a set of collection geographic areas for canvassing and administering the census. Because Census 2000 collection blocks are numbered uniquely within collection state and county, the Census Bureau retains the original collection state and county codes even if the state and county changes after the original Census 2000 collection blocks are delineated. See the Census Block section in this chapter for information on collection blocks.

They use a single field to identify the two functional types (legal and statistical) of county subdivisions. Record Type C contains all valid codes and entity names. Legal Entities Minor Civil Divisions (MCDs)  MCDs are legally defined subcounty areas such as towns (in eight states) and townships. MCDs exist in 28 states, Puerto Rico, and the Island Territories.  Some states have incorporated places that are not part of any MCD. These places also serve as primary legal subdivisions and have a unique FIPS MCD code that is the same as the FIPS place code. The TIGER/Line files will show the same FIPS 55 code in the county subdivision field and the place field.  In New York and Maine, American Indian reservations (AIRs) exist outside the jurisdiction of any town (MCD) and thus also serve as MCD-equivalent entities. Statistical Entities Census County Divisions (CCDs) CCDs are areas delineated by state officials and local data users for statistical purposes. CCD boundaries usually follow visible features and in most cases, coincide with census tract or BNA boundaries. CCDs exist where: 1) There are no legally established minor civil divisions (MCDs). 2) The legally established MCDs do not have governmental or administrative purposes. 3) The boundaries of the MCDs change frequently. 4) The MCDs are not generally known to the public.  4-22 1998 TIGER/Line Files   CCDs have been established for the following 21 states: Alabama Arizona California Colorado Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Kentucky Montana Nevada New Mexico Oklahoma Oregon South Carolina Tennessee Texas Utah Washington Wyoming  Census Subareas Census subareas are subdivisions of boroughs and census areas, the county equivalent entities in Alaska. The state of Alaska and the Census Bureau cooperatively delineated the census subareas to serve as the statistical equivalents of MCDs. Unorganized Territories (UTs) For states with partial MCD coverage, the Census Bureau defines UTs for the non-MCD area. UTs are assigned county subdivision codes and names. Eleven states had or now have UTs: Arkansas Indiana (only for current) Iowa Kansas (only for 1990) Louisiana Maine Minnesota North Carolina North Dakota Ohio (only for current) South Dakota  County Subdivision Code Record Locations Record Type 1 1 3 3 A C C C S Field Name FMCDL FMCDR FMCD90L FMCD90R FMCD FIPS ENTITY NAME FMCD Description FIPS 55 Code (MCD/CCD) FIPS 55 Code (MCD/CCD) FIPS 55 Code (MCD/CCD), FIPS 55 Code (MCD/CCD), FIPS 55 Code (MCD/CCD), FIPS 55 Code, Entity Type Name of Geographic Area FIPS 55 Code (MCD/CCD), Left, Current Right, Current 1990 Left 1990 Right 1990  Current  Geographic Entities 4- 23   The Census Bureau assigned a default county subdivision code of 00000 in some coastal and Great Lakes water where county subdivisions did not extend into the Great Lakes or out to the three-mile limit.  Crews-of-Vessels Crews-of-vessels represent the population on military (including Coast Guard) and merchant ships; they do not include the inhabitants of houseboats or marinas. The census population tables show the vessels population in a unique 1990 census tract/BNA and census block. A crews-of-vessels census tract/BNA and block appear on census maps as an anchor symbol with the census tract/BNA and block numbers, rather than as a delimited area. The location of the anchor symbol is arbitrary and reflects neither the location of the vessel(s) at the time of the census, nor the location of the 1990 crews-of-vessels census tract/ BNA and block as it appears in the TIGER/Line file. See the Census Tracts and Block Numbering Areas and the Census Blocks sections in this chapter for record locations and field names. 1990 Crews-of-vessels census tract/BNA numbers use the same basic 1990 census tract/BNA number as the nearby land census tract/BNA with which the vessel is associated, plus a suffix of 99, shown in decimal notation. For example, 1990 census tract 1234.99 is shown as 123499 in the TIGER/Line files and other machine-readable products. 1990 Crews-ofvessels block numbers use the same basic 1990 block number as the associated land block in that 1990 census tract/BNA, plus a block suffix of Z; for example, block 901Z in 1990 census tract 1234.99. In such a situation, the related land block also receives a suffix, even though it may not be split by a boundary; for example, the addition of crews-of-vessels associated with the 1990 block 901 creates blocks 901A and 901Z. The Census Bureau does not use the 1990 Z census block suffix for any purpose other than the crews-of-vessels. Either the left or right 1990 census tract/BNA and census block identified in Record Type 1 will indicate the location to which the population is assigned. The 1990 census tract/BNA and census block for crews-ofvessels form an extremely small, triangular-shaped polygon requiring only one complete chain with a start node equal to the end node and two intermediate shape points. Based on the coordinates found on Record Types 1 and 2, the location of the 1990 census block is on the 4-24 1998 TIGER/Line Files   shore inside the land block with the same 3-digit 1990 collection block number, not in the water as shown on the census maps. The Census Bureau defines the area measurement enclosed by the special 1990 crews-of-vessels census tract/BNA and block as zero.  Metropolitan Areas The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) designates metropolitan areas to serve as statistical areas around the larger population centers of the United States and Puerto Rico. Basically, a metropolitan area must contain an urbanized area delineated by the Census Bureau or an incorporated place with a population of 50,000 or more. Metropolitan areas consist of whole counties or county equivalents in most states; in New England the OMB defines metropolitan areas using MCDs. The metropolitan area consists of the central county, county equivalent, or MCD (in New England) and additional areas based on OMB criteria related to population density, population growth, and commuting data. There are three types of metropolitan areas. If a metropolitan area has a total population of less than 1,000,000, the area is designated a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). Metropolitan areas with a population of 1,000,000 or greater qualify for designation as a Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA) that is composed of smaller Primary Metropolitan Statistical Areas (PMSAs). This designation is not automatic; the OMB solicits local opinion to designate CMSAs and their component PMSAs. The TIGER/Line files now contain three different 4-character numeric fields to identify the FIPS code for each metropolitan area and to differentiate CMSAs and MSAs from PMSAs. The FIPS codes are from FIPS PUB 8. If the metropolitan area is a CMSA then a value exists in the CMSA field identifying the CMSA and the value in the MA field identifies the PMSA. A blank CMSA field indicates the code in the MA field is for the MSA. Record Type C uses a single metropolitan area field to identify CMSAs, MSAs, and PMSAs. The Legal/Administrat

They include files for all counties and statistically equivalent entities in the United States, as well as files for Puerto Rico and the Island Territories. The TIGER/Line files are released by county or statistically equivalent entity based on the latest available governmental unit boundaries. These files contain data only and do not include display or mapping software. The TIGER/Line files are typically used in conjunction with geographic information system, or similar, software. The US Bureau of the Census first released the TIGER/Line files in 1988. Since that time, it has released several versions of the files, with each successive version being improved through increased editing and updating of address ranges and features. A brief discussion of the changes that occurred in the 1994 and 1995 TIGER/Line files, and the 1997 TIGER/Line files are summarized below.  Changes in the 1994, 1995, and 1997 TIGER/Line File Versions 1994 TIGER/Line Files The format and structure of the TIGER/Line files changed between the 1992 and the 1994 versions. In the 1994 TIGER/Line files, there were field definition changes and additional record types that accommodated new information or information that was previously supplied separately in other Census Bureau products. New Record Types The 1994 TIGER/Line files included five new record types9, C, H, S, and Z. Record Type 9 contained key geographic locations (KGLs). A KGL was a particular type of point landmark with residential or economic significance. Record Type 9 provided the linkage between a building (KGL) with a unique identity and ZIP+4 Code, and the buildings address that used its number and street name.  Introduction I-1   Record Type C replaced information that was supplied separately in the TIGER/Geographic Name files. Record Type C provided a unique list of all geographic entities with their code, name, and status. The FIPS Year field had three values, 90 for geographic names and codes valid for the 1990 census, 94 for geographic names and codes valid for the current year, and blank when the geographic names and codes were the same for 1990 and 1994. Multiple records for the same geographic entity showed its change or correction over time. Record Type H described the history of TIGER/Line IDs when complete chains were split or merged. Two fields (HIST and SOURCE) on Record Type H were not yet maintained in the Census TIGER data base and were blank. Record Type S had geographic area codes for polygons. It was similar to Record Type A (which also had geographic area codes for polygons) and was linked to Record Type P. There was a Record Type S for every polygon in Record Type P. Several fields were reserved for use by participants in Census Bureau programs. The WATER field had two values, 0 for land or 1 for water. The Congressional District codes for the current Congress (in this case, the 103rd) were moved to Record Type S. The current Congressional District code, when combined with the 1990 state codes, created valid geographic areas. When only current state geographic codes were combined, nonexistent geographic areas may have resulted. The fields for the 101st and 103rd Congressional District codes in Record Type A were replaced with those designated for the 106th and 108th. However, these fields were blank in the 1994 TIGER/Line files. Record Type Z linked a Postal +4 Add-On code to an address range in either Record Type 1 or Record Type 6. TLID fields were matched on these records. If the RTSQ field on Record Type 6 contained a 0, the Postal +4 Add-On codes applied to the address ranges in Record Type 1. If the RTSQ field contained a number greater than 0, the Postal +4 AddOn codes applied to the address ranges in the Record Type 6 that had the identical RTSQ value.  I-2 1997 TIGER/Line Files   Deleted Record Types In the 1994 TIGER/Line files, Record Types F and G were deleted because they were no longer used. Record Type F showed geographic codes as of January 1, 1990 that were corrected to resolve questions raised by local officials about the 1990 census data tabulations. Record Type G showed geographic codes (generally as of January 1, 1992) for those situations where geographic entities reported boundary changes during the Census Bureaus annual survey of governmental units. In the 1994 TIGER/Line files, information previously reported in Record Type G became implicit in the current geographic codes in Record Types 1 and S. Field Definition Changes The geographic area codes on Record Type 1 represented current geography rather than the 1990 census tabulation geography. The census tract and block remained as 1990 geography. In a few Type 1 records, the current state and county, when combined with the 1990 census tract and block, created nonexistent geographic areas. To avoid nonexistent geographic areas, it was important not to mix the 1990 geographic codes with the current geographic codes. The 1990 state, county, place, census tract, and census block codes all were found on Record Type 3. Record Type 3 no longer identified 1980 geographic area codes or contained census codes for places, minor civil divisions, and sub-minor civil divisions. These fields were replaced with the 1990 geographic areas that previously appeared in Record Type 1. Current geographic areas included on Record Type 3 were the Alaska Native Regional Corporations and the American Indian/Alaska Native Areas (AIANAs). Census Alaska Native Regional Corporation codes were eliminated from Record Type 1 and replaced by four fields. Two fields were reserved for census use. Two fields carried American Indian Trust Land Flags and contained two values, an I for individual trust land or a T for tribal trust land. The trust land flag more accurately portrayed the American Indian areas. Record Type 7 excluded key geographic locations (KGLs). These appeared in the new Record Type 9.  Introduction I-3   Address Ranges and ZIP Codes The 1994 TIGER/Line files contained improvements in address information. Address ranges were edited for overlaps or other inconsistencies and ZIP Codes were updated in selected areas. Coordinates datum used Puerto Rico, Hawaii and In the 1994 TIGER/Line files, NAD27 was the coordinate for the 48 contiguous states, the District of Columbia, Alaska, and the Virgin Islands. Regional datums were used for the Island Territories in the Pacific.   1995 TIGER/Line  Files  No records types were added or deleted between the 1994 and 1995 versions of the TIGER/Line files. However, there were field definition and coordinate datum changes, as well as address information improvements, in the 1995 TIGER/Line files. Field Definition Changes The CENID field was changed from numeric to alphanumeric in the 1995 TIGER/Line files to permit a wider range of entries within the same field length. Address Ranges and ZIP Codes Address ranges were edited for overlaps or other inconsistencies and ZIP Codes were updated in selected areas. The street names and address ranges in the Census TIGER data base were compared to those in the ZIP+4 file of the US Postal Service. If a street name and address range did not have a ZIP+4 code, the code was copied from the ZIP+4 file to the Census TIGER data base. The consistency of highway names and feature identifiers also was improved. Boundary and Area Changes The 1994 TIGER/Line files were included for American Samoa because the Census Bureau received no updates for this area. Since the 1990 census, the Bureau shifted and reshaped some line features, including boundary lines. This realignment of features could have been associated with corporate boundary corrections and changes. The shape and area of the geographic entities depicted in the 1995 TIGER/Line files may have differed from earlier versions of the TIGER/Line files, but represented the entities as they existed for the 1990 census. The inventory of census tabulation entities remained the same as it was in 1990. I-4 1997 TIGER/Line Files   With the exception of Hawaii, Record Type 1 no longer contained census designated place (CDP) information. Since CDPs are defined at the time of each decennial census and are valid only for the presentation of decennial census data, the CDP complete chain information was removed from Record Type 1 which contained only current geography, but retained on Record Type 3 which had 1990 geography. Because Hawaii did not have independently-defined incorporated place boundaries, it used CDP boundaries as substitutes for these legal boundaries. Thus, its CDP complete chain information was retained on Record Type 1. Coordinates For the 48 contiguous states, the District of Columbia, Alaska, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, the coordinates in the 1995 TIGER/Line files were in the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). In all previous versions, the coordinate datum for the above areas was NAD27. Regional datums were used for Hawaii and the Island Territories in the Pacific.  1997 TIGER/Line    Files  The 1997 TIGER/Line files have the same structure as the 1995 TIGER/ Line files; there are no record additions or deletions. However, there are some field name, file name, and content changes. Field Definition Changes The Census Bureau redefined the concept of version. The four-digit version code no longer will be a number that represents a fixed version that can be referenced nationwide. The version code will be a four-digit number that represents the month and year (mmyy) the file is extracted from the Census TIGER data base. Adjacent counties in a state may have different version codes if they are extracted at different points in time. There have been several changes to the fields on Record Type 3. The reserved spaces one through four in the 1995 TIGER/Line files contain four 1990 American Indian and Alaska Native area census code and American Indian trust land flag fields in the 1997 TIGER/Line files. These four fields are: Census American Indian/Alaska Native Area Code, 1990 Left (column positions 58 through 61); Census American Indian/Alaska Native Area Code, 1990 Right (column positions 62 through 65); American Indian Trust Land Flag, 1990 Left (column  Introduction I-5   position 66); and American Indian Trust Land Flag, 1990 Right (column position 67). Deleted from Record Type 3 in the 1997 TIGER/Line files are the Census Alaska Native Regional Corporation Codes, Current Left and Census Alaska Native Regional Corporation Codes, Current Right. As a result of these deletions, reserved space fills columns 86 through 107 of the 1997 TIGER/Line files and the reserved space fields on the record have been renumbered and reconfigured. Two changes occurred on Record Type A. The School District Code, Middle School field, in columns 60 through 64 of the 1995 TIGER/ Line  files was eliminated and replaced with Reserved Space1 in the 1997 TIGER/Line files. Reserved Space 9 in the 1995 TIGER/Line files (columns 95 through 98) has been replaced with the Census American Indian/Alaska Native Area Code, 1990 in the 1997 TIGER/Line files. The length of the RS 9 field in Record Type A has been changed from nine characters to four characters. The five characters freed by this change are now used for the 1990 state and county codes and are the source for determining the 1990 census tabulation codes. There are changes to Record Type C in the 1997 TIGER/Line files. The 1995 TIGER/Line files had ten characters in columns 23 through 32 which contained the Census Alaska Native Regional Corporation Code, Year; FIPS Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area/Metropolitan Statistical Area Code, Year; and the FIPS Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area Code, Year. The 1997 LUCA TIGER/Line files allocate these columns to Entity Type Code; Metropolitan Area Code, Year; and School District Code. We have standardized the file suffix names that will appear inside the zipped archive. This suffix now will consistently be .rt n where n is the record type. In examining the record layouts in Chapter 6, we corrected information concerning the valid existence of blank values and data formats.  I-6 1997 TIGER/Line Files   Address Ranges and ZIP Codes Address ranges were edited for overlaps or other inconsistencies and ZIP Codes were updated in selected areas. Because of time constraints during the various operations needed to create the 1997 TIGER/ Line files, the Census Bureau has not added new ZIP+4  information. Boundary and Area Changes Since the 1990 census, the Census Bureau has shifted and reshaped some line features, including boundary lines. The shape and area of the geographic entities depicted in the 1997 TIGER/ Line files may differ from earlier versions of the TIGER/Line files, but continue to represent the entities as they existed for the 1990 census. The inventory of census tabulation entities remains the same as it was in 1990.  How to Use This Documentation The structure of this documentation is based on data content rather than record type content. For instance, information on addresses may appear in one section, but cross-references to other related sections also are included. In order to make the document easier to use as a reference, the text contains some repetition from section to section.  Chapter 1 Chapter 1 describes the basic concepts about the Census TIGER data base and the TIGER/Line products. It discusses the topology in the Census TIGER data base, the terminology used to describe the geographic data, and the record types that make up the TIGER/Line  files. Chapter 1 also describes the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Spatial Data Transfer Standard (SDTS) nomenclature for geographic objects.  Chapter 2 Chapter 2 discusses the principle identification numbers forming the basis for record linkage discussed throughout the documentation.  Chapter 3 Chapter 3 discusses the attributes for the line, polygon, and landmark geographic objects.  Introduction I-7   Chapter 4 Chapter 4 defines the types of geographic entities and entity codes that appear in the TIGER/Line files. It also identifies the fundamental relationships among the different types of geographic entities.  Chapter 5 Chapter 5 summarizes the data quality aspects of the information in the Census TIGER data base using the SDTS quality modules.  Chapter 6 Chapter 6 lists the contents of the TIGER/Line file record types and provides a detailed description of the data fields in each.

The Bureaus Census TIGER System automates the mapping geographic activities required to support the decennial census survey programs of the Census Bureau starting with the 1990 census. The Census TIGER System provides support for the and related and sample decennial following:   Creation and maintenance of a digital geographic data base that includes complete coverage of the United States, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands of the United States, and the Pacific Island Territories  Production of maps from the Census TIGER data base for all Census Bureau enumeration and publication programs  Ability to assign individual addresses to geographic entities and census blocks based on polygons formed by features such as roads and streams The design of the Census TIGER data base adapts the theories of topology, graph theory, and associated fields of mathematics to provide a disciplined, mathematical description for the geographic structure of the United States and its territories. The topological structure of the Census TIGER data base defines the location and relationship of streets, rivers, railroads, and other features to each other and to the numerous geographic entities for which the Census Bureau tabulates data from its censuses and sample surveys. It is designed to ensure that there is no duplication of features or areas. The building of the Census TIGER data base involved a variety of encoding techniques such as automated map scanning, manual map digitizing, standard data keying, and sophisticated computer file matching. The goal was to provide automated access to, and retrieval of, relevant geographic information about the United States and its territories.  TIGER Data Base Extracts In order for others to use the information in the Census TIGER data base in a geographic information system (GIS) or for other geographic  Overview and Geographic Concepts 1-1   applications, the Census Bureau releases periodic extracts of the data base, including the TIGER/Line files, to the public. Various versions of the TIGER/Line files have been released; previous versions include the 1990 Census TIGER/Line files, and the 1992, 1994, and 1995 TIGER/Line files. The 1992 TIGER/Line files were produced to satisfy a requirement of the US Department of Education and incorporated all of the updates and revisions since the production of the 1990 TIGER/Line files. The 1994 TIGER/Line files were produced to support the programs of the US Department of Transportation, Bureau of Transportation Statistics. The 1995 TIGER/Line files were originally produced to support Phase I of the Census 2000 Redistricting Data Program.  Relationship of TIGER/Line    to 1990 Census Statistical Data  What makes the TIGER extract products particularly valuable in the GIS environment and to the data user community is the direct linkage between the 1990 decennial census data products and the Census TIGER data base extracts. The digital description in the TIGER data base of the Nations legal and statistical entities includes Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) codes and Census Bureau codes so entities can be easily matched with the 1990 census data. Please refer to the Census Bureau Publication, 1990 Census of Population and Housing Tabulation and Publication Program, for a description of the Public Law (PL) 94-171 data files, Summary Tape Files (STFs), and other sources of data from the 1990 census.  1997 TIGER/Line Files The 1997 TIGER/Line files include files for all counties and statistically equivalent entities in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Territories. The 1994 TIGER/Line files are provided for American Samoa because no updates have been received since 1994. The 1997 TIGER/Line files consist of line segments that represent physical features, and legal and statistical boundaries. The files consist of 17 separate record types, including the basic data record, the shape coord-inate points (feature shape records), and geographic area codes that can be used with appropriate software to prepare maps.  1- 2 1997 TIGER/Line Files   Related Files Summary Tape Files (STFs) provide 1990 statistical data for a wide range of subject headings and geographic entities compatible with the TIGER/ Line files. These files are available on tape and CD-ROM. PL 94-171 Program data files provide selected population data for small area geography (state, county, county subdivision, place, census tract/ block numbering area, block group, and block) and are compatible with the TIGER/Line files. These files are available on tape and CD-ROM. TIGER/SDTS is a data file following the FIPS spatial data transfer standard (SDTS). These files will provide data equivalent to the TIGER/ Line files with additional relational data linkages and data content more similar to the Census TIGER data base. The present product is an early prototype, and any subsequent version is likely to be substantially modified. The TIGER/Line 103rd Congressional District File contains just the features that form the boundaries of the districts of the 103rd Congress. The file follows the format of Record Types 1 and 2 of the 1992 TIGER/ Line files. This is a national data set, by state, on one CD-ROM. TIGER/Line 1990 County Files provide the coordinates for the boundaries of all counties and statistically equivalent entities. This is a national data set, by state, on one CD-ROM. The files follow the format of Record Types 1 and 2 of the 1992 TIGER/Line files. The boundaries for the states and statistically equivalent areas are for the legal limits. As such, coastal states show a boundary that is three miles offshore and do not contain addi-tional records that depict the shoreline. The same holds true for interior water; a boundary in the Chesapeake Bay will be shown, but the shore-line will not. TIGER/Line1990 Census Tract/Block Numbering Area Files provide the coordinates and associated feature attributes for the boundaries of all census tract/block numbering areas (CT/BNAs). This is a national data set, by state, on one CD-ROM. The files follow the format of Record Types 1 and 2 of the 1992 TIGER/Line files.  Overview and Geographic Concepts 1-3   North American Statistical Areas Boundary Files (Prototype), were produced by a joint research initiative between the Geography Divisions of Statistics Canada and the United States Bureau of the Census. The goal of the files is to provide data users with a convenient, unified, geographical framework that will help facilitate cross-border spatial studies. The files are in TIGER/Line format and contain geographic coordinates, various attribute information, and most importantly, geographic identification codes that can be used as links to census data from Canada and the United States. TIGER/Line American Indian/Alaska Native Areas File provides the coordinates for the boundaries of all American Indian and Alaska Native areas (AIANAs) shown in the 1990 census. This file follows the format of Record Types 1 and 2 of the 1992 TIGER/Line files and covers the Nation. TIGER/Line 1990 County Subdivision Files provide the coordinates for the boundaries of all county subdivisions (such as minor civil divisions, census county divisions, and unorganized territory). This is a national data set, by state, on one CD-ROM. The files follow the format of Record Types 1 and 2 of the 1992 TIGER/ Line files. TIGER/Line 1990 Place Files provide the aries of all incorporated places (including census designated places (CDPs). This is a one CD-ROM. The files follow the format the 1992 TIGER/Line files. coordinates for the boundconsolidated cities) and national data set, by state, on of Record Types 1 and 2 of  County-Based Files The geographic coverage for a TIGER/Line file is a county or statistically equivalent entity. See Appendix A for a list of state and county codes and Chapter 4 for a description of county equivalent entities. The county files have a coverage area based on the latest legal boundaries obtained in response to the Census Bureaus Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS). Even though the Census TIGER data base represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, the county-based TIGER/Line files are designed to  1- 4 1997 TIGER/Line Files   stand alone as an independent data set. The files can be combined to cover the whole Nation and its territories (see the Single-Side Flags and County Boundaries section in Chapter 3).  The Data Content of the TIGER/Line Files The TIGER/Line files contain data describing three major types of features:  Line features 1) Roads 2) Railroads 3) Hydrography 4) Miscellaneous transportation features and selected power lines and pipe lines 5) Boundaries   Landmark features 1) Point landmarks such as schools and churches 2) Area landmarks such as parks and cemeteries 3) Key geographic locations (KGLs) such as apartment buildings and factories   Polygon features 1) Geographic entity codes for areas used to tabulate the 1990 census statistical data and current geographic areas 2) Locations of area landmarks 3) Locations of KGLs  The line feature and polygon information form the majority of data in the TIGER/Line files. Some of the data describing the lines include coordinates, feature identifiers (names), feature classification codes, address ranges, and geographic entity codes. Chapter 3 details these data items; Chapter 4 defines the geographic entities and codes. The TIGER/Line files contain point and area labels that describe landmark features. These features provide locational references for field staff and map users. Area landmarks consist of a feature name or label and feature type assigned to a polygon or group of polygons. Landmarks may overlap or  Overview and Geographic Concepts 1-5   refer to the same set of polygons. See Chapter 3 for more information on landmark data.  Topology and Spatial Objects in the TIGER/Line Files Spatial Objects in the TIGER/Line Files The Census TIGER data base uses a collection of spatial objects, points, lines, and polygons, to model or describe real-world geography. The Census Bureau uses these spatial objects to represent features such as streets, and assigns attributes to these features to identify and describe specific features such as the 500 block of Market Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The TIGER/Line files contain information about the spatial objects distributed over a series of record types. Users of the TIGER/Line files may need to link information from several record types to find all the attributes of interest that belong to one spatial object. The final section of this chapter includes a description of the record types.  Topology Topology explains how points, lines, and areas relate to each other and is used as the foundation for organizing spatial objects in the Census TIGER data base. The Census TIGER data base uses points, lines, and areas to provide a disciplined, mathematical description of the features of the earths surface. Spatial objects in the Census TIGER data base are interrelated. A sequence of points define line segments, and line segments connect to define polygons. Topology provides a basic language for describing geographic features. The Census TIGER data base relates information to points or 0-cells, lines or 1-cells, and polygons or 2-cells. The number preceding the cell identifies the dimensionality of the object; for instance, a line segment has a single dimension, length. Each of these objects builds on the others to form higher-level objects. The 0-cells form the end points of 1-cells. The 1-cells connect at 0-cells and form closed figures that partition space into polygons or 2-cells.  1- 6 1997 TIGER/Line Files   Terminology The terms point, line segment, and polygon are familiar, but general terms that may have different meanings to data users working with a variety of different applications and data sets. The TIGER/Line file documentation uses the terminology from the Spatial Data Transfer Standard (SDTS). Since the first release of the TIGER/Line files, the US Geological Survey (USGS) has coordinated the development and release of the SDTS, now a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS). The SDTS specifies a series of terms and definitions for spatial objects. Why use the SDTS terminology? Even though the TIGER/Line files do not follow the SDTS format, the TIGER/Line documentation will use these terms and definitions in order to promote a common language for describing geographic data and to facilitate the transition to the SDTS. T he spatial objects in TIGER/Line belong to the Geometry and  Topology (GT) class of objects in SDTS. The definitions are from FIPS Publication 173, Spatial Data Transfer Standard (SDTS) (August 28, 1992) Section 2-2, Classification and Intended Use of Objects, pp. 11-20. Node A zero-dimensional object that is a topological junction of two or more links or chains, or an end point of a link or chain, is a node . Entity Point A point used for identifying the location of point features (or areal features collapsed to a point), such as towers, buoys, buildings, places, etc. Complete Chain A chain [a sequence of non-intersecting line segments] that explicitly references left and right polygons and start and end nodes. The shape points combine with the nodes to form the segments that make a complete chain .  Overview and Geographic Concepts 1-7   Network Chains A chain that explicitly references start and end nodes and not left and right polygons. GT-Polygon An area that is an atomic two-dimensional component of a two-dimensional manifold, [which is defined as] one and only one planar graph and its two-dimensional objects. GT-polygons are elementary poly-gons that are mutually exclusive and completely exhaust the surface.  Spatial Objects The spatial objects in the TIGER/Line files embody both geometry (coordinate location and shape) and topology (the relationship between points, line objects, and polygons) and therefore belong to the geometry and topology (GT) class of objects in the SDTS. In the SDTS, nodes represent point objects (0-cells) that identify the start and end position of lines or 1-dimensional objects (1-cells) called chains. The chains in the TIGER/ Line  files are complete chains because they form polygon boundaries and intersect other chains only at nodes. Topological chains that do not con-tain polygon information are network chains. Data users may choose not to use the polygon or geographic entity codes and consider the TIGER/ Line files a source of network chain data. Figure 1-1 illustrates the relationship between nodes and complete chains. The figure shows two complete chains forming a central road; a start and end node define each complete chain. Complete chains that meet at an intersection share the same node. As the figure suggests, complete chains may consist of one or more line segments that describe the shape and position of the complete chain. Shape points define the line segments and are not part of the topology of the TIGER/Line files. Shape points and the resulting line segments are attributes of the complete chains. When complete chains link node to node and form a closed figure (a 2-cell), a GT-polygon results. The GT-polygon containing Friendship Park in Figure 1-1 is bounded by five complete chains that share five nodes. GT-polygons are elementary units; they are not subdivided into smaller polygons. The polygons completely encompass the area  1- 8 1997 TIGER/Line Files   Figure 1-1 Basic TIGER/Line File Topology The illustration below shows a generalized block that consists of three GT-polygons (GT stands for geometry and topology). The block contains a point landmark (Parkside School) inside GT-polygon 2 and an area landmark (Friendship Park) that is coextensive with GT-polygon 3.

Overview and Geographic Concepts 1-9   they represent and there is no gap or overlap between adjacent polygons. The geographic entities and area landmarks in the TIGER/Line files are associated with one, or a set of GT-polygons. The TIGER/Line files contain point landmark data that are not included in the Census TIGER data base topology. Point landmarks are entity points that mark the location of points of interest and are not connected to complete chains or GT-polygons. The following table summarizes the terms for spatial objects in the TIGER/Line files: Point (0-cell) Topology Non-topology Attribute Node Entity Point Shape Point Line (1-cell) Complete Chain or Network Chain Polygon (2-cell) GT-polygon  Features The Census TIGER data base uses the term feature to informally describe spatial objects more complex than nodes, complete chains, or GT-polygons. For instance, Main Street is a feature that may consist of a series of complete chains with the same name. The Census TIGER data base contains complete chains, but does not contain features or link complete chains to features.  Left- and Right-Side Data Fields If one is standing on a complete chain at the start node facing the end node, data listed in the fields carrying a right qualifier would be found to the right of the complete chain. Notice the position of the start and end nodes for the road in the central section of Figure 1-1; the rightside of the complete chain corresponds to GT-polygon 1 and the leftside corresponds to GT-polygon 2. From the information contained in this basic record, data users can collect the complete chains necessary to construct intersecting polygons and features.  1- 10 1997 TIGER/Line  Files   Single-Layer Topology All spatial objects in the TIGER/Line files exist in a single data layer that includes roads, hydrography, railroads, boundary lines, and miscellaneous features; they are topologically linked. For instance, nodes mark the intersections of roads and rivers. Subsurface features such as tunnels or above surface features such as bridges also create nodes when they cross surface features even though there is no direct realworld connection.  Introduction to the TIGER/Line File Structure The 1997 TIGER/Line files are extracts of selected information from the Census TIGER data base, organized as topologically consistent networks. The records in these TIGER/Line files represent features traditionally found on a paper map. Each complete chain is classified by codes that describe the type of feature it represents. The 1997 TIGER/Line files consist of 17 record types that collectively contain geographic information (attributes) such as address ranges and ZIP Codes and their Add-On codes for street complete chains, names, feature classification codes, codes for legal and statistical entities, latitude/longitude coordinates of linear and point features, landmark features, area landmarks, key geographic features, and area and polygon boundaries. A separate file exists for each of the 17 record types for each county or county equivalent. The file for each county (or equivalent) is identified by the state and county FIPS code after the tgr in the file name (for example, tgr42107.rt1). The suffixes used for the record type files have been changed to make it easier to identify each record type file (when working with uncompressed versions of the county files). The TIGER/Line data dictionary in Chapter 6 contains a complete list of all the fields in the 17 record types. Separate chapters cross-list the fields by feature attribute and geographic entity type. The next section provides a summary of 1997 TIGER/Line file record types.  Overview and Geographic Concepts 1-11   1997 TIGER/Line    File Record Types  Record Type 1 -- Complete Chain Basic Data Record Record Type 1 provides a single record for each unique complete chain in the TIGER/Line files. The basic data record contains the end nodes for the complete chain. This record also contains address ranges and ZIP Codes (for most areas of the country where a street name/house numbering system existed at the time of data extraction from the Census TIGER data base) and the current census geographic entity codes for each side of the complete chain. Additional feature identifier, address range, and ZIP Code data related to Record Type 1 are found on Record Types 4, 5, 6, and Z. Additional current and 1990 geographic entity codes related to Record Type 1 are found on Record Type 3.  Record Type 2 -- Complete Chain Shape Coordinates Record Type 2 provides an additional series of latitude and longitude coordinate values describing the shape of each complete chain in Record Type 1 that is not a straight line segment. Record Type 2 has a many-to-one relationship with Record Type 1.  Record Type 3 -- Complete Chain Geographic Entity Codes Record Type 3 includes the 1990 voting district (VTD) codes provided to the Census Bureau for the 1990 Census Redistricting Data Program. It also includes the current Census Bureau geographic area codes for the American Indian/TJSA/TDSA/ANVSA areas, and the Alaska Native Regional Corporations. It also includes 1990 geographic codes for a variety of geographic area types. In the 1994 and later TIGER/Line files, all references to the 1980 geographic area codes have been eliminated. In addition, many fields have been replaced with the geographic area codes that were used to tabulate the 1990 census. These codes were previously in Record Type 1. Record Type 3 has a one-to-one relationship with Record Type 1. To identify the 1990 census state and county codes for a complete chain, one must use Record Type 3.  1- 12 1997 TIGER/Line  Files   Record Type 4 -- Index to Alternate Feature Identifiers Record Type 4 provides an index to alternate feature names associated with the complete chain (Record Type 1). A Record Type 4 will not exist for a Record Type 1 that has only one name. A complete chain can have more than one alternate name. Record Type 4 has a many-toone relationship with Record Type 1 and a many-to-one relationship with Record Type 5.  Record Type 5 -- Complete Chain Feature Identifiers Record Type 5 contains a list of all unique feature names for complete chains in the TIGER/Line files. Each name (or feature identifier) has an identification code number (FEAT). Record Type 5 has a oneto-many relationship with Record Type 4 and a one-to-many relationship with Record Type 9.  Record Type 6 -- Additional Address Range and ZIP Code Data Record Type 6 provides additional address range information for a street complete chain when the information cannot be presented as a single address range (for example, the house/building numbers are not uniformly arranged to form an address range). Record Type 6 appears only for those counties that have address ranges and ZIP Code information in the Census TIGER data base. There is no assurance that the address ranges provided on Record Type 6 will cover fewer addresses than the address ranges appearing on Record Type 1. Data users must use Record Type 6 to obtain the entire picture of the potential address ranges along a complete chain. The address ranges used for geocoding along corporate corridors and corporate offset limits appear only in Record Type 6. Record Type 6 has a many-to-one relationship with Record Type 1 and a one-toone relationship with Record Type Z.  Record Type 7 -- Landmark Features Record Type 7 contains the area and point landmarks from the Census TIGER data base. If Record Type 7 represents an area landmark rather than a point landmark, then a one-to-one relationship exists with Record  Overview and Geographic Concepts 1-13   Type 8. If a county file has no or 8 will exist for that county. graphic locations (KGLs) that have a ZIP+4 Add-On code.  landmarks, empty files for Record Types 7 Record Type 7 now excludes all key geocontain an actual or imputed address and These will now appear in Record Type 9.  Record Type 8 -- Polygons Linked to Area Landmarks Record Type 8 links the polygon identification codes with the area landmark identification codes. If a county file does not have any area landmarks in Record Type 7, there will be no Type 8 records. Record Type 8 has a many-to-many relationship with Record Type P.  Record Type 9 -- Key Geographic Location Features Record Type 9 consists only of KGLs in the Census TIGER  data base that have an actual or imputed address and a ZIP+4  Add-On code. This record type lists the names and structure numbers of special geocoding addresses such as named apartment buildings, shopping centers, and airports. If the structure number of the special geocoding address is a street address, then the FEAT field links Record Type 9 to Record Type 5 where the street name associated with the address is listed. The KGLs contained in this record type are not included in Record Types 7 or 8, and have no LAND (landmark identification number). Record Type 9 has a many-to-one relationship with Record Type P.  Record Type A -- Polygon Geographic Entity Codes Record Type A contains a record for each polygon represented by Record Type P in the TIGER/Line files. The Census Bureau provides the basic 1990 census geographic entity codesstate, county, county subdivision, place, American Indian/Alaska Native Areas, census tract/BNA, block on this record type to assist data users who are interested only in polygon information. Record Type A also includes the Census Transportation Planning Package Area code, school district codes, and urban/rural classification information, as well as fields for the 106th and 108th Congressional Districts (which are blank for this release).  1- 14 1997 TIGER/Line  Files   Record Type C -- Geographic Entity Names Record Type C provides information previously supplied in the TIGER/Geographic NameTM files. A unique list of all geographic codes, their associated name, and some entity attributes is supplied for data users in a flat (nonhierarchical) file. It contains a FIPS Year field that may have three values: 90 for geographic names and codes valid for the 1990 census, 9n (where 9n is the year of extraction from the Census TIGER data base) for geographic names and codes valid for the current year, or blank when the geographic names and codes are the same as for 1990 and 199n. Multiple records for the same geographic entity show its change or correction over time. Record Type C is linked to other record types (1, 3, A, S) through geographic area codes.  Record Type H -- TIGER/Line ID History Record Type H provides the history of each TIGER/Line ID when complete chains (Record Type 1) are split or merged, but the source of the change will be blank for this version. Record Type H shows the TLIDs of the complete chains in existence after the split or prior to the merge.  Record Type I -- Link Between Complete Chains and Polygons Record Type I links Record Type 1, the complete chain basic data, to Record Type P, the polygon internal point. The Record Type I to Record Type 1 link (TLID) may be used to link complete chain attributes and other data record types (2, 3, 4, 6, H, and Z) to each other. The Record I to Record Type P link (CENID and POLYID) may be used to link polygon attributes and other data record types (8, 9, A, and S) to each other. Record Type I has a one-to-one relationship with Record Type 1, but a many-toone relationship with Record Type P. When Record Type I is linked to a single-sided Record Type 1 (county boundary), it will provide only the left- or the right-polygon identifier.  Record Type P -- Polygon Internal Point There is a Record Type P for every polygon in the TIGER/Line files. Record Type P has a one-to-many relationship with Record Type I  Overview and Geographic Concepts 1-15   and identifies the internal point coordinates for each polygon. See the Internal Points section in Chapter 3. The TIGER/Line files include all complete chains and polygons in the Census TIGER data base. The topology of the Census TIGER data base ensures that a one-to-one relationship exists between the polygons constructed from Record Types 1 and 2 and Record Type P.  Record Type R -- TIGER/Line ID Record Number Range Record Type R contains the range of unique complete chain record numbers (TLIDs) assigned to a census file in a nationwide scheme. Record Type R has the lowest (minimum allowable), and the highest (maximum allowable) record numbers for the range. Numbers are assigned to complete chains beginning at the lowest value. The current number is the highest record number for the census file used. Each TIGER/Line file consists of an entire county or statistical equivalent. In the Census TIGER data base, the county or statistical equivalent may be split into many partitions. The Census Bureau assigns permanent record numbers to each of these partitions. These record numbers are found in Record Type R. Record Type R is not directly linked to any other record type.  Record Type S -- Polygon Additional Geographic Entity Codes Record Type S contains a record for each polygon represented by Record Type P in the TIGER/Line files. Record Type S contains geographic area codes that identify polygons. Most of the geographic area codes reflect current geography as of the time of extraction from the Census TIGER data base. Except for Hawaii, Record Type S contains no CDP information since CDPs are considered part of the 1990 census geography, not current geography.  Record Type Z -- ZIP+4 Codes Record Type Z provides Postal +4 Add-On codes that make ZIP+4 codes out of the ZIP Codes on Type 1 and Type 6 records. Record Type Z has a one-to-one relationship with Record Type 1 and a oneto-one relationship with Record Type 6.  1- 16 1997 TIGER/Line  Files   The Relationship Between Spatial Objects and TIGER/Line Record Types    The TIGER/Line files do not have specific record types for each spatial object. Nodes, for example, do not have a separate record type; node coordinates appear with other data in Record Type 1. Defining a complete chain requires information from Record Types 1, 2, and I. Record Types 1 and 2 alone describe the set of network chains. GT-polygons require the combined information of Record Types 1, 2, I, and P. See Chapter 3 for a discussion on how to link data using different types of spatial objects.  Linkages Between Record Types All the record types except Record Type R contain fields (such as TLID, FEAT, CENID, POLYID, LAND, or a geographic area code) that are used to link together data from the record types. Chapter 2 discusses the TLID, CENID, POLYID, and LAND identification codes in detail. Figure 1-2 shows the record linkage keys. When different record types have a common key with the same data, a linkage can be made between the records. Some of the links are direct, while others are indirect and require a connection through an intermediate record type. An entire TIGER/Line file can be navigated using the record linkage keys. Linkages may be made to data external to a TIGER/Line file. Record Types 1, 3, A, and S contain geographic area code keysthe current or 1990 census geographic entity codesthat may be linked to the Census Bureaus statistical data (the PL 94-171 data and the several Summary Tape Files or STFs). For the PL 94-171 data and STFs based on 1990 census data, one must use Record Type 3 or Record Type A. With geographic information systems for processing and display, data users can use the geographic area codes to link data tabulations with the geographic data.

All record types have a 4-character field for the version code. For releases after TIGER/Line 1995, including this release, the version code is assigned as MMYY which represents the month and year that the file was created. The month and year are currently extracted from the system date as each county file is created. This means that county files created for the same program are likely to have different version codes. This will make it easier for users to determine the latest version of the data if they have several versions of the TIGER/Line files for a county. The version codes for earlier releases of the TIGER/Line files are as follows: 0000 -- TIGER/Line Precensus File, 1990 0002 -- TIGER/Line Initial Voting District Codes File, 1990 0003 -- TIGER/Line Census File, 1990 0005 -- TIGER/Line File, 1992 0021 -- TIGER/Line File, 1994 0024 -- TIGER/Line File, 1995  TIGER/Line Identification Number (TLID) The TIGER/Line files use a permanent 10-digit TIGER/Line record identification number (TLID) to uniquely identify a complete chain for the Nation.  TLID Codes The 10-digit TLID will not exceed the value 231  1 (2,147,483,647) and will represent the same complete chain in all versions of this file, beginning with the TIGER/Line Precensus Files, 1990. The minimum value is 100,001. Topological changes to the complete chain will cause the TLIDs to change. For instance, when updates split an existing complete chain, each of the new parts receives a new TLID; the old TLID is not reused.  Version Code and Identification Numbers 2- 1   As distributed, TIGER/Line files are grouped by county (or equivalent). A complete chain representing a segment of the boundary between two neighboring counties will have different TLID codes even though the complete chain represents the exact same feature on the ground. See the section, User-Defined Changes to the TIGER/Line  Files , in this chapter. Record Type R contains the range of unique complete chain record numbers assigned to a census file in a nationwide scheme. Record Type R has the lowest (minimum) and the highest (maximum) record numbers for the range. Permanent record numbers are assigned within each partition of the Census TIGER data base. Numbers are assigned to complete chains beginning at the minimum value and increasing the current value by one until it reaches the maximum value. Record Type H, which first appeared in the 1994 version, shows the history of a particular TLID, whether combined or split, and its predecessors or successors.  TLID Record Locations The TLID field appears in columns 6 through 15 of the following record types:     Record Record Record Record Type Type Type Type 1 2 3 4  Record Type 6  Record Type I  Record Type Z  The TLID field appears in columns 11 through 20 in Record Type H.  TLID Record Linkages The TLID field provides a key for linking records containing primary attributes describing the complete chain or the geographic entity codes associated with the left and the right sides of the complete chain. Record Type I contains the key fields required to link the TLID and the GT-polygon identification fields, CENID and POLYID. See Figure 1-2 in Chapter 1.  2- 2 1997 TIGER/Line Files   TLID Sort Sequence Each record type is a separate file. The records in each record type do not have an overall sort sequence. Data users may wish to sort the file by TLID in order to facilitate record linkages.  User-Defined Changes to the TIGER/Line Files TLID as a Standard Identification Number Users should store the record number and the version code associated with each complete chain in their local systems to ensure their ability to match records with earlier or later versions of the TIGER/Line files. The record and version numbers of each complete chain provide an important link to the corresponding complete chain in the Census TIGER data base. This key will allow users to transfer new information from later Census Bureau TIGER/Line releases into their data base, and to provide the Census Bureau with readily usable updates, should they wish to do so.  Feature Changes Users should assign a new record number (TLID) and a version number with a value greater than 5000 to each new complete chain they create in order to avoid duplicating a Census Bureau-assigned record number that may appear elsewhere in the national file. Users should create a new record for each new complete chain, including those formed when a new intersection splits an existing complete chain. If a complete chain has been assigned different feature identifiers, attributes, and/or coordinate positions without being merged with or split from another complete chain, it is a modified complete chain and does not need a new TLID. Users may wish to mark these changes; the Census Bureau will use this information to identify changes more quickly and accurately. Users should assign a version code equal to 4999 for all deleted complete chain and landmark records. This version code will allow the Census Bureau to positively identify all user deletions. Users may assign or reassign polygon and landmark identification numbers in any manner that uniquely identifies each within a file.  Version Code and Identification Numbers 2- 3   TIGER/Line Polygon Identification Numbers (CENID, POLYID) The Census Bureau uses two fields, the census file identification code (CENID) and the polygon identification code (POLYID), to uniquely identify GT-polygons. The CENID is a Census Bureau alphanumeric identifier used to uniquely number the GT-polygons within its TIGER partitions. CENIDs are a recode of the FIPS state and county codes for the partitions (files) that form the national Census TIGER data base. Since the partitions may include only a portion of a county, the TIGER/Line files may contain multiple CENIDs. The polygon identification number (POLYID) is a temporary number assigned to every polygon in the Census TIGER data base. Although this number is part of the data base design, it is a dynamic number and can change between different versions of the TIGER/Line files. The Census TIGER data base does not contain permanent identifiers for GT-polygons as it does for complete chains. POLYID is unique only within CENID; in cases where a TIGER/Line file contains more than one CENID, the POLYID may not be unique within that file. Within each CENID, the value for the POLYID starts with 1 and increments sequentially until all polygons are numbered.  CENID and POLYID Codes In the 1992 and 1994 versions of the TIGER/Line files, the CENID is a 5-digit numeric code. In the 1995 TIGER/Line files and the 1997 TIGER/Line files, the CENID is a 5-character alpha-numeric code to allow for a wider range of codes without increasing field length. Record Type R contains a list of all valid CENIDs used in each county TIGER/Line file. The POLYID code is an integer identification number, without leading zeros, applied to each GT-polygon. The POLYID with a value of 1 refers to the universal polygon, the polygon that refers to all space outside a county coverage area and is excluded from Record Types A, I, P, and S.  2- 4 1997 TIGER/Line Files   The range of POLYID numbers in a county file may contain gaps or skipped numbers resulting from the use of one partition (CENID) for more than one TIGER/Line county file. POLYID numbers also may duplicate in a single TIGER/Line  file as they are unique only within CENID. A single TIGER/Line file may contain CENID information from many other census files. Either the CENIDL and POLYIDL, or CENIDR and POLYIDR fields in Record Type I will have a blank value where the complete chain is a county boundary.  CENID and POLYID Record Locations The CENID and POLYID fields appear in the following record types:  Record Type 8  Records exist only for area landmark GT-polygons  Record Type 9  Records exist for all KGLs  Record Type A  Records exist for all GT-polygons  Record Type I  Contains left- and right-side CENIDs and POLYIDs associated with each complete chain  Record Type P  Records exist for all GT-polygons  Record Type R  Contains only CENID; Record Type R lists the minimum and maximum possible TLIDs, and the highest TLID from each census file (CENID) used to generate the current version of the TIGER/Line  files.  Record Type S  Records exist for all GT-polygons  CENID and POLYID Record Linkages The TIGER/Line files use both the CENID and POLYID fields to link all of the polygon record types together (Record Types A, P, and S), to link the GT-polygons to the associated complete chains, and to link area landmarks to GT-polygons (see Figure 1-2, in Chapter 1). The CENID and POLYID fields link the geographic area codes in Record Types A and S to Record Type P which contains the coordinates for an internal point in the GT-polygon. The TIGER/Line files include a Type A and a Type S record for each Type P record.  Version Code and Identification Numbers 2- 5   Record Type I provides a link between the GT-polygon records and the record types containing complete chain attributes (Record Types 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6). Each Type I record identifies a complete chain by TLID with a left- and right-side GT-polygon. Here CENIDL and POLYIDL contain the CENID and POLYID codes for the GT-polygon on the left side of the line. Likewise, CENIDR and POLYIDR contain the CENID and POLYID codes for the GT-polygon on the right side of the line. There is a Type I record for each Type 1 record. All CENID and POLYID codes appear in Record Type I. To find all of the complete chains that form the boundary of a specific GT-polygon, search Record Type I for a match with either the left or the right CENID and POLYID. Where the left and the right CENID and POLYID codes are the same, the complete chain is internal to the GTpolygon (e.g., a dead-end street). Record Type 8 provides a link between the GT-polygons and the landmark feature records. See the section, TIGER/Line  Landmark Identification Numbers, in this chapter.  CENID and POLYID Sort Sequence The POLYID codes appear in numeric sequence by alphanumeric CENID in Record Types 9, A, P, and S. There is no systematic CENID or POLYID sequence in Record Type I.  TIGER/Line Landmark Identification Numbers (LAND) The landmark feature identification number (LAND ) is a 10-digit number that uniquely identifies both point and area landmarks within each county file. LAND is not a permanent number; the Census Bureau assigns LANDs each time a new version of the TIGER/Line files is produced. Within each county, LANDs are assigned beginning with 1 and are incremented sequentially until all features are numbered. In rare situations, Record Type 7 may list the same LAND number more than once if the landmark has more than one feature name.  2- 6 1997 TIGER/Line Files   Each name appears as a separate data record in Record Type 7. These data records describe the same landmark and have the same LAND. Overlapping landmarks (e.g., a pond located in a park) may cause more than one name to be assigned to a GT-polygon. However, overlapping landmarks are separate features with different LANDs.  LAND Codes The LAND is an integer number that does not contain leading zeros. It is assigned during the extraction of the data and is not a permanent number. There may be gaps in the sequence of the LANDs in Record Type 7 because of the way this information is extracted.  LAND Record Locations The LAND field appears in the following record types:  Record Type 7  Landmark attributes  Record Type 8  Linkage record containing the LAND and the CENID and POLYID fields  LAND Record Linkages Record Type 8 links each area landmarks LAND with a CENID and POLYID. Each area landmark will have one or more Type 8 records that together identify all of the GT-polygons that make up the landmark.  LAND Sort Sequence Record Type 7 and 8 contain records sorted in ascending order by LAND. In Record Type 8, each LAND is repeated for each GT-polygon covered by the area landmark.  Version Code and Identification Numbers 2- 7    Chapter 3: Attributes of Geographic Objects Line Features Line features consist of one or more complete chains that share common attributes such as feature identifiers, address ranges, and census feature class descriptions.  Feature Identifiers The feature identification fields contain either a general type label or a specific proper name assigned to a complete chain that identifies the feature. Each complete chain that is a part of a named feature, such as US Highway 1, has the same feature identifier. The TIGER/Line files use several related data fields to provide a structured description of the feature identifier:     Feature Feature Feature Feature Direction Prefix (e.g., N Adams Ave) Name (e.g., US Highway 1 , Jefferson St) Type (Roosevelt Blvd, Mangosteen River) Direction Suffix (e.g., Providence St NE)  Most named street/highway features have a feature type. Numerous exceptions exist; for example, Broadway consists of a feature name with no type specified. Do not confuse feature types that form proper names with the census feature classification scheme. In the Census TIGER data base, feature names are assigned to line features independently of the census feature class codes (CFCCs) of the line features. For example, major airports usually have an express highway leading to the terminal area. This highway does not have an interstate highway name such as I-95, but may have the CFCC of an interstate highway (A11) because it has the same characteristics as an interstate highway (limited access with separated, multiple lanes). The feature identifiers of line features that are roads may include either a direction prefix or suffix. Some may have both a direction prefix and suffix.  A   The feature name fields for line features that are roads may contain both a name and a feature type. For all hydrography and non-road features, the feature type will follow the feature name in the feature name field. In some instances, the feature type is commonly considered part of the name and is combined with the feature name in the TIGER/Line files to avoid confusion; for example, US Hwy 1. The Census TIGER System identifies US Hwy as a feature type used as a prefix to the name and 1 as the feature name. The feature types, such as US Highway, State Highway, and Interstate that normally precede the name appear in the name field. Generic feature identifiers have a name listed in the names field, but do not have a feature type or direction. Some examples of generic names include ramp, power line, and reservoir. Generic feature identifiers are selectively added to features that do not have proper names. In most cases, complete chains without proper names have no feature identifier. The TIGER/Line files do not support a data level above the complete chain that allows the construction of higher level objects (features). Complete chains with the same name may represent separate features; for example, a county may contain several Main Streets located in different geographic entities (e.g., towns or cities) scattered throughout the county. The ability to group chains together to include the entire length of a street feature, such as US Route 66, depends on the uniqueness of the identifiers and the consistency of the feature identifiers along the length of the feature. The Census Bureau makes no guarantee that the complete chains have uniform names or contain all of the known feature identifiers. The Census Bureau has taken steps to improve the consistency of feature identifiers and to add feature identifiers to fill in gaps along street features. The Census Bureau also has eliminated some alternate spellings in favor of the spelling confirmed by the ZIP+4 file of the US Postal Service. The census feature class codes (CFCCs) may vary for chains with the same feature identifier. For example, the most frequent CFCC for a state highway is A21, but the complete chains marking the location of State Highway 32 may have a CFCC of A01, A21, or A31 (see the Census Feature Class Codes section in this chapter).  3- 2 1997 TIGER/Line Files   The TIGER/Line file structure allows up to 4,996 feature identifiers for a complete chain. The primary feature identifier appears in Record Type 1. For street features, the primary feature identifier is usually the name most commonly associated with the address range. Up to five alternate feature identifiers are cross-referenced in each Type 4 record, and a single complete chain can have up to 999 Type 4 records. Alternate feature identifiers include highway designation numbers for named streets, former names, and alternate spellings where source material provided conflicting data. Where the complete chain represents a limited access highway, the highway type and route designator, such as I-95, should ideally become the primary name, and the local designation, such as Cross County Expressway or Capital Beltway, should become the alternate name. However, this is not always true in the TIGER/Line files. The primary and alternate feature identifiers can be independent of each other. There is no assurance that the same combination of primary and alternate feature identifiers will appear together in a sequence of complete chains. There also is no assurance that a feature identifier will consistently appear as the primary identifier; it might be recorded as an alternate feature identifier for some complete chains and a primary feature identifier for others. During TIGER improvement operations, the Census Bureau has taken steps to make the Interstate highway route designator the primary feature identifier for Interstate highways, and the common street name used in mail delivery the primary name on all other roads. The order of identifiers follows this hierarchy: Interstate highway, common name, US highway, county highway, with town and township road at the bottom of the list. Record Type 5 contains a record for each feature identifier used as either a primary or an alternate name. The TIGER/Line files link the alternate names in Record Type 5 to Record Type 1 through the use of the alternate feature identification code index that forms Record Type 4. See the Feature Identifier Record Linkage section in this chapter.

See Appendix DStandard Abbreviations.  Feature Types The feature type field for road features consists of a 4-character text string. For all hydrography and non-road features, the feature type will follow the feature name in the feature name field. The abbreviations in Appendix DStandard Abbreviations may appear in the feature type field or the feature name field. Data Limitations and Notes In earlier versions of the TIGER/Line files, users did not find many roads with alternate names in the GBF/ DIME-File coverage areas; if an alternate name was provided, it usually represented another local name and not a route number. TIGER  improvement operations have since added route identifiers to many of these areas. Corporate Corridors and Corporate Offset Boundaries A corporate corridor is a narrow, linear part of an incorporated place (or in a few instances, another legal entity). The corporate corridor includes the street and/or right-of-way, or a portion of the street and/or right-ofway within the incorporated place. It excludes from the incorporated place those structures such as houses, apartments, or businesses that front along the street or road. A corporate limit offset boundary exists where the incorporated place lies on one side of the street and may include all or part of the street or right-of-way, but excludes from the incorporated place, the structures located along that side of the street. See Figure 4-4 in Chapter 4. To facilitate address coding, the Census TIGER data base contains duplicate street name and address ranges on complete chains with a CFCC of F11 (nonvisible offset boundary) or F12 (nonvisible corporate corridor). The duplicate street names for the F11 and F12 features are on Record Type 5; the duplicate address ranges are on Record Type 6. Record Type 1 will not contain feature identifiers for complete chains with CFCCs of F11 or F12.  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3- 5   Feature Identifier Record Linkage Record Type 4 provides the link required to find any alternate feature identifiers belonging to a complete chain. Record Type 4 cross-references each TLID with an Alternate Feature ID code (FEAT) assigned to each record in Record Type 5. Record Type 5 contains all feature identifiers including those that are used only as primary identifiers. However, only the FEATs for complete chains that have alternate feature identifiers appear in Record Type 4. Complete chains that have no alternate feature identifier will have no Type 4 record. To find the alternate feature identifiers for a complete chain, begin by determining the TLID for the complete chain. Then search for this TLID in Record Type 4. If the complete chain has any alternate feature identifiers, Record Type 4 should provide at least one record. Once found, the Record Type 4 entries will each contain from one to five FEAT numbers. The FEAT fields are blank when no further alternative identifiers exist. The first FEAT field (FEAT1) should always have a valid FEAT number. Finally, find the records in the Record Type 5 file that match the FEAT codes from Record Type 4. The TIGER/ Line file provides a record sequence number to identify multiple Type 4 records that might exist for one TLID. Even though Record Type 4 contains only users cannot link all ated complete chains Type 5 contains all feature identifiers, Record references for alternate feature identifiers.

A FEAT is assigned sequentially, beginning with 1, to each feature identifier in Record Type 5. The FEAT is not a permanent identification number. TLID is the record identifier for the complete chain. See Chapter 2 for a full discussion of TLIDs. RTSQ is a 3-digit integer that uniquely identifies multiple Type 4 records with the same TLID. RTSQ equals 1 for the first occurrence of a TLID in Record Type 4 and can reach a maximum of 999 for subsequent occurrences.  Address Ranges and ZIP Codes    The TIGER/Line files contain address ranges, not individual addresses. The term address range refers to the first possible structure number and the last possible structure number along a complete chain side relative to the direction in which the complete chain is coded. The address ranges in the TIGER/Line files are predominantly potential ranges that include the full range of possible structure numbers even though the actual structures might not exist. The address numbers used to create the address ranges are commonly known as city-style addresses. A city-style address minimally consists of a structure number, street name, and a 5-digit ZIP Code; for example, 213Main St 90210. In the TIGER/Line files, the ZIP Codes usually appear only on those complete chains that have address ranges identified. However, they may appear on some road features without the address ranges.  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3- 7   An address range also may have the full 9-digit ZIP Code that includes the USPSs 4-digit ZIP+4 Add-On code. The Census Bureau has added the Postal Add-On code to the Census TIGER data base using an automated match to the USPSs AMS II ZIP+4 file. The codes in the TIGER/ Line files are the street-level codes the USPS has assigned to address ranges. The USPS may assign more specific codes to companies and buildings, and to apartments, floors, or suites within buildings. Some address coding software that uses the AMS II ZIP+4 file may provide the more specific codes. However, the TIGER/Line files contain only the more general codes. Usually the ZIP+4 Add-On code is not required to uniquely identify an address range. There are a few situations where a street name and address range legitimately appear more than once in the same 5-digit ZIP Code. Usually the USPS distinguishes these duplicates by using different postal station names. However, the Postal Add-On code will uniquely identify these cases. Puerto Rico is a special case because many addresses were uniquely assigned within an urbanizacion (a community or development) and could duplicate another address in a different urbanizacion with the same 5-digit ZIP Code. To resolve this problem, the USPS added an additional line to the address to identify the urbanizacion. The 9-digit ZIP Code also may serve to uniquely identify these address ranges. We do not yet have all of these 9-digit ZIP Codes in the Census TIGER data base.  Address Ranges Complete chains in the TIGER/Line files have one end point labeled as the start node and the other end point labeled as the end node. The start and end nodes also are referred to as from and to. The start node always corresponds to the beginning of the complete chain identified by the start node coordinates FRLAT and FRLONG. The order of the addresses follows the sequence of the nodes on the complete chain; the nodes may not be related to the low to high orientation of the address range. The start address may be higher or lower than the end address for a complete chain. Structure numbers usually, but not always, systematically increase or decrease while moving along a street in a set direction from one complete chain to the next (see Figure 3-1). 3- 8 1997 TIGER/Line Files   Figure 3-1 TIGER/Line Address Range Basics The TIGER/Line  files contain potential address ranges for city-style addresses. The complete chain (between the start node and the end node) in the diagram below has two address ranges; the left side has odd-numbered addresses and the right side has the complementary even-numbered addresses. Potential address ranges along a complete chain have values that encompass the addresses of existing structures, as well as those not yet built.  Actual Address  Potential Address Range  101  105  107  113  101-119 Start Node  Oak Ave  100-118  LEFT RIGHT  End Node  100  102  104  106  108  110  Record Type 1 contains separate data fields for both the start and end of each address range.

A complete chain side may have multiple address ranges. Often this occurs when address ranges are split to accommodate different 9-digit ZIP Codes. The TIGER/Line files use Record Type 6 to store any additional ranges as required. The Type 1 record will hold the ranges with the largest sequence of numbers. However, Record Type 6 may hold a significant number of additional ranges. Data users must use Record Type 6 to obtain the entire picture of the possible address ranges along a complete chain. In Record Types 1 and 6, both the left- and the right-side address ranges have a start and an end address range field that can contain a maximum of 11-alphanumeric characters. The address range fields are right-justified. Each address range in the TIGER/Line files has only one parity. Only odd-numbered addresses are contained within an address range with odd start and end structure numbers. Likewise, only even-numbered addresses belong to an address range with even start and end structure numbers. The value zero is not used as a valid address range end value. Generally, the left and the right sides of a complete chain have opposite parities. If both odd and even addresses exist on the same side of a complete chain, the TIGER/Line files provide both an even and an odd parity range for that side of the complete chain. One of the ranges appears in Record Type 1, while the other range appears separately in Record Type 6. Some address ranges may include single value ranges, such as 16-16, referred to as include addresses. These include addresses are anomalies; they may have a parity different than the prevailing address range on the complete chain side, or appear as an outlier from an adjoining range that does not fit within the range belonging to the complete chain where it is located. For example, the location of 16 Osage St falls on the predominantly odd-numbered left side of the complete chain with the address range 1-99. The range 16-16 will appear as an additional include range on the left side of the street. The even address range 2-98 on the right side of the street must exclude the number 16 structure number; the right address range becomes two ranges, 2-14 and 18-98. Outliers follow the same pattern. For example, 10 Persimmon St may appear on the side of the complete chain with the range 100-198 and not on the complete chain with the  3- 10 1997 TIGER/Line  Files   range 2-98. As before, 10-10 would become an additional range added to the complete chain with the range 100-198, and the address range 2-98 would become two ranges, 2-8 and 12-98. Because include address ranges require complex edits that may involve several complete chains, the Census Bureau cannot guarantee that all address duplication has been identified and eliminated. Some basic characteristics of address ranges are as follows:  The TIGER/Line files generally contain only those city-style address ranges used for mail delivery. They do not show rural route and post office box addresses. They may contain structure numbers assigned in select areas for use by local emergency services, but not for mail delivery. The TIGER/Line files do include address ranges and ZIP Codes in some small places where the USPS provides only post office box service, not street delivery. These address ranges represent the structure numbers collected during the 1990 census field operations, while the ZIP Codes represent the post office boxes. The address ranges in these areas do not have Postal Add-On codes since the USPS does not use them for street delivery.  Gaps may exist between multiple ranges for a single complete chain. A gap may be significant, since any numbers missing from one complete chain may actually appear on another complete chain in the case of address anomalies such as out-of-parity or out-of-sequence addresses (see Figure 3-2).  In a few rare cases, address ranges can include numbers with alphabetic characters. These characters help uniquely identify addresses within a county. For instance, certain unincorporated areas of Genesee County, Michigan add a letter G prefix to the address number. The characters are consistently placed within the address range field; for example, the letter G maintains a consistent column placement in the range G1 to G99 (see Figure 3-3).  Address ranges exist only for street features, and in some cases, corpo-rate corridor and corporate offset boundary features.  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3- 1 1   Figure 3-2 TIGER/Line Multiple and Out-of-Sequence Address Ranges The TIGER/Line  files can accommodate complex address situations by using more than one address range. A complete chain may contain both odd and even ranges, provided the ranges are not duplicated elsewhere. Whenever there is more than one address range per side for a complete chain, the additional address ranges go into Record Type 6. The TLID field links the two record types. Record Type 6 has a sequence field (RTSQ) that allows more than one Record Type 6 to . have the same TLID. The largest address ranges are put on Record Type 1 and the smaller ranges on Record Type 6. The complete chain in the diagram below has two address ranges on each side. This situation results when a structure with an even-numbered address (150-150) is built on the odd-numbered side of the street.  113  121  123  125  150  199  LEFT Start Node  121-199, 150-150 120-148, 152-198  Oak Ave End Node  RIGHT  110  120  122  124  126  128  130  There is a gap (150-150) in the the even-numbered addresses.

Only a few rare situations require alphabetic characters to uniquely identify an address range.

Inconsistent street numbers may affect the address ranges of other complete chains.  The start-end orientation of address ranges follows the start-end node orientation of the complete chain. Address ranges run from high to low or low to high to be consistent with the actual orientation of address ranges along the street. Single number street addresses appear as a range.

The Census Bureau edits the address ranges to locate possible overlaps, but cannot guarantee that all possible overlap situations have been identified.  Address ranges in the TIGER/Line files are usually associated with both the primary and alternate feature identifiers. Caution: Address range overlaps may occur if primary address ranges are linked to alternate feature identifiers that identify route numbers. Some address systems use a hyphen to separate avenue numbers, private road designators, and grid cell numbers from the structure numbers; for example, 10-01 Reynolds St uses a hyphen to separate the avenue number from the structure number.  Imputed Address Ranges Imputed address ranges occur during the process of updating the Census TIGER data base when a new complete chain intersects an existing complete chain with address ranges. The intersection splits the existing complete chain and produces two new complete chains connected by a new node located at the intersection point. The update program divides the old address ranges among the two new complete chains and imputes the address range ends at the new node. The impute process allocates either all or part of each original address range to each of the new complete chains in proportion to their lengths (see Figures 3-4 and 3-5). For each side of the original complete chain, the process considers all address ranges appearing on each side and determines the overall low and high address. The process assumes the addresses are evenly distributed over the length of the complete chain, and applies the proportion of complete chain lengths to the overall address ranges to calculate a split point address for each side. Address ranges that fall entirely above or below the split point address are moved intact to one of the new complete chains. The process divides any address ranges that contain the split point address and allocates each part to one of the new complete chains. The new address range ends created from the split are imputed values and have an impute flag. 3- 14 1997 TIGER/Line  Files   Some intermediate address range ends also may carry the impute flag. These address range ends fall between the overall high and low address for complete chain sides that have more than one address range. The impute flags on these range ends often mark splits created by adding different nine-digit ZIP Codes to parts of the original address range. These impute flags are not significant and should be disregarded. The impute flags identify address ranges that have been through the impute process. Each record in the TIGER/Line files contains four separate 1-character impute flag fields, one for each address range end.  ZIP Codes The ZIP Code is an attribute of the address ranges. The TIGER/Line files have a five-character ZIP Code field containing a numeric code with leading zeros. Both the left- and right-side address ranges share the ZIP Code that appears in the same Type 1 or Type 6 record. Each address range belonging to a complete chain can have a different ZIP Code. Where ZIP Code boundaries follow a street, the complete chain may have different left- and right-side ZIP Codes, or different ZIP Codes along its length. Because the Census TIGER data base identifies only one ZIP Code for each address range record, address ranges with different ZIP Codes must appear in separate records. The address range(s) with one ZIP Code will appear in Record Type 1, and the address range(s) with the other ZIP Code(s) will appear in Record Type 6. For example, one complete chain making up Duke Street is a ZIP Code boundary; the left-side range 1-99 has a ZIP Code of 12345, and the right-side range 2-98 has a ZIP Code of 54321. The range 1-99 with a ZIP Code of 12345 will appear in Record Type 1, and the right-side range fields will be blank. The range 2-98 with a ZIP Code of 54321 will appear in Record Type 6, and the leftside range fields will be blank. If the complete chain had additional address ranges with a ZIP Code of either 12345 or 54321, these additional address ranges would appear with one of the existing ranges or as additional Type 6 records. For example, a right-side range of 150-198 with a ZIP Code of 12345 could appear on the  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3- 1 5   Figure 3-4 TIGER/Line Address Range Imputes--Before Split The Census TIGER  data base uses impute flags to indicate that the one or both ends of an address range are based on calculations rather than known values. Imputed address situations generally occur when a complete chain with existing address ranges becomes split by a new complete chain. The illustration below shows the address ranges on Chestnut Ave before a split. All impute flags for this complete chain are set at zero. Figure 3-5 shows the address ranges after the split.

However, a right-side range of 150-198 with a ZIP Code of 54321 could not appear on the Type 6 record with the range 2-98. Instead, the range would have to appear in a second Type 6 record. Since the ZIP Codes in the TIGER/Line file relate to mail delivery along addressed streets, they are not true area features. It is possible that a polygon may contain addresses associated with more than one delivery ZIP Code.  Postal Add-On Code The TIGER/Line files have a 4-character Postal ZIP+4 Add-On code which is located on Record Type Z. Record Type Z may link to a left- or right-side address range in Record Type 1 or in Record Type 6. The first two characters of the code indicate the USPS sector code; the last two characters represent the USPS segment code. As stated earlier, the Census Bureau used an automated match process to assign the Add-On codes to the address ranges in the Census TIGER data base. The match utilized only the street type records from the AMS II ZIP+4 file. These records identify a single Add-On code for a range of addresses. The ZIP+4 file also contains company and high-rise building records that supply specific codes to companies, buildings, and floors or suites within buildings. The Census Bureau did not match these codes to the Census TIGER data base because it was not practical to add all of the building features to the Census TIGER data base. Also, it was not feasible to split the address ranges for individual building-level codes. The match process attempted to relate the 5-digit ZIP Code, street name identifier, and address ranges for each feature in the Census TIGER data base to the corresponding street type record in the AMS II ZIP+4 file of the USPS. A match was not always possible because the process could not identify a single match between features with a high degree of confidence. Where successful, the process added the Postal Add-On codes to the address ranges in the Census TIGER data base. The process split these ranges if the Add-On codes covered only part of the range. Splits of this type occurred because the potential address ranges used by the Census  3- 18 1997 TIGER/Line  Files   Bureau differed from those used by the USPS. The USPS assigned different Add-On codes for each range of addresses along a block side. For example the 100, 200, and 300 numbered addresses received different Add-On codes even though they appeared on the same block side. The Add-On codes also may appear on more than one complete chain. This results because of differences in potential address ranges, and because the Census Bureau recognizes complete chain breaks and intersections not recognized by the USPS.  Address Information and Key Geographic Locations (KGLs) KGLs represent a special class of address information. They provide a geocoding tool like address ranges, but also identify a spatial object similar to a landmark. The Census Bureau uses KGLs to identify named buildings where the use of the feature name enhances the ability to geocode addresses. These cases include airports, shopping centers, schools, condominiums, hotels, and apartment complexes. The Census Bureau uses KGLs in situations where the address range along a street does not geocode to the correct block. Thus, greater accuracy in geocoding is provided when the KGL address is used than when the address range on the complete chain is used. In the TIGER/Line files, each KGL usually has a street address, CFCC, KGL feature name, and ZIP Code. The street feature identifier associated with the address of the KGL is obtained by linking the FEAT field to Record Type 5 which contains the list of all street name identifiers. The KGLs are independent of the address range on the complete chain; the geocoding link for the KGL is the GT-polygon. In most cases, one of the complete chains that forms the boundary of the GT-polygon will contain the KGL address. However, this relationship is not true for all KGLs. In order to locate the street segment with the KGL address, use the previously linked street name identifier from Record Type 5. The ZIP Codes may not be the same. Even though the KGLs appear to identify specific structures, the KGL descriptions do not include location coordinates. In most cases, the Census Bureau can determine the general location of the KGL, but cannot provide a specific location with any certainty.  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3- 1 9   Address Information Methodology Pre-1992 Address Ranges Before the 1990 census, the Census TIGER data base contained address ranges only for the area covered by 1980 geographic base files (GBF/DIME Files) and a few file extension areas prepared in conjunction with 1980 census activities. These ranges were used to geocode a list of addresses to geographic areas for use in the 1990 questionnaire mail-out. For the 1990 census, the Bureau purchased the list of addresses from commercial vendors for the geographic areas where the Census TIGER data base included address ranges. To verify the accuracy of the addresses, the Census Bureau began with an initial assignment of residential addresses to the 1990 census tracts and blocks. Clerical review of the results of the assignment process provided additional address range updates. If an address range in the TIGER/Line file prepared for the 1990 census was incorrect, the Census Bureau implemented procedures to ensure that the error did not adversely affect the accuracy or the quality of the 1990 census. Later, in field operations, enumerators verified, corrected, and updated the list of addresses assigned to each block. They walked the perimeter and all interior streets of each block and checked the address list against their observations.  1992 TIGER/Line Expanded Addresses In the 1992 TIGER/Line Files, the Census Bureau expanded the address range coverage for the entire United States by creating new ranges based on the Address Control File (ACF) used in the 1990 decennial census. The ACF was a master list of addresses geocoded to the census block level. For each block, the individual structure addresses were grouped by feature identifier and sorted into numerical order to extract an actual range. The order of the addresses along the complete chains bordering the block, relative to the start and end nodes of the complete chains, came from the order of addresses for the street feature as a whole (i.e., the collection of linked complete chains with the same feature identifier). Likewise, the overall parity of the street feature set the standard for identifying and editing anomalies along the complete chains.  3- 20 1997 TIGER/Line  Files   To maintain confidentiality of individual addresses, the Census Bureau converted the actual range to a potential range. This was accomplished by expanding the actual range to complete a hundred range, splitting the difference between coverage gaps, and in some cases disguising the range by the random addition or subtraction of addresses. Where a complete chain in the Census TIGER data base contained both an ACF-derived address range and a pre-existing address range, only the pre-existing address range was extracted for the 1992 TIGER/ Line files. This extraction process was followed on each side of a complete chain. No attempt was made to resolve differences between the two sources (the pre-existing or the ACF-derived). The ACF-derived address range may have created overlaps with pre-existing address ranges on the adjoining complete chains.  Post-1992 Expanded Addresses What had been true for addresses in the 1992 TIGER/Line files was modified for the 1994, 1995, and the 1997 versions of the files. The preexisting address ranges in the Census TIGER data base and the ACF address ranges were matched to determine their comparability. Then, a rematch process was performed similar to the process used for the 1992 TIGER/Line files. Using more sophisticated processing, the address ranges were merged to create better address range coverage. In the merge process, the ACF range became the base address range, and the pre-existing address range in the Census TIGER  data base was used to make the address range coverage more complete. The merged range is the address range in the 1997 TIGER/Line files. In addition to the address merge process, the Census Bureau ran an address range edit. The edits fixed some orientation and parity reversals along a street feature. They also identified overlapping address ranges of different complete chains that had the same street identifier and ZIP Code. Where all of the overlapping addresses were geocoded to the same 1990 census block, only one instance of the address was retained in the TIGER/Line files. If overlapping addresses were geocoded to a different census block, none of these overlapping addresses were  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3- 2 1   entered into the TIGER/Line files. For this reason, street features that had address ranges in the past may show no ranges or incomplete ranges in the latest versions of the TIGER/Line files. Both primary and alternate feature identifiers can be used in geocoding, but great care should be used with the alternate identifiers. In the case of corporate corridors and corporate limit offset boundaries, the alternate address linked to the boundary should be used for geocoding rather than the primary range linked to the street (see the Corporate Corridors and Corporate Limit Offset Boundaries section in this chapter). Orientation edits attempted to standardize the low to high orientation of address ranges along a chain of street feature complete chains with the same feature identifier. Complete chains with address ranges that were specifically identified as orientation anomalies were automatically excluded. The edit determined the majority orientation for the street feature chain and reversed the low and high values on any range that deviated from the majority. The edit only created street feature chains that included adjacent complete chains; discontiguous street feature chains were edited as separate pieces. Therefore, the from-to orientation of the complete chains may be inconsistent along a feature chain. The parity edits attempted to place the even- and odd-parity ranges consistently on the same side of a feature chain. Chains with address ranges that were specifically identified as known anomalies were automatically excluded. Because address geocoding could be affected, the parity fix required a feature chain with a minimum of four complete chains and a majority parity representing 70 percent of the address ranges. As a result, smaller feature chains remained unaltered. For the 1994 TIGER/Line files, the Census Bureau conducted a general ZIP Code clean-up and staff added new ZIP Codes created since the 1990 census. These updates had a significant impact on parts of Michigan, California, and central Florida. Nationwide, automated processes eliminated illegal codes not recognized by the USPS as ZIP Codes, and clerical operations began eliminating the scatter of incorrectly applied ZIP Codes. Nearly all 3-digit ZIP Code anomalies have been corrected.  3- 22 1997 TIGER/Line  Files   Address Range Record Locations Record Type 1 1 1 1 6 6 6 6 9 Field Name FRADDL TOADDL FRADDR TOADDR FRADDL TOADDL FRADDR TOADDR KGLADD Start End Start End Start End Start End Key  Description Address, Left Address, Left Address, Right Address, Right Address, Left Address, Left Address, Right Address, Right Geographic Location Address  Impute Flag Record Locations Record Type 1 1 1 1 6 6 6 6 Field Name FRIADDL TOIADDL FRIADDR TOIADDR FRIADDL TOIADDL FRIADDR TOIADDR Start End Start End Start End Start End  Description Imputed Address Imputed Address Imputed Address Imputed Address Imputed Address Imputed Address Imputed Address Imputed Address  Flag, Flag, Flag, Flag, Flag, Flag, Flag, Flag,  Left Left Right Right Left Left Right Right  ZIP Code Record Locations Record Type 1 1 6 6 Z Z 9 9 Field Name ZIPL ZIPR ZIPL ZIPR ZIP4L ZIP4R KGLZIP KGLZIP4 Description ZIP Code, Left ZIP Code, Right ZIP Code, Left ZIP Code, Right +4 Postal Add-On Code, Left +4 Postal Add-On Code, Right Key Geographic Location ZIP Code +4 Postal Add-On Code for KGL  Address Ranges and Impute Flag Codes Address Ranges  Numeric characters or a mixture of numeric and alphabetic characters (maximum of 11 characters)  Ranges beginning or ending with zero (0) are not valid  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3- 2 3    Address range fields are blank when no address range is available.

The distribution of ZIP Codes in the TIGER/Line files may not reflect the exact USPS ZIP Code service area.  Limitations Users of the address ranges in the TIGER/Line files should check for address range overlaps, gaps, odd/even reversals, and other situations that may be incorrect. While the Census Bureau continues to edit for, and correct these situations, it is possible that some still exist.  Corporate Corridors and Corporate Limit Offset Boundaries A corporate corridor is a narrow, linear part of an incorporated place (or in a few instances, another legal entity). The corporate corridor includes the street and/or right-of-way, or a portion of the street and/or right-ofway within the incorporated place. It excludes from the incorporated place those structures such as houses, apartments, or businesses that front along the street or road. A corporate limit offset boundary exists where the incorporated place lies on one side of the street and may include all or part of the street and/or right-of-way, but not the structures located on that side of the street. See the Places section in Chapter 4.  3- 24 1997 TIGER/Line  Files   To facilitate the coding of addresses to the correct geographic entity, the Census TIGER data base contains duplicate street name and address ranges on complete chains with a CFCC of F11 (nonvisible offset boundary) or F12 (nonvisible corporate corridor). The duplicate street names for the F11 and F12 features are on Record Type 5; the duplicate address ranges are on Record Type 6. Complete chains with CFCCs of F11 or F12 will not contain the duplicate names or address ranges in Record Type 1. Record Type 1 does not indicate that the street or right-of-way lies within a corporate corridor or offset boundary. Therefore, the address ranges lie outside the corporate corridor or offset boundary and are encoded on either side of these lines. Data users planning to geocode addresses in areas with these boundary types must identify the duplicate feature identifiers and ranges from Record Types 5 and 6 (the names and address ranges for CFCC F11 and F12 features), locate the street feature with those ranges, and remove the street features address ranges and geographic codes from the geocoding process.  Record Linkages The TIGER/Line files store address range information in two record types. Record Type 1 contains the basic complete chain attributes, including one basic address range. Record Type 6 stores the additional ranges when the complete chain has more than one range on one or both sides. The TLID field links Record Types 1 and 6. Since a complete chain can have more than one set of address ranges, multiple Type 6 records can exist with the same TLID. The TIGER/Line files distinguish these records with a record sequence number (RTSQ). All Type 6 records that have the same TLID appear sequentially in the file even though the records are not sorted by TLID. The TIGER/ Line files do not contain a field indicating whether a Type 6 record exists for a specific TLID; the user must scan any existing records in Record Type 6 for a TLID match.  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3- 2 5   Boundaries of Geographic Entities The TIGER/Line files store geographic codes as either a polygon or complete chain attribute. In the case of state and county level geography, and some other areas, the codes appear in both complete chain and polygon record types. Refer to Chapter 4 for descriptions of geographic areas, and to Chapter 6 for the data dictionary that describes the record type fields.  Record Linkages and Boundary Extraction The codes assigned to the complete chain belong to the areas referenced by the left and the right sides of a complete chain. Only those features that have different geographic codes on the left and the right sides of a line become boundary features. Information from multiple TIGER/ Line data fields is required to uniquely identify the boundary of some geographic entities. For instance, both the census block and census tract/ BNA codes are required to identify a block boundary. Block 101 in census tract 2101 could neighbor block 101 in census tract 2998. Be sure to use both the basic number and the suffix when extracting either census tract or block boundaries. Data users who have combined TIGER/Line files should include the 1990 state/statistical equivalent and 1990 county/statistical equivalent codes to extract 1990 census tract/BNA boundaries. The extraction of boundary features from polygon attribute codes requires making a link between the polygon and the complete chain data records, then identifying the features with different left- and right-side geographic codes. For a description of the record linkage process, see the Polygon Features section in this chapter. Boundary rings consist of multiple complete chains that are sequentially linked together and connected to form a closed ring. The process of linking all of the boundary complete chains that outline the same geographic entity requires the extraction of all complete chains that have that entitys code on either the left or the right side (but not both). Linking the chains together will form a polygon; each polygon may represent one of the GTpolygons described in Record Types A, P, and S, or a collection of these GT-polygons.  3- 26 1997 TIGER/Line  Files   Caution: Some types of geographic areas must end at a county/file boundary while others can continue into adjoining counties/files. For example, MCDs stop at a county boundary, whereas incorporated places can exist in several counties (See the Record Linkages/Feature Chaining section in this chapter).  Single-Side Flags and County Boundaries The 1997 TIGER/Line files use current counties/statistical equivalents as the basis for the file coverage area, not the boundaries as they existed for the 1990 census. This means that a county or countyequivalent file may not cover the exact same area as it did in 1990. Any legal changes or boundary corrections that occurred since 1990 could have resulted in a piece of land moving from one county, or county equivalent, to another. County boundary features are duplicated between adjoining pairs of counties so that each file is complete. However, the complete chains that constitute the boundary features contain only the geographic entity codes and address ranges relevant to each county-based TIGER/Line file. The geographic entity codes are blanked out on the outside edge of the county, even though some of these fields must normally have a non-blank code. The TIGER/Line file identifies these complete chains with a 1-character, single-side segment flag in the SIDE1 field of Record Type 1. When combining several TIGER/Line files data set, the data user will need to eliminate Because each one of the duplicate boundary the left- or right-side geographic entity codes elimination process will need to combine the from both lines. to form a state or regional duplicate boundary lines. complete chains has either and address ranges, the codes and address ranges  The same situation applies to the polygon identification codes. Record Type I contains CENIDs and POLYIDs for GT-polygons within the county. If the GT-polygon is in the adjacent county, the CENID and POLYID fields are blank.

The CFCC is applied only once to a chain or landmark with preference given to classifications that cover features that are visible to an observer and a part of the ground transportation network. Thus, a road that also is the boundary of a town would have a CFCC describing its road characteristics, not its boundary characteristics. The CFCC, as used in The first character is a character is a number character is a number the TIGER/Line files, is a three-character code. letter describing the feature class; the second describing the major category; and the third describing the minor category.  Feature Class A, Road The definition of a divided highway has been the source of considerable discussion. Earlier specifications have defined a divided road as having  opposing traffic lanes that are physically separated by a median strip no less than 70 feet wide in former GBF/DIME areas or no less than 200 feet wide in non-GBF/DIME areas. This definition caused confusion in the proper coding of interstates having narrow medians. To clarify the situation, the Census Bureau now uses the term divided to refer to a road with opposing traffic lanes separated by any size median, and separated to refer to lanes that are represented in the Census TIGER data base as two distinct complete chains. Earlier operations may have depicted widely separated lanes as a single line in the data base or created separate lines when the median was small, depending on the available source used during the update.  3- 28 1997 TIGER/Line  Files   The term, rail line in center, indicates that a rail line shares the road rightof-way. The rail line may follow the center of the road or be directly next to the road; representation is dependent upon the available source used during the update. The rail line can represent a railroad, a street carline, or other carline. Primary Highway With Limited Access Interstate highways and some toll highways are in this category (A1) and are distinguished by the presence of interchanges. These highways are accessed by way of ramps and have multiple lanes of traffic. The opposing traffic lanes are divided by a median strip. The TIGER/Line files may depict these opposing traffic lanes as two distinct lines in which case, the road is called separated.

Only those GT-polygons associated with an area landmark have a CFCC. Most CFCCs in the feature classification scheme apply only to complete chains. In a few instances, the same feature code may apply to complete chains as well as to point and area landmarks. Only those features required for census operational purposes are classified and inserted into the Census TIGER data base. Therefore, not all features in a county will appear in the TIGER/Line files. Since features are classified with only a single code, a road that also is a boundary will have only the CFCC of a road even though a CFCC for a boundary exists in the classification scheme.  CFCC Record Location Record Type 1 7 9  Field Name CFCC CFCC CFCC  Description Code assigned to the complete chain Code assigned to a point or area landmark Code assigned to a key geographic location  Points Describing the Complete Chain The TIGER/Line files describe the spatial/geometric position and shape of a complete chain using shape points and nodes; see the section entitled Topology in Chapter 1. Latitude and longitude coordinate fields identify the shape points and nodes. The Census TIGERdata base does not support node identification numbers.  Nodes Nodes are topological objects that mark the end location of each complete chain. Every chain has two nodes, a start node and an end node (using the  3- 42 1997 TIGER/Line  Files   Spatial Data Transfer Standard, or SDTS, terminology). Earlier releases of the TIGER/Line files refer to these nodes as the from node and the to node. The order of the nodes establishes the left and the right sides of the line and sets the sequencing order for the shape points. The node coordinates are stored in Record Type 1.  Shape Points The Census Bureau uses the term shape points to describe the nontopological points that describe the position and shape of a chain. Shape points exist only where required; straight-line complete chains require no shape points. Shape points are associated only with one complete chain and are listed in order from start node to end node. The TIGER/Line files store shape points in Record Type 2 and link them to the nodes in Record Type 1 using the TLID. The shape points for a chain can fill several Type 2 records.  Coordinates for Nodes and Shape Points Coordinates are expressed in Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) notation, where a positive latitude represents the Northern Hemisphere and a negative longitude represents the Western Hemisphere. All coordinates are expressed as a signed integer with six decimal places of precision implied (see the section, Positional Accuracy, in Chapter 5). Actual Latitude 15 Deg. S to 72 Deg. N Longitude 64 Deg. W to 131 Deg. E  TIGER/Line File -15000000 to +72000000 -64000000 to -180000000 +179999999 to +131000000  For the 48 contiguous states, the District of Columbia, Alaska, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, the coordinates in the 1995 and 1997 versions of the TIGER/Line files are in the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). The coordinate datum for the above areas was NAD27 in all previous versions of the files prior to 1995. Regional datums are used in all versions of the TIGER/Line files for Hawaii and the Island Territories in the Pacific.  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3- 4 3   Coordinate Values All nodes have non-zero coordinates within the range specified in the Coordinates for Nodes and Shape Points section on the previous page. Shape point coordinates are expressed in the same manner. However, unused Record Type 2 fields are zero-filled and begin with a + sign.

Point 10, Longitude Point 10, Latitude  Record Linkages/Feature Chaining Plotting a complete chain requires using the nodes from Record Type 1 and all of the shape point records in Record Type 2 with the same TLID, if any. Plot the start node first, then search Record Type 2 for any matching records. If there is a match, the record will contain from 1 to 10 shape points. If all 10-point fields are filled with non-zero values, there may be an additional matching Type 2 record. Type 2 records are not sorted by TLID, but all records with the same TLID should appear together in sequence by the record sequence number (RTSQ). Plot the shape points from all Type 2 records and end the complete chain by plotting the end node. Street features may consist of multiple complete chains that are sequentially linked together. Linking all of the features with the same name requires the extraction of all Type 1 and Type 2 records with the same feature identifiers in Record Types 1 and 5.  3- 44 1997 TIGER/Line  Files   Boundary generation requires the extraction of all features that have different left and right geographic codes. The placement of the complete chains into a boundary-ring sequence requires a procedure to match the end of one complete chain to the beginning or end of the next complete chain. The complete chains will probably not have the same to-from or start-end orientation down the length of the street or boundary. Therefore, the procedure must reverse the order of the nodes and shape points that form some complete chains to achieve a correct and consistent sequence of nodes and shape points. Since the nodes that identify the ends of the complete chains do not have an identification number, the procedure must match the nodes based on the latitude and longitude coordinates. This might facilitate the match by combining the coordinates into a single peano key code composed of alternating latitude and longitude digits. Sorting nodes using the peano key will cluster nodes that are spatially close together.  Polygon Features The TIGER/Line files contain identification and geographic codes for each GT-polygon in the Census TIGER data base. These GT-polygons are the smallest areas identified in the TIGER/Line files. Geographic entities and area landmarks have specific identification codes and form more complex polygons. The TIGER/Line files link these features to GT-polygons, but do not directly identify the more complex polygons. GT-polygons are building blocks that form features. They are not features and do not have their own feature name or CFCC. However, GT-polygons may be a part of many area landmark features that have their own feature name and CFCC. GT-polygons have unique GT-polygon identification codes (CENID and POLYID), a set of geographic entity codes, and an internal point location. Refer to Chapter 2 for more information on GT-polygon identification codes and Chapter 4 for a description of the geographic entities in the TIGER/Line files.  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3- 4 5   Information and record linkage keys for GT-polygons are distributed over several record types:  Record Type  Record Type areas  Record Type  Record Type  Record Type  Record Type P -- provides the GT-polygon internal point location A -- provides the 1990 census geographic entity codes and 8 9 I S -- -- -- -- links GT-polygons to area landmarks links GT-polygons to key geographic location features links GT-polygons to complete chains provides current geographic entity codes and areas  Updates to the Census TIGER data base include new street and boundary complete chains that create new GT-polygons. Thus, each version of the TIGER/Line files will have a single, unique set of GT-polygons, each with a corresponding Record Type A, S, and P. The CENID and POLYID identification codes link records together, but are not permanent GT-polygon identification codes.  Geographic Entity Codes Geographic entity codes can be attributes of a set of polygons, a complete chain, or both. Refer to Chapter 6 for the data dictionary that describes the record type fields and to Chapter 4 for descriptions of geographic areas.  Internal Points The internal point is a point location within each GT-polygon that is unique to that GT-polygon. The TIGER/Line files exclude the internal points from the node-complete chain-polygon topology; do not confuse the internal point with a centroid. In a polygon with an irregular shape, such as a doughnut or crescent shape, the true centroid could fall outside the polygon. Unlike true centroids, the internal points always fall within the GT-polygon or on the GT-polygon boundary. Some of the GT-polygons (approximately 400 nationwide) are so small that the internal point may be identical to a point on one of the lines bounding the GT-polygon, or identical to one of the nodes. Depending upon the precision of a particular software or hardware system, the data user may find the internal point outside the correct GT-polygon, or find that a GT-polygon may contain two internal points. 3- 46 1997 TIGER/Line  Files   Changes to the shape and location of complete chains forming polygon boundaries will change the polygon internal point coordinates even though the topology of the polygon remains the same. Such changes complicate the matching, using internal point coordinates, of polygons from different versions of the TIGER/Line files. All internal points have non-zero coordinates. Coordinates are expressed in standard FIPS PUB 70 notation. See the Coordinates for Nodes and Shape Points section in this chapter. GT-Polygon Internal Point Coordinates Record Locations Record Type P P Field Name POLYLONG POLYLAT Description Internal point longitude Internal point latitude  Record Linkages The topological network of complete chains divides the surface area of geographic entities into GT-polygons. There is a one-to-one relationship between the GT-polygons constructed from Record Types 1 and 2 and those appearing in Record Type P. In constructing the GT-polygons from Record Types 1 and 2, users are cautioned to be sure their software has the necessary coordinate precision and does not snap together complete chains that are merely close. Record Type I provides a direct link from each complete chain in the TIGER/Line file to its adjoining GT-polygons. It contains both the TLID and the polygon identification codes for each side of the GT-polygon. Record Type I facilitates the transfer of polygon geographic codes to the complete chain, but also provides the link back from polygon to complete chain. In this case, finding all complete chains associated with a GT-polygon is more difficult. The procedure involves searching every Type I record to locate all instances where a CENID and POLYID appear on either the left or the right side of a complete chain. Area landmarks also must link to the GT-polygons in order to establish their geographic location. Record Type 8 provides the link from GT-polygon to area landmark. See the Area Landmark Locations section in this chapter.  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3- 4 7   Landmark Features The Census Bureau includes landmarks in the Census TIGER data base for locating special features and to help enumerators during field operations. Some of the more common landmark types include airports, cemeteries, parks, and educational facilities. The Census Bureau added landmark features on an as-needed-basis and made no attempt to ensure that all instances of a particular feature were included. The absence of a landmark does not mean that the living quarters, e.g., hospitals and group quarters associated with the landmark were excluded from the 1990 enumeration. The address list used for the census was maintained apart from the landmark data. Landmarks with a ZIP Code and an address are called key geographic locations (KGLs). A landmark can be either a point, Census TIGER data base permits airport or airfield might appear as depends on the size of the feature the source document. line, or area type. In some cases, the a choice of types. For instance, an a point, line, or area; the approach and the depiction of the feature in  Line features such as airfields could appear as one or more complete chains; they are not identified in the landmark record types. See the Point, Line, and Area Landmark CFCCs section in this chapter to identify the possible codes that could appear as complete chains. In addition to landmark data, the TIGER/Line files contain the CFCCs and names for bodies of water including ponds, lakes, oceans, and the area covered by large streams represented as double-line drainage. These water areas have 1990 census block numbers ending in 99. See Chapter 4 for a complete description of census blocks covering land and water. Landmark and water features can overlap. The most common situation is a park or other special land-use feature that includes a lake or pond. In this case, the GT-polygon covered by the lake or pond belongs to a water landmark feature and a park landmark feature. Other kinds of landmarks can overlap as well. Area landmarks can contain point landmarks; these are not linked in the TIGER/Line files.  3- 48 1997 TIGER/Line  Files   Record Type 7 contains point and area landmarks. Most water areas are identified as an area landmark whether named or not. The other landmarks may be identified only by a census feature class code and may not have a name. During the extraction of this data, the Census Bureau assigned a temporary landmark identification number (LAND) to each landmark record. Record Type 8 uses the LAND to link the area landmark records in Record Type 7 to the GT-polygons. Record Type 7 and Record Type 8 exist only when the county file contains landmark features or water features. Record Type 9 contains the KGLs in the Census TIGER data base. The KGLs are linked by the CENID and POLYID to the GT-polygons.  Point, Line, and Area Landmark CFCCs All landmarks, including KGLs, have a CFCC. In the Census TIGER data base the CFCCs of the complete chains forming the polygon boundary are independent of the CFCCs assigned to the area landmark or the water feature filling the polygon.

The text string includes upper- and lower-case characters. The feature name may carry an imbedded feature type (e.g., River, Military Reservation,  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3- 5 1   Garden, Park, and Lake). The Census Bureau has not standardized or edited the feature types or names for landmarks in the Census TIGER data base in all areas. The Census Bureau does not guarantee that the landmarks or water areas are consistently identified in the TIGER/Line  files. Area landmarks added to the Census TIGER data base in different update actions with the same name and CFCC will produce separate landmark records in the TIGER/Line files. The landmark records may contain variant spellings of the feature name or different CFCCs even though they refer to the same feature. These differences could result in the fragmentation of a large landmark. For instance, a water body could have the name Lake Redmond with a CFCC of H31, while another part could have the same name, but a CFCC of H30, and still a third part could have the name York County Reservoir. Because area landmarks can overlap, it is possible, although not likely, for one polygon to belong to several landmarks. Area landmarks and water area labels can have alternate names. Each feature name will appear as a separate Type 7 record, but each record will have the same LAND. Type 7 Records with the same LAND will have the same landmark or water area label. Each unique combination of primary and alternate names becomes a separate landmark record even though the primary name and the CFCCs match the adjoining landmark features. The TIGER/Line files do not show all water bodies as landmark records. Using Record Type 7 (area landmarks) and Record Type 8 (polygons linked to area landmarks) will not necessarily provide all water areas. Record Type S contains a water flag (WATER) to identify all polygons associated with water bodies. Key geographic location names uniquely identify the landmark separately from its street address; for example, Springfield Towers instead of 1605 Main St.  3- 52 1997 TIGER/Line  Files   Landmark Feature Record Locations Record Type 7 9 Field Name LANAME KGLNAME Description Landmark name Key geographic location name  Landmark Feature Name Codes The LANAME and KGLNAME field may include any ASCII text string.

The presence of coordinate data in Record Type 7 distinguishes point landmarks from area landmarks that have blank coordinate fields.

The coordinate fields for area landmarks are blank-filled.  Area Landmark Locations To find the location of each area landmark, link the basic landmark description in Record Type 7 to all of the elementary polygons that belong to the landmark. Record Type 8 serves as a bridge between these two record types. The TIGER/Line files provide a Type 8 record for each polygon linked to a specific landmark. Polygons belonging to multiple landmarks appear once for each landmark. The TIGER/Line  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3- 5 3   files use the LAND and the polygon identification codes (CENID and POLYID) to actually make the link. See Chapter 2 for a description of the LAND, CENID, and POLYID codes and fields. Locate the polygons for an area landmark by searching Record Type 8 for all of the CENIDs and POLYIDs with the specified LAND. Record Type 8 is in LAND sort sequence. Once the polygons are linked to the area landmark, use Record Type I to locate the complete chains that form the landmarks polygon boundaries. Record Type I contains a record for all complete chains and identifies the polygons located on either side of the complete chains. The search procedure must look for all instances of Record Type I and evaluate the left- and right-side polygon identifiers for a possible match. Data users may need to eliminate complete chains that are internal to the polygon and landmark, depending on the application.  KGLs To find the location of KGLs, link the description in Record Type 9 to the elementary polygon in which the KGL is found. Use the polygon identification codes (CENID and POLYID) to make the link. If the address of the KGL is a street address, use the FEAT field (alternate feature ID code) to link to the feature identifier in Record Type 5.  3- 54 1997 TIGER/Line  Files   Chapter 4: Geographic Entities Overview The 1997 TIGER/Line files contain the boundaries of legal, administrative, and statistical areas. Some boundaries are those that were in effect as of the tabulation of the 1990 census, while others are updated boundaries. The legal areas shown in the files are:        States and their statistical equivalents--1990 and current Counties and their statistical equivalents--1990 and current Minor civil divisions (MCDs) --1990 and current Sub-minor civil divisions (Puerto Rico only)--1990 and current Consolidated cities--current only Incorporated places--1990 and current American Indian reservations (both federally and state-recognized)--1990 and current  American Indian trust lands--current only  Alaska Native Regional Corporations--current only  Congressional districts--current only  The administrative areas shown in the files are:  Voting districts--1990 only  School districts--current only  Traffic analysis zones--current only  The statistical areas included in the files are:  Census areas (statistical county equivalents in Alaska)--1990 and current  Census county divisions and unorganized territories (statistical county subdivisions)--1990 and current  Census designated places (statistical place equivalents)--1990 only  Place (remainder) entities (statistical place equivalents within consolidated cities)--1990 and current  American 1) Alaska 2) Tribal 3) Tribal Indian/Alaska Native statistical areas--1990 and current Native village statistical areas designated statistical areas jurisdiction statistical areas   Census tracts and block numbering areas--1990 only  Urbanized areas--1990 only  Census blocks--1990 only  Geographic Entities 4-1    Metropolitan areas: 1) Consolidated metropolitan statistical areas--current only 2) Metropolitan statistical areas--current only 3) Primary metropolitan statistical areas--current only  Geographic entities tabulated by the Census Bureau generally are hierarchical; Figure 4-1 shows the progression of geographic areas from the Nation to the block level. See Appendix F for a count of legal, admini-strative, and statistical entities. The TIGER/Line files Information Processing codes. The TIGER/Line identify geographic areas using either the Federal Standard (FIPS) codes or Census Bureau-assigned  files depict geographic areas in two ways:   The assignment of codes to the left and the right sides of the complete chains (Record Types 1 and 3)  The identification of codes that belong to each GT-polygon (Record Types A and S) The TIGER/Line files identify some geographic entities in both the complete chain and polygon records for certain boundary vintages. This chapter provides detailed information on the record types and fields for the geographic entities.  Boundary and Area Changes The boundaries identified as current for some legal areas are updated boundaries collected since 1990 as part of the Census Bureaus Boundary and Annexation Surveys, or as part of the 1990 Count Quality Review correction process. The boundaries of all states, all counties and their statistical equivalents, all MCDs, and all incorporated places are those that were legally in effect as of the latest Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS). This may vary by county record or the date of extraction from the Census TIGER data base. The boundaries of incorporated places have a varied vintage usually based on the 1990 definition of the incorporated place. Below are general guidelines for the effective date of incorporated place boundaries:  Latest Available Boundaries--Population of 2.500 or greater  Boundaries as of January 1, 1990--Population of less than 2,500  4- 2 1997 TIGER/Line Files   Figure 4-1 Hierarchical Relationship of Geographic Entities  Nation  States UAs Counties CDs School Districts VTDs County Subdivisions Sub-MCDs Census Tracts/ BNAs BGs Places AIANAs ANRCs  Blocks  Geographic Entities 4-3   Some incorporated places have boundaries of a date later than those shown in the list on page 4-2. This occurs because special censuses are conducted, counts are updated based on more current boundary information, or Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS) information for places is reported later than the deadline. Some boundary dates may be earlier than those shown on page 4-2 because of a nonresponse to the most recent BAS, in which case, the boundaries of the previous BAS are used. For all other legal areas and nearly all statistical areas, the boundaries shown were those in effect at the time of the 1990 census whether the data are identified as 1990 or current. Because unorganized territories and census designated places occupy the same level of geography as legal MCDs and incorporated places, updates to the legal boundaries may affect the current boundaries for some of these entities, including the elimination of some of the statistical entities. Metropolitan area data on Record Type S, the CMSA and MA fields, are based on the latest available designations by the Office of Management and Budget, and are not the metropolitan areas for which the Census Bureau tab-ulated data in 1990. The metropolitan area information on Record Type C, however, shows both 1990 and current codes and names. In a few cases, the Census Bureau made statistical area boundary changes in order to correct errors. Since the release of the 1990 Census TIGER/Line files, the Census Bureau shifted and reshaped some line features including the lines forming some boundaries. These changes involved the realignment of complete chains associated with a legal or statistical area boundary. The shape and area of the 1990 geographic entities portrayed in the 1995 and 1997 TIGER/Line files may differ from earlier TIGER/Line versions, but the inventory of 1990 census tabulation entities remains the same. Changes in the shape and location of complete chains will change the polygon internal point locations. See the Internal Points section in Chapter 3.  4- 4 1997 TIGER/Line Files   Codes for Entities Appendix A is a list of FIPS state and county codes. A list of valid codes and names for other legal entities does not appear in the documentation for the TIGER/Line files. The TIGER/Line files include Record Type C which lists the geographic codes and names plus some attribute data (FIPS 55 class code, census place description code, and legal, administrative, or statistical area description code; and entity type) for certain entities. The codes and names are identified as 1990, current, or both. Record Type C contains the TIGER/Geographic NameTM files that the Census Bureau produced as a companion to the 1992 TIGER/Line  files. Record Type C also replaces the TIGER Geographic Reference File Names (GRF-N), 1990. The documentation and additional information for FIPS codes is available from the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), US Department of Commerce, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161.

FIPS PUB 55-3 includes many more entity records than those for which the Census Bureau tabulates data. The FIPS 55 codes are state-based. American Indian reservations in  Geographic Entities 4-5   more than one state will have a different FIPS 55 code for each state portion of the single reservation. The 1994, 1995, and 1997 versions of the TIGER/Line files do not contain the census codes for places, county subdivisions, and sub-MCDs that were available in earlier versions of the TIGER/Line files. A description of the Census Bureaus codes that are assigned to higher-level geographic entities (county subdivisions, sub-minor civil divisions, consolidated cities, and places) appears in the geographic identification coding scheme (GICS) product, TIGER/GICS. The TIGER/GICS contains FIPS and Census Bureau codes, names and attributes, and demographic data for the higherlevel geographic entities included in the 1990 census.

The TIGER/Line files use multiple fields to identify a series of legal and statistical AIANAs:  4- 6 1997 TIGER/Line Files   Legal Entities  American Indian reservations (AIRs) are legal entities having boundaries established by treaty, statute, and/or executive or court order over which a federally recognized American Indian tribal group has jurisdiction. The areas identified as American Indian reservations include entities with other designations, such as pueblo, colony, and community. AIRs are identified by representatives of the reservations or tribes.  American Indian trust lands included in the census are the off-reservation lands associated with a specific tribe or a reservation held in trust by the Federal Government. They are identified by representatives of the reservations or tribes. Trust lands may be either tribal (held in trust for the tribe) or individual (held in trust for an individual member of the tribe). Trust lands are assigned the same codes as the associated reservation. Trust lands not associated with a reservation are assigned codes based on the tribal name. The TIGER/Line files did not previously distinguish between AIRs and trust lands because they shared the same code. Beginning with the 1994 TIGER/Line files, American Indian trust lands are flagged in a separate field (previously the Census ANRC field).  Alaska Native Regional Corporations (ANRCs) are corporate entities established by the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (PL 92-203) to conduct business and nonprofit operations for Alaska Natives. The 12 ANRCs have specific boundaries and cover the state of Alaska except for the Annette Islands Reserve (an American Indian reservation). Statistical Entities  Alaska Native village statistical areas (ANVSAs) are 1990 census statistical areas that delineate the settled area of each Alaska Native village (ANV). ANVs represent tribes, bands, clans, villages, communities, and associations that are recognized pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (PL 92-203), but do not have legally recognized boundaries. Officials of Alaska Native Regional Corporations (ANRCs) and other knowledgeable officials delineated the 1990 ANVSAs for the Census Bureau for the purpose of presenting census data for these entities.  Geographic Entities 4-7    Tribal designated statistical areas (TDSAs) are geographic areas that were delineated for 1990 census data tabulation purposes by tribal officials of federally and state-recognized tribes outside of Oklahoma. TDSAs do not have a legally defined reservation or associated trust lands. They define areas that contain population under tribal jurisdiction and/or areas for which the tribe provides benefits and services. TDSAs are defined for data presentation purposes only.  Tribal jurisdiction statistical areas (TJSAs) are geographic areas delineated for 1990 census data tabulation purposes in Oklahoma by federally recognized tribes that do not have a legally defined reservation. TJSAs are areas defined only for data presentation purposes. They generally contain American Indian population over which one or more tribal governments have jurisdiction. They replace the single Historic Areas of Oklahoma (excluding UAs) recognized for the 1980 census.

Also, refer to FIPS PUB 55-3 or the Census Bureaus TIGER/GICS for a list of valid codes and entity names. The type of AIANA area can be identified either by the census code or by the FIPS 55 class code on each entity record in Record Type C. The range of census codes allocated to each AIANA and the valid FIPS 55 class code(s) associated with each are as follows: Type AIR TJSA ANVSA TDSA Census Code Range 0001 to 4989 5001 to 5989 6001 to 8989 9001 to 9589 Valid FIPS 55 Class D1, D2, D3, D4, D5 D6 E1, E2, E6 D6  Block Groups (BGs) Geographic BGs Block groups are clusters of blocks within the same census tract or BNA; they have the same first digit as their 3-digit block numbers. For example, blocks 101, 102, 103,, 199 in census tract 1210.02 belong to BG 1. BGs never cross county or census tract/BNA boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of county subdivisions, places, UAs, VTDs, congressional districts, and AIANAs. BGs generally contain between 250 and 550 housing units. Each BG usually covers a contiguous area. Each census tract/BNA contains at least one BG. BGs are uniquely numbered within census tract/BNA. Tabulation BGs Tabulation block groups are geographic BGs split to present data for every unique combination of county subdivision, place, UA, VTD, congressional district, U/R, and AIANA shown in the data tabulation products.  Geographic Entities 4-9   The TIGER/Line files do not have a separate BG data field. Data users can determine the geographic BG by using the first digit of the block number in combination with the 1990 state, county, and census tract/BNA number. Users can identify the tabulation BG by using the geographic BG in combination with the codes for the entities listed above. STF 1A and STF 3A present data for both geographic and tabulation BGs. Block Group Number Record Locations See the section, Census Blocks, in this chapter for record locations and field names. The BG is the compilation of all blocks with the same first digit of their block number in a specific 1990 state-county-census tract/BNA combination. All polygons have a non-blank BG number. The left- and right-side complete chain block numbers should not be blank except where they are located along the outside edge of the county boundary. The TIGER/ Line files do not contain codes for areas outside the county file. BGs have a valid range of 0 through 9. Some BGs beginning with a 0 are in coastal and Great Lakes water. Rather than extending the census tract/ BNA boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the three-mile territorial sea limit, the Census Bureau delineated some census tract/BNA bound-aries along the shoreline or just offshore. The Census Bureau assigned a default census tract/BNA number of 0000 and block number of 099 to the offshore areas not included in regularly numbered census tract/ BNA areas.  Census Blocks Census blocks usually are small statistical areas bounded on all sides by visible features such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad tracks, and by invisible boundaries such as property lines, legal limits, and short imaginary extensions of streets and roads. Blocks never cross county or census tract/BNA boundaries. In rare instances, parts of a block may be discontiguous, but all parts of a tabulation block will be in the same geographic or governmental unit. Blocks are composed of one or more GT-polygons; that is, several GT-polygons can share the same block number. See Figures 4-2 and 4-3.  4- 10 1997 TIGER/Line  Files   Census Block Numbers Blocks are numbered uniquely within each 1990 state/county/census tract or BNA. A census block must be identified by a 3-character basic block number field and a 1-character block suffix field. The suffix field often is blank. The 3-character basic block number identifies the collection block used in the 1990 census field operations. The first digit of the basic block number identifies the BG. The Census Bureau refers to the combined basic 1990 collection block number and suffix (if a suffix exists) as the tabulation block number. The 1990 tabulation block numbers identified in Record Types 1, 3, A, and S have a 1-character suffix field. The suffix character is blank for whole 1990 collection blocks that also are tabulation blocks. Block numbers with suffixes usually represent collection blocks that are split in order to identify separate geographic entities that divide the original block. For example, when a city limit runs through collection block 101, the portion inside the city may be tabulated in block 101A and the portion outside the city in block 101B. The suffix letters A and B have no correlation to the location of the block portion to which they are assigned. In other words, in the example above, the portion of block 101 inside the city could have been assigned a suffix of B, and the portion outside the city, a suffix of A. There is no limit on the number of parts into which a block can be split. Water Blocks A 3-character basic block number that ends in 99 signifies water area. As there is only one number ending in 99 within a BG, many water polygons can have the same block number. Water blocks have suffixes if parts of the same block are located in different geographic entities. Rather than extending the census tract/BNA boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the three-mile limit, the Census Bureau closed off some census tract/BNA areas using boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore. The Census Bureau assigned a default census tract/ BNA number of 0000 and block number of 099 to the offshore areas.

Census maps and other data files do not display the block numbers for water areas. The principal purpose for census block numbers assigned to water areas is to identify all areas of the United States and its territories and to allocate the water areas to geographic entities. Water GT-polygons with the same block number may not be contiguous, but will be in the same geographic area or governmental unit. Changes to shorelines or boundaries made since the release of the 1990 Census TIGER/Line files altered or removed block boundary features between parts of some water blocks and changed the block numbers (the BG designator) for those blocks. Because the water blocks had no population or housing, the tabulation of the 1990 census was unaffected. Some water blocks in the 1990 Census TIGER/Line  files Supplemental CD-ROM may contain census block suffixes that do not match subsequent TIGER/Line file. Current Geography Record Types 1, 3, A, C, and S identify changes (both codes and boundaries) since the 1990 census tabulation for some geographic entities. These records do not show new block numbers. The Census Bureau continues to conduct its annual Boundary and Annexation Survey to identify changes to the boundaries of legal entities. However, the 1990 block numbers remain for new polygons created by the post-census boundary changes. The Census Bureau will not systematically update block numbering to reflect the current geographic boundaries until it prepares for the 2000 census.

When first established, census tracts should have relatively homogeneous demographic characteristics. Generally, census tracts have a population size between 2,500 and 8,000 people, and average about 4,000 people. The local data users can delineate census tracts for special land uses, such as military installations and American Indian reservations.  Geographic Entities 4-15   BNAs BNAs are statistical areas delineated by state agencies or the Census Bureau for counties without census tracts. The delineation of BNAs follows the same basic criteria as those for census tracts. Because BNAs appear more often in less populated counties, they may have fewer people than census tracts. Numbering The TIGER/Line files store census tract and BNA numbers in a 4-character basic number field and an optional 2-character suffix number field. In printed reports and on mapping products, the Census Bureau uses a decimal point (.) to separate the basic number from the suffix. However, in the TIGER/Line files and STF data products, the decimal point is implied. The basic number and the suffix appear together in a single 6-character field in Record Types 1, 3, A, and S. A basic number smaller than 1000 will contain leading zeros. Leading zeros are shown on machine-readable products, but are not shown in printed reports and on census maps since leading zeros are not part of the basic number. The TIGER/Line files use the right-most two characters in the census tract/BNA field for the suffix. These two characters are blank if the census tract/BNA number does not have a suffix. Suffixes smaller than 10 have a leading zero. For example, census tract 0077.01 is shown as 007701 in the TIGER/Line files. The Census Bureau uses suffixes to help identify census tract changes for comparison purposes. Local data users have an opportunity to review the existing census tracts before each census. If data users split a census tract, the split parts usually retain the basic number, but receive different suffixes. In a few counties, data users approve major changes to, and renumber, the census tracts. Changes to individual census tract boundaries usually do not result in census tract numbering changes. The Census Bureau documents all changes to census tract boundaries and numbers in the TIGER/Census Tract Comparability File (19801990). Data users are cautioned to examine the census tract boundaries or the comparability file before making comparisons between past data and 1990 data.  4- 16 1997 TIGER/Line  Files   Boundaries and Boundary Changes Census tract/BNA boundaries generally follow visible physical features and county boundaries. The census tract or BNA boundary may follow MCD and incorporated place boundaries in New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and the New England States (and occasionally other states) because the boundaries tend to be stable and locally known. In a few rare instances, a census tract or BNA may consist of discontiguous areas. These discontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves discontiguous. Census tracts were last defined in preparation for the 1990 census. Census tracts/BNAs must nest within acounty. New census tracts/BNAs were created to accommodate updates and corrections to county boundaries following the assignment of block numbers in 1988. This was necessary because existing 1990 census tracts were in place for the 1990census and could not be shifted. At the request of some local data users, the Census Bureau resolved a number of census tract boundary discrepancies. This explains some of the less populated census tracts and the census tracts with basic numbers or suffixes that are seemingly out of range for the county. The Census Bureau generally identified the revised census tracts/BNAs with a unique suffix ranging from .70 to .98 (e.g., 1234.98) so data users could easily determine which census tracts/BNAs were affected. The Census Bureau made these changes after the release of the TIGER/Line Precensus Files, 1990. The census tract boundaries follow legal county boundaries as of January 1, 1990. Because there have been state and/or county boundary changes since 1990, users are cautioned to only use 1990 state and county areas to identify census tracts/BNAs. Census tracts next will be defined for the 2000 census. Relationship to Other Geographic Entities The census tracts and BNAs represent the same level of geography and share the same field in the TIGER/Line files. Census tracts or BNAs entirely cover a county. A county contains either census tracts or BNAs, but not a combination of both. Census BGs and blocks are uniquely numbered within census tracts and BNAs.

The leftand right-side complete chain census tract/BNA numbers are not blank except where they are located along the outside edge of the county boundary. The TIGER/Line files do not contain geographic codes for the area outside of the county file. The TIGER/Line files identify the boundary complete chains by placing a 1 in the single-side segment field in Record Type 1. The Census Bureau assigned a default census tract/BNA number of 0000 to some coastal and Great Lakes water rather than extend the census tract/ BNA boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the three-mile limit. The Census Bureau closed off some census tract/BNA areas along the shore-line or just offshore, and assigned the default census tract/BNA and special block numbers to the offshore water areas.  Counties and Statistically Equivalent Entities The first-order divisions of each state are counties for 48 states, parishes for Louisiana, and boroughs and census areas for Alaska. In addition, the Census Bureau treats the following entities as equivalents of counties for purposes of data presentation: independent cities in Maryland, Missouri, 4- 18 1997 TIGER/Line  Files   Nevada, and Virginia; the portion of Yellowstone National Park in Montana; District of Columbia for the District of Columbia; municipios in Puerto Rico; Islands in the Virgin Islands of the United States; and a variety of entities in the Pacific Island Territories. The TIGER/Line files contain several 3-character numeric fields identifying the FIPS county code for the 1990 census and the FIPS county codes for current entities. Each individual TIGER/Line file contains state and county code fields to uniquely identify its records. See Appendix A for a list of FIPS codes for county and county-equivalent areas.

They use a single field to identify the two functional types (legal and statistical) of county subdivisions. Record Type C contains all valid codes and entity names.  Geographic Entities 4-19   Legal Entities Minor Civil Divisions (MCDs)  MCDs are legally defined subcounty areas such as towns (in eight states) and townships. MCDs occur in 28 states, Puerto Rico, and the Island Territories.  Some states have incorporated places that are not part of any MCD. These places also serve as primary legal subdivisions and have a unique FIPS MCD code that is the same as the FIPS place code. The TIGER/ Line files will show the same FIPS 55 code in the county subdivision field and the place field.  In New York and Maine, American Indian reservations (AIRs) exist outside the jurisdiction of any town (MCD) and thus also serve as MCD-equivalent entities. Statistical Entities Census County Divisions (CCDs) CCDs are areas delineated by state officials and local data users for statistical purposes. CCD boundaries usually follow visible features and in most cases, coincide with census tract or BNA boundaries. CCDs exist where: 1) There are no legally established minor civil divisions (MCDs). 2) The legally established MCDs do not have governmental or administrative purposes. 3) The boundaries of the MCDs change frequently. 4) The MCDs are not generally known to the public.  CCDs have been established for the following 21 states: Alabama Arizona California Colorado Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Kentucky Montana Nevada New Mexico Oklahoma O regon South Carolina Tennessee Texas Utah Washington Wyoming  4- 20 1997 TIGER/Line  Files   Census Subareas Census subareas are subdivisions of boroughs and census areas, the county equivalent entities in Alaska. The state of Alaska and the Census Bureau cooperatively delineated the census subareas to serve as the statistical equivalents of MCDs. Unorganized Territories (UTs) For states with partial MCD coverage, the Census Bureau defines UTs for the non-MCD area. UTs are assigned county subdivision codes and names. Eleven states had or now have UTs: Arkansas Indiana (only for current) Iowa Kansas (only for 1990) Louisiana Maine Minnesota North Carolina North Dakota Ohio (only for current) South Dakota  County Subdivision Code Record Locations Record Type 1 1 3 3 A C C C S Field Name FMCDL FMCDR FMCD90L FMCD90R FMCD FIPS ENTITY NAME FMCD Description FIPS 55 Code (MCD/CCD) Left, Current FIPS 55 Code (MCD/CCD) Right, Current FIPS 55 Code (MCD/CCD), 1990 Left FIPS 55 Code (MCD/CCD), 1990 Right FIPS 55 Code (MCD/CCD), 1990 FIPS 55 Code, Year Entity Type Name of Geographic Area FIPS 55 Code (MCD/CCD), Current  The Census Bureau assigned a default county subdivision code of 00000 in some coastal and Great Lakes water where county subdivisions did not extend into the Great Lakes or out to the three-mile limit.

Geographic Entities 4-21   Congressional Districts The 1997 TIGER/Line files contain 2-character numeric code fields for the current (105th ), the 106th, and the 108th congressional districts. Congressional districts are numbered uniquely within state. The fields for the 106th and 108th congressional districts are blank. The current congressional district field always has a value other than blank for all polygons.

The county or MCD and the separately incorporated places within the consolidated city continue to exist. The Census Bureau classifies the separately incorporated places within the consolidated city as place entities and creates a separate place (remainder) record for the portion of the consolidated city not within any other place. Refer to the Places section in this chapter for additional information. Consolidated cities are represented in the TIGER/Line files by a 5-character numeric FIPS code. Record Type C has the complete list of valid codes and entity names.  4- 22 1997 TIGER/Line  Files   Consolidated City Code Record Locations Record Type C C C S Field Name FIPS ENTITY NAME FCCITY Description FIPS 55 Code, Year Entity Type Name of Geographic Area FIPS 55 Code (Consolidated City), Current  Crews-of-Vessels Crews-of-vessels represent the population on military (including Coast Guard) and merchant ships; they do not include the inhabitants of houseboats or marinas. The census population tables show the vessels population in a unique census tract/BNA and census block. A crews-of-vessels census tract/BNA and block appear on census maps as an anchor symbol with the census tract/BNA and block numbers, rather than as a delimited area. The location of the anchor symbol is arbitrary and reflects neither the location of the vessel(s) at the time of the census, nor the location of the crews-of-vessels census tract/ BNA and block as it appears in the TIGER/Line file. See the Census Tracts and Block Numbering Areas and the Census Blocks sections in this chapter for record locations and field names. Crews-of-vessels census tract/BNA numbers use the same basic census tract/BNA number as the nearby land census tract/BNA with which the vessel is associated, plus a suffix of 99, shown in decimal notation. For example, census tract 1234.99 is shown as 123499 in the TIGER/ Line files and other machine-readable products. Crews-of-vessels block numbers use the same basic block number as the associated land block in that census tract/BNA, plus a block suffix of Z; for example, block 901Z in census tract 1234.99. In such a situation, the related land block also receives a suffix, even though it may not be split by a boundary; for example, the addition of crews-of-vessels associated with the block 901 creates blocks 901A and 901Z. The Census Bureau does not use the Z census block suffix for any purpose other than the crewsof-vessels. Either the left or right census tract/BNA and census block identified in Record Type 1 will indicate the location to which the population is assigned. The census tract/BNA and census block for crews-of-vessels  Geographic Entities 4-23   form an extremely small, triangular-shaped polygon requiring only one complete chain with a start node equal to the end node and two intermediate shape points. Based on the coordinates found on Record Types 1 and 2, the location of the census block is on the shore inside the land block with the same 3-digit collection block number, not in the water as shown on the census maps. The Census Bureau defines as zero, the area measurement enclosed by the special crews-of-vessels census tract/BNA and block.  Metropolitan Areas The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) designates metropolitan areas to serve as statistical areas around the larger population centers of the United States and Puerto Rico. Basically, a metropolitan area must contain an urbanized area delineated by the Census Bureau or an incorporated place with a population of 50,000 or more. Metropolitan areas consist of whole counties or county equivalents in most states; in New England the OMB defines metropolitan areas using MCDs. The metropolitan area consists of the central county, county equivalent, or MCD (in New England) and additional areas based on OMB criteria related to population density, population growth, and commuting data. There are three types of metropolitan areas. If a metropolitan area has a total population of less than 1,000,000, the area is designated a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). Metropolitan areas with a population of 1,000,000 or greater qualify for designation as a Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA) that is composed of smaller Primary Metropolitan Statistical Areas (PMSAs). This designation is not automatic; the OMB solicits local opinion to designate CMSAs and their component PMSAs. The TIGER/Line files now contain three different 4-character numeric fields to identify the FIPS code for each metropolitan area and to differentiate CMSAs and MSAs from PMSAs. The FIPS codes are from FIPS PUB 8. If a value exists in the PMSA field identifying a PMSA, then the CMSAMSA field also must be filled; this combination identifies the associated CMSA and PMSA combinations. A blank PMSA field indicates the code in the CMSAMSA field is for the MSA. Record Type C uses a  4- 24 1997 TIGER/Line  Files   single metropolitan area field to identify CMSAs, MSAs, and PMSAs. The Legal/Administrative/Statistical Area code identified the type of metropolitan area. Metropolitan Area Code Record Locations Record Type C C C S S  Field Name MA ENTITY NAME CMSAMSA PMSA  Description FIPS Metropolitan Area Code, Year Entity Type Name of Geographic Area FIPS Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area/ Metropolitan Statistical Area Code, Current FIPS Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area Code, Current  Metropolitan Area Codes Metropolitan areas are identified using the 4-character numeric FIPS codes. Record Type C in the TIGER/Line files contains all the valid codes and entity names for CMSAs, MSAs, and PMSAs. The current metropolitan areas represent the latest OMB designations and not necessarily the metropolitan areas for which the Census Bureau tabulated data in the 1990 census. Record Type C shows both 1990 and current codes and names.  Places The TIGER/Line files use a single field to identify places that are legal entities, and places that are statistical entities. The FIPS place code uniquely identifies a place within a state. Legal Entities Incorporated Places Incorporated places are legal entities incorporated under individual state law. Places may extend across county and county subdivision boundaries. An incorporated place can be a city, town, borough, village, or rarely, undesignated. But, for census purposes, incorporated places exclude:  The boroughs in Alaska (treated as county equivalents)  Towns in the New England States, New York, and Wisconsin (treated as MCDs)  Geographic Entities 4-25    The boroughs in New York (treated as MCDs)  The remainder portions of consolidated cities (statistical equivalents of incorporated places)  Statistical Entities Census Designated Places (CDPs) CDPs are recognizable communities or concentrations of population that are not incorporated places. CDPs may have a locally recognized name, but do not have legally defined corporate limits or corporate powers. The Census Bureau defines CDPs at the time of each decennial census in cooperation with state officials, AIR officials, and local data users. In Puerto Rico, CDPs are called comunidades or zonas urbana. Since CDPs are valid only for the presentation of decennial census data, CDP complete chain information is removed from the current geography contained on Record Types 1 and A, but remains with the 1990 geography contained on Record Type 3. This change occurred in the 1995 TIGER/Line files and will remain in effect until TIGER/Line files are released containing Census 2000 geographic areas. CDPs in Hawaii are an exception. The Census Bureau, in agreement with the state of Hawaii, does not recognize any incorporated places in Hawaii. Thus, its CDP complete chain information is retained on Record Type 1.  Consolidated City (Remainder) Portions Consolidated city (remainder) portions refer to the areas of a consolidated city not included in another incorporated place. For example, Columbus city, GA, is a consolidated city that includes the separately incorporated municipality of Bibb City town. The area of the consolidated city that is not in Bibb City town is assigned to Columbus city (remainder). The name always includes the (remainder) identifier. Legally incorporated places and CDPs are mutually exclusive and are identified in the same TIGER/Line field. Users of earlier versions of the TIGER/Line files without Record Type C will need to consult the publication GRF-N, FIPS PUB 55-3, or the Census Bureaus TIGER/ GICS to identify the list of valid codes and entity names, and to differentiate between the legal and statistical entities.  4- 26 1997 TIGER/Line  Files   Dependent and Independent Places Depending on the state, incorporated places are either dependent within, or independent of, county subdivisions, or there is a mixture of dependent and independent places in the state. Dependent places are part of the county subdivision; the county subdivision code of the place is the same as that of the underlying county subdivision(s), but is different from the FIPS place code. Independent places are separate from the adjoining county subdivisions and have their own county subdivision code (or codes if the place lies in multiple counties). These places also serve as primary county subdivisions. The TIGER/Line files will show the same FIPS 55 code in the FIPS county subdivision code field and the FIPS place code field for independent places. The only exception is if the place is independent of the MCDs in a state in which the FIPS MCD codes are in the 90000 range. Then, the FIPS MCD and FIPS place codes will differ. CDPs and remainder portions of consolidated cities (Class C8) always are dependent within county subdivisions. Corporate Corridors and Offset Corporate Boundaries A corporate corridor is a narrow, linear part of an incorporated place (or in a very few instances, another legal entity). The corporate corridor includes the street and/or right-of-way, or a portion of the street and/or right-ofway within the incorporated place. It excludes from the incorporated place those structures such as houses, apartments, or businesses, that front along the street or road; see Figure 4-4. A corporate limit offset boundary exists where the incorporated place lies on only one side of the street, and may include all or part of the street and/or the right-of-way. It does not include the houses or land that adjoin the side of the street with the corporate limit offset boundary. It is possible to have two or more corporate limit offset boundaries in the same street or right-of-way. In order to reduce the overprinting of symbols on the printed or plotted census maps, a corporate corridor was shown in earlier map versions by only one symbol along its center line rather than by a symbol that followed its outer boundary. Corporate limit offset boundaries use the same map symbology as non-offset boundaries. Figure 4-4 depicts corporate corridors and corporate offset limits.  Geographic Entities 4-27   Figure 4-4 Corporate Corridors--Overview This diagram, using symbology typical of a census map, shows a corporate corridor linking the two larger areas of Place 38520 (shading has been added to highlight the actual area within the corporate limits). Part of the corporate limit along Orange St is an offset boundary. A corporate limit offset covers only one side of the street or right-of-way, not the entire street or right-of-way, as is the case with a corporate corridor.  Corporate Corridor Corporate Limit Offset  Orange St  Place 38520  Place 38520  Corporate Corridor  Place Boundary  4-28 1997 TIGER/Line Files   To facilitate address coding, the street name and address ranges are generally duplicated on complete chains with a CFCC of F11 (nonvisible offset boundary) or F12 (nonvisible corporate corridor). The duplicate street names for the F11 and F12 features are on Record Type 5 and the duplicate address ranges are on Record Type 6. However, Record Type 1 will not indicate that the street or right-of-way lies within a corporate corridor or offset boundary, or that the address ranges lie outside, and are encoded on either side, of the corporate corridor or offset boundary. When data users find duplicate address ranges where one of the duplicates is on a complete chain with a CFCC of F11 or F12, they should use this address range for address geocoding rather than the range on the street feature that has a CFCC beginning with A (see Figure 4-5). Likewise, use the street name and address ranges on the related street feature (CFCC beginning with A ) for mapping or vehicle routing.

This program was designed to provide 1990 census data tabulations for school districts. The program continues to be updated and the updates are reflected in the subsequent versions of the TIGER/Line files.  Geographic Entities 4-29   Figure 4-5 Corporate Corridors--Detail View This diagram shows a detailed view of a corporate corridor that runs along Corporate Dr. The complete chains with the census feature class code (CFCC) F12 form the corporate corridor and have geocoding address ranges that mirror the address ranges of Corporate Dr. The geocoding address ranges exist so structures are coded to the correct block and place. For example, 311 Corporate Dr is located outside the corporate limits. Using the address range from Corporate Dr to geocode the structure will incorrectly code the structure to Place 69012. The corporate corridor (CFCC F12) splits City Line Ave at one end of the corridor and the boundary feature (F10) at the other end, creating four short complete chains. The Census TIGER data base software compensates by moving the address ranges from these short complete chains located inside the corporate corridor to complete chains outside the corridor so they geocode to the correct geographic entity.  This corporate corridor complete chain (CFCC F12) has a geocoding feature identifier (Corporate Dr on Record Types 4 and 5) and an address range (307-319 on Record Type 6).  These short complete chains are part of City Line Ave and have no address ranges.  309 303  311 319  Place 69012 Corporate Dr 307 - 319 306 - 320  Place 69012 306 These short complete chains (CFCC F10) are created to define corporate corridor polygons.  312  320  This corporate corridor complete chain (CFCC F12) has a geocoding feature identifier (Corporate Dr on Record Types 4 and 5) and an address range (306-320 on Record Type 6).

Since 1995, the intermediate level has become defunct and is not longer a separate level. The elementary and secondary levels of a school district can overlap each other because they represent different segments of the school-age population; for example, a secondary school district could cover parts of several elementary school districts. The TIGER/ Line files use separate fields to accommodate for the overlap and may not contain a code for all grade levels. The TIGER/Line files contain a unified school district code for those school districts where all levels are represented in a single district. The elementary and secondary school district code fields are blank if there is a unified school district code. Exceptions exist for the state of Hawaii and the five boroughs of New York city; New York city and Hawaii are each single school districts. The National School District Program has mapped Attendance Zones for each school in these two districts. School districts may cut through existing census blocks. In such instances, the Census Bureau created new complete chains and GTpolygons. However, the school district boundaries did not create new blocks. The tabulation blocks may contain more than one polygon, and each polygon may have a different school district code. The block parts/polygons allocated to the different school districts do  Geographic Entities 4-31   not have separate tabulation block numbers. Thus, a school district in the TIGER/Line files is a representation of the area, not the actual area. The TIGER/Line files store the school district codes in a set of three, 5-character fields. All codes consist of numeric characters. The value, 99999, is a pseudo-school district code assigned to non-water blocks for which the National School District Program does not report a school district. Some large water areas have a pseudoschool district code of 99998.

The TAZs are established by metropolitan planning organizations. TAZs were not shown in any 1990 Census TIGER extracts. The Census Bureau subsequently inserted the TAZs into the Census TIGER data base and began extracting them starting with the 1994 TIGER/Line files. Upon insertion, contiguity edits were performed to identify inconsistencies in the current delineations. The Census Bureau did not revise any TAZ problems discovered during the insertion process because production of the CTPP data preceded the insertion of the TAZs into the Census TIGER data base and the geography had to remain consistent with the data. All CTPP areas are identified by a pseudo-metropolitan area (MA) 4-digit code. A 6-character alphanumeric code on each record identifies the individual TAZs. CTPP and TAZ entities exist only on Record Type A; there is no Record Type C information for these areas. TAZ Code Record Locations Record Type A A Field Name CTPP TAZ Description Census Transportation Planning Package Area Code Traffic Analysis Zone Code  Urbanized Areas (UAs) A UA consists of at least one central place and the adjacent densely settled surrounding territory that together have a minimum population of 50,000 people. The densely settled surrounding territory generally consists of an area with continuous residential development and an overall population density of at least 1,000 people per square mile. The TIGER/Line files identify UAs with a 4-character numeric census code. See Appendix G for a list of UA names and codes. All polygons that have a UA code (other than blank) will have an urban/ rural designation (U/R) flag equal to U. See the section, Urban/Rural Designation, in this chapter.  4- 34 1997 TIGER/Line  Files   UA Code Record Locations Record Type A C C C Field Name UA UA ENTITY NAME Description Census Urbanized Area Code Census Urbanized Area Code, Year Entity Type Name of Geographic Area  Urban/Rural (U/R) Designation The Census Bureau defines urban for the 1990 census as consisting of all territory and population in UAs and in the urban portion of places with 2,500 or more people located outside of the UAs. The Census Bureau distinguishes the urban and rural population within incorporated places whose boundaries contain large, sparsely populated, or even unpopulated area. These extended cities have either 25 percent of their land area, or at least 25 square miles, classified as sparsely settled. The sparsely settled area must consist of at least one group of one or more contiguous census blocks. Each group must be at least five square miles in area and have an overall population density of less than 100 people per square mile. Polygons in the group of sparsely settled blocks will have a flag equal to R; the densely populated blocks will have a flag equal to U. Incorporated places (based on 1990 census boundaries) with both urbanand rural-flagged polygons are extended cities. For the 1990 census, the Census Bureau defined 280 incorporated places as extended cities. Extended cities exist both inside and outside of UAs. The TIGER/Line files include

They include files for all counties and statistically equivalent entities in the United States, as well as files for Puerto Rico and the Island Territories. The TIGER/Line files are released by county or statistically equivalent entity based on the latest available governmental unit boundaries. Since the 1990 Census, there have been several changes to the universe of county or statistically equivalent entities. In Alaska the SkagwayYukutat-Angoon Census Area has become Skagway-Hoonah-Angoon Census Area and Yukutat Borough. Also in Alaska, Denali Borough was created from parts of Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area and Southeast Fairbanks Census Area. Dade County, Florida officially changed its legal name to Miami-Dade County, Florida. The City of South Boston, VA no longer is an independent city (statistical equivalent of a county) and is now part of Halifax County, VA. The TIGER/Line files contain data only and do not include display or mapping software. The TIGER/Line files are typically used in conjunction with geographic information system, or similar, software. The US Bureau of the Census first released the TIGER/Line files in 1988. Since that time, it has released several versions of the files, with each successive version being improved through increased editing  Census TIGER, TIGER, TIGER/Line, TIGER/SDTS, TIGER/Census Tract Street Index, TIGER/CTSI, CTSI, TIGER/Census Tract Comparability, and TIGER/GICS are registered trademarks of the U.S. Bureau of the Census. As such, these names cannot be used as or within the proprietary product names of any commercial product including or otherwise relevant to Census Bureau data, and may only be used to refer to the nature of such product. The Census Bureau requests that any repackaging of the TIGER/Line data (and documentation) and other files accompanying it for distribution include a conspicuously-placed statement to this effect on the product's cover, the first page of the website, or elsewhere of comparable visibility. Further, Census Bureau trademarks, when used in reference to the nature of the product, should be accompanied by the  (registered) symbol, where convenient.  Introduction I-1   and updating of address ranges and features. A brief discussion of the changes that occurred in the 1994, 1995 and 1997 TIGER/Line files, and the 1998 TIGER/Line files are summarized below.  Changes in the Post 1994 TIGER/Line File Versions 1994 TIGER/Line Files The format and structure of the TIGER/Line files changed between the 1992 and the 1994 versions. In the 1994 TIGER/Line files, there were field definition changes and additional record types that accommodated new information or information that was previously supplied separately in other Census Bureau products. New Record Types The 1994 TIGER/Line files included five new record types9, C, H, S, and Z. Record Type 9 contained key geographic locations (KGLs). A KGL was a particular type of point landmark with residential or economic significance. Record Type 9 provided the linkage between a building (KGL) with a unique identity and ZIP+4 Code, and the buildings address that used its number and street name. Record Type C replaced information that was supplied separately in the TIGER/Geographic Name files. Record Type C provided a unique list of all geographic entities with their code, name, and status. The FIPS Year field had three values, 90 for geographic names and codes valid for the 1990 census, 94 for geographic names and codes valid for the current year, and blank when the geographic names and codes were the same for 1990 and 1994. Multiple records for the same geographic entity showed its change or correction over time. Record Type H described the history of TIGER/Line IDs when complete chains were split or merged. Two fields (HIST and SOURCE) on Record Type H were not yet maintained in the Census TIGER data base and were blank. Record Type S had geographic area codes for polygons. It was similar to Record Type A (which also had geographic area codes for polygons) and was linked to Record Type P. There was a Record Type S for every  I-2 1998 TIGER/Line Files   polygon in Record Type P. Several fields were reserved for use by participants in Census Bureau programs. The WATER field had two values, 0 for land or 1 for water. The Congressional District codes for the current Congress (in this case, the 103rd) were moved to Record Type S. The current Congressional District code, when combined with the 1990 state codes, created valid geographic areas. When only current state geographic codes were combined, nonexistent geographic areas may have resulted. The fields for the 101st and 103rd Congressional District codes in Record Type A were replaced with those designated for the 106th and 108th. However, these fields were blank in the 1994 TIGER/Line files. Record Type Z linked a Postal +4 Add-On code to an address range in either Record Type 1 or Record Type 6. TLID fields were matched on these records. If the RTSQ field on Record Type 6 contained a 0, the Postal +4 Add-On codes applied to the address ranges in Record Type 1. If the RTSQ field contained a number greater than 0, the Postal +4 AddOn codes applied to the address ranges in the Record Type 6 that had the identical RTSQ value. Deleted Record Types In the 1994 TIGER/Line files, Record Types F and G were deleted because they were no longer used. Record Type F showed geographic codes as of January 1, 1990 that were corrected to resolve questions raised by local officials about the 1990 census data tabulations. Record Type G showed geographic codes (generally as of January 1, 1992) for those situations where geographic entities reported boundary changes during the Census Bureaus annual survey of governmental units. In the 1994 TIGER/Line files, information previously reported in Record Type G became implicit in the current geographic codes in Record Types 1 and S. Field Definition Changes The geographic area codes on Record Type 1 represented current geography rather than the 1990 census tabulation geography. The census tract and block remained as 1990 geography. In a few Type 1 records, the current state and county, when combined with the 1990 census tract and block, created nonexistent geographic areas. To avoid nonexistent geographic areas, it was important not to  Introduction I-3   mix the 1990 geographic codes with the current geographic codes. The 1990 state, county, place, census tract, and census block codes all were found on Record Type 3. Record Type 3 no longer identified 1980 geographic area codes or contained census codes for places, minor civil divisions, and sub-minor civil divisions. These fields were replaced with the 1990 geographic areas that previously appeared in Record Type 1. Current geographic areas included on Record Type 3 were the Alaska Native Regional Corporations and the American Indian/Alaska Native Areas (AIANAs). Census Alaska Native Regional Corporation codes were eliminated from Record Type 1 and replaced by four fields. Two fields were reserved for census use. Two fields carried American Indian Trust Land Flags and contained two values, an I for individual trust land or a T for tribal trust land. The trust land flag more accurately portrayed the American Indian areas. Record Type 7 excluded key geographic locations (KGLs). These appeared in the new Record Type 9. Address Ranges and ZIP Codes The 1994 TIGER/Line files contained improvements in address information. Address ranges were edited for overlaps or other inconsistencies and ZIP Codes were updated in selected areas. Coordinates In the 1994 TIGER/Line files, NAD27 was the coordinate datum used for the 48 contiguous states, the District of Columbia, Alaska, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. Regional datums were used for Hawaii and the Island Territories in the Pacific. The accuracy of the feature coordinates in Alaska was improved by shifting them in relation to a sample of points of known higher accuracy.  1995 TIGER/Line Files No records types were added or deleted between the 1994 and 1995 versions of the TIGER/Line files. However, there were field definition and coordinate datum changes, as well as address information improvements, in the 1995 TIGER/Line files. I-4 1998 TIGER/Line Files   Field Definition Changes The CENID field was changed from numeric to alphanumeric in the 1995 TIGER/Line files to permit a wider range of entries within the same field length. Address Ranges and ZIP Codes Address ranges were edited for overlaps or other inconsistencies and ZIP Codes were updated in selected areas. The street names and address ranges in the Census TIGER data base were compared to those in the ZIP+4 file of the US Postal Service. If a street name and address range did not have a ZIP+4 code, the code was copied from the ZIP+4 file to the Census TIGER data base. The consistency of highway names and feature identifiers also was improved. Boundary and Area Changes The 1994 TIGER/Line files were included for American Samoa because the Census Bureau received no updates for this area. Since the 1990 census, the Bureau shifted and reshaped some line features, including boundary lines. This realignment of features could have been associated with corporate boundary corrections and changes. The shape and area of the geographic entities depicted in the 1995 TIGER/Line files may have differed from earlier versions of the TIGER/Line files, but represented the entities as they existed for the 1990 census. The inventory of census tabulation entities remained the same as it was in 1990. With the exception of Hawaii, Record Type 1 no longer contained census designated place (CDP) information. Since CDPs are defined at the time of each decennial census and are valid only for the presentation of decennial census data, the CDP complete chain information was removed from Record Type 1 which contained only current geography, but retained on Record Type 3 which had 1990 geography. Because Hawaii did not have independently-defined incorporated place boundaries, it used CDP boundaries as substitutes for these legal boundaries. Thus, its CDP complete chain information was retained on Record Type 1. Coordinates For the 48 contiguous states, the District of Columbia, Alaska, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, the coordinates in the 1995 TIGER/Line files were in the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83).  Introduction I-5   In all previous versions, the coordinate datum for the above areas was NAD27. Regional datums were used for Hawaii and the Island Territories in the Pacific.  1997 TIGER/Line Files The 1997 TIGER/Line files had the same structure as the 1995 TIGER/ Line files; there were no record additions or deletions. However, there were some field name, file name, and content changes. Field Definition Changes The Census Bureau redefined the concept of version. The four-digit version code no longer is a number that represents a fixed version that can be referenced nationwide. The version code is a four-digit number that represents the month and year (mmyy) the file is extracted from the Census TIGER data base. Adjacent counties in a state may have different version codes if they were extracted at different points in time. There were several changes to the fields on Record Type 3. The reserved spaces one through four in the 1995 TIGER/Line files contain four 1990 American Indian and Alaska Native area census code and American Indian trust land flag fields in the 1997 TIGER/Line files. These four fields are: Census American Indian/Alaska Native Area Code, 1990 Left (column positions 58 through 61); Census American Indian/Alaska Native Area Code, 1990 Right (column positions 62 through 65); American Indian Trust Land Flag, 1990 Left (column position 66); and American Indian Trust Land Flag, 1990 Right (column position 67). Deleted from Record Type 3 in the 1997 TIGER/Line files were the Census Alaska Native Regional Corporation Codes, Current Left and Census Alaska Native Regional Corporation Codes, Current Right. As a result of these deletions, reserved space filled columns 86 through 107 of the 1997 TIGER/Line files and the reserved space fields on the record were renumbered and reconfigured. Two changes occurred on Record Type A. The School District Code, Middle School field, in columns 60 through 64 of the 1995 TIGER/ Line files were eliminated and replaced with Reserved Space 1 in the 1997 TIGER/Line files. Reserved Space 9 in the 1995 TIGER/Line files I-6 1998 TIGER/Line Files   (columns 95 through 98) was replaced with the Census American Indian/Alaska Native Area Code, 1990 in the 1997 TIGER/Line files. The length of the RS 9 field in Record Type A was changed from nine characters to four characters. The five characters freed by this change were used for the 1990 state and county codes and are the source for determining the 1990 census tabulation codes. There were changes to Record Type C in the 1997 TIGER/Line files. The 1995 TIGER/Line files had ten characters in columns 23 through 32 which contained the Census Alaska Native Regional Corporation Code, FIPS Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area/Metropolitan Statistical Area Code, and the FIPS Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area Code. The 1997 TIGER/Line files allocated these columns to Entity Type Code, Metropolitan Area Code, and School District Code. We standardized the file suffix names that appear inside the zipped archive. This suffix now consistently be .rtn where n is the record type. In examining the record layouts in Chapter 6, we corrected information concerning the valid existence of blank values and data formats. Address Ranges and ZIP Codes Address ranges were edited for overlaps or other inconsistencies and ZIP Codes were updated in selected areas. Because of time constraints during the various operations needed to create the 1997 TIGER/Line files, the Census Bureau did not add new ZIP+4 information. Boundary and Area Changes Since the 1990 census, the Census Bureau shifted and reshaped some line features, including boundary lines. The shape and area of the geographic entities depicted in the 1997 TIGER/ Line files may differ from earlier versions of the TIGER/Line files, but continue to represent the entities as they existed for the 1990 census. The inventory of census tabulation entities remains the same as it was in 1990. Change in Naming Standards for Record Type 1 The Census Bureau changed its naming standards in Record Type 1 affecting the data in the Feature Direction, Prefix (FEDIRP), Feature Name (FENAME), Feature  Introduction I-7   Type (FETYPE), and Feature Direction, Suffix (FEDIRS) fields. In previous TIGER/Line products, directional prefixes and suffixes could appear for any type of line feature. For the TIGER/Line 1997, only road features, those features with a Census Feature Class Code (CFCC) in the A class, should have feature directional data in the directional fields. Other types of chains representing other types of features (for example, hydrologic features in CFCC class H) no longer are standardized to show directional information. The Census Bureau also modified the extraction of feature directional, name, and type information to improve the standardization of road feature information. The improvement parses a greater number of road chains into the correct feature identifier fields.  Known Problems and Anomalies in TIGER/Line 1997 Missing ZIP+4 Records Data users may note a significant reduction in the number of ZIP+4 Add On Codes in Record Type Z (ZIP4L and ZIP4R fields) for the 1997 TIGER/Line files in some areas. This reduction occurred as a result of operations to update the TIGER data base in preparation for Census 2000. These operations may have replaced address ranges or changed the 5-digit ZIP Code, but did not automatically update or transfer the ZIP+4 codes to the new ranges. Because the Add On codes are valid for specific 5-digit ZIP Codes and address ranges, the previous Add On codes may no longer apply to the new address ranges and thus were not retained. In nearly all situations, an automated match between the Census TIGER data base and the USPS ZIP+4 file was the source of ZIP+4 Add On Codes in TIGER products. With update operations for Census 2000 underway for large portions of the nation, we had not yet performed this automated match to refresh these codes. Future public sale releases of TIGER/Line files will contain refreshed codes that will reflect a more current USPS ZIP+4 file for the address range improvements that we are now making. Address Anomalies in Puerto Rico and Queens County, N.Y. The TIGER/Line files contain some address range coverage for Puerto Rico. However, use of this information for geocoding purposes may I-8 1998 TIGER/Line Files   be problematic and the data user should proceed with caution. These address ranges are preliminary attempts at using Puerto Rico address ranges in Census Bureau files. Due to the lack of software or resources to handle some of the more unique aspects of addressing in Puerto Rico, the address ranges were entered without the standard edits and quality checks used in other parts of the United States. Improvements in software and address standardization for Puerto Rico are expected in the future. At present, there are inconsistencies, overlaps, and duplication of address ranges. Address ranges may lack alpha character prefixes or have hyphenated prefixes. The files also lack the community names used in a four-line address that the U.S. Postal Service requires to avoid duplicate addresses. Errors in the reference files, and other factors may limit the usefulness of this product for geocoding purposes. Address range data for Queens County, NY in TIGER/Line 1997 did not show a consistent use of hyphenated and non-hyphenated addressing. The Census Bureau intends to correct this in future public sale versions of TIGER products. Road Feature Anomalies The Census Bureau extracts TIGER/Line files from the TIGER data base which is continually updated. During the update process for some 1997 TIGER/Line files errors caused anomalies to be introduced into some chains represented in Record Types 1 and 2. For these cases road features may appear in the 1997 TIGER/Line files unconnected to other road features (so-called floating features) or severely skewed in relation to surrounding line features of any type. This problem was not discovered during the normal Census Bureau correction operations. The Census Bureau will fix these disconnected or skewed features before the release of future public sale versions of TIGER products.  Introduction I-9   The following county files have the greatest likelihood of road feature anomalies: FIPS 01073 06071 08069 13121 17077 21001 21065 21095 21131 21175 21203 24003 26093 26125 26161 34003 36055 42003 42019 42125 45031 45071 47037 48453 50007 50021  County name, State Jefferson, AL San Bernardino, CA Larimer, CO Fulton, GA Jackson, IL Adair, KY Estill, KY Harlan, KY Leslie, KY Morgan, KY Rockcastle, KY Anne Arundel, MD Livingston, MI Oakland, MI Washtenaw, MI Bergen, NJ Monroe, NY Allegheny, PA Butler, PA Washington, PA Darlington, SC Newberry, SC Davidson, TN Travis, TX Essex, VT Rutland, VT  FIPS 04013 06073 13089 13135 18097 21011 21067 21109 21165 21189 22017 24035 26115 26147 26163 36029 37119 42007 42071 42129 45057 46099 48229 50003 50015 55025  County name, State Maricopa, AZ San Diego, CA DeKalb, GA Gwinnett, GA Marion, IN Bath, KY Fayette, KY Jackson, KY Menifee, KY Owsley, KY Caddo, LA Queen Anne's, MD Monroe, MI St. Clair, MI Wayne, MI Erie, NY Mecklenburg, NC Beaver, PA Lancaster, PA Westmoreland, PA Lancaster, SC Minnehaha, SD Hudspeth, TX Bennington, VT Lamoille, VT Dane, WI  1998 TIGER/Line Files The 1998 TIGER/Line files have the same structure as the 1997 TIGER/ Line files; there were no record additions or deletions. However, there were some field name, file name, and content changes including corrections to the data format information appearing in Chapter 6.  I-10 1998 TIGER/Line Files   Field Definition Changes There are two field name changes on Record Type 1. The Census Bureau renamed the CTBNAL and CTBNAR field names as CTL and CTR. There have been several changes to the fields on Record Type 3. The reserved spaces two and three in the 1998 TIGER/Line files contain the FIPS 55 Code (ANRC), Current Left and FIPS 55 Code (ANRC), Current Right. Reserved spaces four and five have been converted to Census Use fields and reserved space 6 renumbered. The Census Bureau has renamed the VTDL and VTDR field names as VTD90L and VTD90R. Two changes have occurred on Record Type A. The Reserved Space 1 field has been replaced by Census Urbanized Area Code, 2000 with a field name of UA. This field is blank in the 1998 TIGER/Line files. The Census Urbanized Area Code, 1990 field name has been changed from UA to UA90. The length of the Name of Geographic Area field on Record Type C has been changed from 66 characters to 58 characters and now comprises columns 55 through 112. The FIPS Code and Name Relationship Applicable Year field has been expanded from two characters to four characters, using columns 11 through 14. As a result, the FIPS 55 Code now occupies columns 15 through 19, the FIPS Class Code occupies columns 20 through 21, the Census Place Description Code appears in column 22, the Legal/Administrative Statistical Area Description Code occupies columns 23 through 24, the Entity Type Code appears in column 25, the Metropolitan Area Code occupies columns 26 through 29, the School District Code occupies columns 30 through 34, the Census American Indian/Alaska Native Area Code occupies columns 35 through 38, and the Census Voting District Code occupies columns 39 through 44. The Census Urbanized Area Code has been expanded from four characters to five characters, using columns 45 through 49. The Census Bureau has added a two character Census Alaska Native Regional Corporation Code in columns 50 and 51 and the remaining characters freed by the change to the Name of Geographic Area field have been replaced with Census Use 5 in columns 50 through 52.  Introduction I-11   The Census Bureau has made a number of field name changes on Record Type S for the 1998 TIGER/Line files. The field names CMSAMSA and PMSA have been changed to CMSA and MA. The field names STATECU and COUNTYCU have been renamed STATE and COUNTY. The BLK00 field name has been renamed BLK and VTD00 has been renamed VTD. The Census Tract/BNA Code, 2000 on the 1997 TIGER/Line files has become Census Tract Code, 1990 on the 1998 TIGER/Line files with a field name change from CTBNA00 to CT. The length of the State Senate District Code and State House District Code fields in Record Type S have been changed from six characters to three characters. The six characters freed by this change have become Census Use 7 and Reserved Space 7 fields. Type of Enumeration Area has replaced Reserved Space 10 in column 82. On Record Type S, reserved spaces 11 through 14 and the filler occupying columns 103 through 120 have been restructured. The 1998 TIGER/ Line files allocate these columns to FIPS collection State Code, 2000; FIPS Collection County Code, 2000; Collection Block Number, 2000; Collection Block Number Suffix, 2000; Zip Code Tabulation Area, 2000; and Reserved Space 8. Boundary and Area Changes Since the 1990 census, the Census Bureau shifted and reshaped some line features, including boundary lines. The shape and area of the geographic entities depicted in the 1998 TIGER/ Line files may differ from earlier versions of the TIGER/Line files, but continue to represent the entities as they existed for the 1990 census. The inventory of census tabulation entities remains the same as it was in 1990.  How to Use This Documentation The structure of this documentation is based on data content rather than record type content. For instance, information on addresses may appear in one section, but cross-references to other related sections also are included. In order to make the document easier to use as a reference, the text contains some repetition from section to section.

I-14 1998 TIGER/Line Files   Chapter 1: Overview and Geographic Concepts Overview What Is TIGER? The Bureaus Census TIGER System automates the mapping geographic activities required to support the decennial census survey programs of the Census Bureau starting with the 1990 census. The Census TIGER System provides support for the and related and sample decennial following:   Creation and maintenance of a digital geographic data base that includes complete coverage of the United States, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands of the United States, and the Pacific Island Territories  Production of maps from the Census TIGER data base for all Census Bureau enumeration and publication programs  Ability to assign individual addresses to geographic entities and census blocks based on polygons formed by features such as roads and streams The design of the Census TIGER data base adapts the theories of topology, graph theory, and associated fields of mathematics to provide a disciplined, mathematical description for the geographic structure of the United States and its territories. The topological structure of the Census TIGER data base defines the location and relationship of streets, rivers, railroads, and other features to each other and to the numerous geographic entities for which the Census Bureau tabulates data from its censuses and sample surveys. It is designed to ensure that there is no duplication of features or areas. The building of the Census TIGER data base involved a variety of encoding techniques such as automated map scanning, manual map digitizing, standard data keying, and sophisticated computer file matching. The goal was to provide automated access to, and retrieval of, relevant geographic information about the United States and its territories.  TIGER Data Base Extracts In order for others to use the information in the Census TIGER data base in a geographic information system (GIS) or for other geographic  Overview and Geographic Concepts 1- 1   applications, the Census Bureau releases periodic extracts of the data base, including the TIGER/Line files, to the public. Various versions of the TIGER/Line files have been released; previous versions include the 1990 Census TIGER/Line files, and the 1992, 1994, 1995 and 1997 TIGER/ Line files. The 1992 TIGER/Line files were produced to satisfy a requirement of the US Department of Education and incorporated all of the updates and revisions since the production of the 1990 TIGER/Line files. The 1994 TIGER/Line files were produced to support the programs of the US Department of Transportation, Bureau of Transportation Statistics. The 1995 TIGER/Line files were originally produced to support Phase I of the Census 2000 Redistricting Data Program. The 1997 TIGER/Line files were originally produced to support the Phase I Verification of the Census 2000 Redistricting Data Program and the Census 2000 Participant Statistical Areas Program Delineation.  Relationship of TIGER/Line    to 1990 Census Statistical Data  What makes the TIGER extract products particularly valuable in the GIS environment and to the data user community is the direct linkage between the 1990 decennial census data products and the Census TIGER data base extracts. The digital description in the TIGER data base of the Nations legal and statistical entities includes Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) codes and, for American Indian/Alaska Native Areas only, Census Bureau codes so entities can be easily matched with the 1990 census data. Please refer to the Census Bureau Publication, 1990 Census of Population and Housing Tabulation and Publication Program, for a description of the Public Law (PL) 94-171 data files, Summary Tape Files (STFs), and other sources of data from the 1990 census.  1998 TIGER/Line Files The 1998 TIGER/Line files include files for all counties and statistically equivalent entities in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. The 1998 TIGER/Line files consist of line segments that represent physical features, and legal and statistical boundaries. The files consist of 17 separate record types, including the basic data record, the shape coordinate points (feature shape records), and geographic area codes that can be used with appropriate software to prepare maps. 1-2 1998 TIGER/Line Files   Related Files Summary Tape Files (STFs) provide 1990 statistical data for a wide range of subject headings and geographic entities compatible with the TIGER/ Line files. These files are available on tape and CD-ROM. PL 94-171 Program data files provide selected population data for small area geography (state, county, county subdivision, place, census tract/ block numbering area, block group, and block) and are compatible with the TIGER/Line files. These files are available on tape and CD-ROM. The TIGER/Line 103rd Congressional District File contains just the features that form the boundaries of the districts of the 103rd Congress. The file follows the format of Record Types 1 and 2 of the 1992 TIGER/ Line files. This is a national data set, by state, on one CD-ROM. TIGER/Line 1990 County Files provide the coordinates for the boundaries of all counties and statistically equivalent entities. This is a national data set, by state, on one CD-ROM. The files follow the format of Record Types 1 and 2 of the 1992 TIGER/Line files. The boundaries for the states and statistically equivalent areas are for the legal limits. As such, coastal states show a boundary that is three miles offshore and do not contain additional records that depict the shoreline. The same holds true for interior water; a boundary in the Chesapeake Bay will be shown, but the shore-line will not. TIGER/Line1990 Census Tract/Block Numbering Area Files provide the coordinates and associated feature attributes for the boundaries of all census tract/block numbering areas (CT/BNAs). This is a national data set, by state, on one CD-ROM. The files follow the format of Record Types 1 and 2 of the 1992 TIGER/Line files. North American Statistical Areas Boundary Files (Prototype), were produced by a joint research initiative between the Geography Divisions of Statistics Canada and the United States Bureau of the Census. The goal of the files is to provide data users with a convenient, unified, geographical framework that will help facilitate cross-border spatial studies. The files are in TIGER/Line format and contain geographic  Overview and Geographic Concepts 1- 3   coordinates, various attribute information, and most importantly, geographic identification codes that can be used as links to census data from Canada and the United States. TIGER/Line American Indian/Alaska Native Areas File provides the coordinates for the boundaries of all American Indian and Alaska Native areas (AIANAs) shown in the 1990 census. This file follows the format of Record Types 1 and 2 of the 1992 TIGER/Line files and covers the Nation. TIGER/Line 1990 County Subdivision Files provide the coordinates for the boundaries of all county subdivisions (such as minor civil divisions, census county divisions, and unorganized territory). This is a national data set, by state, on one CD-ROM. The files follow the format of Record Types 1 and 2 of the 1992 TIGER/Line files. TIGER/Line 1990 Place Files provide the aries of all incorporated places (including census designated places (CDPs). This is a one CD-ROM. The files follow the format the 1992 TIGER/Line files. coordinates for the boundconsolidated cities) and national data set, by state, on of Record Types 1 and 2 of  County-Based Files The geographic coverage for a TIGER/Line file is a county or statistically equivalent entity. See Appendix A for a list of state and county codes and Chapter 4 for a description of county equivalent entities. The county files have a coverage area based on the latest legal boundaries obtained in response to the Census Bureaus Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS). Even though the Census TIGER data base represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, the county-based TIGER/Line files are designed to stand alone as an independent data set. The files can be combined to cover the whole Nation and its territories (see the Single-Side Flags and County Boundaries section in Chapter 3).  1-4 1998 TIGER/Line Files   The Data Content of the TIGER/Line Files The TIGER/Line files contain data describing three major types of features:  Line features 1) Roads 2) Railroads 3) Hydrography 4) Miscellaneous transportation features and selected power lines and pipe lines 5) Boundaries   Landmark features 1) Point landmarks such as schools and churches 2) Area landmarks such as parks and cemeteries 3) Key geographic locations (KGLs) such as apartment buildings and factories   Polygon features 1) Geographic entity codes for areas used to tabulate the 1990 census statistical data and current geographic areas 2) Locations of area landmarks 3) Locations of KGLs  The line feature and polygon information form the majority of data in the TIGER/Line files. Some of the data describing the lines include coordinates, feature identifiers (names), feature classification codes, address ranges, and geographic entity codes. Chapter 3 details these data items; Chapter 4 defines the geographic entities and codes. The TIGER/Line files contain point and area labels that describe landmark features. These features provide locational references for field staff and map users. Area landmarks consist of a feature name or label and feature type assigned to a polygon or group of polygons. Landmarks may overlap or refer to the same set of polygons. See Chapter 3 for more information on landmark data.  Overview and Geographic Concepts 1- 5   Topology and Spatial Objects in the TIGER/Line Files Spatial Objects in the TIGER/Line Files The Census TIGER data base uses a collection of spatial objects, points, lines, and polygons, to model or describe real-world geography. The Census Bureau uses these spatial objects to represent features such as streets, and assigns attributes to these features to identify and describe specific features such as the 500 block of Market Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The TIGER/Line files contain information about the spatial objects distributed over a series of record types. Users of the TIGER/Line files may need to link information from several record types to find all the attributes of interest that belong to one spatial object. The final section of this chapter includes a description of the record types.  Topology Topology explains how points, lines, and areas relate to each other and is used as the foundation for organizing spatial objects in the Census TIGER data base. The Census TIGER data base uses points, lines, and areas to provide a disciplined, mathematical description of the features of the earths surface. Spatial objects in the Census TIGER data base are interrelated. A sequence of points define line segments, and line segments connect to define polygons. Topology provides a basic language for describing geographic features. The Census TIGER data base relates information to points or 0-cells, lines or 1-cells, and polygons or 2-cells. The number preceding the cell identifies the dimensionality of the object; for instance, a line segment has a single dimension, length. Each of these objects builds on the others to form higher-level objects. The 0-cells form the end points of 1-cells. The 1-cells connect at 0-cells and form closed figures that partition space into polygons or 2-cells.  1-6 1998 TIGER/Line Files   Terminology The terms point, line segment, and polygon are familiar, but general terms that may have different meanings to data users working with a variety of different applications and data sets. The TIGER/Line file documentation uses the terminology from the Spatial Data Transfer Standard (SDTS). Since the first release of the TIGER/Line files, the US Geological Survey (USGS) has coordinated the development and release of the SDTS, now a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS). The SDTS specifies a series of terms and definitions for spatial objects. Why use the SDTS terminology? Even though the TIGER/Line files do not follow the SDTS format, the TIGER/Line documentation will use these terms and definitions in order to promote a common language for describing geographic data and to facilitate the transition to the SDTS. The spatial objects in TIGER/Line belong to the Geometry and  Topology (GT) class of objects in SDTS. The definitions are from FIPS Publication 173, Spatial Data Transfer Standard (SDTS) (August 28, 1992) Section 2-2, Classification and Intended Use of Objects, pp. 11-20. Node A zero-dimensional object that is a topological junction of two or more links or chains, or an end point of a link or chain, is a node. Entity Point A point used for identifying the location of point features (or areal features collapsed to a point), such as towers, buoys, buildings, places, etc. Complete Chain A chain [a sequence of non-intersecting line segments] that explicitly references left and right polygons and start and end nodes. The shape points combine with the nodes to form the segments that make a complete chain.  Overview and Geographic Concepts 1- 7   Network Chains A chain that explicitly references start and end nodes and not left and right polygons. GT-Polygon An area that is an atomic two-dimensional component of a two-dimensional manifold, [which is defined as] one and only one planar graph and its two-dimensional objects. GT-polygons are elementary polygons that are mutually exclusive and completely exhaust the surface.  Spatial Objects The spatial objects in the TIGER/Line files embody both geometry (coordinate location and shape) and topology (the relationship between points, line objects, and polygons) and therefore belong to the geometry and topology (GT) class of objects in the SDTS. In the SDTS, nodes represent point objects (0-cells) that identify the start and end position of lines or 1-dimensional objects (1-cells) called chains. The chains in the TIGER/ Line files are complete chains because they form polygon boundaries and intersect other chains only at nodes. Topological chains that do not contain polygon information are network chains. Data users may choose not to use the polygon or geographic entity codes and consider the TIGER/ Line files a source of network chain data. Figure 1-1 illustrates the relationship between nodes and complete chains. The figure shows two complete chains forming a central road; a start and end node define each complete chain. Complete chains that meet at an intersection share the same node. As the figure suggests, complete chains may consist of one or more line segments that describe the shape and position of the complete chain. Shape points define the line segments and are not part of the topology of the TIGER/Line files. Shape points and the resulting line segments are attributes of the complete chains. When complete chains link node to node and form a closed figure (a 2-cell), a GT-polygon results. The GT-polygon containing Friendship Park in Figure 1-1 is bounded by five complete chains that share five nodes. GT-polygons are elementary units; they are not subdivided into smaller polygons. The polygons completely encompass the area  1-8 1998 TIGER/Line Files   Figure 1-1 Basic TIGER/Line File Topology The illustration below shows a generalized block that consists of three GT-polygons (GT stands for geometry and topology). The block contains a point landmark (Parkside School) inside GT-polygon 2 and an area landmark (Friendship Park) that is coextensive with GT-polygon 3.  Entity Point/Point Landmark location (entity points are independent of the GT-polygon complete chain topology)  Start Node  School Ave There are two shape points on the complete chain that extends from the start node to the end node.  Parkside School  GT-POLYGON 2  GT-POLYGON 1  End Node  Friendship Park This complete chain does not form a polygon boundary.  GT-POLYGON 3  Park Ave  Actual Street Curb Location Node--A zero-dimensional object that incorporates topology and geometry. Each marks the intersection or end point of a complete chain.  Shape Point-- A zero-dimensional object that defines the curvature of a complete chain, but is not required to describe the topology of the complete chain (unlike nodes at intersections or end points). Point Landmark--An entity point that identifies the location of a point landmark. Polygon Interior Points--A point associated with, and inside of, a polygon. Complete Chain--A one-dimensional object having topological and geometric characteristics.  Overview and Geographic Concepts 1-9   they represent and there is no gap or overlap between adjacent polygons. The geographic entities and area landmarks in the TIGER/Line files are associated with one, or a set of GT-polygons. The TIGER/Line files contain point landmark data that are not included in the Census TIGER data base topology. Point landmarks are entity points that mark the location of points of interest and are not connected to complete chains or GT-polygons. The following table summarizes the terms for spatial objects in the TIGER/Line files: Point (0-cell) Topology Non-topology Attribute Node Entity Point Shape Point Line (1-cell) Complete Chain or Network Chain Polygon (2-cell) GT-polygon  Features The Census TIGER data base uses the term feature to informally describe spatial objects more complex than nodes, complete chains, or GT-polygons. For instance, Main Street is a feature that may consist of a series of complete chains with the same name. The Census TIGER data base contains complete chains, but does not contain features or link complete chains to features.  Left- and Right-Side Data Fields If one is standing on a complete chain at the start node facing the end node, data listed in the fields carrying a right qualifier would be found to the right of the complete chain. Notice the position of the start and end nodes for the road in the central section of Figure 1-1; the rightside of the complete chain corresponds to GT-polygon 1 and the leftside corresponds to GT-polygon 2. From the information contained in this basic record, data users can collect the complete chains necessary to construct intersecting polygons and features.  1-10 1998 TIGER/Line Files   Single-Layer Topology All spatial objects in the TIGER/Line files exist in a single data layer that includes roads, hydrography, railroads, boundary lines, and miscellaneous features; they are topologically linked. For instance, nodes mark the intersections of roads and rivers. Subsurface features such as tunnels or above surface features such as bridges also create nodes when they cross surface features even though there is no direct realworld connection.  Introduction to the TIGER/Line    File Structure  The 1998 TIGER/Line files are extracts of selected information from the Census TIGER data base, organized as topologically consistent networks. The records in these TIGER/Line files represent features traditionally found on a paper map. Each complete chain is classified by codes that describe the type of feature it represents. The 1998 TIGER/Line files consist of 17 record types that collectively contain geographic information (attributes) such as address ranges and ZIP Codes and their Add-On codes for street complete chains, names, feature classification codes, codes for legal and statistical entities, latitude/longitude coordinates of linear and point features, landmark features, area landmarks, key geographic features, and area and polygon boundaries. A separate file exists for each of the 17 record types for each county or county equivalent. The file for each county (or equivalent) is identified by the state and county FIPS code after the tgr in the file name (for example, tgr42107.rt1). The suffixes used for the record type files have been changed to make it easier to identify each record type file (when working with uncompressed versions of the county files). The suffix consistently is .rtn where n is the record type. The TIGER/Line data dictionary in Chapter 6 contains a complete list of all the fields in the 17 record types. Separate chapters cross-list the fields by feature attribute and geographic entity type. The next section provides a summary of 1998 TIGER/Line file record types.  Overview and Geographic Concepts 1- 11   1998 TIGER/Line File Record Types Record Type 1 -- Complete Chain Basic Data Record Record Type 1 provides a single record for each unique complete chain in the TIGER/Line files. The basic data record contains the end nodes for the complete chain. This record also contains address ranges and ZIP Codes (for most areas of the country where a street name/house numbering system existed at the time of data extraction from the Census TIGER data base) and the current census geographic entity codes for each side of the complete chain. Additional feature identifier, address range, and ZIP Code data related to Record Type 1 are found on Record Types 4, 5, 6, and Z. Additional current and 1990 geographic entity codes related to Record Type 1 are found on Record Type 3.  Record Type 2 -- Complete Chain Shape Coordinates Record Type 2 provides an additional series of latitude and longitude coordinate values describing the shape of each complete chain in Record Type 1 that is not a straight line segment. That is, not all complete chains in Record Type 1 have shape points and therefore not all have an associated Record Type 2. Where a complete chain in Record Type 1 is not a straight line, Record Type 2 may have a many-to-one relationship with Record Type 1.  Record Type 3 -- Complete Chain Geographic Entity Codes Record Type 3 includes the 1990 voting district (VTD) codes provided to the Census Bureau for the 1990 Census Redistricting Data Program. It also includes the current Census Bureau geographic area codes for the American Indian/TJSA/TDSA/ANVSA areas, and the Alaska Native Regional Corporations. It also includes 1990 geographic codes for a variety of geographic area types. In the 1994 and later TIGER/Line files, all references to the 1980 geographic area codes have been eliminated. In addition, many fields have been replaced with the geographic area codes that were used to tabulate the 1990 census. These codes were previously in Record Type 1. Record Type 3 has a one-to-one relationship with Record Type 1. To identify the 1990 census state and county codes for a complete chain, one must use Record Type 3. 1-12 1998 TIGER/Line Files   Record Type 4 -- Index to Alternate Feature Identifiers Record Type 4 provides an index to alternate feature names associated with the complete chain (Record Type 1). A Record Type 4 will not exist for a Record Type 1 that has only one name. A complete chain can have more than one alternate name. Record Type 4 has a many-toone relationship with Record Type 1 and a many-to-one relationship with Record Type 5.  Record Type 5 -- Complete Chain Feature Identifiers Record Type 5 contains a list of all unique feature names for complete chains in the TIGER/Line files. Each name (or feature identifier) has an identification code number (FEAT). Record Type 5 has a oneto-many relationship with Record Type 4 and a one-to-many relationship with Record Type 9.  Record Type 6 -- Additional Address Range and ZIP Code Data Record Type 6 provides additional address range information for a street complete chain when the information cannot be presented as a single address range (for example, the house/building numbers are not uniformly arranged to form an address range). Record Type 6 appears only for those counties that have address ranges and ZIP Code information in the Census TIGER data base. There is no assurance that the address ranges provided on Record Type 6 will cover fewer addresses than the address ranges appearing on Record Type 1. Data users must use Record Type 6 to obtain the entire picture of the potential address ranges along a complete chain. The address ranges used for geocoding along corporate corridors and corporate offset limits appear only in Record Type 6. Record Type 6 has a many-to-one relationship with Record Type 1 and a one-toone relationship with Record Type Z.  Record Type 7 -- Landmark Features Record Type 7 contains the area and point landmarks from the Census TIGER data base. If Record Type 7 represents an area landmark rather than a point landmark, then a one-to-one relationship exists with Record Type 8. If a county file has no landmarks, empty files for Record Types 7  Overview and Geographic Concepts 1- 13   or 8 will exist for that county. Record Type 7 now excludes all key geographic locations (KGLs) that contain an actual or imputed address and have a ZIP+4 Add-On code. These will now appear in Record Type 9.  Record Type 8 -- Polygons Linked to Area Landmarks Record Type 8 links the polygon identification codes with the area landmark identification codes. If a county file does not have any area landmarks in Record Type 7, there will be no Type 8 records. Record Type 8 has a many-to-many relationship with Record Type P.  Record Type 9 -- Key Geographic Location Features Record Type 9 consists only of KGLs in the Census TIGER data base that have an actual or imputed address and a ZIP+4 Add-On code. This record type lists the names and structure numbers of special geocoding addresses such as named apartment buildings, shopping centers, and airports. If the structure number of the special geocoding address is a street address, then the FEAT field links Record Type 9 to Record Type 5 where the street name associated with the address is listed. The KGLs contained in this record type are not included in Record Types 7 or 8, and have no LAND (landmark identification number). Record Type 9 has a many-to-one relationship with Record Type P.  Record Type A -- Polygon Geographic Entity Codes Record Type A contains a record for each polygon represented by Record Type P in the TIGER/Line files. The Census Bureau provides the basic 1990 census geographic entity codesstate, county, county subdivision, place, American Indian/Alaska Native Areas, census tract/BNA, block on this record type to assist data users who are interested only in polygon information. Record Type A also includes the Census Transportation Planning Package Area code, school district codes, and urban/rural classification information, as well as fields for the 106th and 108th Congressional Districts (the 108th field is blank for this release).  Record Type C -- Geographic Entity Names Record Type C provides information previously supplied in the TIGER/Geographic NameTM files. A unique list of all geographic codes,  1-14 1998 TIGER/Line Files   their associated name, and some entity attributes is supplied for data users in a flat (nonhierarchical) file. It contains a FIPS Year field that may have three values: 1990 for geographic names and codes valid for the 1990 census, 199n (where 199n is the year of extraction from the Census TIGER data base) for geographic names and codes valid for the current year, or blank when the geographic names and codes are the same as for 1990 and 199n. Multiple records for the same geographic entity show its change or correction over time. Record Type C is linked to other record types (1, 3, A, S) through geographic area codes.  Record Type H -- TIGER/Line ID History Record Type H provides the history of each TIGER/Line ID when complete chains (Record Type 1) are split or merged, but the source of the change will be blank for this version. Record Type H shows the TLIDs of the complete chains in existence after the split or prior to the merge.  Record Type I -- Link Between Complete Chains and Polygons Record Type I links Record Type 1, the complete chain basic data, to Record Type P, the polygon internal point. The Record Type I to Record Type 1 link (TLID) may be used to link complete chain attributes and other data record types (2, 3, 4, 6, H, and Z) to each other. The Record I to Record Type P link (CENID and POLYID) may be used to link polygon attributes and other data record types (8, 9, A, and S) to each other. Record Type I has a one-to-one relationship with Record Type 1, but a many-toone relationship with Record Type P. When Record Type I is linked to a single-sided Record Type 1 (county boundary), it will provide only the left- or the right-polygon identifier.  Record Type P -- Polygon Internal Point There is a Record Type P for every polygon in the TIGER/Line files. Record Type P has a one-to-many relationship with Record Type I and identifies the internal point coordinates for each polygon. See the Internal Points section in Chapter 3.  Overview and Geographic Concepts 1- 15   The TIGER/Line files include all complete chains and polygons in the Census TIGER data base. The topology of the Census TIGER data base ensures that a one-to-one relationship exists between the polygons constructed from Record Types 1 and 2 and Record Type P.  Record Type R -- TIGER/Line ID Record Number Range Record Type R contains the range of unique complete chain record numbers (TLIDs) assigned to a census file in a nationwide scheme. Record Type R has the lowest (minimum allowable), and the highest (maximum allowable) record numbers for the range. Numbers are assigned to complete chains beginning at the lowest value. The current number is the highest record number for the census file used. Each TIGER/Line file consists of an entire county or statistical equivalent. In the Census TIGER data base, the county or statistical equivalent may be split into many partitions. The Census Bureau assigns permanent record numbers to each of these partitions. These record numbers are found in Record Type R. Record Type R is not directly linked to any other record type.  Record Type S -- Polygon Additional Geographic Entity Codes Record Type S contains a record for each polygon represented by Record Type P in the TIGER/Line files. Record Type S contains geographic area codes that identify polygons. Most of the geographic area codes reflect current geography as of the time of extraction from the Census TIGER data base. Except for Hawaii, Record Type S contains no CDP information since CDPs are considered part of the 1990 census geography, not current geography.  Record Type Z -- ZIP+4 Codes Record Type Z provides Postal +4 Add-On codes that make ZIP+4 codes out of the ZIP Codes on Type 1 and Type 6 records. Record Type Z has a one-to-one relationship with Record Type 1 and a oneto-one relationship with Record Type 6.  1-16 1998 TIGER/Line Files   The Relationship Between Spatial Objects and TIGER/Line Record Types    The TIGER/Line files do not have specific record types for each spatial object. Nodes, for example, do not have a separate record type; node coordinates appear with other data in Record Type 1. Defining a complete chain requires information from Record Types 1, 2, and I. Record Types 1 and 2 alone describe the set of network chains. GT-polygons require the combined information of Record Types 1, 2, I, and P. See Chapter 3 for a discussion on how to link data using different types of spatial objects.  Linkages Between Record Types All the record types except Record Type R contain fields (such as TLID, FEAT, CENID, POLYID, LAND, or a geographic area code) that are used to link together data from the record types. Chapter 2 discusses the TLID, CENID, POLYID, and LAND identification codes in detail. Figure 1-2 shows the record linkage keys. When different record types have a common key with the same data, a linkage can be made between the records. Some of the links are direct, while others are indirect and require a connection through an intermediate record type. An entire TIGER/Line file can be navigated using the record linkage keys. Linkages may be made to data external to a TIGER/Line file. Record Types 1, 3, A, and S contain geographic area code keysthe current or 1990 census geographic entity codesthat may be linked to the Census Bureaus statistical data (the PL 94-171 data and the several Summary Tape Files or STFs). For the PL 94-171 data and STFs based on 1990 census data, one must use Record Type 3 or Record Type A. With geographic information systems for processing and display, data users can use the geographic area codes to link data tabulations with the geographic data.

All record types have a 4-character field for the version code. For releases after TIGER/Line 1995, including this release, the version code is assigned as MMYY which represents the month and year that the file was created. The month and year are currently extracted from the system date as each county file is created. This means that county files created for the same program are likely to have different version codes. Adjacent counties in a state may have different version codes if they were extracted at different points in time. This will make it easier for users to determine the latest version of the data if they have several versions of the TIGER/Line files for a county. The version codes for earlier releases of the TIGER/Line files are as follows: 0000 -- TIGER/Line Precensus File, 1990 0002 -- TIGER/Line Initial Voting District Codes File, 1990 0003 -- TIGER/Line Census File, 1990 0005 -- TIGER/Line File, 1992 0021 -- TIGER/Line File, 1994 0024 -- TIGER/Line File, 1995  TIGER/Line  Identification Number (TLID) The TIGER/Line files use a permanent 10-digit TIGER/Line record identification number (TLID) to uniquely identify a complete chain for the Nation.  TLID Codes The 10-digit TLID will not exceed the value 231  1 (2,147,483,647) and will represent the same complete chain in all versions of this file, beginning with the TIGER/Line Precensus Files, 1990. The minimum value is 100,001. Topological changes to the complete chain will cause the TLIDs to change. For instance, when updates split an existing complete chain, each of the new parts receives a new TLID; the old TLID is not reused.  Version Code and Identification Numbers 2-1   As distributed, TIGER/Line files are grouped by county (or equivalent). A complete chain representing a segment of the boundary between two neighboring counties will have different TLID codes even though the complete chain represents the exact same feature on the ground. See the section, User-Defined Changes to the TIGER/Line Files, in this chapter. Record Type R contains the range of unique complete chain record numbers assigned to a census file in a nationwide scheme. Record Type R has the lowest (minimum) and the highest (maximum) record numbers for the range. Permanent record numbers are assigned within each partition of the Census TIGER data base. Numbers are assigned to complete chains beginning at the minimum value and increasing the current value by one until it reaches the maximum value. Record Type H, which first appeared in the 1994 version, shows the history of a particular TLID, whether combined or split, and its predecessors or successors.  TLID Record Locations The TLID field appears in columns 6 through 15 of the following record types:     Record Record Record Record Type Type Type Type 1 2 3 4  Record Type 6  Record Type I  Record Type Z  The TLID field appears in columns 11 through 20 in Record Type H.  TLID Record Linkages The TLID field provides a key for linking records containing primary attributes describing the complete chain or the geographic entity codes associated with the left and the right sides of the complete chain. Record Type I contains the key fields required to link the TLID and the GT-polygon identification fields, CENID and POLYID. See Figure 1-2 in Chapter 1.  2-2 1998 TIGER/Line Files   TLID Sort Sequence Each record type is a separate file. The records in each record type do not have an overall sort sequence. Data users may wish to sort the file by TLID in order to facilitate record linkages.  User-Defined Changes to the TIGER/Line Files TLID as a Standard Identification Number Users should store the record number and the version code associated with each complete chain in their local systems to ensure their ability to match records with earlier or later versions of the TIGER/Line files. The record and version numbers of each complete chain provide an important link to the corresponding complete chain in the Census TIGER data base. This key will allow users to transfer new information from later Census Bureau TIGER/Line releases into their data base, and to provide the Census Bureau with readily usable updates, should they wish to do so.  Feature Changes Users should assign a new record number (TLID) and a version number with a value greater than 5000 to each new complete chain they create in order to avoid duplicating a Census Bureau-assigned record number that may appear elsewhere in the national file. Users should create a new record for each new complete chain, including those formed when a new intersection splits an existing complete chain. If a complete chain has been assigned different feature identifiers, attributes, and/or coordinate positions without being merged with or split from another complete chain, it is a modified complete chain and does not need a new TLID. Users may wish to mark these changes; the Census Bureau will use this information to identify changes more quickly and accurately. Users should assign a version code equal to 4999 for all deleted complete chain and landmark records. This version code will allow the Census Bureau to positively identify all user deletions. Users may assign or reassign polygon and landmark identification numbers in any manner that uniquely identifies each within a file.  Version Code and Identification Numbers 2-3   TIGER/Line  Polygon Identification Numbers (CENID, POLYID) The Census Bureau uses two fields, the census file identification code (CENID) and the polygon identification code (POLYID), to uniquely identify GT-polygons. The CENID is a Census Bureau alphanumeric identifier used to uniquely number the GT-polygons within its TIGER partitions. CENIDs are a recode of the FIPS state and county codes for the partitions (files) that form the national Census TIGER data base. Since the partitions may include only a portion of a county, the TIGER/Line files may contain multiple CENIDs. The polygon identification number (POLYID) is a temporary number assigned to every polygon in the Census TIGER data base. Although this number is part of the data base design, it is a dynamic number and can change between different versions of the TIGER/Line files. The Census TIGER data base does not contain permanent identifiers for GT-polygons as it does for complete chains. POLYID is unique only within CENID; in cases where a TIGER/Line file contains more than one CENID, the POLYID may not be unique within that file. Within each CENID, the value for the POLYID starts with 1 and increments sequentially until all polygons are numbered.  CENID and POLYID Codes In the 1992 and 1994 versions of the TIGER/Line files, the CENID is a 5-digit numeric code. In the 1995, 1997 TIGER/Line files and the 1998 TIGER/Line files, the CENID is a 5-character alpha-numeric code to allow for a wider range of codes without increasing field length. Record Type R contains a list of all valid CENIDs used in each county TIGER/Line file. The POLYID code is an integer identification number, without leading zeros, applied to each GT-polygon. The POLYID with a value of 1 refers to the universal polygon, the polygon that refers to all space outside a county coverage area and is excluded from Record Types A, I, P, and S.  2-4 1998 TIGER/Line Files   The range of POLYID numbers in a county file may contain gaps or skipped numbers resulting from the use of one partition (CENID) for more than one TIGER/Line county file. POLYID numbers also may duplicate in a single TIGER/Line  file as they are unique only within CENID. A single TIGER/Line file may contain CENID information from many other census files. Either the CENIDL and POLYIDL, or CENIDR and POLYIDR fields in Record Type I will have a blank value where the complete chain is a county boundary.  CENID and POLYID Record Locations The CENID and POLYID fields appear in the following record types:  Record Type 8  Records exist only for area landmark GT-polygons  Record Type 9  Records exist for all KGLs  Record Type A  Records exist for all GT-polygons  Record Type I  Contains left- and right-side CENIDs and POLYIDs associated with each complete chain  Record Type P  Records exist for all GT-polygons  Record Type R  Contains only CENID; Record Type R lists the minimum and maximum possible TLIDs, and the highest TLID from each census file (CENID) used to generate the current version of the TIGER/Line files.  Record Type S  Records exist for all GT-polygons  CENID and POLYID Record Linkages The TIGER/Line files use both the CENID and POLYID fields to link all of the polygon record types together (Record Types A, P, and S), to link the GT-polygons to the associated complete chains, and to link area landmarks to GT-polygons (see Figure 1-2, in Chapter 1). The CENID and POLYID fields link the geographic area codes in Record Types A and S to Record Type P which contains the coordinates for an internal point in the GT-polygon. The TIGER/Line files include a Type A and a Type S record for each Type P record.  Version Code and Identification Numbers 2-5   Record Type I provides a link between the GT-polygon records and the record types containing complete chain attributes (Record Types 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6). Each Type I record identifies a complete chain by TLID with a left- and right-side GT-polygon. Here CENIDL and POLYIDL contain the CENID and POLYID codes for the GT-polygon on the left side of the line. Likewise, CENIDR and POLYIDR contain the CENID and POLYID codes for the GT-polygon on the right side of the line. There is a Type I record for each Type 1 record. All CENID and POLYID codes appear in Record Type I. To find all of the complete chains that form the boundary of a specific GT-polygon, search Record Type I for a match with either the left or the right CENID and POLYID. Where the left and the right CENID and POLYID codes are the same, the complete chain is internal to the GTpolygon (e.g., a dead-end street). Record Type 8 provides a link between the GT-polygons and the landmark feature records. See the section, TIGER/Line Landmark Identification Numbers, in this chapter.  CENID and POLYID Sort Sequence The POLYID codes appear in numeric sequence by alphanumeric CENID in Record Types 9, A, P, and S. There is no systematic CENID or POLYID sequence in Record Type I.  TIGER/Line  Landmark Identification Numbers (LAND) The landmark feature identification number (LAND) is a 10-digit number that uniquely identifies both point and area landmarks within each county file. LAND is not a permanent number; the Census Bureau assigns LANDs each time a new version of the TIGER/Line files is produced. Within each county, LANDs are assigned beginning with 1 and are incremented sequentially until all features are numbered. In rare situations, Record Type 7 may list the same LAND number more than once if the landmark has more than one feature name.  2-6 1998 TIGER/Line Files   Each name appears as a separate data record in Record Type 7. These data records describe the same landmark and have the same LAND. Overlapping landmarks (e.g., a pond located in a park) may cause more than one name to be assigned to a GT-polygon. However, overlapping landmarks are separate features with different LANDs.  LAND Codes The LAND is an integer number that does not contain leading zeros. It is assigned during the extraction of the data and is not a permanent number. There may be gaps in the sequence of the LANDs in Record Type 7 because of the way this information is extracted.  LAND Record Locations The LAND field appears in the following record types:  Record Type 7  Landmark attributes  Record Type 8  Linkage record containing the LAND and the CENID and POLYID fields  LAND Record Linkages Record Type 8 links each area landmarks LAND with a CENID and POLYID. Each area landmark will have one or more Type 8 records that together identify all of the GT-polygons that make up the landmark.  LAND Sort Sequence Record Type 7 and 8 contain records sorted in ascending order by LAND. In Record Type 8, each LAND is repeated for each GT-polygon covered by the area landmark.  Version Code and Identification Numbers 2-7    Chapter 3: Attributes of Geographic Objects Line Features Line features consist of one or more complete chains that share common attributes such as feature identifiers, address ranges, and census feature class descriptions.  Feature Identifiers The feature identification fields contain either a general type label or a specific proper name assigned to a complete chain that identifies the feature. Each complete chain that is a part of a named feature, such as US Highway 1, has the same feature identifier. The TIGER/Line files use several related data fields to provide a structured description of the feature identifier:     Feature Feature Feature Feature Direction Prefix Name (e.g., US Type (Roosevelt Direction Suffix (e.g., N Adams Ave) Highway 1 , Jefferson St) Blvd, Mangosteen River ) (e.g., Providence St NE )  Most named street/highway features have a feature type. Numerous exceptions exist; for example, Broadway consists of a feature name with no type specified. Do not confuse feature types that form proper names with the census feature classification scheme. In the Census TIGER data base, feature names are assigned to line features independently of the census feature class codes (CFCCs) of the line features. For example, major airports usually have an express highway leading to the terminal area. This highway does not have an interstate highway name such as I-95, but may have the CFCC of an interstate highway (A11) because it has the same characteristics as an interstate highway (limited access with separated, multiple lanes). The feature identifiers of line features that are roads may include either a direction prefix or suffix. Some may have both a direction prefix and suffix.  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3- 1   The feature name fields for line features that are roads may contain both a name and a feature type. For all hydrography and non-road features, the feature type will follow the feature name in the feature name field. In some instances, the feature type is commonly considered part of the name and is combined with the feature name in the TIGER/Line files to avoid confusion; for example, US Hwy 1. The Census TIGER System identifies US Hwy as a feature type used as a prefix to the name and 1 as the feature name. The feature types, such as US Highway, State Highway, and Interstate that normally precede the name appear in the name field. Generic feature identifiers have a name listed in the names field, but do not have a feature type or direction. Some examples of generic names include ramp, power line, and reservoir. Generic feature identifiers are selectively added to features that do not have proper names. In most cases, complete chains without proper names have no feature identifier. The TIGER/Line files do not support a data level above the complete chain that allows the construction of higher level objects (features). Complete chains with the same name may represent separate features; for example, a county may contain several Main Streets located in different geographic entities (e.g., towns or cities) scattered throughout the county. The ability to group chains together to include the entire length of a street feature, such as US Route 66, depends on the uniqueness of the identifiers and the consistency of the feature identifiers along the length of the feature. The Census Bureau makes no guarantee that the complete chains have uniform names or contain all of the known feature identifiers. The Census Bureau has taken steps to improve the consistency of feature identifiers and to add feature identifiers to fill in gaps along street features. The Census Bureau also has eliminated some alternate spellings in favor of the spelling confirmed by the ZIP+4 file of the US Postal Service. The census feature class codes (CFCCs) may vary for chains with the same feature identifier. For example, the most frequent CFCC for a state highway is A21, but the complete chains marking the location of State Highway 32 may have a CFCC of A01, A21, or A31 (see the Census Feature Class Codes section in this chapter).  3-2 1998 TIGER/Line Files   The TIGER/Line file structure allows up to 4,996 feature identifiers for a complete chain. The primary feature identifier appears in Record Type 1. For street features, the primary feature identifier is usually the name most commonly associated with the address range. Up to five alternate feature identifiers are cross-referenced in each Type 4 record, and a single complete chain can have up to 999 Type 4 records. Alternate feature identifiers include highway designation numbers for named streets, former names, and alternate spellings where source material provided conflicting data. Where the complete chain represents a limited access highway, the highway type and route designator, such as I-95, should ideally become the primary name, and the local designation, such as Cross County Expressway or Capital Beltway, should become the alternate name. However, this is not always true in the TIGER/Line files. The primary and alternate feature identifiers can be independent of each other. There is no assurance that the same combination of primary and alternate feature identifiers will appear together in a sequence of complete chains. There also is no assurance that a feature identifier will consistently appear as the primary identifier; it might be recorded as an alternate feature identifier for some complete chains and a primary feature identifier for others. During TIGER improvement operations, the Census Bureau has taken steps to make the Interstate highway route designator the primary feature identifier for Interstate highways, and the common street name used in mail delivery the primary name on all other roads. The order of identifiers follows this hierarchy: Interstate highway, common name, US highway, county highway, with town and township road at the bottom of the list. Record Type 5 contains a record for each feature identifier used as either a primary or an alternate name. The TIGER/Line files link the alternate names in Record Type 5 to Record Type 1 through the use of the alternate feature identification code index that forms Record Type 4. See the Feature Identifier Record Linkage section in this chapter.

See Appendix DStandard Abbreviations.  Feature Types The feature type field for road features consists of a 4-character text string. For all hydrography and non-road features, the feature type will follow the feature name in the feature name field. The abbreviations in Appendix DStandard Abbreviations may appear in the feature type field or the feature name field. Data Limitations and Notes In earlier versions of the TIGER/Line files, users did not find many roads with alternate names in the GBF/ DIME-File coverage areas; if an alternate name was provided, it usually represented another local name and not a route number. TIGER improvement operations have since added route identifiers to many of these areas. Corporate Corridors and Corporate Offset Boundaries A corporate corridor is a narrow, linear part of an incorporated place (or in a few instances, another legal entity). The corporate corridor includes the street and/or right-of-way, or a portion of the street and/or right-ofway within the incorporated place. It excludes from the incorporated place those structures such as houses, apartments, or businesses that front along the street or road. A corporate limit offset boundary exists where the incorporated place lies on one side of the street and may include all or part of the street or right-of-way, but excludes from the incorporated place, the structures located along that side of the street. See Figure 4-4 in Chapter 4. To facilitate address coding, the Census TIGER data base contains duplicate street name and address ranges on complete chains with a CFCC of F11 (nonvisible offset boundary) or F12 (nonvisible corporate corridor). The duplicate street names for the F11 and F12 features are on Record Type 5; the duplicate address ranges are on Record Type 6. Record Type 1 will not contain feature identifiers for complete chains with CFCCs of F11 or F12.  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3- 5   Feature Identifier Record Linkage Record Type 4 provides the link required to find any alternate feature identifiers belonging to a complete chain. Record Type 4 cross-references each TLID with an Alternate Feature ID code (FEAT) assigned to each record in Record Type 5. Record Type 5 contains all feature identifiers including those that are used only as primary identifiers. However, only the FEATs for complete chains that have alternate feature identifiers appear in Record Type 4. Complete chains that have no alternate feature identifier will have no Type 4 record. To find the alternate feature identifiers for a complete chain, begin by determining the TLID for the complete chain. Then search for this TLID in Record Type 4. If the complete chain has any alternate feature identifiers, Record Type 4 should provide at least one record. Once found, the Record Type 4 entries will each contain from one to five FEAT numbers. The FEAT fields are blank when no further alternative identifiers exist. The first FEAT field (FEAT1) should always have a valid FEAT number. Finally, find the records in the Record Type 5 file that match the FEAT codes from Record Type 4. The TIGER/ Line file provides a record sequence number to identify multiple Type 4 records that might exist for one TLID. Even though Record Type 5 contains all feature identifiers, Record Type 4 contains only references for alternate feature identifiers. Data users cannot link all of the names in Record Type 5 to all of the associated complete chains in Record Type 1 by using Record Type 4.

A FEAT is assigned sequentially, beginning with 1, to each feature identifier in Record Type 5. The FEAT is not a permanent identification number. TLID is the record identifier for the complete chain. See Chapter 2 for a full discussion of TLIDs. RTSQ is a 3-digit integer that uniquely identifies multiple Type 4 records with the same TLID. RTSQ equals 1 for the first occurrence of a TLID in Record Type 4 and can reach a maximum of 999 for subsequent occurrences.  Address Ranges and ZIP Codes    The TIGER/Line files contain address ranges, not individual addresses. The term address range refers to the first possible structure number and the last possible structure number along a complete chain side relative to the direction in which the complete chain is coded. The address ranges in the TIGER/Line files are predominantly potential ranges that include the full range of possible structure numbers even though the actual structures might not exist. The address numbers used to create the address ranges are commonly known as city-style addresses. A city-style address minimally consists of a structure number, street name, and a 5-digit ZIP Code; for example, 213Main St 90210. In the TIGER/Line files, the ZIP Codes usually appear only on those complete chains that have address ranges identified. However, they may appear on some road features without the address ranges.  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3- 7   An address range also may have the full 9-digit ZIP Code that includes the USPSs 4-digit ZIP+4 Add-On code. The Census Bureau has added the Postal Add-On code to the Census TIGER data base using an automated match to the USPSs AMS II ZIP+4 file. The codes in the TIGER/ Line files are the street-level codes the USPS has assigned to address ranges. The USPS may assign more specific codes to companies and buildings, and to apartments, floors, or suites within buildings. Some address coding software that uses the AMS II ZIP+4 file may provide the more specific codes. However, the TIGER/Line files contain only the more general codes. Usually the ZIP+4 Add-On code is not required to uniquely identify an address range. There are a few situations where a street name and address range legitimately appear more than once in the same 5-digit ZIP Code. Usually the USPS distinguishes these duplicates by using different postal station names. However, the Postal Add-On code will uniquely identify these cases. Puerto Rico is a special case because many addresses were uniquely assigned within an urbanizacion (a community or development) and could duplicate another address in a different urbanizacion with the same 5-digit ZIP Code. To resolve this problem, the USPS added an additional line to the address to identify the urbanizacion. The 9-digit ZIP Code also may serve to uniquely identify these address ranges. We do not yet have all of these 9-digit ZIP Codes in the Census TIGER data base.  Address Ranges Complete chains in the TIGER/Line files have one end point labeled as the start node and the other end point labeled as the end node. The start and end nodes also are referred to as from and to. The start node always corresponds to the beginning of the complete chain identified by the start node coordinates FRLAT and FRLONG. The order of the addresses follows the sequence of the nodes on the complete chain; the nodes may not be related to the low to high orientation of the address range. The start address may be higher or lower than the end address for a complete chain. Structure numbers usually, but not always, systematically increase or decrease while moving along a street in a set direction from one complete chain to the next (see Figure 3-1).  3-8 1998 TIGER/Line Files   Figure 3-1 TIGER/Line Address Range Basics The TIGER/Line  files contain potential address ranges for city-style addresses. The complete chain (between the start node and the end node) in the diagram below has two address ranges; the left side has odd-numbered addresses and the right side has the complementary even-numbered addresses. Potential address ranges along a complete chain have values that encompass the addresses of existing structures, as well as those not yet built.  Actual Address  Potential Address Range  101  105  107  113  101-119 Start Node  Oak Ave  100-118  LEFT RIGHT  End Node  100  102  104  106  108  110  Record Type 1 contains separate data fields for both the start and end of each address range.  Record Type 1 RT TLID FENAME FETYPE 1 0007654320 Oak Ave  Address Range Left side Start End Right Side Start End  FRADDL TOADDL 101 119  FRADDR TOADDR 100 118  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3-9   Record Type 1 contains the initial address ranges for the left and the right sides of a complete chain. A complete chain side may have multiple address ranges. Often this occurs when address ranges are split to accommodate different 9-digit ZIP Codes. The TIGER/Line files use Record Type 6 to store any additional ranges as required. The Type 1 record will hold the ranges with the largest sequence of numbers. However, Record Type 6 may hold a significant number of additional ranges. Data users must use Record Type 6 to obtain the entire picture of the possible address ranges along a complete chain. In Record Types 1 and 6, both the left- and the right-side address ranges have a start and an end address range field that can contain a maximum of 11-alphanumeric characters. The address range fields are right-justified. Each address range in the TIGER/Line files has only one parity. Only odd-numbered addresses are contained within an address range with odd start and end structure numbers. Likewise, only even-numbered addresses belong to an address range with even start and end structure numbers. The value zero is not used as a valid address range end value. Generally, the left and the right sides of a complete chain have opposite parities. If both odd and even addresses exist on the same side of a complete chain, the TIGER/Line files provide both an even and an odd parity range for that side of the complete chain. One of the ranges appears in Record Type 1, while the other range appears separately in Record Type 6. Some address ranges may include single value ranges, such as 16-16, referred to as include addresses. These include addresses are anomalies; they may have a parity different than the prevailing address range on the complete chain side, or appear as an outlier from an adjoining range that does not fit within the range belonging to the complete chain where it is located. For example, the location of 16 Osage St falls on the predominantly odd-numbered left side of the complete chain with the address range 1-99. The range 16-16 will appear as an additional include range on the left side of the street. The even address range 2-98 on the right side of the street must exclude the number 16 structure number; the right address range becomes two ranges, 2-14 and 18-98. Outliers follow the same pattern. For example, 10 Persimmon St may appear on the side of the complete chain with the range 100-198 and not on the complete chain with the  3-10 1998 TIGER/Line Files   range 2-98. As before, 10-10 would become an additional range added to the complete chain with the range 100-198, and the address range 2-98 would become two ranges, 2-8 and 12-98. Because include address ranges require complex edits that may involve several complete chains, the Census Bureau cannot guarantee that all address duplication has been identified and eliminated. Some basic characteristics of address ranges are as follows:  The TIGER/Line files generally contain only those city-style address ranges used for mail delivery. They do not show rural route and post office box addresses. They may contain structure numbers assigned in select areas for use by local emergency services, but not for mail delivery. The TIGER/Line files do include address ranges and ZIP Codes in some small places where the USPS provides only post office box service, not street delivery. These address ranges represent the structure numbers collected during the 1990 census field operations, while the ZIP Codes represent the post office boxes. The address ranges in these areas do not have Postal Add-On codes since the USPS does not use them for street delivery.  Gaps may exist between multiple ranges for a single complete chain. A gap may be significant, since any numbers missing from one complete chain may actually appear on another complete chain in the case of address anomalies such as out-of-parity or out-of-sequence addresses (see Figure 3-2).  In a few rare cases, address ranges can include numbers with alphabetic characters. These characters help uniquely identify addresses within a county. For instance, certain unincorporated areas of Genesee County, Michigan add a letter G prefix to the address number. The characters are consistently placed within the address range field; for example, the letter G maintains a consistent column placement in the range G1 to G99 (see Figure 3-3).  Address ranges exist only for street features, and in some cases, corporate corridor and corporate offset boundary features.  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3- 11   Figure 3-2 TIGER/Line Multiple and Out-of-Sequence Address Ranges The TIGER/Line  files can accommodate complex address situations by using more than one address range. A complete chain may contain both odd and even ranges, provided the ranges are not duplicated elsewhere. Whenever there is more than one address range per side for a complete chain, the additional address ranges go into Record Type 6. The TLID field links the two record types. Record Type 6 has a sequence field (RTSQ) that allows more than one Record Type 6 to . have the same TLID. The largest address ranges are put on Record Type 1 and the smaller ranges on Record Type 6. The complete chain in the diagram below has two address ranges on each side. This situation results when a structure with an even-numbered address (150-150) is built on the odd-numbered side of the street.  113  121  123  125  150  199  LEFT Start Node  121-199, 150-150 120-148, 152-198  Oak Ave End Node  RIGHT  110  120  122  124  126  128  130  There is a gap (150-150) in the the even-numbered addresses.

The Census Bureau edits the address ranges to locate possible overlaps, but cannot guarantee that all possible overlap situations have been identified.  Address ranges in the TIGER/Line files are usually associated with both the primary and alternate feature identifiers. Caution: Address range overlaps may occur if primary address ranges are linked to alternate feature identifiers that identify route numbers. Some address systems use a hyphen to separate avenue numbers, private road designators, and grid cell numbers from the structure numbers; for example, 10-01 Reynolds St uses a hyphen to separate the avenue number from the structure number. See the Introduction chapter for more information on known anomalies.  Imputed Address Ranges Imputed address ranges occur during the process of updating the Census TIGER data base when a new complete chain intersects an existing complete chain with address ranges. The intersection splits the existing complete chain and produces two new complete chains connected by a new node located at the intersection point. The update program divides the old address ranges among the two new complete chains and imputes the address range ends at the new node. The impute process allocates either all or part of each original address range to each of the new complete chains in proportion to their lengths (see Figures 3-4 and 3-5). For each side of the original complete chain, the process considers all address ranges appearing on each side and determines the overall low and high address. The process assumes the addresses are evenly distributed over the length of the complete chain, and applies the proportion of complete chain lengths to the overall address ranges to calculate a split point address for each side. Address ranges that fall entirely above or below the split point address are moved intact to one of the new complete chains. The process divides any address ranges that contain the split point address and allocates each part to one of the new complete chains.  3-14 1998 TIGER/Line Files   The new address range ends created from the split are imputed values and have an impute flag. Some intermediate address range ends also may carry the impute flag. These address range ends fall between the overall high and low address for complete chain sides that have more than one address range. The impute flags on these range ends often mark splits created by adding different nine-digit ZIP Codes to parts of the original address range. These impute flags are not significant and should be disregarded. The impute flags identify address ranges that have been through the impute process. Each record in the TIGER/Line files contains four separate 1-character impute flag fields, one for each address range end.  ZIP Codes The ZIP Code is an attribute of the address ranges. The TIGER/Line files have a five-character ZIP Code field containing a numeric code with leading zeros. Both the left- and right-side address ranges share the ZIP Code that appears in the same Type 1 or Type 6 record. Each address range belonging to a complete chain can have a different ZIP Code. Where ZIP Code boundaries follow a street, the complete chain may have different left- and right-side ZIP Codes, or different ZIP Codes along its length. Because the Census TIGER data base identifies only one ZIP Code for each address range record, address ranges with different ZIP Codes must appear in separate records. The address range(s) with one ZIP Code will appear in Record Type 1, and the address range(s) with the other ZIP Code(s) will appear in Record Type 6. For example, one complete chain making up Duke Street is a ZIP Code boundary; the left-side range 1-99 has a ZIP Code of 12345, and the right-side range 2-98 has a ZIP Code of 54321. The range 1-99 with a ZIP Code of 12345 will appear in Record Type 1, and the right-side range fields will be blank. The range 2-98 with a ZIP Code of 54321 will appear in Record Type 6, and the leftside range fields will be blank. If the complete chain had additional address ranges with a ZIP Code of either 12345 or 54321, these additional address ranges would appear with Attributes of Geographic Objects 3- 15   Figure 3-4 TIGER/Line Address Range Imputes--Before Split The Census TIGER  data base uses impute flags to indicate that the one or both ends of an address range are based on calculations rather than known values. Imputed address situations generally occur when a complete chain with existing address ranges becomes split by a new complete chain. The illustration below shows the address ranges on Chestnut Ave before a split. All impute flags for this complete chain are set at zero. Figure 3-5 shows the address ranges after the split.

Each part is assigned a new TIGER/Line  identification number (TLID) and the old number is deleted. The overall address range for each complete chain side (1649 to 201 on the left side and 298 to 200 on the right side) and the split points for each of these address ranges (approximately 1088 on the left side and 261 on the right side) are determined by the TIGER System. Address ranges that fall entirely above or below the split point belong to one of the two new complete chains and do not get an impute flag. The TIGER System divides those address ranges that contain the split point and assigns a part to each of the new complete chains.

For example, a right-side range of 150-198 with a ZIP Code of 12345 could appear on the Type 1 record with the left-side range of 1-99. However, a right-side range of 150-198 with a ZIP Code of 54321 could not appear on the Type 6 record with the range 2-98. Instead, the range would have to appear in a second Type 6 record. Since the ZIP Codes in the TIGER/Line file relate to mail delivery along addressed streets, they are not true area features. It is possible that a polygon may contain addresses associated with more than one delivery ZIP Code.  Postal Add-On Code The TIGER/Line files have a 4-character Postal ZIP+4 Add-On code which is located on Record Type Z. Record Type Z may link to a leftor right-side address range in Record Type 1 or in Record Type 6. By using the TLID fields, data users can match the Postal +4 Add-On codes on Record Type Z to an address range in either Record Type 1 or Record Type 6. If the RTSQ field on Record Type 6 contains a 0, the postal +4 Add-On codes apply to the address ranges in Record Type 1. If the RTSQ field contains a number greater than 0, the Postal +4 Add-On codes apply to the address ranges in the Record Type 6 that have the identical RTSQ value. The first two characters of the Postal +4 Add-On code indicate the USPS sector code; the last two characters represent the USPS segment code. As stated earlier, the Census Bureau used an automated match process to assign the Add-On codes to the address ranges in the Census TIGER data base. The match utilized only the street type records from the AMS II ZIP+4 file. These records identify a single Add-On code for a range of addresses. The ZIP+4 file also contains company and high-rise building records that supply specific codes to companies, buildings, and floors or suites within buildings. The Census Bureau did not match these codes to the Census TIGER data base because it was not practical to add all of the building features to the Census TIGER data base. Also, it was not feasible to split the address ranges for individual building-level codes. The match process attempted to relate the 5-digit ZIP Code, street name identifier, and address ranges for each feature in the Census TIGER data base to the corresponding street type record in the AMS II ZIP+4 file of 3-18 1998 TIGER/Line Files   the USPS. A match was not always possible because the process could not identify a single match between features with a high degree of confidence. Where successful, the process added the Postal Add-On codes to the address ranges in the Census TIGER data base. The process split these ranges if the Add-On codes covered only part of the range. Splits of this type occurred because the potential address ranges used by the Census Bureau differed from those used by the USPS. The USPS assigned different Add-On codes for each range of addresses along a block side. For example the 100, 200, and 300 numbered addresses received different Add-On codes even though they appeared on the same block side. The Add-On codes also may appear on more than one complete chain. This results because of differences in potential address ranges, and because the Census Bureau recognizes complete chain breaks and intersections not recognized by the USPS.  Address Information and Key Geographic Locations (KGLs) KGLs represent a special class of address information. They provide a geocoding tool like address ranges, but also identify a spatial object similar to a landmark. The Census Bureau uses KGLs to identify named buildings where the use of the feature name enhances the ability to geocode addresses. These cases include airports, shopping centers, schools, condominiums, hotels, and apartment complexes. The Census Bureau uses KGLs in situations where the address range along a street does not geocode to the correct block. Thus, greater accuracy in geocoding is provided when the KGL address is used than when the address range on the complete chain is used. In the TIGER/Line files, each KGL usually has a street address, CFCC, KGL feature name, and ZIP Code. The street feature identifier associated with the address of the KGL is obtained by linking the FEAT field to Record Type 5 which contains the list of all street name identifiers. The KGLs are independent of the address range on the complete chain; the geocoding link for the KGL is the GT-polygon. In most cases, one of the complete chains that forms the boundary of the GT-polygon will contain the KGL address. However, this relationship is not true for all KGLs. In order to locate the street segment with the KGL address, use  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3- 19   the previously linked street name identifier from Record Type 5. The ZIP Codes may not be the same. Even though the KGLs appear to identify specific structures, the KGL descriptions do not include location coordinates. In most cases, the Census Bureau can determine the general location of the KGL, but cannot provide a specific location with any certainty.  Address Information Methodology Pre-1992 Address Ranges Before the 1990 census, the Census TIGER data base contained address ranges only for the area covered by 1980 Geographic Base File/Dual Independent Map Encoding (GBF/DIME) files and a few file extension areas prepared in conjunction with 1980 census activities. These ranges were used to geocode a list of addresses to geographic areas for use in the 1990 questionnaire mail-out. For the 1990 census, the Bureau purchased the list of addresses from commercial vendors for the geographic areas where the Census TIGER data base included address ranges. To verify the accuracy of the addresses, the Census Bureau began with an initial assignment of residential addresses to the 1990 census tracts and blocks. Clerical review of the results of the assignment process provided additional address range updates. If an address range in the TIGER/Line file prepared for the 1990 census was incorrect, the Census Bureau implemented procedures to ensure that the error did not adversely affect the accuracy or the quality of the 1990 census. Later, in field operations, enumerators verified, corrected, and updated the list of addresses assigned to each block. They walked the perimeter and all interior streets of each block and checked the address list against their observations.  1992 TIGER/Line Expanded Addresses In the 1992 TIGER/Line Files, the Census Bureau expanded the address range coverage for the entire United States by creating new ranges based on the Address Control File (ACF) used in the 1990 decennial census. The ACF was a master list of addresses geocoded to the census block level. For each block, the individual structure addresses were grouped by feature 3-20 1998 TIGER/Line Files   identifier and sorted into numerical order to extract an actual range. The order of the addresses along the complete chains bordering the block, relative to the start and end nodes of the complete chains, came from the order of addresses for the street feature as a whole (i.e., the collection of linked complete chains with the same feature identifier). Likewise, the overall parity of the street feature set the standard for identifying and editing anomalies along the complete chains. To maintain confidentiality of individual addresses, the Census Bureau converted the actual range to a potential range. This was accomplished by expanding the actual range to complete a hundred range, splitting the difference between coverage gaps, and in some cases disguising the range by the random addition or subtraction of addresses. Where a complete chain in the Census TIGER data base contained both an ACF-derived address range and a pre-existing address range, only the pre-existing address range was extracted for the 1992 TIGER/ Line files. This extraction process was followed on each side of a complete chain. No attempt was made to resolve differences between the two sources (the pre-existing or the ACF-derived). The ACF-derived address range may have created overlaps with pre-existing address ranges on the adjoining complete chains.  Post-1992 Expanded Addresses What had been true for addresses in the 1992 TIGER/Line files was modified for the 1994, 1995, 1997 and the 1998 versions of the files. The preexisting address ranges in the Census TIGER data base and the ACF address ranges were matched to determine their comparability. Then, a rematch process was performed similar to the process used for the 1992 TIGER/Line files. Using more sophisticated processing, the address ranges were merged to create better address range coverage. In the merge process, the ACF range became the base address range, and the pre-existing address range in the Census TIGER data base was used to make the address range coverage more complete. The merged range is the address range in the 1998 TIGER/Line files. In addition to the address merge process, the Census Bureau ran an address range edit. The edits fixed some orientation and parity reversals Attributes of Geographic Objects 3- 21   along a street feature. They also identified overlapping address ranges of different complete chains that had the same street identifier and ZIP Code. Where all of the overlapping addresses were geocoded to the same 1990 census block, only one instance of the address was retained in the TIGER/Line files. If overlapping addresses were geocoded to a different census block, none of these overlapping addresses were entered into the TIGER/Line files. For this reason, street features that had address ranges in the past may show no ranges or incomplete ranges in the latest versions of the TIGER/Line files. Both primary and alternate feature identifiers can be used in geocoding, but great care should be used with the alternate identifiers. In the case of corporate corridors and corporate limit offset boundaries, the alternate address linked to the boundary should be used for geocoding rather than the primary range linked to the street (see the Corporate Corridors and Corporate Limit Offset Boundaries section in this chapter). Orientation edits attempted to standardize the low to high orientation of address ranges along a chain of street feature complete chains with the same feature identifier. Complete chains with address ranges that were specifically identified as orientation anomalies were automatically excluded. The edit determined the majority orientation for the street feature chain and reversed the low and high values on any range that deviated from the majority. The edit only created street feature chains that included adjacent complete chains; discontiguous street feature chains were edited as separate pieces. Therefore, the from-to orientation of the complete chains may be inconsistent along a feature chain. The parity edits attempted to place the even- and odd-parity ranges consistently on the same side of a feature chain. Chains with address ranges that were specifically identified as known anomalies were automatically excluded. Because address geocoding could be affected, the parity fix required a feature chain with a minimum of four complete chains and a majority parity representing 70 percent of the address ranges. As a result, smaller feature chains remained unaltered. For the 1994 TIGER/Line files, the Census Bureau conducted a general ZIP Code clean-up and staff added new ZIP Codes created since the  3-22 1998 TIGER/Line Files   1990 census. These updates had a significant impact on parts of Michigan, California, and central Florida. Nationwide, automated processes eliminated illegal codes not recognized by the USPS as ZIP Codes, and clerical operations began eliminating the scatter of incorrectly applied ZIP Codes. Nearly all 3-digit ZIP Code anomalies have been corrected. The Census Bureau, for the 1995 TIGER/Line files, edited address ranges for overlaps or other inconsistencies and ZIP Codes were updated in selected areas. The street names and address ranges in the Census TIGER data base were compared to those in the ZIP+4 file of the US Postal Service. If a street name and address range did not have a ZIP+4 code, the code was copied from the ZIP+4 file to the Census TIGER data base. The consistency of highway names and feature identifiers also was improved.

The distribution of ZIP Codes in the TIGER/Line files may not reflect the exact USPS ZIP Code service area.  Limitations Users of the address ranges in the TIGER/Line files should check for address range overlaps, gaps, odd/even reversals, and other situations 3-24 1998 TIGER/Line Files   that may be incorrect. While the Census Bureau continues to edit for, and correct these situations, it is possible that some still exist.  Corporate Corridors and Corporate Limit Offset Boundaries A corporate corridor is a narrow, linear part of an incorporated place (or in a few instances, another legal entity). The corporate corridor includes the street and/or right-of-way, or a portion of the street and/or right-ofway within the incorporated place. It excludes from the incorporated place those structures such as houses, apartments, or businesses that front along the street or road. A corporate limit offset boundary exists where the incorporated place lies on one side of the street and may include all or part of the street and/or right-of-way, but not the structures located on that side of the street. See the Places section in Chapter 4. To facilitate the coding of addresses to the correct geographic entity, the Census TIGER data base contains duplicate street name and address ranges on complete chains with a CFCC of F11 (nonvisible offset boundary) or F12 (nonvisible corporate corridor). The duplicate street names for the F11 and F12 features are on Record Type 5; the duplicate address ranges are on Record Type 6. Complete chains with CFCCs of F11 or F12 will not contain the duplicate names or address ranges in Record Type 1. Record Type 1 does not indicate that the street or right-of-way lies within a corporate corridor or offset boundary. Therefore, the address ranges lie outside the corporate corridor or offset boundary and are encoded on either side of these lines. Data users planning to geocode addresses in areas with these boundary types must identify the duplicate feature identifiers and ranges from Record Types 5 and 6 (the names and address ranges for CFCC F11 and F12 features), locate the street feature with those ranges, and remove the street features address ranges and geographic codes from the geocoding process.  Record Linkages The TIGER/Line files store address range information in two record types. Record Type 1 contains the basic complete chain attributes, including one basic address range. Record Type 6 stores the Attributes of Geographic Objects 3- 25   additional ranges when the complete chain has more than one range on one or both sides. The TLID field links Record Types 1 and 6. Since a complete chain can have more than one set of address ranges, multiple Type 6 records can exist with the same TLID. The TIGER/Line files distinguish these records with a record sequence number (RTSQ). All Type 6 records that have the same TLID appear sequentially in the file even though the records are not sorted by TLID. The TIGER/ Line files do not contain a field indicating whether a Type 6 record exists for a specific TLID; the user must scan any existing records in Record Type 6 for a TLID match.  Boundaries of Geographic Entities The TIGER/Line files store geographic codes as either a polygon or complete chain attribute. In the case of state and county level geography, and some other areas, the codes appear in both complete chain and polygon record types. Refer to Chapter 4 for descriptions of geographic areas, and to Chapter 6 for the data dictionary that describes the record type fields.  Record Linkages and Boundary Extraction The codes assigned to the complete chain belong to the areas referenced by the left and the right sides of a complete chain. Only those features that have different geographic codes on the left and the right sides of a line become boundary features. Information from multiple TIGER/ Line data fields is required to uniquely identify the boundary of some geographic entities. For instance, both the census block and census tract/ BNA codes are required to identify a block boundary. Block 101 in census tract 2101 could neighbor block 101 in census tract 2998. Be sure to use both the basic number and the suffix when extracting either census tract or block boundaries. Data users who have combined TIGER/Line files should include the 1990 state/statistical equivalent and 1990 county/statistical equivalent codes to extract 1990 census tract/BNA boundaries. The extraction of boundary features from polygon attribute codes requires making a link between the polygon and the complete chain data records, then identifying the features with different left- and right-side geographic 3-26 1998 TIGER/Line Files   codes. For a description of the record linkage process, see the Polygon Features section in this chapter. Boundary rings consist of multiple complete chains that are sequentially linked together and connected to form a closed ring. The process of linking all of the boundary complete chains that outline the same geographic entity requires the extraction of all complete chains that have that entitys code on either the left or the right side (but not both). Linking the chains together will form a polygon; each polygon may represent one of the GTpolygons described in Record Types A, P, and S, or a collection of these GT-polygons. Caution: Some types of geographic areas must end at a county/file boundary while others can continue into adjoining counties/files. For example, MCDs stop at a county boundary, whereas incorporated places can exist in several counties (See the Record Linkages/Feature Chaining section in this chapter).  Single-Side Flags and County Boundaries The 1998 TIGER/Line files use current counties/statistical equivalents as the basis for the file coverage area, not the boundaries as they existed for the 1990 census. This means that a county or countyequivalent file may not cover the exact same area as it did in 1990. Any legal changes or boundary corrections that occurred since 1990 could have resulted in a piece of land moving from one county, or county equivalent, to another. County boundary features are duplicated between adjoining pairs of counties so that each file is complete. However, the complete chains that constitute the boundary features contain only the geographic entity codes and address ranges relevant to each county-based TIGER/Line file. The geographic entity codes are blanked out on the outside edge of the county, even though some of these fields must normally have a non-blank code. The TIGER/Line file identifies these complete chains with a 1-character, single-side segment flag in the SIDE1 field of Record Type 1.

The CFCC is applied only once to a chain or landmark with preference given to classifications that cover features that are visible to an observer and a part of the ground transportation network. Thus, a road that also is the boundary of a town would have a CFCC describing its road characteristics, not its boundary characteristics. The CFCC, as used in The first character is a character is a number character is a number the TIGER/Line files, is a three-character code. letter describing the feature class; the second describing the major category; and the third describing the minor category.  Feature Class A, Road The definition of a divided highway has been the source of considerable discussion. Earlier specifications have defined a divided road as having 3-28 1998 TIGER/Line Files    opposing traffic lanes that are physically separated by a median strip no less than 70 feet wide in former GBF/DIME areas or no less than 200 feet wide in non-GBF/DIME areas. This definition caused confusion in the proper coding of interstates having narrow medians. To clarify the situation, the Census Bureau now uses the term divided to refer to a road with opposing traffic lanes separated by any size median, and separated to refer to lanes that are represented in the Census TIGER data base as two distinct complete chains. Earlier operations may have depicted widely separated lanes as a single line in the data base or created separate lines when the median was small, depending on the available source used during the update. See the list of anomalies in the Introduction chapter. The term, rail line in center, indicates that a rail line shares the road rightof-way. The rail line may follow the center of the road or be directly next to the road; representation is dependent upon the available source used during the update. The rail line can represent a railroad, a street carline, or other carline. Primary Highway With Limited Access Interstate highways and some toll highways are in this category (A1) and are distinguished by the presence of interchanges. These highways are accessed by way of ramps and have multiple lanes of traffic. The opposing traffic lanes are divided by a median strip. The TIGER/Line files may depict these opposing traffic lanes as two distinct lines in which case, the road is called separated.

Only those GT-polygons associated with an area landmark have a CFCC. Most CFCCs in the feature classification scheme apply only to complete chains. In a few instances, the same feature code may apply to complete chains as well as to point and area landmarks. Only those features required for census operational purposes are classified and inserted into the Census TIGER data base. Therefore, not all features in a county will appear in the TIGER/Line files. Since features are classified with only a single code, a road that also is a boundary will have only the CFCC of a road even though a CFCC for a boundary exists in the classification scheme.  CFCC Record Location Record Type 1 7 9  Field Name CFCC CFCC CFCC  Description Code assigned to the complete chain Code assigned to a point or area landmark Code assigned to a key geographic location  Points Describing the Complete Chain The TIGER/Line files describe the spatial/geometric position and shape of a complete chain using shape points and nodes; see the section entitled Topology in Chapter 1. Latitude and longitude coordinate fields identify  3-42 1998 TIGER/Line Files   the shape points and nodes. The Census TIGER data base does not support node identification numbers.  Nodes Nodes are topological objects that mark the end location of each complete chain. Every chain has two nodes, a start node and an end node (using the Spatial Data Transfer Standard, or SDTS, terminology). Earlier releases of the TIGER/Line files refer to these nodes as the from node and the to node. The order of the nodes establishes the left and the right sides of the line and sets the sequencing order for the shape points. The node coordinates are stored in Record Type 1.  Shape Points The Census Bureau uses the term shape points to describe the nontopological points that describe the position and shape of a chain. Shape points exist only where required; straight-line complete chains require no shape points. Shape points are associated only with one complete chain and are listed in order from start node to end node. The TIGER/Line files store shape points in Record Type 2 and link them to the nodes in Record Type 1 using the TLID. The shape points for a chain can fill several Type 2 records.  Coordinates for Nodes and Shape Points Coordinates are expressed in Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) notation, where a positive latitude represents the Northern Hemisphere and a negative longitude represents the Western Hemisphere. All coordinates are expressed as a signed integer with six decimal places of precision implied (see the section, Positional Accuracy, in Chapter 5). Actual Latitude 15 Deg. S to 72 Deg. N Longitude 64 Deg. W to 131 Deg.

The coordinate datum for the above areas was NAD27 Attributes of Geographic Objects 3- 43   in all previous versions of the files prior to 1995. Regional datums are used in all versions of the TIGER/Line files for Hawaii and the Island Territories in the Pacific.  Coordinate Values All nodes have non-zero coordinates within the range specified in the Coordinates for Nodes and Shape Points section on the previous page. Shape point coordinates are expressed in the same manner. However, unused Record Type 2 fields are zero-filled and begin with a + sign.

Plot the start node first, then search Record Type 2 for any matching records. If there is a match, the record will contain from 1 to 10 shape points. If all 10-point fields are filled with non-zero values, there may be an additional matching Type 2 record. Type 2 records are not sorted by TLID, but all records with the same TLID should appear together in sequence by the record sequence number (RTSQ). Plot the shape points from all Type 2 records and end the complete chain by plotting the end node.  3-44 1998 TIGER/Line Files   Street features may consist of multiple complete chains that are sequentially linked together. Linking all of the features with the same name requires the extraction of all Type 1 and Type 2 records with the same feature identifiers in Record Types 1 and 5. Boundary generation requires the extraction of all features that have different left and right geographic codes. The placement of the complete chains into a boundary-ring sequence requires a procedure to match the end of one complete chain to the beginning or end of the next complete chain. The complete chains will probably not have the same to-from or start-end orientation down the length of the street or boundary. Therefore, the procedure must reverse the order of the nodes and shape points that form some complete chains to achieve a correct and consistent sequence of nodes and shape points. Since the nodes that identify the ends of the complete chains do not have an identification number, the procedure must match the nodes based on the latitude and longitude coordinates. This might facilitate the match by combining the coordinates into a single peano key code composed of alternating latitude and longitude digits. Sorting nodes using the peano key will cluster nodes that are spatially close together.  Polygon Features The TIGER/Line files contain identification and geographic codes for each GT-polygon in the Census TIGER data base. These GT-polygons are the smallest areas identified in the TIGER/Line files. Geographic entities and area landmarks have specific identification codes and form more complex polygons. The TIGER/Line files link these features to GT-polygons, but do not directly identify the more complex polygons. GT-polygons are building blocks that form features. They are not features and do not have their own feature name or CFCC. However, GT-polygons may be a part of many area landmark features that have their own feature name and CFCC. GT-polygons have unique GT-polygon identification codes (CENID and POLYID), a set of geographic entity codes, and an internal point location. Refer to Chapter 2 for more information on GT-polygon  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3- 45   identification codes and Chapter 4 for a description of the geographic entities in the TIGER/Line files. Information and record linkage keys for GT-polygons are distributed over several record types:       Record Record Record Record Record Record Type Type Type Type Type Type P -- provides the GT-polygon internal point location A -- provides the 1990 census geographic entity codes and areas 8 -- links GT-polygons to area landmarks 9 -- links GT-polygons to key geographic location features I -- links GT-polygons to complete chains S -- provides current geographic entity codes and areas  Updates to the Census TIGER data base include new street and boundary complete chains that create new GT-polygons. Thus, each version of the TIGER/Line files will have a single, unique set of GT-polygons, each with a corresponding Record Type A, S, and P. The CENID and POLYID identification codes link records together, but are not permanent GT-polygon identification codes.  Geographic Entity Codes Geographic entity codes can be attributes of a set of polygons, a complete chain, or both. Refer to Chapter 6 for the data dictionary that describes the record type fields and to Chapter 4 for descriptions of geographic areas.  Internal Points The internal point is a point location within each GT-polygon that is unique to that GT-polygon. The TIGER/Line files exclude the internal points from the node-complete chain-polygon topology; do not confuse the internal point with a centroid. In a polygon with an irregular shape, such as a doughnut or crescent shape, the true centroid could fall outside the polygon. Unlike true centroids, the internal points should always fall within the GT-polygon or on the GT-polygon boundary. Some of the GT-polygons (approximately 400 nationwide) are so small that the internal point may be identical to a point on one of the lines bounding the GT-polygon, or identical to one of the nodes. Depending upon the precision of a particular software or hardware system, the 3-46 1998 TIGER/Line Files   data user may find the internal point outside the correct GT-polygon, or find that a GT-polygon may contain two internal points. Changes to the shape and location of complete chains forming polygon boundaries will change the polygon internal point coordinates even though the topology of the polygon remains the same. Such changes complicate the matching, using internal point coordinates, of polygons from different versions of the TIGER/Line files. All internal points have non-zero coordinates. Coordinates are expressed in standard FIPS PUB 70 notation. See the Coordinates for Nodes and Shape Points section in this chapter. GT-Polygon Internal Point Coordinates Record Locations Record Type P P Field Name POLYLONG POLYLAT Description Internal point longitude Internal point latitude  Record Linkages The topological network of complete chains divides the surface area of geographic entities into GT-polygons. There is a one-to-one relationship between the GT-polygons constructed from Record Types 1 and 2 and those appearing in Record Type P. In constructing the GT-polygons from Record Types 1 and 2, users are cautioned to be sure their software has the necessary coordinate precision and does not snap together complete chains that are merely close. Record Type I provides a direct link from each complete chain in the TIGER/Line file to its adjoining GT-polygons. It contains both the TLID and the polygon identification codes for each side of the GT-polygon. Record Type I facilitates the transfer of polygon geographic codes to the complete chain, but also provides the link back from polygon to complete chain. In this case, finding all complete chains associated with a GT-polygon is more difficult. The procedure involves searching every Type I record to locate all instances where a CENID and POLYID appear on either the left or the right side of a complete chain.  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3- 47   Area landmarks also must link to the GT-polygons in order to establish their geographic location. Record Type 8 provides the link from GT-polygon to area landmark. See the Area Landmark Locations section in this chapter.  Landmark Features The Census Bureau includes landmarks in the Census TIGER data base for locating special features and to help enumerators during field operations. Some of the more common landmark types include airports, cemeteries, parks, and educational facilities. The Census Bureau added landmark features on an as-needed-basis and made no attempt to ensure that all instances of a particular feature were included. The absence of a landmark does not mean that the living quarters, e.g., hospitals and group quarters associated with the landmark were excluded from the 1990 enumeration. The address list used for the census was maintained apart from the landmark data. Landmarks with a ZIP Code and an address are called key geographic locations (KGLs). A landmark can be either a point, Census TIGER data base permits airport or airfield might appear as depends on the size of the feature the source document. line, or area type. In some cases, the a choice of types. For instance, an a point, line, or area; the approach and the depiction of the feature in  Line features such as airfields could appear as one or more complete chains; they are not identified in the landmark record types. See the Point, Line, and Area Landmark CFCCs section in this chapter to identify the possible codes that could appear as complete chains. In addition to landmark data, the TIGER/Line files contain the CFCCs and names for bodies of water including ponds, lakes, oceans, and the area covered by large streams represented as double-line drainage. These water areas have 1990 census block numbers ending in 99. See Chapter 4 for a complete description of census blocks covering land and water.  3-48 1998 TIGER/Line Files   Landmark and water features can overlap. The most common situation is a park or other special land-use feature that includes a lake or pond. In this case, the GT-polygon covered by the lake or pond belongs to a water landmark feature and a park landmark feature. Other kinds of landmarks can overlap as well. Area landmarks can contain point landmarks; these are not linked in the TIGER/Line files. Record Type 7 contains point and area landmarks. Most water areas are identified as an area landmark whether named or not. The other landmarks may be identified only by a census feature class code and may not have a name. During the extraction of this data, the Census Bureau assigned a temporary landmark identification number (LAND) to each landmark record. Record Type 8 uses the LAND to link the area landmark records in Record Type 7 to the GT-polygons. Record Type 7 and Record Type 8 exist only when the county file contains landmark features or water features. Record Type 9 contains the KGLs in the Census TIGER data base. The KGLs are linked by the CENID and POLYID to the GT-polygons.  Point, Line, and Area Landmark CFCCs All landmarks, including KGLs, have a CFCC. In the Census TIGER data base the CFCCs of the complete chains forming the polygon boundary are independent of the CFCCs assigned to the area landmark or the water feature filling the polygon.

The text string includes upper- and lower-case characters. The feature name may carry an imbedded feature type (e.g., River, Military Reservation, Garden, Park, and Lake). The Census Bureau has not standardized or edited the feature types or names for landmarks in the Census TIGER data base in all areas. The Census Bureau does not guarantee that the landmarks or water areas are consistently identified in the TIGER/Line files. Area landmarks added to the Census TIGER data base in different update actions with the same name and CFCC will produce separate landmark records in the TIGER/Line files. The landmark records may contain variant spellings of the feature name or different CFCCs even though they refer to the same feature. These differences could result in the fragmentation of a large landmark. For instance, a water body could have the name Lake Redmond with a CFCC of H31, while another part could have the same name, but a CFCC of H30, and still a third part could have the name York County Reservoir. Because area landmarks can overlap, it is possible, although not likely, for one polygon to belong to several landmarks. Area landmarks and water area labels can have alternate names. Each feature name will appear as a separate Type 7 record, but each record will have the same LAND. Type 7 Records with the same LAND will have the same landmark or water area label. Each unique combination of primary and alternate names becomes a separate landmark record even though the primary name and the CFCCs match the adjoining landmark features. The TIGER/Line files do not show all water bodies as landmark records. Using Record Type 7 (area landmarks) and Record Type 8 (polygons linked to area landmarks) will not necessarily provide all water areas. Record Type S contains a water flag (WATER) to identify polygons associated with water bodies. Water bodies are identified with a value of 1 in the WATER field.  3-52 1998 TIGER/Line Files   Key geographic location names uniquely identify the landmark separately from its street address; for example, Springfield Towers instead of 1605 Main St. Landmark Feature Record Locations Record Type 7 9 Field Name LANAME KGLNAME Description Landmark name Key geographic location name  Landmark Feature Name Codes The LANAME and KGLNAME field may include any ASCII text string. The fields can be blank where the feature is unnamed.  Point Landmark Locations The TIGER/Line files identify the location of point landmarks with a single coordinate point. The presence of coordinate data in Record Type 7 distinguishes point landmarks from area landmarks that have blank coordinate fields. Coordinates Coordinates are expressed in standard FIPS PUB 70 notation. For additional information, see the Coordinates for Nodes and Shape Points section in this chapter. Point Landmark Coordinate Record Locations Record Type Field Name Description  7 7  LALONG LALAT  Longitude Latitude  Coordinate Values All point landmarks have non-zero coordinates within the range specified above. The coordinate fields for area landmarks are blank-filled.  Area Landmark Locations To find the location of each area landmark, link the basic landmark description in Record Type 7 to all of the elementary polygons that belong to the landmark. Record Type 8 serves as a bridge between these two record types. The TIGER/Line files provide a Type 8 record  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3- 53   for each polygon linked to a specific landmark. Polygons belonging to multiple landmarks appear once for each landmark. The TIGER/Line files use the LAND and the polygon identification codes (CENID and POLYID) to actually make the link. See Chapter 2 for a description of the LAND, CENID, and POLYID codes and fields. Locate the polygons for an area landmark by searching Record Type 8 for all of the CENIDs and POLYIDs with the specified LAND. Record Type 8 is in LAND sort sequence. Once the polygons are linked to the area landmark, use Record Type I to locate the complete chains that form the landmarks polygon boundaries. Record Type I contains a record for all complete chains and identifies the polygons located on either side of the complete chains. The search procedure must look for all instances of Record Type I and evaluate the left- and right-side polygon identifiers for a possible match. Data users may need to eliminate complete chains that are internal to the polygon and landmark, depending on the application.  KGLs To find the location of KGLs, link the description in Record Type 9 to the elementary polygon in which the KGL is found. Use the polygon identification codes (CENID and POLYID) to make the link. If the address of the KGL is a street address, use the FEAT field (alternate feature ID code) to link to the feature identifier in Record Type 5.  3-54 1998 TIGER/Line Files   Chapter 4: Geographic Entities Overview The 1998 TIGER/Line files contain the boundaries of legal, administrative, and statistical areas. Some boundaries are those that were in effect as of the tabulation of the 1990 census, while others are updated boundaries. The legal areas shown in the files are:        States and their statistical equivalents--1990 and current Counties and their statistical equivalents--1990 and current Minor civil divisions (MCDs) --1990 and current Sub-minor civil divisions (Puerto Rico only)--1990 and current Consolidated cities--current only Incorporated places--1990 and current American Indian reservations (both federally and state-recognized)--1990 and current  American Indian trust lands--current only  Alaska Native Regional Corporations--current only  Congressional districts--current only  The administrative areas shown in the files are:  Voting districts--1990 only  School districts--current only  Traffic analysis zones--current only  The statistical areas included in the files are:  Census areas (statistical county equivalents in Alaska)--1990 and current  Census county divisions and unorganized territories (statistical county subdivisions)--1990 and current  Census designated places (statistical place equivalents)--1990 only  Place (remainder) entities (statistical place equivalents within consolidated cities)--1990 and current  American Indian/Alaska Native statistical areas--1990 and current 1) Alaska Native village statistical areas 2) Tribal designated statistical areas 3) Tribal jurisdiction statistical areas  Census tracts and block numbering areas--1990 only  Urbanized areas--1990 only  Census blocks--1990 and Census 2000 collection  Geographic Entities 4- 1    Metropolitan areas: 1) Consolidated metropolitan statistical areas--current only 2) Metropolitan statistical areas--current only 3) Primary metropolitan statistical areas--current only  Geographic entities tabulated by the Census Bureau generally are hierarchical; Figure 4-1 shows the progression of geographic areas from the Nation to the block level. See Appendix F for a count of legal, administrative, and statistical entities. The TIGER/Line files identify geographic areas the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) codes or, in American Indian/Alaska Native Areas only, Census Bureau-assigned codes. The TIGER/Line files depict geographic areas in two ways:  The assignment of codes to the left and the right sides of the complete chains (Record Types 1 and 3)  The identification of codes that belong to each GT-polygon (Record Types A and S) The TIGER/Line files identify some geographic entities in both the complete chain and polygon records for certain boundary vintages. This chapter provides detailed information on the record types and fields for the geographic entities.  Boundary and Area Changes The boundaries identified as current for some legal areas are updated boundaries collected since 1990 as part of the Census Bureaus Boundary and Annexation Survey, or as part of the 1990 County Quality Review correction process. The boundaries of all states, all counties and their statistical equivalents, all MCDs, and all incorporated places are those that were legally in effect as of the latest Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS). This may vary by county record or the date of extraction from the Census TIGER data base. For all other legal areas and nearly all statistical areas, the boundaries shown were those in effect at the time of the 1990 census whether the data are identified as 1990 or current. Because unorganized territories and census designated places occupy the same level of geography as 4-2 1998 TIGER/Line Files   Figure 4-1 Hierarchical Relationship of Geographic Entities  Nation  States AIANAs UAs CDs School Districts VTDs County Subdivisions Sub-MCDs Census Tracts Counties ANRCs Places  BGs  Blocks  Geographic Entities 4-3   legal MCDs and incorporated places, updates to the legal boundaries may affect the current boundaries for some of these entities, including the elimination of some of the statistical entities. The metropolitan area data that appears on Record Type S are based on the latest available designations by the Office of Management and Budget, and are not the metropolitan areas for which the Census Bureau tabulated data in 1990. The metropolitan area information on Record Type C, however, shows both 1990 and current codes and names. In a few cases, the Census Bureau made statistical area boundary changes in order to correct errors. Since the release of the 1990 Census TIGER/Line files, the Census Bureau shifted and reshaped some line features including the lines forming some boundaries. These changes involved the realignment of complete chains associated with a legal or statistical area boundary. The shape and area of the 1990 geographic entities portrayed in the 1995, 1997 and 1998 TIGER/Line files may differ from earlier TIGER/Line versions, but the inventory of 1990 census tabulation entities remains the same. Changes in the shape and location of complete chains will change the polygon internal point locations. See the Internal Points section in Chapter 3.  Codes for Entities Appendix A is a list of FIPS state and county codes. A list of valid codes and names for other legal entities does not appear in the documentation for the TIGER/Line files. The TIGER/Line files include Record Type C which lists the geographic codes and names plus some attribute data (FIPS 55 class code, census place description code, and legal, administrative, or statistical area description code; and entity type) for certain entities. The codes and names are identified as 1990, current, or both. Record Type C contains the TIGER/Geographic NameTM files that the Census Bureau produced as a companion to the 1992 TIGER/Line files. Record Type C also replaces the TIGER Geographic Reference File Names (GRF-N), 1990. The documentation and paper or file versions of the FIPS codes are available for sale from the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), US Department of Commerce, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161. 4-4 1998 TIGER/Line Files   The telephone number is (703) 487-4650. The US Geological Survey (USGS) maintains the FIPS 55 codes. Information about FIPS codes is available from USGS's Geographic Names Section at (703) 648-4547. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) maintains an Internet World Wide Web site of FIPS codes and information. The URL for this site is http://www.itl.nist.gov/div897/pubs/index.htm. The FIPS publications include:  FIPS PUB 5-2, Codes for Identification of States, the District of Columbia and the Outlying Areas of the United States, and Associated Areas  FIPS PUB 6-4, Counties and Equivalent Entities of the United States, Its Possessions, and Associated Areas  FIPS PUB 8-5, Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs)--including CMSAs, PMSAs, and NECMAs  FIPS PUB 55-3 , Codes for Named Populated Places, Primary County Divisions, and Other Locational Entities of the United States, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and the Pacific Island Territories  The Census Bureau uses the codes in FIPS PUB 55-3 to identify both legal and statistical entities for county subdivisions, places, and American Indian/Alaska Native areas. FIPS PUB 55-3 includes many more entity records than those for which the Census Bureau tabulates data. The FIPS 55 codes are state-based. American Indian reservations in more than one state will have a different FIPS 55 code for each state portion of the single reservation. The 1994, 1995, 1997 and 1998 versions of the TIGER/Line files do not contain the census codes for places, county subdivisions, and sub-MCDs that were available in earlier versions of the TIGER/Line files. A description of the Census Bureaus codes that are assigned to higher-level geographic entities (county subdivisions, sub-minor civil divisions, consolidated cities, and places) appears in the geographic identification coding scheme (GICS) product, TIGER/GICS. The TIGER/GICS contains FIPS and Census Bureau codes, names and attributes, and demographic data for the higherlevel geographic entities included in the 1990 census.

The TIGER/Line files use multiple fields to identify a series of legal and statistical AIANAs: Legal Entities  American Indian reservations (AIRs) are legal entities having boundaries established by treaty, statute, and/or executive or court order over which a federally recognized American Indian tribal group has jurisdiction. The areas identified as American Indian reservations include entities with other designations, such as pueblo, colony, and community. AIRs are identified by representatives of the reservations or tribes.  American Indian trust lands associated with Federal Government. reservations or tribes. trust for the tribe) or the tribe). 4-6 1998 TIGER/Line Files  lands included in the census are the off-reservation a specific tribe or a reservation held in trust by the They are identified by representatives of the Trust lands may be either tribal (held in individual (held in trust for an individual member of   Trust lands are assigned the same codes as the associated reservation. Trust lands not associated with a reservation are assigned codes based on the tribal name. The TIGER/Line files did not previously distinguish between AIRs and trust lands because they shared the same code. Beginning with the 1994 TIGER/Line files, American Indian trust lands are flagged in a separate field (previously the Census ANRC field).  Alaska Native Regional Corporations (ANRCs) are corporate entities established by the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (PL 92-203) to conduct business and nonprofit operations for Alaska Natives. The 12 ANRCs have specific boundaries and cover the state of Alaska except for the Annette Islands Reserve (an American Indian reservation). Statistical Entities  Alaska Native village statistical areas (ANVSAs) are 1990 census statistical areas that delineate the settled area of each Alaska Native village (ANV). ANVs represent tribes, bands, clans, villages, communities, and associations that are recognized pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (PL 92-203), but do not have legally recognized boundaries. Officials of Alaska Native Regional Corporations (ANRCs) and other knowledgeable officials delineated the 1990 ANVSAs for the Census Bureau for the purpose of presenting census data for these entities.  Tribal designated statistical areas (TDSAs) are geographic areas that were delineated for 1990 census data tabulation purposes by tribal officials of federally and state-recognized tribes outside of Oklahoma. TDSAs do not have a legally defined reservation or associated trust lands. They define areas that contain population under tribal jurisdiction and/or areas for which the tribe provides benefits and services. TDSAs are defined for data presentation purposes only.  Tribal jurisdiction statistical areas (TJSAs) are geographic areas delineated for 1990 census data tabulation purposes in Oklahoma by federally recognized tribes that do not have a legally defined reservation. TJSAs are areas defined only for data presentation purposes. They generally contain American Indian population over which one or more tribal governments have jurisdiction. They replace the single Historic Areas of Oklahoma (excluding UAs) recognized for the 1980 census.

Also, refer to FIPS PUB 55-3 or the Census Bureaus TIGER/GICS for a list of valid codes and entity names. The type of AIANA area can be identified either by the census code or by the FIPS 55 class code on each entity record in Record Type C. The range of census codes allocated to each AIANA and the valid FIPS 55 class code(s) associated with each are as follows: 4-8 1998 TIGER/Line Files   Type AIR TJSA ANVSA TDSA  Census Code Range 0001 to 4989 5001 to 5989 6001 to 8989 9001 to 9589  Valid FIPS 55 Class D1, D2, D3, D4, D5 D6 E1, E2, E6 D6  Block Groups (BGs) Geographic BGs Block groups are clusters of blocks within the same census tract or BNA; they have the same first digit as their 3-digit 1990 census block numbers. For example, blocks 101, 102, 103,, 199 in census tract 1210.02 belong to BG 1. BGs never cross county or census tract/BNA boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of county subdivisions, places, UAs, VTDs, congressional districts, and AIANAs. BGs generally contain between 250 and 550 housing units. Each BG usually covers a contiguous area. Each census tract/BNA contains at least one BG. BGs are uniquely numbered within census tract/BNA. Tabulation BGs Tabulation block groups are geographic BGs split to present data for every unique combination of county subdivision, place, UA, VTD, congressional district, U/R, and AIANA shown in the data tabulation products. The TIGER/Line files do not have a separate BG data field. Data users can determine the geographic BG by using the first digit of the 1990 census block number in combination with the 1990 state, county, and census tract/BNA number. Users can identify the tabulation BG by using the geographic BG in combination with the codes for the entities listed above. STF 1A and STF 3A present data for both geographic and tabulation BGs. Block Group Number Record Locations See the section, Census Blocks, in this chapter for record locations and field names. The BG is the compilation of all blocks with the same first digit of their block number in a specific 1990 state-county-census tract/BNA combination. All polygons have a non-blank BG number. The left- and right-side complete chain block numbers should not be blank except where they are located along the outside edge of the county boundary. The TIGER/ Line files do not contain codes for areas outside the county file. Geographic Entities 4- 9   BGs have a valid range of 0 through 9. Some BGs beginning with a 0 are in coastal and Great Lakes water. Rather than extending the census tract/ BNA boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the three-mile territorial sea limit, the Census Bureau delineated some census tract/BNA boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore. The Census Bureau assigned a default census tract/BNA number of 0000 and block number of 099 to the offshore areas not included in regularly numbered census tract/ BNA areas.  Census Blocks Census blocks usually are small statistical areas bounded on all sides by visible features such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad tracks, and by invisible boundaries such as property lines, legal limits, and short imaginary extensions of streets and roads. 1990 census blocks never cross county or 1990 census tract/BNA boundaries. In rare instances, parts of a 1990 census block may be discontiguous, but all parts of a 1990 tabulation block will be in the same geographic or governmental unit. Blocks are composed of one or more GT-polygons; that is, several GT-polygons can share the same block number. See Figures 4-2 and 4-3. Census 2000 Collection Blocks Census 2000 uses a set of collection geographic areas for canvassing and administering the census. The collection areas and their hierarchy used in the Census 2000 are different from those used in the 1990 census. Census 2000 collection blocks are unique within collection state and county. The Census 2000 collection blocks generally follow visible features such as roads, rivers, and railroad tracks. 1990 Census Block Numbers 1990 census blocks are numbered uniquely within each 1990 state/county/census tract or BNA. A 1990 census block must be identified by a 3-character basic block number field and a 1-character block suffix field. The suffix field often is blank. The 3-character basic block number identifies the collection block used in the 1990 census field operations. The first digit of the basic 1990 block number identifies the BG.  4-10 1998 TIGER/Line Files   The Census Bureau refers to the combined basic 1990 collection block number and suffix (if a suffix exists) as the tabulation block number. The 1990 tabulation block numbers identified in Record Types 1, 3, A, and S have a 1-character suffix field. The suffix character is blank for whole 1990 collection blocks that also are tabulation blocks. 1990 block numbers with suffixes usually represent 1990 collection blocks that are split in order to identify separate geographic entities that divide the original block. For example, when a city limit runs through 1990 collection block 101, the portion inside the city may be tabulated in block 101A and the portion outside the city in 1990 block 101B. The suffix letters A and B have no correlation to the location of the 1990 block portion to which they are assigned. In other words, in the example above, the portion of 1990 block 101 inside the city could have been assigned a suffix of B, and the portion outside the city, a suffix of A. There is no limit on the number of parts into which a 1990 block can be split. Census 2000 Collection Block Numbers For Census 2000, collection blocks are numbered with a four- or five-character identifier. Census 2000 collection blocks are unique within collection state and county; they do not nest within census tract as they did in 1990. To control the Census 2000 collection block numbers during the collection process, the Census Bureau retains the original state and county codes even if the current state and county changed after the original Census 2000 collection blocks were delineated. The collection state and county codes reflect the boundaries of those areas at the time of collection block numbering. To uniquely identify Census 2000 collection blocks, users must take both the collection state and county code file together with the collection block number and suffix fields. To support its enumeration activities, the Census Bureau assigns a collection block suffix to collection blocks split by road features added to Census TIGER after the assignment of the Census 2000 collection block numbers. The Census Bureau also assigns collection block suffixes to reflect updated American Indian reservation, American Indian trust land, and military installation boundaries. For those Census 2000 collection blocks that are split, the Census Bureau assigns a suffix to each collection block part.

As there is only one number ending in 99 within a 1990 BG, many water polygons can have the same 1990 block number. 1990 water blocks have suffixes if parts of the same 1990 block are located in different geographic entities. Rather than extending the 1990 census tract/BNA boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the three-mile limit, the Census Bureau closed off some 1990 census tract/BNA areas using boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore. The Census Bureau assigned a default 1990 census tract/BNA number of 0000 and 1990 block number of 099 to the offshore areas. 1990 water blocks do not appear in the 1990 census STF files. Census maps and other data files do not display the 1990 block numbers for water areas. The principal purpose for census block numbers assigned to water areas is to identify all areas of the United States and its territories and to allocate the water areas to geographic entities. Water GT-polygons with the same 1990 block number may not be contiguous, but will be in the same geographic area or governmental unit. Changes to shorelines or boundaries made since the release of the 1990 Census TIGER/Line files altered or removed 1990 block boundary features between parts of some 1990 water blocks and changed the 1990 block numbers (the BG designator) for those blocks. Because the 1990 water blocks had no population or housing, the tabulation of the 1990 census was unaffected. Some water blocks in the 1990 Census TIGER/Line files Supplemental CD-ROM may contain census block suffixes that do not match subsequent TIGER/Line file. Census 2000 Collection Water Blocks For Census 2000, the Census Bureau is using a different method for identifying the water areas of census blocks than used in the 1990 census. Any water area located completely with the boundaries of a single land block will have the same block number as that land block. Water area that touches more than one land block is assigned a unique collection block number not associated with any adjacent land block. The Census Bureau is assigning collection water block numbers beginning with 9999 or 99999 and preceding in descending order. For example, the collection water block numbers in a county would be 9999, 9998, 9997, and so forth. In some counties it is possible that the number 4-14 1998 TIGER/Line Files   of land blocks might use enough of the available collection block numbers to reach into 9000 range. For this reason, and because some land blocks include water (ponds and small lakes), no conclusions about whether or not a collection block is all land or all water can be made by looking at the Census 2000 collection block numbers. Data users must use the WATER flag on Record Type S to determine if the GT-polygon is land or water. Current Geography Record Types 1, 3, A, C, and S identify changes (both codes and boundaries) since the 1990 census tabulation for some geographic entities. These records do not show new block numbers. The Census Bureau continues to conduct its annual Boundary and Annexation Survey to identify changes to the boundaries of legal entities. However, the 1990 block numbers remain for new polygons created by the post-census boundary changes. The Census Bureau will not systematically update block numbering to reflect the current geographic boundaries until it assigns the Census 2000 tabulation block numbers.

When first established, census tracts should have relatively homogeneous demographic characteristics. Generally, census tracts have a population size between 2,500 and 8,000 people, and average about 4,000 people. The local data users can delineate census tracts for special land uses, such as military installations and American Indian reservations. BNAs BNAs are statistical areas delineated for the 1990 census by state agencies or the Census Bureau for counties without census tracts. The delineation of BNAs followed the same basic criteria as those for census tracts. Because BNAs appear more often in less populated counties, they may have fewer people than census tracts.  4-16 1998 TIGER/Line Files   Numbering Census tract numbers have a 4-character basic number field and an optional 2-character suffix number field. In printed reports and on mapping products, the Census Bureau uses a decimal point (.) to separate the basic number from the suffix. However, in the TIGER/ Line files and STF data products, the decimal point is implied. The basic number and the suffix appear together in a single 6-character field in Record Types 1, 3, A, and S. A basic number smaller than 1000 will contain leading zeros. Leading zeros are shown on machine-readable products, but are not shown in printed reports and on census maps since leading zeros are not part of the basic number. The TIGER/Line files use the right-most two characters in the census tract/BNA field for the suffix. These two characters are blank if the census tract/BNA number does not have a suffix. Suffixes smaller than 10 have a leading zero. For example, census tract 0077.01 is shown as 007701 in the TIGER/Line files. The Census Bureau uses suffixes to help identify census tract changes for comparison purposes. Local data users have an opportunity to review the existing census tracts before each census. If data users split a census tract, the split parts usually retain the basic number, but receive different suffixes. In a few counties, data users approve major changes to, and renumber, the census tracts. Changes to individual census tract boundaries usually do not result in census tract numbering changes. The Census Bureau documents all changes to census tract boundaries and numbers in the TIGER/Census Tract Comparability File (19801990). Data users are cautioned to examine the census tract boundaries or the comparability file before making comparisons between past data and 1990 data. Boundaries and Boundary Changes Census tract/BNA boundaries generally follow visible physical features and county boundaries. The 1990 census tract or BNA boundary may follow MCD and incorporated place boundaries in New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and the New England States (and occasionally other states) because the boundaries tend to be stable and locally known.  Geographic Entities 4- 17   In a few rare instances, a 1990 census tract or BNA may consist of discontiguous areas. These discontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves discontiguous. Census tracts were last defined in preparation for the 1990 census. Census tracts/BNAs must nest within acounty. New 1990 census tracts/BNAs were created to accommodate updates and corrections to county boundaries following the assignment of block numbers in 1988. This was necessary because existing 1990 census tracts were in place for the 1990census and could not be shifted. At the request of some local data users, the Census Bureau resolved a number of census tract boundary discrepancies. This explains some of the less populated census tracts and the census tracts with basic numbers or suffixes that are seemingly out of range for the county. The Census Bureau generally identified the revised 1990 census tracts/ BNAs with a unique suffix ranging from .70 to .98 (e.g., 1234.98) so data users could easily determine which census tracts/BNAs were affected. The Census Bureau made these changes after the release of the TIGER/ Line Precensus Files, 1990. The census tract boundaries follow legal county boundaries as of January 1, 1990. Because there have been state and/or county boundary changes since 1990, users are cautioned to only use 1990 state and county areas to identify census tracts/BNAs. Census tracts next will be defined for Census 2000. Relationship to Other Geographic Entities The 1990 census tracts and BNAs represent the same level of geography and share the same field in the TIGER/Line files. Census tracts or BNAs entirely cover a county. A county contains either census tracts or BNAs, but not a combination of both. Census BGs and blocks are uniquely numbered within census tracts and BNAs.

The left- and right-side complete chain census tract/BNA numbers are not blank except where they are located along the outside edge of the county boundary. The TIGER/Line files do not contain geographic codes for the area outside of the county file. The TIGER/Line files identify the boundary complete chains by placing a 1 in the single-side segment field in Record Type 1. The Census Bureau assigned a default 1990 census tract/BNA number of 0000 to some coastal and Great Lakes water rather than extend the census tract/ BNA boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the three-mile limit. The Census Bureau closed off some census tract/BNA areas along the shoreline or just offshore, and assigned the default census tract/BNA and special block numbers to the offshore water areas.  Congressional Districts The 1998 TIGER/Line files contain 2-character numeric code fields for the current (106th ), the 106th, and the 108th congressional districts. Congressional districts are numbered uniquely within 1990 state. Users must always combine the 1990 state codes with congressional district codes; corrections to state boundaries since 1990 will create anomalous current state to congressional district relationships. The field for the 108th congressional districts is blank. The current congressional district field always has a value other than blank for all polygons.

The county or MCD and the separately incorporated places within the consolidated city continue to exist. The Census Bureau classifies the separately incorporated places within the consolidated city as place entities and creates a separate place (remainder) record for the portion of the consolidated city not within any other place. Refer to the Places section in this chapter for additional information. Consolidated cities are represented in the TIGER/Line files by a 5-character numeric FIPS code. Record Type C has the complete list of valid codes and entity names.

The TIGER/Line files contain several 3-character numeric fying the FIPS county code for the 1990 census and the FIPS current entities.

They use a single field to identify the two functional types (legal and statistical) of county subdivisions. Record Type C contains all valid codes and entity names. Legal Entities Minor Civil Divisions (MCDs)  MCDs are legally defined subcounty areas such as towns (in eight states) and townships. MCDs exist in 28 states, Puerto Rico, and the Island Territories.  Some states have incorporated places that are not part of any MCD. These places also serve as primary legal subdivisions and have a unique FIPS MCD code that is the same as the FIPS place code. The TIGER/Line files will show the same FIPS 55 code in the county subdivision field and the place field.  In New York and Maine, American Indian reservations (AIRs) exist outside the jurisdiction of any town (MCD) and thus also serve as MCD-equivalent entities. Statistical Entities Census County Divisions (CCDs) CCDs are areas delineated by state officials and local data users for statistical purposes. CCD boundaries usually follow visible features and in most cases, coincide with census tract or BNA boundaries. CCDs exist where: 1) There are no legally established minor civil divisions (MCDs). 2) The legally established MCDs do not have governmental or administrative purposes. 3) The boundaries of the MCDs change frequently. 4) The MCDs are not generally known to the public.  4-22 1998 TIGER/Line Files   CCDs have been established for the following 21 states: Alabama Arizona California Colorado Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Kentucky Montana Nevada New Mexico Oklahoma Oregon South Carolina Tennessee Texas Utah Washington Wyoming  Census Subareas Census subareas are subdivisions of boroughs and census areas, the county equivalent entities in Alaska. The state of Alaska and the Census Bureau cooperatively delineated the census subareas to serve as the statistical equivalents of MCDs. Unorganized Territories (UTs) For states with partial MCD coverage, the Census Bureau defines UTs for the non-MCD area. UTs are assigned county subdivision codes and names. Eleven states had or now have UTs: Arkansas Indiana (only for current) Iowa Kansas (only for 1990) Louisiana Maine Minnesota North Carolina North Dakota Ohio (only for current) South Dakota  County Subdivision Code Record Locations Record Type 1 1 3 3 A C C C S Field Name FMCDL FMCDR FMCD90L FMCD90R FMCD FIPS ENTITY NAME FMCD Description FIPS 55 Code (MCD/CCD) FIPS 55 Code (MCD/CCD) FIPS 55 Code (MCD/CCD), FIPS 55 Code (MCD/CCD), FIPS 55 Code (MCD/CCD), FIPS 55 Code, Entity Type Name of Geographic Area FIPS 55 Code (MCD/CCD), Left, Current Right, Current 1990 Left 1990 Right 1990  Current  Geographic Entities 4- 23   The Census Bureau assigned a default county subdivision code of 00000 in some coastal and Great Lakes water where county subdivisions did not extend into the Great Lakes or out to the three-mile limit.  Crews-of-Vessels Crews-of-vessels represent the population on military (including Coast Guard) and merchant ships; they do not include the inhabitants of houseboats or marinas. The census population tables show the vessels population in a unique 1990 census tract/BNA and census block. A crews-of-vessels census tract/BNA and block appear on census maps as an anchor symbol with the census tract/BNA and block numbers, rather than as a delimited area. The location of the anchor symbol is arbitrary and reflects neither the location of the vessel(s) at the time of the census, nor the location of the 1990 crews-of-vessels census tract/ BNA and block as it appears in the TIGER/Line file. See the Census Tracts and Block Numbering Areas and the Census Blocks sections in this chapter for record locations and field names. 1990 Crews-of-vessels census tract/BNA numbers use the same basic 1990 census tract/BNA number as the nearby land census tract/BNA with which the vessel is associated, plus a suffix of 99, shown in decimal notation. For example, 1990 census tract 1234.99 is shown as 123499 in the TIGER/Line files and other machine-readable products. 1990 Crews-ofvessels block numbers use the same basic 1990 block number as the associated land block in that 1990 census tract/BNA, plus a block suffix of Z; for example, block 901Z in 1990 census tract 1234.99. In such a situation, the related land block also receives a suffix, even though it may not be split by a boundary; for example, the addition of crews-of-vessels associated with the 1990 block 901 creates blocks 901A and 901Z. The Census Bureau does not use the 1990 Z census block suffix for any purpose other than the crews-of-vessels. Either the left or right 1990 census tract/BNA and census block identified in Record Type 1 will indicate the location to which the population is assigned. The 1990 census tract/BNA and census block for crews-ofvessels form an extremely small, triangular-shaped polygon requiring only one complete chain with a start node equal to the end node and two intermediate shape points. Based on the coordinates found on Record Types 1 and 2, the location of the 1990 census block is on the 4-24 1998 TIGER/Line Files   shore inside the land block with the same 3-digit 1990 collection block number, not in the water as shown on the census maps. The Census Bureau defines the area measurement enclosed by the special 1990 crews-of-vessels census tract/BNA and block as zero.  Metropolitan Areas The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) designates metropolitan areas to serve as statistical areas around the larger population centers of the United States and Puerto Rico. Basically, a metropolitan area must contain an urbanized area delineated by the Census Bureau or an incorporated place with a population of 50,000 or more. Metropolitan areas consist of whole counties or county equivalents in most states; in New England the OMB defines metropolitan areas using MCDs. The metropolitan area consists of the central county, county equivalent, or MCD (in New England) and additional areas based on OMB criteria related to population density, population growth, and commuting data. There are three types of metropolitan areas. If a metropolitan area has a total population of less than 1,000,000, the area is designated a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). Metropolitan areas with a population of 1,000,000 or greater qualify for designation as a Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA) that is composed of smaller Primary Metropolitan Statistical Areas (PMSAs). This designation is not automatic; the OMB solicits local opinion to designate CMSAs and their component PMSAs. The TIGER/Line files now contain three different 4-character numeric fields to identify the FIPS code for each metropolitan area and to differentiate CMSAs and MSAs from PMSAs. The FIPS codes are from FIPS PUB 8. If the metropolitan area is a CMSA then a value exists in the CMSA field identifying the CMSA and the value in the MA field identifies the PMSA. A blank CMSA field indicates the code in the MA field is for the MSA. Record Type C uses a single metropolitan area field to identify CMSAs, MSAs, and PMSAs. The Legal/Administrative/Statistical Area code identifies the type of metropolitan area.

Record Type C in the TIGER/Line files contains all the valid codes and entity names for CMSAs, MSAs, and PMSAs. The current metropolitan areas represent the latest OMB designations and not necessarily the metropolitan areas for which the Census Bureau tabulated data in the 1990 census. Record Type C shows both 1990 and current codes and names.  Places The TIGER/Line files use a single field to identify places that are legal entities, and places that are statistical entities. The FIPS place code uniquely identifies a place within a state. Legal Entities Incorporated Places Incorporated places are legal entities incorporated

This data set was extracted from the 2000 TIGER/Line Redistricting File. The geographic coverage for a single TIGER/Line file is a county or statistical equivalent entity, with the coverage area based on January 1, 2000 legal boundaries.  This data set contains extracts from all of Washington State's 39 Counties.                  Purpose :  Statistical enumeration, cartographic display and analysis.        Supplemental Information :                        This data set dose NOT include those parts of Urbanized Areas which cross into other States.   1990 Urban/Rural:  The U.S. Census Bureau defined urban for the 1990 census as consisting of all territory and population in urbanized areas (UAs) and in the urban portion of places with 2,500 or more people located outside of the UAs.  Urbanized Areas (UAs) are a subset of those areas the Census Bureau classified as urban in 1990. Urban Places (NOT included in this file) are the urban portion of places with 2,500 or more people located outside of the UAs.  1990 Urbanized Areas (UAs) consists of at least one central place and the adjacent densely settled surrounding territory that together have a minimum population of 50,000 people. The densely settled surrounding territory generally consists of an area with continuous residential development and a general overall population density of at least 1,000 people per square mile. The TIGER/Line® files identify 1990 UAs with a 4-character numeric census code.  The 1990 Seattle, Wa UA included the City of Everett's Municipal watershed.  This watershed is not contiguous with the Seattle UA or the Everett City Limits. As the watershed is for municipal purposes it did not, contain any population according to the 1990 Census. Given the location of the watershed, approximately 15 miles east of Everett City, and it's municipal use, it the opinion of OFM staff that this area dose not qualify as an urbanized area and was included in the data seta in error.  Users may want to remove this polygon from the Seattle UA for some types of analysis.  The Census Bureau continually updates their TIGER Database.  In the update process the points, lines, and polygons are repositioned.  Because of the repositioning of various TIGER line segments the boundaries included may not correspond to those derived from previous versions of the TIGER files.

The Census Bureau check for accuracy against Federal information Processing Standards (FIPS), FIPS Publication 6-4, and FIPS-55 at the 100% level for the codes and base names.  The remaining attribute information has been examined but has not been fully tested for accuracy.  The data represent entities in Washington State only.                    Completeness Report :  The data represent the 10 Urbanized Areas defined by the Census Bureau based on the 1990 Census Data in the State of Washington.    Positional Accuracy :              Horizontal Positional Accuracy :                      Horizontal Positional Accuracy Report :                                The information present in these files is provided for the purposes of statistical analysis and census operations only.  Coordinates in the TIGER/Line files have six implied decimal places, but the positional accuracy of these coordinates is not as great as the six decimal places suggest.  The positional accuracy varies with the source materials used, but generally the information is no better than the established national map Accuracy standards for 1:100,000-scale maps from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS); thus it is NOT suitable for high-precision measurement applications such as engineering problems, property transfers, or other uses that might require highly accurate measurements of the earth's surface.  The USGS 1:100,000-scale maps met national map accuracy standards and use coordinates defined by the North American Datum, 1983.  For the contiguous 48 States, the cartographic fidelity of most of the Redistricting Census 2000 TIGER/Line files, in areas outside the 1980 census Geographic Base File/Dual Independent map Encoding (GBF/DIME) file coverage and selected other large metropolitan areas, compare favorable with the USGS 1:100,000-scale maps.  The Census Bureau cannot specify the accuracy of features inside of what was the 1980 GBF/DIME-File coverage or selected metropolitan areas.  The Census Bureau added updates to the TIGER/Line files that enumerators annotated on maps sheets prepared from the Census TIGER data base as they attempted to traverse every street feature shown on the Census 2000 map sheets; the Census Bureau also made other corrections from updated map sheets supplied by local participants for Census Bureau programs.  The locational accuracy of these updates is of unknown quality.  In addition to the Federal, State, and local sources, portions of the files may contain information obtained in part from maps and other materials prepared by private companies.  Despite the fact the TIGER/Line data positional accuracy is not as high as the coordinate values imply, the six-decimal place precision is useful when producing maps.  The precision allows features that are next to each other on the ground to be placed in the correct position, on the map, relative to each other, without overlap.

ZCTA is a trademark of the U.S. Census Bureau.             The Census 2000 TIGER/Line files are an extract of selected geographic                        and cartographic information from the Census TIGER data base. The             geographic coverage for a single TIGER/Line file is a county or             statistical equivalent entity, with the coverage area based on January                        1, 2000 legal boundaries. A complete set of Census 2000 TIGER/Line             files includes all counties and statistically equivalent entities in                        the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. The Census             TIGER data base represents a seamless national file with no overlaps                        or gaps between parts. However, each county-based TIGER/Line file             is designed to stand alone as an independent data set or the files             can be combined to cover the whole Nation. The Census 2000             TIGER/Line files consist of line segments representing physical             features and governmental and statistical boundaries. The boundary            information in the TIGER/Line files are for statistical data             collection and tabulation purposes only; their depiction and             designation for statistical purposes does not constitute a             determination of jurisditional authority or rights of ownership or             entitlement. The Census 2000 TIGER/Line files do NOT contain the             Census 2000 urban areas which have not yet been delineated. The             files contain information distributed over a series of record types                        for the spatial objects of a county. There are 17 record types,             including the basic data record, the shape coordinate points, and             geographic codes that can be used with appropriate software to             prepare maps. Other geographic information contained in the files             includes attributes such as feature identifiers/census feature             class codes (CFCC) used to differentiate feature types, address             ranges and ZIP Codes, codes for legal and statistical entities,             latitude/longitude coordinates of linear and point features,             landmark point features, area landmarks, key geographic features,             and area boundaries. The Census 2000 TIGER/Line data dictionary             contains a complete list of all the fields in the 17 record types.                     Purpose:            In order for others to use the information in the Census TIGER data                        base in a geographic information system (GIS) or for other geographic                        applications, the Census Bureau releases to the public extracts of             the data base in the form of TIGER/Line files. Various versions of             the TIGER/Line files have been released; previous versions include             the 1990 Census TIGER/Line files, the 1992 TIGER/Line files, the             1994 TIGER/Line files, the 1995 TIGER/Line files, the 1997 TIGER/Line            files, the 1998 TIGER/Line files, the 1999 TIGER/Line files, and the                        Redistricting Census 2000 TIGER/Line files.

Native_Data_Set_Environment:            TIGER/Line files are created and processed in a VMS environment.             The environment consists of two Alpha Server 8400s clustered together                        running OpenVMS version 6.2-1H3 used for production operations. The                        Census TIGER system is driven by DEC Command language (DCL) procedures                        which invoke C software routines to extract selected geographic and                        cartographic information (TIGER/Line files) from the operational             Census TIGER data base.                     Data_Quality_Information:            Attribute_Accuracy:            Attribute_Accuracy_Report:            Accurate against Federal information Processing Standards (FIPS),             FIPS Publication 6-4, and FIPS-55 at the 100% level for the codes             and base names. The remaining attribute information has been             examined but has not been fully tested for accuracy.            Logical_Consistency_Report:            The feature network of lines (as represented by Record Types 1 and 2)                        is compete for census purposes. Spatial objects in TIGER/Line belong                        to the ""Geometry and Topology"" (GT) class of objects in the            ""Spatial             Data Transfer Standard"" (SDTS) FIPS Publication 173 and are             topologically valid. Node/geometry and topology (GT)-polygon/chain             relationships are collected or generated to satisfy topological edit            requirements. These requirements include:            * Complete chains must begin and end at nodes.            * Complete chains must connect to each other at nodes.            * Complete chains do not extend through nodes.            * Left and right GT-polygons are defined for each complete chain             element and are consistent throughout the extract process.            * The chains representing the limits of the files are free of gaps.            The Census Bureau performed automated tests to ensure logical             consistency and limits of files. All polygons are tested for closure.                        The Census Bureau uses its internally developed Geographic Update             System to enhance and modify spatial and attribute data in the Census                        TIGER data base. Standard geographic codes, such as FIPS codes for             states, counties, municipalities, and places, are used when encoding                        spatial entities. The Census Bureau performed spatial data tests for                        logical consistency of the codes during the compilation of the original                        Census TIGER data base files. Most of the Codes themselves were provided                        to the Census Bureau by the USGS, the agency responsible for maintaining                        FIPS 55. Feature attribute information has been examined but has not            been            fully tested for consistency.            Completeness_Report:            Data completeness of the TIGER/Line files reflects the contents of the                        Census TIGER data base at the time the TIGER/Line files (Census 2000                        version) were created.            Positional_Accuracy:            Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:            Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:            The information present in these files is provided for the purposes                        of statistical analysis and census operations only. Coordinates             in the TIGER/Line files have six implied decimal places, but             the positional accuracy of these coordinates is not as great as             the six decimal places suggest. The positional accuracy varies             with the source materials used, but generally the information is             no better than the established national map Accuracy standards             for 1:100,000-scale maps from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS);             thus it is NOT suitable for high-precision measurement applications                        such as engineering problems, property transfers, or other uses             that might require highly accurate measurements of the earth's             surface. The USGS 1:100,000-scale maps met national map accuracy             standards and use coordinates defined by the North American Datum,             1983. For the contiguous 48 States, the cartographic fidelity of             most of the Census 2000 TIGER/Line files, in areas outside the             1980 census Geographic Base File/Dual Independent map Encoding             (GBF/DIME) file coverage and selected other large metropolitan             areas, compare favorably with the USGS 1:100,000-scale maps. The             Census Bureau cannot specify the accuracy of features inside of             what was the 1980 GBF/DIME-File coverage or selected metropolitan             areas. The Census Bureau added updates to the TIGER/Line files that                        enumerators annotated on maps sheets prepared from the Census             TIGER data base as they attempted to traverse every street feature             shown on the Census 2000 map sheets; the Census Bureau also made             other corrections from updated map sheets supplied by local             participants for Census Bureau programs. The locational accuracy             of these updates is of unknown quality. In addition to the Federal,                        State, and local sources, portions of the files may contain             information obtained in part from maps and other materials prepared                        by private companies. Despite the fact the TIGER/Line data positional                        accuracy is not as high as the coordinate values imply, the six-            decimal place precision is useful when producing maps. The precision                        allows features that are next to each other on the ground to be placed                        in the correct position, on the map, relative to each other, without                        overlap.

Software (TIGER DB routines) written by             the Geography Division allows for efficient access to Census             TIGER system data. TIGER/Line files are extracted from the             Census TIGER data base by county or statistical equivalent             area. Census TIGER data for a given county or statistical            equivalent area is then distributed among 17 fixed length             record ASCII files, each one containing attributes for either             line, polygon, or landmark geographic data types. The Census             Bureau has released various versions of the TIGER/Line files            since 1988, with each version having more updates (feature             and feature names, address ranges and ZIP Codes, coordinate             updates, revised field definitions, etc.) than the previous             version.

Polygon features -            1) Geographic entity codes for areas used to tabulate the Census             2000 census            statistical data and 1990 geographic areas            2) Locations of area landmarks            3) Locations of KGLs            The line features and polygon information form the majority of             data in the TIGER/Line files. Some of the data/attributes             describing the lines include coordinates, feature identifiers             (names), CFCCs (used to identify the most noticeable             characteristic of a feature), address ranges, and geographic             entity codes. The TIGER/Line files contain point and area             labels that describe landmark features and provide locational             reference. Area landmarks consist of a feature name or label             and feature type assigned to a polygon or group of polygons.             Landmarks may overlap or refer to the same set of polygons.            The Census TIGER data base uses collections of spatial objects             (points, lines, and polygons) to model or describe real-world             geography. The Census Bureau uses these spatial objects to             represent features such as streets, rivers, and political             boundaries and assigns attributes to these features to identify             and describe specific features such as the 500 block of Market             Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Glossary-1  Table of Contents xi    Introduction The TIGER/Line files are extracts, from the Census TIGER (Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing) data base, of selected geographic and cartographic information. They include files for all counties and statistically equivalent entities in the United States, as well as files for Puerto Rico and the Island Territories. The TIGER/Line files are released by county or statistically equivalent entity based on the latest available governmental unit boundaries. Since the 1990 Census, there have been several changes to the universe of county or statistically equivalent entities. In Alaska the SkagwayYukutat-Angoon Census Area has become Skagway-Hoonah-Angoon Census Area and Yukutat Borough. Also in Alaska, Denali Borough was created from parts of Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area and Southeast Fairbanks Census Area. The City of South Boston, VA no longer is an independent city (statistical equivalent of a county) and is now part of Halifax County, VA. The TIGER/Line files contain data only and do not include display or mapping software. The TIGER/Line files are typically used in conjunction with geographic information system, or similar, software. The US Bureau of the Census first released the TIGER/Line files in 1988. Since that time, it has released several versions of the files, with each successive version being improved through increased editing and updating of address ranges and features. A brief discussion of the changes that occurred in the 1994 and 1995 TIGER/Line files, and the 1997 TIGER/Line files are summarized below.  Census TIGER, TIGER, TIGER/Line, TIGER/SDTS, TIGER/Census Tract Street Index, TIGER/CTSI, CTSI, TIGER/Census Tract Comparability , and TIGER/GICS are registered trademarks of the U.S. Bureau of the Census. As such, these names cannot be used as or within the proprietary product names of any commercial product including or otherwise relevant to Census Bureau data, and may only be used to refer to the nature of such product. The Census Bureau requests that any repackaging of the TIGER/Line data (and documentation) and other files accompanying it for distribution include a conspicuously-placed statement to this effect on the product's cover, the first page of the website, or elsewhere of comparable visibility. Further, Census Bureau trademarks, when used in reference to the nature of the product, should be accompanied by the  (registered) symbol, where convenient.  Introduction I-1   Changes in the 1994, 1995, and 1997 TIGER/Line 1994 TIGER/Line Files    File Versions  The format and structure of the TIGER/Line files changed between the 1992 and the 1994 versions. In the 1994 TIGER/Line files, there were field definition changes and additional record types that accommodated new information or information that was previously supplied separately in other Census Bureau products. New Record Types The 1994 TIGER/Line files included five new record types--9, C, H, S, and Z. Record Type 9 contained key geographic locations (KGLs). A KGL was a particular type of point landmark with residential or economic significance. Record Type 9 provided the linkage between a building (KGL) with a unique identity and ZIP+4 Code, and the building's address that used its number and street name. Record Type C replaced information that was supplied separately in the TIGER/Geographic NameTM files. Record Type C provided a unique list of all geographic entities with their code, name, and status. The FIPS Year field had three values, 90 for geographic names and codes valid for the 1990 census, 94 for geographic names and codes valid for the current year, and blank when the geographic names and codes were the same for 1990 and 1994. Multiple records for the same geographic entity showed its change or correction over time. Record Type H described the history of TIGER/Line IDs when complete chains were split or merged. Two fields (HIST and SOURCE) on Record Type H were not yet maintained in the Census TIGER data base and were blank. Record Type S had geographic area codes for polygons. It was similar to Record Type A (which also had geographic area codes for polygons) and was linked to Record Type P. There was a Record Type S for every polygon in Record Type P. Several fields were reserved for use by participants in Census Bureau programs. The WATER field had two values, 0 for land or 1 for water.  I-2 1997 TIGER/Line Files   The Congressional District codes for the current Congress (in this case, the 103rd) were moved to Record Type S. The current Congressional District code, when combined with the 1990 state codes, created valid geographic areas. When only current state geographic codes were combined, nonexistent geographic areas may have resulted. The fields for the 101st and 103rd Congressional District codes in Record Type A were replaced with those designated for the 106th and 108th. However, these fields were blank in the 1994 TIGER/Line files. Record Type Z linked a Postal +4 Add-On code to an address range in either Record Type 1 or Record Type 6. TLID fields were matched on these records. If the RTSQ field on Record Type 6 contained a 0, the Postal +4 Add-On codes applied to the address ranges in Record Type 1. If the RTSQ field contained a number greater than 0, the Postal +4 AddOn codes applied to the address ranges in the Record Type 6 that had the identical RTSQ value. Deleted Record Types In the 1994 TIGER/Line files, Record Types F and G were deleted because they were no longer used. Record Type F showed geographic codes as of January 1, 1990 that were corrected to resolve questions raised by local officials about the 1990 census data tabulations. Record Type G showed geographic codes (generally as of January 1, 1992) for those situations where geographic entities reported boundary changes during the Census Bureau's annual survey of governmental units. In the 1994 TIGER/Line files, information previously reported in Record Type G became implicit in the current geographic codes in Record Types 1 and S. Field Definition Changes The geographic area codes on Record Type 1 represented current geography rather than the 1990 census tabulation geography. The census tract and block remained as 1990 geography. In a few Type 1 records, the current state and county, when combined with the 1990 census tract and block, created nonexistent geographic areas. To avoid nonexistent geographic areas, it was important not to mix the 1990 geographic codes with the current geographic codes. The 1990 state, county, place, census tract, and census block codes all were found on Record Type 3.  Introduction I-3   Record Type 3 no longer identified 1980 geographic area codes or contained census codes for places, minor civil divisions, and sub-minor civil divisions. These fields were replaced with the 1990 geographic areas that previously appeared in Record Type 1. Current geographic areas included on Record Type 3 were the Alaska Native Regional Corporations and the American Indian/Alaska Native Areas (AIANAs). Census Alaska Native Regional Corporation codes were eliminated from Record Type 1 and replaced by four fields. Two fields were reserved for census use. Two fields carried American Indian Trust Land Flags and contained two values, an ""I"" for individual trust land or a ""T"" for tribal trust land. The trust land flag more accurately portrayed the American Indian areas. Record Type 7 excluded key geographic locations (KGLs). These appeared in the new Record Type 9. Address Ranges and ZIP Codes The 1994 TIGER/Line files contained improvements in address information. Address ranges were edited for overlaps or other inconsistencies and ZIP Codes were updated in selected areas. Coordinates In the 1994 TIGER/Line files, NAD27 was the coordinate datum used for the 48 contiguous states, the District of Columbia, Alaska, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. Regional datums were used for Hawaii and the Island Territories in the Pacific. The accuracy of the feature coordinates in Alaska was improved by shifting them in relation to a sample of points of known higher accuracy.  1995 TIGER/Line Files No records types were added or deleted between the 1994 and 1995 versions of the TIGER/Line files. However, there were field definition and coordinate datum changes, as well as address information improvements, in the 1995 TIGER/Line files. Field Definition Changes The CENID field was changed from numeric to alphanumeric in the 1995 TIGER/Line files to permit a wider range of entries within the same field length. I-4 1997 TIGER/Line Files   Address Ranges and ZIP Codes Address ranges were edited for overlaps or other inconsistencies and ZIP Codes were updated in selected areas. The street names and address ranges in the Census TIGER data base were compared to those in the ZIP+4 file of the US Postal Service. If a street name and address range did not have a ZIP+4 code, the code was copied from the ZIP+4 file to the Census TIGER data base. The consistency of highway names and feature identifiers also was improved. Boundary and Area Changes The 1994 TIGER/Line files were included for American Samoa because the Census Bureau received no updates for this area. Since the 1990 census, the Bureau shifted and reshaped some line features, including boundary lines. This realignment of features could have been associated with corporate boundary corrections and changes. The shape and area of the geographic entities depicted in the 1995 TIGER/Line files may have differed from earlier versions of the TIGER/Line files, but represented the entities as they existed for the 1990 census. The inventory of census tabulation entities remained the same as it was in 1990. With the exception of Hawaii, Record Type 1 no longer contained census designated place (CDP) information. Since CDPs are defined at the time of each decennial census and are valid only for the presentation of decennial census data, the CDP complete chain information was removed from Record Type 1 which contained only current geography, but retained on Record Type 3 which had 1990 geography. Because Hawaii did not have independently-defined incorporated place boundaries, it used CDP boundaries as substitutes for these legal boundaries. Thus, its CDP complete chain information was retained on Record Type 1. Coordinates For the 48 contiguous states, the District of Columbia, Alaska, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, the coordinates in the 1995 TIGER/Line files were in the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). In all previous versions, the coordinate datum for the above areas was NAD27. Regional datums were used for Hawaii and the Island Territories in the Pacific.  Introduction I-5   1997 TIGER/Line Files The 1997 TIGER/Line files have the same structure as the 1995 TIGER/ Line files; there are no record additions or deletions. However, there are some field name, file name, and content changes. Field Definition Changes The Census Bureau redefined the concept of version. The four-digit version code no longer will be a number that represents a fixed version that can be referenced nationwide. The version code will be a four-digit number that represents the month and year (mmyy) the file is extracted from the Census TIGER data base. Adjacent counties in a state may have different version codes if they are extracted at different points in time. There have been several changes to the fields on Record Type 3. The reserved spaces one through four in the 1995 TIGER/Line  files contain four 1990 American Indian and Alaska Native area census code and American Indian trust land flag fields in the 1997 TIGER/ Line files. These four fields are: Census American Indian/Alaska Native Area Code, 1990 Left (column positions 58 through 61); Census American Indian/Alaska Native Area Code, 1990 Right (column positions 62 through 65); American Indian Trust Land Flag, 1990 Left (column position 66); and American Indian Trust Land Flag, 1990 Right (column position 67). Deleted from Record Type 3 in the 1997 TIGER/Line files are the Census Alaska Native Regional Corporation Codes, Current Left and Census Alaska Native Regional Corporation Codes, Current Right. As a result of these deletions, reserved space fills columns 86 through 107 of the 1997 TIGER/Line files and the reserved space fields on the record have been renumbered and reconfigured. Two changes occurred on Record Type A. The School District Code, Middle School field, in columns 60 through 64 of the 1995 TIGER/ Line  files was eliminated and replaced with Reserved Space1 in the 1997 TIGER/Line files. Reserved Space 9 in the 1995 TIGER/Line files (columns 95 through 98) has been replaced with the Census American Indian/Alaska Native Area Code, 1990 in the 1997 TIGER/Line files.  I-6 1997 TIGER/Line Files   The length of the RS 9 field in Record Type A has been changed from nine characters to four characters. The five characters freed by this change are now used for the 1990 state and county codes and are the source for determining the 1990 census tabulation codes. There are changes to Record Type C in the 1997 TIGER/Line files. The 1995 TIGER/Line files had ten characters in columns 23 through 32 which contained the Census Alaska Native Regional Corporation Code, Year; FIPS Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area/Metropolitan Statistical Area Code, Year; and the FIPS Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area Code, Year. The 1997 TIGER/Line files allocate these columns to Entity Type Code, Metropolitan Area Code, and School District Code. We have standardized the file suffix names that will the zipped archive. This suffix now will consistently is the record type. In examining the record layouts in corrected information concerning the valid existence and data formats. appear inside be .rtn where n Chapter 6, we of blank values  Address Ranges and ZIP Codes Address ranges were edited for overlaps or other inconsistencies and ZIP Codes were updated in selected areas. Because of time constraints during the various operations needed to create the 1997 TIGER/Line files, the Census Bureau has not added new ZIP+4  information. Boundary and Area Changes Since the 1990 census, the Census Bureau has shifted and reshaped some line features, including boundary lines. The shape and area of the geographic entities depicted in the 1997 TIGER/Line files may differ from earlier versions of the TIGER/Line files, but continue to represent the entities as they existed for the 1990 census. The inventory of census tabulation entities remains the same as it was in 1990. Change in Naming Standards for Record Type 1 The Census Bureau changed its naming standards in Record Type 1 affecting the data in the Feature Direction, Prefix (FEDIRP), Feature Name (FENAME), Feature Type (FETYPE), and Feature Direction, Suffix (FEDIRS) fields. In previous TIGER/Line products, directional prefixes and suffixes could  Introduction I-7   appear for any type of line feature. For the TIGER/Line 1997, only road features, those features with a Census Feature Class Code (CFCC) in the A class, should have feature directional data in the directional fields. Other types of chains representing other types of features (for example, hydrologic features in CFCC class H) no longer are standardized to show directional information. The Census Bureau also modified the extraction of feature directional, name, and type information to improve the standardization of road feature information. The improvement parses a greater number of road chains into the correct feature identifier fields.  Known Problems and Anomalies in TIGER/Line 1997 Missing ZIP+4 Records In the current release of the TIGER/Line files, data users may note a significant reduction in the number of ZIP+4 Add On Codes in Record Type Z (ZIP4L and ZIP4R fields) for some areas. This reduction occurs as a result of operations to update the TIGER data base in preparation for Census 2000. These operations may replace address ranges or change the 5-digit ZIP Code, but do not automatically update or transfer the ZIP+4 codes to the new ranges. Because the Add On codes are valid for specific 5-digit ZIP Codes and address ranges, the previous Add On codes may no longer apply to the new address ranges. In nearly all situations, an automated match between the Census TIGER data base and the USPS ZIP+4 file is the source of ZIP+4 Add On Codes in TIGER products. With update operations for Census 2000 underway for large portions of the nation, we have not yet performed this automated match to refresh these codes. Future releases of TIGER/Line files will contain refreshed codes that will reflect a more current USPS ZIP+4 file for the address range improvements that we are now making. Address Anomalies in Puerto Rico and Queens County, N.Y. The TIGER/Line files contain some address range coverage for Puerto Rico. However, use of this information for geocoding purposes may be problematic and the data user should proceed with caution. These address ranges are preliminary attempts at using Puerto Rico address I-8 1997 TIGER/Line Files   ranges in Census Bureau files. Due to the lack of software or resources to handle some of the more unique aspects of addressing in Puerto Rico, the address ranges were entered without the standard edits and quality checks used in other parts of the United States. Improvements in software and address standardization for Puerto Rico are expected in the future. At present, there are inconsistencies, overlaps, and duplication of address ranges. Address ranges may lack alpha character prefixes or have hyphenated prefixes. The files also lack the community names used in a four-line address that the U.S. Postal Service requires to avoid duplicate addresses. Errors in the reference files, and other factors may limit the usefulness of this product for geocoding purposes. Address range data for Queens County, NY in TIGER/Line 1997 does not show a consistent use of hyphenated and non-hyphenated addressing. The Census Bureau intends to correct this in future versions of TIGER products. Road Feature Anomalies The Census Bureau extracts TIGER/Line files from the TIGER data base which is continually updated. During the update process for some 1997 TIGER/Line files errors caused anomalies to be introduced into some chains represented in Record Types 1 and 2. For these cases road features may appear in the 1997 TIGER/Line files unconnected to other road features (so-called floating features) or severely skewed in relation to surrounding line features of any type. This problem was not discovered during the normal Census Bureau correction operations. The Census Bureau will fix these disconnected or skewed features before the release of future versions of TIGER products.

For instance, information on addresses may appear in one section, but cross-references to other related sections also are included. In order to make the document easier to use as a reference, the text contains some repetition from section to section.  I-10 1997 TIGER/Line Files   Chapter 1 Chapter 1 describes the basic concepts about the Census TIGER  data base and the TIGER/Line products. It discusses the topology in the Census TIGER data base, the terminology used to describe the geographic data, and the record types that make up the TIGER/Line  files. Chapter 1 also describes the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Spatial Data Transfer Standard (SDTS) nomenclature for geographic objects.  Chapter 2 Chapter 2 discusses the principle identification numbers forming the basis for record linkage discussed throughout the documentation.  Chapter 3 Chapter 3 discusses the attributes for the line, polygon, and landmark geographic objects.  Chapter 4 Chapter 4 defines the types of geographic entities and entity codes that appear in the TIGER/Line files. It also identifies the fundamental relationships among the different types of geographic entities.  Chapter 5 Chapter 5 summarizes the data quality aspects of the information in the Census TIGER data base using the SDTS quality modules.  Chapter 6 Chapter 6 lists the contents of the TIGER/Line file record types and provides a detailed description of the data fields in each. Use Chapter 6 in conjunction with Chapters 3 and 4 to locate the positions of specific data fields in the TIGER/Line files.

I-12 1997 TIGER/Line Files   Chapter 1: Overview and Geographic Concepts Overview What Is TIGER? The Bureau's Census TIGER System automates the mapping geographic activities required to support the decennial census survey programs of the Census Bureau starting with the 1990 census. The Census TIGER System provides support for the and related and sample decennial following:   Creation and maintenance of a digital geographic data base that includes complete coverage of the United States, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands of the United States, and the Pacific Island Territories  Production of maps from the Census TIGER data base for all Census Bureau enumeration and publication programs  Ability to assign individual addresses to geographic entities and census blocks based on polygons formed by features such as roads and streams The design of the Census TIGER data base adapts the theories of topology, graph theory, and associated fields of mathematics to provide a disciplined, mathematical description for the geographic structure of the United States and its territories. The topological structure of the Census TIGER data base defines the location and relationship of streets, rivers, railroads, and other features to each other and to the numerous geographic entities for which the Census Bureau tabulates data from its censuses and sample surveys. It is designed to ensure that there is no duplication of features or areas. The building of the Census TIGER data base involved a variety of encoding techniques such as automated map scanning, manual map digitizing, standard data keying, and sophisticated computer file matching. The goal was to provide automated access to, and retrieval of, relevant geographic information about the United States and its territories.  TIGER Data Base Extracts In order for others to use the information in the Census TIGER data base in a geographic information system (GIS) or for other geographic  Overview and Geographic Concepts 1- 1   applications, the Census Bureau releases periodic extracts of the data base, including the TIGER/Line files, to the public. Various versions of the TIGER/Line files have been released; previous versions include the 1990 Census TIGER/Line files, and the 1992, 1994, and 1995 TIGER/Line files. The 1992 TIGER/Line files were produced to satisfy a requirement of the US Department of Education and incorporated all of the updates and revisions since the production of the 1990 TIGER/Line files. The 1994 TIGER/Line files were produced to support the programs of the US Department of Transportation, Bureau of Transportation Statistics. The 1995 TIGER/Line files were originally produced to support Phase I of the Census 2000 Redistricting Data Program.  Relationship of TIGER/Line    to 1990 Census Statistical Data  What makes the TIGER extract products particularly valuable in the GIS environment and to the data user community is the direct linkage between the 1990 decennial census data products and the Census TIGER data base extracts. The digital description in the TIGER data base of the Nation's legal and statistical entities includes Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) codes and Census Bureau codes so entities can be easily matched with the 1990 census data. Please refer to the Census Bureau Publication, 1990 Census of Population and Housing Tabulation and Publication Program, for a description of the Public Law (PL) 94-171 data files, Summary Tape Files (STFs), and other sources of data from the 1990 census.  1997 TIGER/Line Files The 1997 TIGER/Line files include files for all counties and statistically equivalent entities in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. The 1994 TIGER/Line files are provided for American Samoa because no updates have been received since 1994. The 1997 TIGER/Line files consist of line segments that represent physical features, and legal and statistical boundaries. The files consist of 17 separate record types, including the basic data record, the shape coordinate points (feature shape records), and geographic area codes that can be used with appropriate software to prepare maps.  1-2 1997 TIGER/Line Files   Related Files Summary Tape Files (STFs) provide 1990 statistical data for a wide range of subject headings and geographic entities compatible with the TIGER/ Line files. These files are available on tape and CD-ROM. PL 94-171 Program data files provide selected population data for small area geography (state, county, county subdivision, place, census tract/ block numbering area, block group, and block) and are compatible with the TIGER/Line files. These files are available on tape and CD-ROM. TIGER/SDTS is a data file following the FIPS spatial data transfer standard (SDTS). These files will provide data equivalent to the TIGER/ Line files with additional relational data linkages and data content more similar to the Census TIGER data base. The present product is an early prototype, and any subsequent version is likely to be substantially modified. The TIGER/Line 103rd Congressional District File contains just the features that form the boundaries of the districts of the 103rd Congress. The file follows the format of Record Types 1 and 2 of the 1992 TIGER/ Line files. This is a national data set, by state, on one CD-ROM. TIGER/Line 1990 County Files provide the coordinates for the boundaries of all counties and statistically equivalent entities. This is a national data set, by state, on one CD-ROM. The files follow the format of Record Types 1 and 2 of the 1992 TIGER/Line files. The boundaries for the states and statistically equivalent areas are for the legal limits. As such, coastal states show a boundary that is three miles offshore and do not contain additional records that depict the shoreline. The same holds true for interior water; a boundary in the Chesapeake Bay will be shown, but the shore-line will not. TIGER/Line1990 Census Tract/Block Numbering Area Files provide the coordinates and associated feature attributes for the boundaries of all census tract/block numbering areas (CT/BNAs). This is a national data set, by state, on one CD-ROM. The files follow the format of Record Types 1 and 2 of the 1992 TIGER/Line files.  Overview and Geographic Concepts 1- 3   North American Statistical Areas Boundary Files (Prototype), were produced by a joint research initiative between the Geography Divisions of Statistics Canada and the United States Bureau of the Census. The goal of the files is to provide data users with a convenient, unified, geographical framework that will help facilitate cross-border spatial studies. The files are in TIGER/Line format and contain geographic coordinates, various attribute information, and most importantly, geographic identification codes that can be used as links to census data from Canada and the United States. TIGER/Line American Indian/Alaska Native Areas File provides the coordinates for the boundaries of all American Indian and Alaska Native areas (AIANAs) shown in the 1990 census. This file follows the format of Record Types 1 and 2 of the 1992 TIGER/Line files and covers the Nation. TIGER/Line 1990 County Subdivision Files provide the coordinates for the boundaries of all county subdivisions (such as minor civil divisions, census county divisions, and unorganized territory). This is a national data set, by state, on one CD-ROM. The files follow the format of Record Types 1 and 2 of the 1992 TIGER/Line files. TIGER/Line 1990 Place Files provide the aries of all incorporated places (including census designated places (CDPs). This is a one CD-ROM. The files follow the format the 1992 TIGER/Line files. coordinates for the boundconsolidated cities) and national data set, by state, on of Record Types 1 and 2 of  County-Based Files The geographic coverage for a TIGER/Line file is a county or statistically equivalent entity. See Appendix A for a list of state and county codes and Chapter 4 for a description of county equivalent entities. The county files have a coverage area based on the latest legal boundaries obtained in response to the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS). Even though the Census TIGER data base represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, the county-based TIGER/Line files are designed to  1-4 1997 TIGER/Line Files   stand alone as an independent data set. The files can be combined to cover the whole Nation and its territories (see the Single-Side Flags and County Boundaries section in Chapter 3).  The Data Content of the TIGER/Line Files The TIGER/Line files contain data describing three major types of features:  Line features 1) Roads 2) Railroads 3) Hydrography 4) Miscellaneous transportation features and selected power lines and pipe lines 5) Boundaries   Landmark features 1) Point landmarks such as schools and churches 2) Area landmarks such as parks and cemeteries 3) Key geographic locations (KGLs) such as apartment buildings and factories   Polygon features 1) Geographic entity codes for areas used to tabulate the 1990 census statistical data and current geographic areas 2) Locations of area landmarks 3) Locations of KGLs  The line feature and polygon information form the majority of data in the TIGER/Line files. Some of the data describing the lines include coordinates, feature identifiers (names), feature classification codes, address ranges, and geographic entity codes. Chapter 3 details these data items; Chapter 4 defines the geographic entities and codes. The TIGER/Line files contain point and area labels that describe landmark features. These features provide locational references for field staff and map users. Area landmarks consist of a feature name or label and feature type assigned to a polygon or group of polygons. Landmarks may overlap or  Overview and Geographic Concepts 1- 5   refer to the same set of polygons. See Chapter 3 for more information on landmark data.  Topology and Spatial Objects in the TIGER/Line Files Spatial Objects in the TIGER/Line Files The Census TIGER data base uses a collection of spatial objects, points, lines, and polygons, to model or describe real-world geography. The Census Bureau uses these spatial objects to represent features such as streets, and assigns attributes to these features to identify and describe specific features such as the 500 block of Market Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The TIGER/Line files contain information about the spatial objects distributed over a series of record types. Users of the TIGER/Line files may need to link information from several record types to find all the attributes of interest that belong to one spatial object. The final section of this chapter includes a description of the record types.  Topology Topology explains how points, lines, and areas relate to each other and is used as the foundation for organizing spatial objects in the Census TIGER data base. The Census TIGER data base uses points, lines, and areas to provide a disciplined, mathematical description of the features of the earth's surface. Spatial objects in the Census TIGER data base are interrelated. A sequence of points define line segments, and line segments connect to define polygons. Topology provides a basic language for describing geographic features. The Census TIGER data base relates information to points or 0-cells, lines or 1-cells, and polygons or 2-cells. The number preceding the cell identifies the dimensionality of the object; for instance, a line segment has a single dimension, length. Each of these objects builds on the others to form higher-level objects. The 0-cells form the end points of 1-cells. The 1-cells connect at 0-cells and form closed figures that partition space into polygons or 2-cells.  1-6 1997 TIGER/Line Files   Terminology The terms point, line segment, and polygon are familiar, but general terms that may have different meanings to data users working with a variety of different applications and data sets. The TIGER/Line file documentation uses the terminology from the Spatial Data Transfer Standard (SDTS). Since the first release of the TIGER/Line files, the US Geological Survey (USGS) has coordinated the development and release of the SDTS, now a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS). The SDTS specifies a series of terms and definitions for spatial objects. Why use the SDTS terminology? Even though the TIGER/Line  files do not follow the SDTS format, the TIGER/Line documentation will use these terms and definitions in order to promote a common language for describing geographic data and to facilitate the transition to the SDTS. The spatial objects in TIGER/Line belong to the ""Geometry and  Topology"" (GT) class of objects in SDTS. The definitions are from FIPS Publication 173, Spatial Data Transfer Standard (SDTS) (August 28, 1992) Section 2-2, ""Classification and Intended Use of Objects,"" pp. 11-20. Node ""A zero-dimensional object that is a topological junction of two or more links or chains, or an end point of a link or chain,"" is a node . Entity Point ""A point used for identifying the location of point features (or areal features collapsed to a point), such as towers, buoys, buildings, places, etc."" Complete Chain ""A chain [a sequence of non-intersecting line segments] that explicitly references left and right polygons and start and end nodes."" The shape points combine with the nodes to form the segments that make a complete chain .  Overview and Geographic Concepts 1- 7   Network Chains ""A chain that explicitly references start and end nodes and not left and right polygons."" GT-Polygon ""An area that is an atomic two-dimensional component of a two-dimensional manifold, [which is defined as] one and only one planar graph and its two-dimensional objects."" GT-polygons are elementary polygons that are mutually exclusive and completely exhaust the surface.  Spatial Objects The spatial objects in the TIGER/Line files embody both geometry (coordinate location and shape) and topology (the relationship between points, line objects, and polygons) and therefore belong to the geometry and topology (GT) class of objects in the SDTS. In the SDTS, nodes represent point objects (0-cells) that identify the start and end position of lines or 1-dimensional objects (1-cells) called chains. The chains in the TIGER/ Line  files are complete chains because they form polygon boundaries and intersect other chains only at nodes. Topological chains that do not contain polygon information are network chains. Data users may choose not to use the polygon or geographic entity codes and consider the TIGER/ Line files a source of network chain data. Figure 1-1 illustrates the relationship between nodes and complete chains. The figure shows two complete chains forming a central road; a start and end node define each complete chain. Complete chains that meet at an intersection share the same node. As the figure suggests, complete chains may consist of one or more line segments that describe the shape and position of the complete chain. Shape points define the line segments and are not part of the topology of the TIGER/Line files. Shape points and the resulting line segments are attributes of the complete chains. When complete chains link node to node and form a closed figure (a 2-cell), a GT-polygon results. The GT-polygon containing Friendship Park in Figure 1-1 is bounded by five complete chains that share five nodes. GT-polygons are elementary units; they are not subdivided into smaller polygons. The polygons completely encompass the area  1-8 1997 TIGER/Line Files   Figure 1-1 Basic TIGER/Line File Topology The illustration below shows a generalized block that consists of three GT-polygons (GT stands for geometry and topology). The block contains a point landmark (Parkside School) inside GT-polygon 2 and an area landmark (Friendship Park) that is coextensive with GT-polygon 3.  Entity Point/Point Landmark location (entity points are independent of the GT-polygon complete chain topology)  Start Node  School Ave There are two shape points on the complete chain that extends from the start node to the end node.  Parkside School  GT-POLYGON 2  GT-POLYGON 1  End Node  Friendship Park This complete chain does not form a polygon boundary.  GT-POLYGON 3  Park Ave  Actual Street Curb Location Node--A zero-dimensional object that incorporates topology and geometry. Each marks the intersection or end point of a complete chain.  Shape Point-- A zero-dimensional object that defines the curvature of a complete chain, but is not required to describe the topology of the complete chain (unlike nodes at intersections or end points). Point Landmark--An entity point that identifies the location of a point landmark. Polygon Interior Points--A point associated with, and inside of, a polygon. Complete Chain--A one-dimensional object having topological and geometric characteristics.  Overview and Geographic Concepts 1-9   they represent and there is no gap or overlap between adjacent polygons. The geographic entities and area landmarks in the TIGER/Line files are associated with one, or a set of GT-polygons. The TIGER/Line files contain point landmark data that are not included in the Census TIGER data base topology. Point landmarks are entity points that mark the location of points of interest and are not connected to complete chains or GT-polygons. The following table summarizes the terms for spatial objects in the TIGER/Line files: Point (0-cell) Topology Non-topology Attribute Node Entity Point Shape Point Line (1-cell) Complete Chain or Network Chain Polygon (2-cell) GT-polygon  Features The Census TIGER data base uses the term feature to informally describe spatial objects more complex than nodes, complete chains, or GT-polygons. For instance, Main Street is a feature that may consist of a series of complete chains with the same name. The Census TIGER data base contains complete chains, but does not contain features or link complete chains to features.  Left- and Right-Side Data Fields If one is standing on a complete chain at the start node facing the end node, data listed in the fields carrying a right qualifier would be found to the right of the complete chain. Notice the position of the start and end nodes for the road in the central section of Figure 1-1; the rightside of the complete chain corresponds to GT-polygon 1 and the leftside corresponds to GT-polygon 2. From the information contained in this basic record, data users can collect the complete chains necessary to construct intersecting polygons and features.  1-10 1997 TIGER/Line Files   Single-Layer Topology All spatial objects in the TIGER/Line files exist in a single data layer that includes roads, hydrography, railroads, boundary lines, and miscellaneous features; they are topologically linked. For instance, nodes mark the intersections of roads and rivers. Subsurface features such as tunnels or above surface features such as bridges also create nodes when they cross surface features even though there is no direct realworld connection.  Introduction to the TIGER/Line    File Structure  The 1997 TIGER/Line files are extracts of selected information from the Census TIGER data base, organized as topologically consistent networks. The records in these TIGER/Line files represent features traditionally found on a paper map. Each complete chain is classified by codes that describe the type of feature it represents. The 1997 TIGER/Line files consist of 17 record types that collectively contain geographic information (attributes) such as address ranges and ZIP Codes and their Add-On codes for street complete chains, names, feature classification codes, codes for legal and statistical entities, latitude/longitude coordinates of linear and point features, landmark features, area landmarks, key geographic features, and area and polygon boundaries. A separate file exists for each of the 17 record types for each county or county equivalent. The file for each county (or equivalent) is identified by the state and county FIPS code after the ""tgr"" in the file name (for example, tgr42107.rt1). The suffixes used for the record type files have been changed to make it easier to identify each record type file (when working with uncompressed versions of the county files). The TIGER/Line data dictionary in Chapter 6 contains a complete list of all the fields in the 17 record types. Separate chapters cross-list the fields by feature attribute and geographic entity type. The next section provides a summary of 1997 TIGER/Line file record types.  Overview and Geographic Concepts 1- 11   1997 TIGER/Line File Record Types Record Type 1 -- Complete Chain Basic Data Record Record Type 1 provides a single record for each unique complete chain in the TIGER/Line files. The basic data record contains the end nodes for the complete chain. This record also contains address ranges and ZIP Codes (for most areas of the country where a street name/house numbering system existed at the time of data extraction from the Census TIGER data base) and the current census geographic entity codes for each side of the complete chain. Additional feature identifier, address range, and ZIP Code data related to Record Type 1 are found on Record Types 4, 5, 6, and Z. Additional current and 1990 geographic entity codes related to Record Type 1 are found on Record Type 3. See the Introduction chapter for information about changes and anomalies in this version of the TIGER/Line files.  Record Type 2 -- Complete Chain Shape Coordinates Record Type 2 provides an additional series of latitude and longitude coordinate values describing the shape of each complete chain in Record Type 1 that is not a straight line segment. That is, not all complete chains in Record Type 1 have shape points and therefore not all have an associated Record Type 2. Where a complete chain in Record Type 1 is not a straight line, Record Type 2 may have a many-to-one relationship with Record Type 1.  Record Type 3 -- Complete Chain Geographic Entity Codes Record Type 3 includes the 1990 voting district (VTD) codes provided to the Census Bureau for the 1990 Census Redistricting Data Program. It also includes the current Census Bureau geographic area codes for the American Indian/TJSA/TDSA/ANVSA areas, and the Alaska Native Regional Corporations. It also includes 1990 geographic codes for a variety of geographic area types. In the 1994 and later TIGER/Line files, all references to the 1980 geographic area codes have been eliminated. In addition, many fields have been replaced with the geographic area codes that were used to tabulate the 1990 census. These codes were previously in Record Type 1. Record Type 3 has a one-to-one relationship with Record Type 1. To identify 1-12 1997 TIGER/Line Files   the 1990 census state and county codes for a complete chain, one must use Record Type 3.  Record Type 4 -- Index to Alternate Feature Identifiers Record Type 4 provides an index to alternate feature names associated with the complete chain (Record Type 1). A Record Type 4 will not exist for a Record Type 1 that has only one name. A complete chain can have more than one alternate name. Record Type 4 has a many-toone relationship with Record Type 1 and a many-to-one relationship with Record Type 5.  Record Type 5 -- Complete Chain Feature Identifiers Record Type 5 contains a list of all unique feature names for complete chains in the TIGER/Line files. Each name (or feature identifier) has an identification code number (FEAT). Record Type 5 has a oneto-many relationship with Record Type 4 and a one-to-many relationship with Record Type 9.  Record Type 6 -- Additional Address Range and ZIP Code Data Record Type 6 provides additional address range information for a street complete chain when the information cannot be presented as a single address range (for example, the house/building numbers are not uniformly arranged to form an address range). Record Type 6 appears only for those counties that have address ranges and ZIP Code information in the Census TIGER data base. There is no assurance that the address ranges provided on Record Type 6 will cover fewer addresses than the address ranges appearing on Record Type 1. Data users must use Record Type 6 to obtain the entire picture of the potential address ranges along a complete chain. The address ranges used for geocoding along corporate corridors and corporate offset limits appear only in Record Type 6. Record Type 6 has a many-to-one relationship with Record Type 1 and a one-toone relationship with Record Type Z. See the Introduction chapter for information about changes in the 1997 TIGER/Line files.  Record Type 7 -- Landmark Features Record Type 7 contains the area and point landmarks from the Census TIGER data base. If Record Type 7 represents an area landmark rather  Overview and Geographic Concepts 1- 13   than a point landmark, then a one-to-one relationship exists with Record Type 8. If a county file has no landmarks, empty files for Record Types 7 or 8 will exist for that county. Record Type 7 now excludes all key geographic locations (KGLs) that contain an actual or imputed address and have a ZIP+4 Add-On code. These will now appear in Record Type 9.  Record Type 8 -- Polygons Linked to Area Landmarks Record Type 8 links the polygon identification codes with the area landmark identification codes. If a county file does not have any area landmarks in Record Type 7, there will be no Type 8 records. Record Type 8 has a many-to-many relationship with Record Type P.  Record Type 9 -- Key Geographic Location Features Record Type 9 consists only of KGLs in the Census TIGER  data base that have an actual or imputed address and a ZIP+4  Add-On code. This record type lists the names and structure numbers of special geocoding addresses such as named apartment buildings, shopping centers, and airports. If the structure number of the special geocoding address is a street address, then the FEAT field links Record Type 9 to Record Type 5 where the street name associated with the address is listed. The KGLs contained in this record type are not included in Record Types 7 or 8, and have no LAND (landmark identification number). Record Type 9 has a many-to-one relationship with Record Type P.  Record Type A -- Polygon Geographic Entity Codes Record Type A contains a record for each polygon represented by Record Type P in the TIGER/Line files. The Census Bureau provides the basic 1990 census geographic entity codes--state, county, county subdivision, place, American Indian/Alaska Native Areas, census tract/BNA, block-- on this record type to assist data users who are interested only in polygon information. Record Type A also includes the Census Transportation Planning Package Area code, school district codes, and urban/rural classification information, as well as fields for the 106th and 108th Congressional Districts (which are blank for this release).  1-14 1997 TIGER/Line Files   Record Type C -- Geographic Entity Names Record Type C provides information previously supplied in the TIGER/Geographic NameTM files. A unique list of all geographic codes, their associated name, and some entity attributes is supplied for data users in a flat (nonhierarchical) file. It contains a FIPS Year field that may have three values: 90 for geographic names and codes valid for the 1990 census, 9n (where 9n is the year of extraction from the Census TIGER data base) for geographic names and codes valid for the current year, or blank when the geographic names and codes are the same as for 1990 and 199n. Multiple records for the same geographic entity show its change or correction over time. Record Type C is linked to other record types (1, 3, A, S) through geographic area codes.  Record Type H -- TIGER/Line ID History Record Type H provides the history of each TIGER/Line ID when complete chains (Record Type 1) are split or merged, but the source of the change will be blank for this version. Record Type H shows the TLIDs of the complete chains in existence after the split or prior to the merge.  Record Type I -- Link Between Complete Chains and Polygons Record Type I links Record Type 1, the complete chain basic data, to Record Type P, the polygon internal point. The Record Type I to Record Type 1 link (TLID) may be used to link complete chain attributes and other data record types (2, 3, 4, 6, H, and Z) to each other. The Record I to Record Type P link (CENID and POLYID) may be used to link polygon attributes and other data record types (8, 9, A, and S) to each other. Record Type I has a one-to-one relationship with Record Type 1, but a many-toone relationship with Record Type P. When Record Type I is linked to a single-sided Record Type 1 (county boundary), it will provide only the left- or the right-polygon identifier.  Record Type P -- Polygon Internal Point There is a Record Type P for every polygon in the TIGER/Line files. Record Type P has a one-to-many relationship with Record Type I  Overview and Geographic Concepts 1- 15   and identifies the internal point coordinates for each polygon. See the Internal Points section in Chapter 3. The TIGER/Line files include all complete chains and polygons in the Census TIGER data base. The topology of the Census TIGER data base ensures that a one-to-one relationship exists between the polygons constructed from Record Types 1 and 2 and Record Type P.  Record Type R -- TIGER/Line ID Record Number Range Record Type R contains the range of unique complete chain record numbers (TLIDs) assigned to a census file in a nationwide scheme. Record Type R has the lowest (minimum allowable), and the highest (maximum allowable) record numbers for the range. Numbers are assigned to complete chains beginning at the lowest value. The current number is the highest record number for the census file used. Each TIGER/Line file consists of an entire county or statistical equivalent. In the Census TIGER data base, the county or statistical equivalent may be split into many partitions. The Census Bureau assigns permanent record numbers to each of these partitions. These record numbers are found in Record Type R. Record Type R is not directly linked to any other record type.  Record Type S -- Polygon Additional Geographic Entity Codes Record Type S contains a record for each polygon represented by Record Type P in the TIGER/Line files. Record Type S contains geographic area codes that identify polygons. Most of the geographic area codes reflect current geography as of the time of extraction from the Census TIGER data base. Except for Hawaii, Record Type S contains no CDP information since CDPs are considered part of the 1990 census geography, not current geography.  Record Type Z -- ZIP+4 Codes Record Type Z provides Postal +4 Add-On codes that make ZIP+4 codes out of the ZIP Codes on Type 1 and Type 6 records. Record Type Z has a one-to-one relationship with Record Type 1 and a one-  1-16 1997 TIGER/Line Files   to-one relationship with Record Type 6. See the Introduction chapter for information on missing ZIP+4 records.  The Relationship Between Spatial Objects and TIGER/Line Record Types    The TIGER/Line files do not have specific record types for each spatial object. Nodes, for example, do not have a separate record type; node coordinates appear with other data in Record Type 1. Defining a complete chain requires information from Record Types 1, 2, and I. Record Types 1 and 2 alone describe the set of network chains. GT-polygons require the combined information of Record Types 1, 2, I, and P. See Chapter 3 for a discussion on how to link data using different types of spatial objects.  Linkages Between Record Types All the record types except Record Type R contain fields (such as TLID, FEAT, CENID, POLYID, LAND, or a geographic area code) that are used to link together data from the record types. Chapter 2 discusses the TLID, CENID, POLYID, and LAND identification codes in detail. Figure 1-2 shows the record linkage keys. When different record types have a common key with the same data, a linkage can be made between the records. Some of the links are direct, while others are indirect and require a connection through an intermediate record type. An entire TIGER/Line file can be navigated using the record linkage keys. Linkages may be made to data external to a TIGER/Line file. Record Types 1, 3, A, and S contain geographic area code keys--the current or 1990 census geographic entity codes--that may be linked to the Census Bureau's statistical data (the PL 94-171 data and the several Summary Tape Files or STFs). For the PL 94-171 data and STFs based on 1990 census data, one must use Record Type 3 or Record Type A. With geographic information systems for processing and display, data users can use the geographic area codes to link data tabulations with the geographic data.

All record types have a 4-character field for the version code. For releases after TIGER/Line 1995, including this release, the version code is assigned as ""MMYY"" which represents the month and year that the file was created. The month and year are currently extracted from the system date as each county file is created. This means that county files created for the same program are likely to have different version codes. This will make it easier for users to determine the latest version of the data if they have several versions of the TIGER/Line files for a county. The version codes for earlier releases of the TIGER/Line files are as follows: 0000 -- TIGER/Line Precensus File, 1990 0002 -- TIGER/Line Initial Voting District Codes File, 1990 0003 -- TIGER/Line Census File, 1990 0005 -- TIGER/Line File, 1992 0021 -- TIGER/Line File, 1994 0024 -- TIGER/Line File, 1995  TIGER/Line  Identification Number (TLID) The TIGER/Line files use a permanent 10-digit TIGER/Line record identification number (TLID) to uniquely identify a complete chain for the Nation.  TLID Codes The 10-digit TLID will not exceed the value 231  1 (2,147,483,647) and will represent the same complete chain in all versions of this file, beginning with the TIGER/Line Precensus Files, 1990. The minimum value is 100,001. Topological changes to the complete chain will cause the TLIDs to change. For instance, when updates split an existing complete chain, each of the new parts receives a new TLID; the old TLID is not reused.  Version Code and Identification Numbers 2-1   As distributed, TIGER/Line files are grouped by county (or equivalent). A complete chain representing a segment of the boundary between two neighboring counties will have different TLID codes even though the complete chain represents the exact same feature on the ground. See the section, User-Defined Changes to the TIGER/Line Files , in this chapter. Record Type R contains the range of unique complete chain record numbers assigned to a census file in a nationwide scheme. Record Type R has the lowest (minimum) and the highest (maximum) record numbers for the range. Permanent record numbers are assigned within each partition of the Census TIGER data base. Numbers are assigned to complete chains beginning at the minimum value and increasing the current value by one until it reaches the maximum value. Record Type H, which first appeared in the 1994 version, shows the history of a particular TLID, whether combined or split, and its predecessors or successors.  TLID Record Locations The TLID field appears in columns 6 through 15 of the following record types:     Record Record Record Record Type Type Type Type 1 2 3 4  Record Type 6  Record Type I  Record Type Z  The TLID field appears in columns 11 through 20 in Record Type H.  TLID Record Linkages The TLID field provides a key for linking records containing primary attributes describing the complete chain or the geographic entity codes associated with the left and the right sides of the complete chain. Record Type I contains the key fields required to link the TLID and the GT-polygon identification fields, CENID and POLYID. See Figure 1-2 in Chapter 1.  2-2 1997 TIGER/Line Files   TLID Sort Sequence Each record type is a separate file. The records in each record type do not have an overall sort sequence. Data users may wish to sort the file by TLID in order to facilitate record linkages.  User-Defined Changes to the TIGER/Line Files TLID as a Standard Identification Number Users should store the record number and the version code associated with each complete chain in their local systems to ensure their ability to match records with earlier or later versions of the TIGER/Line files. The record and version numbers of each complete chain provide an important link to the corresponding complete chain in the Census TIGER data base. This key will allow users to transfer new information from later Census Bureau TIGER/Line releases into their data base, and to provide the Census Bureau with readily usable updates, should they wish to do so.  Feature Changes Users should assign a new record number (TLID) and a version number with a value greater than 5000 to each new complete chain they create in order to avoid duplicating a Census Bureau-assigned record number that may appear elsewhere in the national file. Users should create a new record for each new complete chain, including those formed when a new intersection splits an existing complete chain. If a complete chain has been assigned different feature identifiers, attributes, and/or coordinate positions without being merged with or split from another complete chain, it is a modified complete chain and does not need a new TLID. Users may wish to mark these changes; the Census Bureau will use this information to identify changes more quickly and accurately. Users should assign a version code equal to 4999 for all deleted complete chain and landmark records. This version code will allow the Census Bureau to positively identify all user deletions. Users may assign or reassign polygon and landmark identification numbers in any manner that uniquely identifies each within a file.  Version Code and Identification Numbers 2-3   TIGER/Line  Polygon Identification Numbers (CENID, POLYID) The Census Bureau uses two fields, the census file identification code (CENID) and the polygon identification code (POLYID), to uniquely identify GT-polygons. The CENID is a Census Bureau alphanumeric identifier used to uniquely number the GT-polygons within its TIGER partitions. CENIDs are a recode of the FIPS state and county codes for the partitions (files) that form the national Census TIGER data base. Since the partitions may include only a portion of a county, the TIGER/Line files may contain multiple CENIDs. The polygon identification number (POLYID) is a temporary number assigned to every polygon in the Census TIGER data base. Although this number is part of the data base design, it is a dynamic number and can change between different versions of the TIGER/Line files. The Census TIGER data base does not contain permanent identifiers for GT-polygons as it does for complete chains. POLYID is unique only within CENID; in cases where a TIGER/Line file contains more than one CENID, the POLYID may not be unique within that file. Within each CENID, the value for the POLYID starts with ""1"" and increments sequentially until all polygons are numbered.  CENID and POLYID Codes In the 1992 and 1994 versions of the TIGER/Line files, the CENID is a 5-digit numeric code. In the 1995 TIGER/Line files and the 1997 TIGER/Line files, the CENID is a 5-character alpha-numeric code to allow for a wider range of codes without increasing field length. Record Type R contains a list of all valid CENIDs used in each county TIGER/Line file. The POLYID code is an integer identification number, without leading zeros, applied to each GT-polygon. The POLYID with a value of 1 refers to the universal polygon, the polygon that refers to all space outside a county coverage area and is excluded from Record Types A, I, P, and S.  2-4 1997 TIGER/Line Files   The range of POLYID numbers in a county file may contain gaps or skipped numbers resulting from the use of one partition (CENID) for more than one TIGER/Line county file. POLYID numbers also may duplicate in a single TIGER/Line  file as they are unique only within CENID. A single TIGER/Line file may contain CENID information from many other census files. Either the CENIDL and POLYIDL, or CENIDR and POLYIDR fields in Record Type I will have a blank value where the complete chain is a county boundary.  CENID and POLYID Record Locations The CENID and POLYID fields appear in the following record types:  Record Type 8 -- Records exist only for area landmark GT-polygons  Record Type 9 -- Records exist for all KGLs  Record Type A -- Records exist for all GT-polygons  Record Type I -- Contains left- and right-side CENIDs and POLYIDs associated with each complete chain  Record Type P -- Records exist for all GT-polygons  Record Type R -- Contains only CENID; Record Type R lists the minimum and maximum possible TLIDs, and the highest TLID from each census file (CENID) used to generate the current version of the TIGER/Line files.  Record Type S -- Records exist for all GT-polygons  CENID and POLYID Record Linkages The TIGER/Line files use both the CENID and POLYID fields to link all of the polygon record types together (Record Types A, P, and S), to link the GT-polygons to the associated complete chains, and to link area landmarks to GT-polygons (see Figure 1-2, in Chapter 1). The CENID and POLYID fields link the geographic area codes in Record Types A and S to Record Type P which contains the coordinates for an internal point in the GT-polygon. The TIGER/Line files include a Type A and a Type S record for each Type P record.  Version Code and Identification Numbers 2-5   Record Type I provides a link between the GT-polygon records and the record types containing complete chain attributes (Record Types 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6). Each Type I record identifies a complete chain by TLID with a left- and right-side GT-polygon. Here CENIDL and POLYIDL contain the CENID and POLYID codes for the GT-polygon on the left side of the line. Likewise, CENIDR and POLYIDR contain the CENID and POLYID codes for the GT-polygon on the right side of the line. There is a Type I record for each Type 1 record. All CENID and POLYID codes appear in Record Type I. To find all of the complete chains that form the boundary of a specific GT-polygon, search Record Type I for a match with either the left or the right CENID and POLYID. Where the left and the right CENID and POLYID codes are the same, the complete chain is internal to the GTpolygon (e.g., a dead-end street). Record Type 8 provides a link between the GT-polygons and the landmark feature records. See the section, TIGER/Line  Landmark Identification Numbers, in this chapter.  CENID and POLYID Sort Sequence The POLYID codes appear in numeric sequence by alphanumeric CENID in Record Types 9, A, P, and S. There is no systematic CENID or POLYID sequence in Record Type I.  TIGER/Line  Landmark Identification Numbers (LAND) The landmark feature identification number (LAND ) is a 10-digit number that uniquely identifies both point and area landmarks within each county file. LAND is not a permanent number; the Census Bureau assigns LANDs each time a new version of the TIGER/Line files is produced. Within each county, LANDs are assigned beginning with ""1"" and are incremented sequentially until all features are numbered. In rare situations, Record Type 7 may list the same LAND number more than once if the landmark has more than one feature name.  2-6 1997 TIGER/Line Files   Each name appears as a separate data record in Record Type 7. These data records describe the same landmark and have the same LAND. Overlapping landmarks (e.g., a pond located in a park) may cause more than one name to be assigned to a GT-polygon. However, overlapping landmarks are separate features with different LANDs.  LAND Codes The LAND is an integer number that does not contain leading zeros. It is assigned during the extraction of the data and is not a permanent number. There may be gaps in the sequence of the LANDs in Record Type 7 because of the way this information is extracted.  LAND Record Locations The LAND field appears in the following record types:  Record Type 7 -- Landmark attributes  Record Type 8 -- Linkage record containing the LAND and the CENID and POLYID fields  LAND Record Linkages Record Type 8 links each area landmark's LAND with a CENID and POLYID. Each area landmark will have one or more Type 8 records that together identify all of the GT-polygons that make up the landmark.  LAND Sort Sequence Record Type 7 and 8 contain records sorted in ascending order by LAND. In Record Type 8, each LAND is repeated for each GT-polygon covered by the area landmark.  Version Code and Identification Numbers 2-7    Chapter 3: Attributes of Geographic Objects Line Features Line features consist of one or more complete chains that share common attributes such as feature identifiers, address ranges, and census feature class descriptions.  Feature Identifiers The feature identification fields contain either a general type label or a specific proper name assigned to a complete chain that identifies the feature. Each complete chain that is a part of a named feature, such as US Highway 1, has the same feature identifier. The TIGER/Line files use several related data fields to provide a structured description of the feature identifier:     Feature Feature Feature Feature Direction Prefix Name (e.g., US Type (Roosevelt Direction Suffix (e.g., N Adams Ave) Highway 1 , Jefferson St) Blvd, Mangosteen River ) (e.g., Providence St NE )  Most named street/highway features have a feature type. Numerous exceptions exist; for example, Broadway consists of a feature name with no type specified. Do not confuse feature types that form proper names with the census feature classification scheme. In the Census TIGER data base, feature names are assigned to line features independently of the census feature class codes (CFCCs) of the line features. For example, major airports usually have an express highway leading to the terminal area. This highway does not have an interstate highway name such as I-95, but may have the CFCC of an interstate highway (A11) because it has the same characteristics as an interstate highway (limited access with separated, multiple lanes). The feature identifiers of line features that are roads may include either a direction prefix or suffix. Some may have both a direction prefix and suffix.  A   The feature name fields for line features that are roads may contain both a name and a feature type. For all hydrography and non-road features, the feature type will follow the feature name in the feature name field. In some instances, the feature type is commonly considered part of the name and is combined with the feature name in the TIGER/Line files to avoid confusion; for example, US Hwy 1. The Census TIGER System identifies US Hwy as a feature type used as a prefix to the name and 1 as the feature name. The feature types, such as US Highway, State Highway, and Interstate that normally precede the name appear in the name field. Generic feature identifiers have a name listed in the names field, but do not have a feature type or direction. Some examples of generic names include ramp, power line, and reservoir. Generic feature identifiers are selectively added to features that do not have proper names. In most cases, complete chains without proper names have no feature identifier. The TIGER/Line files do not support a data level above the complete chain that allows the construction of higher level objects (features). Complete chains with the same name may represent separate features; for example, a county may contain several Main Streets located in different geographic entities (e.g., towns or cities) scattered throughout the county. The ability to group chains together to include the entire length of a street feature, such as US Route 66, depends on the uniqueness of the identifiers and the consistency of the feature identifiers along the length of the feature. The Census Bureau makes no guarantee that the complete chains have uniform names or contain all of the known feature identifiers. The Census Bureau has taken steps to improve the consistency of feature identifiers and to add feature identifiers to fill in gaps along street features. The Census Bureau also has eliminated some alternate spellings in favor of the spelling confirmed by the ZIP+4 file of the US Postal Service. The census feature class codes (CFCCs) may vary for chains with the same feature identifier. For example, the most frequent CFCC for a state highway is A21, but the complete chains marking the location of State Highway 32 may have a CFCC of A01, A21, or A31 (see the Census Feature Class Codes section in this chapter).  3-2 1997 TIGER/Line Files   The TIGER/Line file structure allows up to 4,996 feature identifiers for a complete chain. The primary feature identifier appears in Record Type 1. For street features, the primary feature identifier is usually the name most commonly associated with the address range. Up to five alternate feature identifiers are cross-referenced in each Type 4 record, and a single complete chain can have up to 999 Type 4 records. Alternate feature identifiers include highway designation numbers for named streets, former names, and alternate spellings where source material provided conflicting data. Where the complete chain represents a limited access highway, the highway type and route designator, such as I-95, should ideally become the primary name, and the local designation, such as Cross County Expressway or Capital Beltway, should become the alternate name. However, this is not always true in the TIGER/Line files. The primary and alternate feature identifiers can be independent of each other. There is no assurance that the same combination of primary and alternate feature identifiers will appear together in a sequence of complete chains. There also is no assurance that a feature identifier will consistently appear as the primary identifier; it might be recorded as an alternate feature identifier for some complete chains and a primary feature identifier for others. During TIGER improvement operations, the Census Bureau has taken steps to make the Interstate highway route designator the primary feature identifier for Interstate highways, and the common street name used in mail delivery the primary name on all other roads. The order of identifiers follows this hierarchy: Interstate highway, common name, US highway, county highway, with town and township road at the bottom of the list. Record Type 5 contains a record for each feature identifier used as either a primary or an alternate name. The TIGER/Line files link the alternate names in Record Type 5 to Record Type 1 through the use of the alternate feature identification code index that forms Record Type 4. See the Feature Identifier Record Linkage section in this chapter.

See Appendix D--Standard Abbreviations.  Feature Types The feature type field for road features consists of a 4-character text string. For all hydrography and non-road features, the feature type will follow the feature name in the feature name field. The abbreviations in Appendix D--Standard Abbreviations may appear in the feature type field or the feature name field. Data Limitations and Notes In earlier versions of the TIGER/Line files, users did not find many roads with alternate names in the GBF/ DIME-File coverage areas; if an alternate name was provided, it usually represented another local name and not a route number. TIGER improvement operations have since added route identifiers to many of these areas. Corporate Corridors and Corporate Offset Boundaries A corporate corridor is a narrow, linear part of an incorporated place (or in a few instances, another legal entity). The corporate corridor includes the street and/or right-of-way, or a portion of the street and/or right-ofway within the incorporated place. It excludes from the incorporated place those structures such as houses, apartments, or businesses that front along the street or road. A corporate limit offset boundary exists where the incorporated place lies on one side of the street and may include all or part of the street or right-of-way, but excludes from the incorporated place, the structures located along that side of the street. See Figure 4-4 in Chapter 4. To facilitate address coding, the Census TIGER data base contains duplicate street name and address ranges on complete chains with a CFCC of F11 (nonvisible offset boundary) or F12 (nonvisible corporate corridor). The duplicate street names for the F11 and F12 features are on Record Type 5; the duplicate address ranges are on Record Type 6. Record Type 1 will not contain feature identifiers for complete chains with CFCCs of F11 or F12.  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3- 5   Feature Identifier Record Linkage Record Type 4 provides the link required to find any alternate feature identifiers belonging to a complete chain. Record Type 4 cross-references each TLID with an Alternate Feature ID code (FEAT) assigned to each record in Record Type 5. Record Type 5 contains all feature identifiers including those that are used only as primary identifiers. However, only the FEATs for complete chains that have alternate feature identifiers appear in Record Type 4. Complete chains that have no alternate feature identifier will have no Type 4 record. To find the alternate feature identifiers for a complete chain, begin by determining the TLID for the complete chain. Then search for this TLID in Record Type 4. If the complete chain has any alternate feature identifiers, Record Type 4 should provide at least one record. Once found, the Record Type 4 entries will each contain from one to five FEAT numbers. The FEAT fields are blank when no further alternative identifiers exist. The first FEAT field (FEAT1) should always have a valid FEAT number. Finally, find the records in the Record Type 5 file that match the FEAT codes from Record Type 4. The TIGER/ Line file provides a record sequence number to identify multiple Type 4 records that might exist for one TLID. Even though Record Type 4 contains only users cannot link all ated complete chains Type 5 contains all feature identifiers, Record references for alternate feature identifiers.

A FEAT is assigned sequentially, beginning with 1, to each feature identifier in Record Type 5. The FEAT is not a permanent identification number. TLID is the record identifier for the complete chain. See Chapter 2 for a full discussion of TLIDs. RTSQ is a 3-digit integer that uniquely identifies multiple Type 4 records with the same TLID. RTSQ equals 1 for the first occurrence of a TLID in Record Type 4 and can reach a maximum of 999 for subsequent occurrences.  Address Ranges and ZIP Codes    The TIGER/Line files contain address ranges, not individual addresses. The term address range refers to the first possible structure number and the last possible structure number along a complete chain side relative to the direction in which the complete chain is coded. The address ranges in the TIGER/Line  files are predominantly potential ranges that include the full range of possible structure numbers even though the actual structures might not exist. The address numbers used to create the address ranges are commonly known as city-style addresses. A city-style address minimally consists of a structure number, street name, and a 5-digit ZIP Code; for example, 213 Main St 90210. In the TIGER/Line files, the ZIP Codes usually appear only on those complete chains that have address ranges identified. However, they may appear on some road features without the address ranges.  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3- 7   An address range also may have the full 9-digit ZIP Code that includes the USPS's 4-digit ZIP+4 Add-On code. The Census Bureau has added the Postal Add-On code to the Census TIGER data base using an automated match to the USPS's AMS II ZIP+4 file. The codes in the TIGER/ Line files are the street-level codes the USPS has assigned to address ranges. The USPS may assign more specific codes to companies and buildings, and to apartments, floors, or suites within buildings. Some address coding software that uses the AMS II ZIP+4 file may provide the more specific codes. However, the TIGER/Line files contain only the more general codes. Usually the ZIP+4 Add-On code is not required to uniquely identify an address range. There are a few situations where a street name and address range legitimately appear more than once in the same 5-digit ZIP Code. Usually the USPS distinguishes these duplicates by using different postal station names. However, the Postal Add-On code will uniquely identify these cases. Puerto Rico is a special case because many addresses were uniquely assigned within an urbanizacion (a community or development) and could duplicate another address in a different urbanizacion with the same 5-digit ZIP Code . To resolve this problem, the USPS added an additional line to the address to identify the urbanizacion. The 9-digit ZIP Code also may serve to uniquely identify these address ranges. We do not yet have all of these 9-digit ZIP Codes in the Census TIGER data base.  Address Ranges Complete chains in the TIGER/Line files have one end point labeled as the start node and the other end point labeled as the end node. The start and end nodes also are referred to as from and to. The start node always corresponds to the beginning of the complete chain identified by the start node coordinates FRLAT and FRLONG. The order of the addresses follows the sequence of the nodes on the complete chain; the nodes may not be related to the low to high orientation of the address range. The start address may be higher or lower than the end address for a complete chain. Structure numbers usually, but not always, systematically increase or decrease while moving along a street in a set direction from one complete chain to the next (see Figure 3-1).  3-8 1997 TIGER/Line Files   Figure 3-1 TIGER/Line Address Range Basics The TIGER/Line  files contain potential address ranges for city-style addresses. The complete chain (between the start node and the end node) in the diagram below has two address ranges; the left side has odd-numbered addresses and the right side has the complementary even-numbered addresses. Potential address ranges along a complete chain have values that encompass the addresses of existing structures, as well as those not yet built.  Actual Address  Potential Address Range  101  105  107  113  101-119 Start Node  Oak Ave  100-118  LEFT RIGHT  End Node  100  102  104  106  108  110  Record Type 1 contains separate data fields for both the start and end of each address range.

A complete chain side may have multiple address ranges. Often this occurs when address ranges are split to accommodate different 9-digit ZIP Codes. The TIGER/Line files use Record Type 6 to store any additional ranges as required. The Type 1 record will hold the ranges with the largest sequence of numbers. However, Record Type 6 may hold a significant number of additional ranges. Data users must use Record Type 6 to obtain the entire picture of the possible address ranges along a complete chain. In Record Types 1 and 6, both the left- and the right-side address ranges have a start and an end address range field that can contain a maximum of 11-alphanumeric characters. The address range fields are right-justified. Each address range in the TIGER/Line files has only one parity. Only odd-numbered addresses are contained within an address range with odd start and end structure numbers. Likewise, only even-numbered addresses belong to an address range with even start and end structure numbers. The value zero is not used as a valid address range end value. Generally, the left and the right sides of a complete chain have opposite parities. If both odd and even addresses exist on the same side of a complete chain, the TIGER/Line files provide both an even and an odd parity range for that side of the complete chain. One of the ranges appears in Record Type 1, while the other range appears separately in Record Type 6. Some address ranges may include single value ranges, such as 16-16, referred to as include addresses. These include addresses are anomalies; they may have a parity different than the prevailing address range on the complete chain side, or appear as an outlier from an adjoining range that does not fit within the range belonging to the complete chain where it is located. For example, the location of 16 Osage St falls on the predominantly odd-numbered left side of the complete chain with the address range 1-99. The range 16-16 will appear as an additional include range on the left side of the street. The even address range 2-98 on the right side of the street must exclude the number 16 structure number; the right address range becomes two ranges, 2-14 and 18-98. Outliers follow the same pattern. For example, 10 Persimmon St may appear on the side of the complete chain with the range 100-198 and not on the complete chain with the  3-10 1997 TIGER/Line Files   range 2-98. As before, 10-10 would become an additional range added to the complete chain with the range 100-198, and the address range 2-98 would become two ranges, 2-8 and 12-98. Because include address ranges require complex edits that may involve several complete chains, the Census Bureau cannot guarantee that all address duplication has been identified and eliminated. Some basic characteristics of address ranges are as follows:  The TIGER/Line files generally contain only those city-style address ranges used for mail delivery. They do not show rural route and post office box addresses. They may contain structure numbers assigned in select areas for use by local emergency services, but not for mail delivery. The TIGER/Line files do include address ranges and ZIP Codes in some small places where the USPS provides only post office box service, not street delivery. These address ranges represent the structure numbers collected during the 1990 census field operations, while the ZIP Codes represent the post office boxes. The address ranges in these areas do not have Postal Add-On codes since the USPS does not use them for street delivery.  Gaps may exist between multiple ranges for a single complete chain. A gap may be significant, since any numbers missing from one complete chain may actually appear on another complete chain in the case of address anomalies such as out-of-parity or out-of-sequence addresses (see Figure 3-2).  In a few rare cases, address ranges can include numbers with alphabetic characters. These characters help uniquely identify addresses within a county. For instance, certain unincorporated areas of Genesee County, Michigan add a letter G prefix to the address number. The characters are consistently placed within the address range field; for example, the letter G maintains a consistent column placement in the range G1 to G99 (see Figure 3-3).  Address ranges exist only for street features, and in some cases, corporate corridor and corporate offset boundary features.  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3- 11   Figure 3-2 TIGER/Line Multiple and Out-of-Sequence Address Ranges The TIGER/Line  files can accommodate complex address situations by using more than one address range. A complete chain may contain both odd and even ranges, provided the ranges are not duplicated elsewhere. Whenever there is more than one address range per side for a complete chain, the additional address ranges go into Record Type 6. The TLID field links the two record types. Record Type 6 has a sequence field (RTSQ) that allows more than one Record Type 6 to . have the same TLID. The largest address ranges are put on Record Type 1 and the smaller ranges on Record Type 6. The complete chain in the diagram below has two address ranges on each side. This situation results when a structure with an even-numbered address (150-150) is built on the odd-numbered side of the street.  113  121  123  125  150  199  LEFT Start Node  121-199, 150-150 120-148, 152-198  Oak Ave End Node  RIGHT  110  120  122  124  126  128  130  There is a gap (150-150) in the the even-numbered addresses.

Only a few rare situations require alphabetic characters to uniquely identify an address range.

Inconsistent street numbers may affect the address ranges of other complete chains.  The start-end orientation of address ranges follows the start-end node orientation of the complete chain. Address ranges run from high to low or low to high to be consistent with the actual orientation of address ranges along the street. Single number street addresses appear as a range.

The Census Bureau edits the address ranges to locate possible overlaps, but cannot guarantee that all possible overlap situations have been identified.  Address ranges in the TIGER/Line files are usually associated with both the primary and alternate feature identifiers. Caution: Address range overlaps may occur if primary address ranges are linked to alternate feature identifiers that identify route numbers. Some address systems use a hyphen to separate avenue numbers, private road designators, and grid cell numbers from the structure numbers; for example, 10-01 Reynolds St uses a hyphen to separate the avenue number from the structure number. See the Introduction chapter for more information on known anomalies.  Imputed Address Ranges Imputed address ranges occur during the process of updating the Census TIGER data base when a new complete chain intersects an existing complete chain with address ranges. The intersection splits the existing complete chain and produces two new complete chains connected by a new node located at the intersection point. The update program divides the old address ranges among the two new complete chains and imputes the address range ends at the new node. The impute process allocates either all or part of each original address range to each of the new complete chains in proportion to their lengths (see Figures 3-4 and 3-5). For each side of the original complete chain, the process considers all address ranges appearing on each side and determines the overall low and high address. The process assumes the addresses are evenly distributed over the length of the complete chain, and applies the proportion of complete chain lengths to the overall address ranges to calculate a split point address for each side. Address ranges that fall entirely above or below the split point address are moved intact to one of the new complete chains. The process divides any address ranges that contain the split point address and allocates each part to one of the new complete chains.  3-14 1997 TIGER/Line Files   The new address range ends created from the split are imputed values and have an impute flag. Some intermediate address range ends also may carry the impute flag. These address range ends fall between the overall high and low address for complete chain sides that have more than one address range. The impute flags on these range ends often mark splits created by adding different nine-digit ZIP Codes to parts of the original address range. These impute flags are not significant and should be disregarded. The impute flags identify address ranges that have been through the impute process. Each record in the TIGER/Line files contains four separate 1-character impute flag fields, one for each address range end.  ZIP Codes The ZIP Code is an attribute of the address ranges. The TIGER/Line files have a five-character ZIP Code field containing a numeric code with leading zeros. Both the left- and right-side address ranges share the ZIP Code that appears in the same Type 1 or Type 6 record. Each address range belonging to a complete chain can have a different ZIP Code. Where ZIP Code boundaries follow a street, the complete chain may have different left- and right-side ZIP Codes, or different ZIP Codes along its length. Because the Census TIGER data base identifies only one ZIP Code for each address range record, address ranges with different ZIP Codes must appear in separate records. The address range(s) with one ZIP Code will appear in Record Type 1, and the address range(s) with the other ZIP Code(s) will appear in Record Type 6. For example, one complete chain making up Duke Street is a ZIP Code boundary; the left-side range 1-99 has a ZIP Code of 12345, and the right-side range 2-98 has a ZIP Code of 54321. The range 1-99 with a ZIP Code of 12345 will appear in Record Type 1, and the right-side range fields will be blank. The range 2-98 with a ZIP Code of 54321 will appear in Record Type 6, and the leftside range fields will be blank. If the complete chain had additional address ranges with a ZIP Code of either 12345 or 54321, these additional address ranges would appear with Attributes of Geographic Objects 3- 15   Figure 3-4 TIGER/Line Address Range Imputes--Before Split The Census TIGER  data base uses impute flags to indicate that the one or both ends of an address range are based on calculations rather than known values. Imputed address situations generally occur when a complete chain with existing address ranges becomes split by a new complete chain. The illustration below shows the address ranges on Chestnut Ave before a split. All impute flags for this complete chain are set at zero. Figure 3-5 shows the address ranges after the split.

The overall address range for each complete chain side (1649 to 201 on the left side and 298 to 200 on the right side) and the split points for each of these address ranges (approximately 1088 on the left side and 261 on the right side) are determined by the TIGER System. Address ranges that fall entirely above or below the split point belong to one of the two new complete chains and do not get an impute flag.

For example, a right-side range of 150-198 with a ZIP Code of 12345 could appear on the Type 1 record with the left-side range of 1-99. However, a right-side range of 150-198 with a ZIP Code of 54321 could not appear on the Type 6 record with the range 2-98. Instead, the range would have to appear in a second Type 6 record. Since the ZIP Codes in the TIGER/Line file relate to mail delivery along addressed streets, they are not true area features. It is possible that a polygon may contain addresses associated with more than one delivery ZIP Code . See the Introduction chapter for information relating to the 1997 TIGER/Line files.  Postal Add-On Code The TIGER/Line files have a 4-character Postal ZIP+4 Add-On code which is located on Record Type Z. Record Type Z may link to a left- or right-side address range in Record Type 1 or in Record Type 6. The first two characters of the code indicate the USPS sector code; the last two characters represent the USPS segment code. As stated earlier, the Census Bureau used an automated match process to assign the Add-On codes to the address ranges in the Census TIGER  data base. The match utilized only the street type records from the AMS II ZIP+4 file. These records identify a single Add-On code for a range of addresses. The ZIP+4 file also contains company and high-rise building records that supply specific codes to companies, buildings, and floors or suites within buildings. The Census Bureau did not match these codes to the Census TIGER data base because it was not practical to add all of the building features to the Census TIGER data base. Also, it was not feasible to split the address ranges for individual building-level codes. The match process attempted to relate the 5-digit ZIP Code, street name identifier, and address ranges for each feature in the Census TIGER data base to the corresponding street type record in the AMS II ZIP+4 file of the USPS. A match was not always possible because the process could not identify a single match between features with a high degree of confidence.  3-18 1997 TIGER/Line Files   Where successful, the process added the Postal Add-On codes to the address ranges in the Census TIGER data base. The process split these ranges if the Add-On codes covered only part of the range. Splits of this type occurred because the potential address ranges used by the Census Bureau differed from those used by the USPS. The USPS assigned different Add-On codes for each range of addresses along a block side. For example the 100, 200, and 300 numbered addresses received different Add-On codes even though they appeared on the same block side. The Add-On codes also may appear on more than one complete chain. This results because of differences in potential address ranges, and because the Census Bureau recognizes complete chain breaks and intersections not recognized by the USPS. See the Introduction chapter for information on missing data.  Address Information and Key Geographic Locations (KGLs) KGLs represent a special class of address information. They provide a geocoding tool like address ranges, but also identify a spatial object similar to a landmark. The Census Bureau uses KGLs to identify named buildings where the use of the feature name enhances the ability to geocode addresses. These cases include airports, shopping centers, schools, condominiums, hotels, and apartment complexes. The Census Bureau uses KGLs in situations where the address range along a street does not geocode to the correct block. Thus, greater accuracy in geocoding is provided when the KGL address is used than when the address range on the complete chain is used. In the TIGER/Line files, each KGL usually has a street address, CFCC, KGL feature name, and ZIP Code. The street feature identifier associated with the address of the KGL is obtained by linking the FEAT field to Record Type 5 which contains the list of all street name identifiers. The KGLs are independent of the address range on the complete chain; the geocoding link for the KGL is the GT-polygon. In most cases, one of the complete chains that forms the boundary of the GT-polygon will contain the KGL address. However, this relationship is not true for all KGLs. In order to locate the street segment with the KGL address, use the previously linked street name identifier from Record Type 5. The ZIP Codes may not be the same.  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3- 19   Even though the KGLs appear to identify specific structures, the KGL descriptions do not include location coordinates. In most cases, the Census Bureau can determine the general location of the KGL, but cannot provide a specific location with any certainty.  Address Information Methodology Pre-1992 Address Ranges Before the 1990 census, the Census TIGER data base contained address ranges only for the area covered by 1980 Geographic Base File/Dual Independent Map Encoding (GBF/DIME) files and a few file extension areas prepared in conjunction with 1980 census activities. These ranges were used to geocode a list of addresses to geographic areas for use in the 1990 questionnaire mail-out. For the 1990 census, the Bureau purchased the list of addresses from commercial vendors for the geographic areas where the Census TIGER data base included address ranges. To verify the accuracy of the addresses, the Census Bureau began with an initial assignment of residential addresses to the 1990 census tracts and blocks. Clerical review of the results of the assignment process provided additional address range updates. If an address range in the TIGER/Line file prepared for the 1990 census was incorrect, the Census Bureau implemented procedures to ensure that the error did not adversely affect the accuracy or the quality of the 1990 census. Later, in field operations, enumerators verified, corrected, and updated the list of addresses assigned to each block. They walked the perimeter and all interior streets of each block and checked the address list against their observations.  1992 TIGER/Line Expanded Addresses In the 1992 TIGER/Line Files, the Census Bureau expanded the address range coverage for the entire United States by creating new ranges based on the Address Control File (ACF) used in the 1990 decennial census. The ACF was a master list of addresses geocoded to the census block level. For each block, the individual structure addresses were grouped by feature identifier and sorted into numerical order to extract an actual range. The order of the addresses along the complete chains bordering the block, relative to the start and end nodes of the complete chains, came from the order 3-20 1997 TIGER/Line Files   of addresses for the street feature as a whole (i.e., the collection of linked complete chains with the same feature identifier). Likewise, the overall parity of the street feature set the standard for identifying and editing anomalies along the complete chains. To maintain confidentiality of individual addresses, the Census Bureau converted the actual range to a potential range. This was accomplished by expanding the actual range to complete a hundred range, splitting the difference between coverage gaps, and in some cases disguising the range by the random addition or subtraction of addresses. Where a complete chain in the Census TIGER data base contained both an ACF-derived address range and a pre-existing address range, only the pre-existing address range was extracted for the 1992 TIGER/ Line files. This extraction process was followed on each side of a complete chain. No attempt was made to resolve differences between the two sources (the pre-existing or the ACF-derived). The ACF-derived address range may have created overlaps with pre-existing address ranges on the adjoining complete chains.  Post-1992 Expanded Addresses What had been true for addresses in the 1992 TIGER/Line files was modified for the 1994, 1995, and the 1997 versions of the files. The preexisting address ranges in the Census TIGER data base and the ACF address ranges were matched to determine their comparability. Then, a rematch process was performed similar to the process used for the 1992 TIGER/Line files. Using more sophisticated processing, the address ranges were merged to create better address range coverage. In the merge process, the ACF range became the base address range, and the pre-existing address range in the Census TIGER  data base was used to make the address range coverage more complete. The merged range is the address range in the 1997 TIGER/Line files. In addition to the address merge process, the Census Bureau ran an address range edit. The edits fixed some orientation and parity reversals along a street feature. They also identified overlapping address ranges of different complete chains that had the same street identifier and ZIP Code. Where all of the overlapping addresses were geocoded to the Attributes of Geographic Objects 3- 21   same 1990 census block, only one instance of the address was retained in the TIGER/Line files. If overlapping addresses were geocoded to a different census block, none of these overlapping addresses were entered into the TIGER/Line files. For this reason, street features that had address ranges in the past may show no ranges or incomplete ranges in the latest versions of the TIGER/Line files. Both primary and alternate feature identifiers can be used in geocoding, but great care should be used with the alternate identifiers. In the case of corporate corridors and corporate limit offset boundaries, the alternate address linked to the boundary should be used for geocoding rather than the primary range linked to the street (see the Corporate Corridors and Corporate Limit Offset Boundaries section in this chapter). Orientation edits attempted to standardize the low to high orientation of address ranges along a chain of street feature complete chains with the same feature identifier. Complete chains with address ranges that were specifically identified as orientation anomalies were automatically excluded. The edit determined the majority orientation for the street feature chain and reversed the low and high values on any range that deviated from the majority. The edit only created street feature chains that included adjacent complete chains; discontiguous street feature chains were edited as separate pieces. Therefore, the from-to orientation of the complete chains may be inconsistent along a feature chain. The parity edits attempted to place the even- and odd-parity ranges consistently on the same side of a feature chain. Chains with address ranges that were specifically identified as known anomalies were automatically excluded. Because address geocoding could be affected, the parity fix required a feature chain with a minimum of four complete chains and a majority parity representing 70 percent of the address ranges. As a result, smaller feature chains remained unaltered. For the 1994 TIGER/Line files, the Census Bureau conducted a general ZIP Code clean-up and staff added new ZIP Codes created since the 1990 census. These updates had a significant impact on parts of Michigan, California, and central Florida. Nationwide, automated processes eliminated illegal codes not recognized by the USPS as ZIP Codes, and clerical  3-22 1997 TIGER/Line Files   operations began eliminating the scatter of incorrectly applied ZIP Codes. Nearly all 3-digit ZIP Code anomalies have been corrected.

The distribution of ZIP Codes in the TIGER/Line files may not reflect the exact USPS ZIP Code service area.  Limitations Users of the address ranges in the TIGER/Line files should check for address range overlaps, gaps, odd/even reversals, and other situations that may be incorrect. While the Census Bureau continues to edit for, and correct these situations, it is possible that some still exist. See the list of anomalies in the Introduction chapter.  Corporate Corridors and Corporate Limit Offset Boundaries A corporate corridor is a narrow, linear part of an incorporated place (or in a few instances, another legal entity). The corporate corridor includes the street and/or right-of-way, or a portion of the street and/or right-of-  3-24 1997 TIGER/Line Files   way within the incorporated place. It excludes from the incorporated place those structures such as houses, apartments, or businesses that front along the street or road. A corporate limit offset boundary exists where the incorporated place lies on one side of the street and may include all or part of the street and/or right-of-way, but not the structures located on that side of the street. See the Places section in Chapter 4. To facilitate the coding of addresses to the correct geographic entity, the Census TIGER data base contains duplicate street name and address ranges on complete chains with a CFCC of F11 (nonvisible offset boundary) or F12 (nonvisible corporate corridor). The duplicate street names for the F11 and F12 features are on Record Type 5; the duplicate address ranges are on Record Type 6. Complete chains with CFCCs of F11 or F12 will not contain the duplicate names or address ranges in Record Type 1. Record Type 1 does not indicate that the street or right-of-way lies within a corporate corridor or offset boundary. Therefore, the address ranges lie outside the corporate corridor or offset boundary and are encoded on either side of these lines. Data users planning to geocode addresses in areas with these boundary types must identify the duplicate feature identifiers and ranges from Record Types 5 and 6 (the names and address ranges for CFCC F11 and F12 features), locate the street feature with those ranges, and remove the street feature's address ranges and geographic codes from the geocoding process.  Record Linkages The TIGER/Line files store address range information in two record types. Record Type 1 contains the basic complete chain attributes, including one basic address range. Record Type 6 stores the additional ranges when the complete chain has more than one range on one or both sides. The TLID field links Record Types 1 and 6. Since a complete chain can have more than one set of address ranges, multiple Type 6 records can exist with the same TLID. The TIGER/Line files distinguish these records with a record sequence number (RTSQ). All Attributes of Geographic Objects 3- 25   Type 6 records that have the same TLID appear sequentially in the file even though the records are not sorted by TLID. The TIGER/ Line files do not contain a field indicating whether a Type 6 record exists for a specific TLID; the user must scan any existing records in Record Type 6 for a TLID match.  Boundaries of Geographic Entities The TIGER/Line files store geographic codes as either a polygon or complete chain attribute. In the case of state and county level geography, and some other areas, the codes appear in both complete chain and polygon record types. Refer to Chapter 4 for descriptions of geographic areas, and to Chapter 6 for the data dictionary that describes the record type fields.  Record Linkages and Boundary Extraction The codes assigned to the complete chain belong to the areas referenced by the left and the right sides of a complete chain. Only those features that have different geographic codes on the left and the right sides of a line become boundary features. Information from multiple TIGER/ Line data fields is required to uniquely identify the boundary of some geographic entities. For instance, both the census block and census tract/ BNA codes are required to identify a block boundary. Block 101 in census tract 2101 could neighbor block 101 in census tract 2998. Be sure to use both the basic number and the suffix when extracting either census tract or block boundaries. Data users who have combined TIGER/Line files should include the 1990 state/statistical equivalent and 1990 county/statistical equivalent codes to extract 1990 census tract/BNA boundaries. The extraction of boundary features from polygon attribute codes requires making a link between the polygon and the complete chain data records, then identifying the features with different left- and right-side geographic codes. For a description of the record linkage process, see the Polygon Features section in this chapter. Boundary rings consist of multiple complete chains that are sequentially linked together and connected to form a closed ring. The process of linking all of the boundary complete chains that outline the same geographic  3-26 1997 TIGER/Line Files   entity requires the extraction of all complete chains that have that entity's code on either the left or the right side (but not both). Linking the chains together will form a polygon; each polygon may represent one of the GTpolygons described in Record Types A, P, and S, or a collection of these GT-polygons. Caution: Some types of geographic areas must end at a county/file boundary while others can continue into adjoining counties/files. For example, MCDs stop at a county boundary, whereas incorporated places can exist in several counties (See the Record Linkages/Feature Chaining section in this chapter).  Single-Side Flags and County Boundaries The 1997 TIGER/Line files use current counties/statistical equivalents as the basis for the file coverage area, not the boundaries as they existed for the 1990 census. This means that a county or countyequivalent file may not cover the exact same area as it did in 1990. Any legal changes or boundary corrections that occurred since 1990 could have resulted in a piece of land moving from one county, or county equivalent, to another. County boundary features are duplicated between adjoining pairs of counties so that each file is complete. However, the complete chains that constitute the boundary features contain only the geographic entity codes and address ranges relevant to each county-based TIGER/Line  file. The geographic entity codes are blanked out on the outside edge of the county, even though some of these fields must normally have a non-blank code. The TIGER/Line file identifies these complete chains with a 1-character, single-side segment flag in the SIDE1 field of Record Type 1. When combining several TIGER/Line files data set, the data user will need to eliminate Because each one of the duplicate boundary the left- or right-side geographic entity codes elimination process will need to combine the from both lines. to form a state or regional duplicate boundary lines. complete chains has either and address ranges, the codes and address ranges  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3- 27   The same situation applies to the polygon identification codes. Record Type I contains CENIDs and POLYIDs for GT-polygons within the county. If the GT-polygon is in the adjacent county, the CENID and POLYID fields are blank.  Single-Side Flag Record Location Record Type 1 Field Name SIDE1 Description Single-Side Complete Chain Code (flag)  Single-Side Flag Codes 1-- The complete chain is a county boundary; either the left or the right side is blank blank -- The complete chain is not a county boundary; neither left nor right side is blank  Census Feature Class Codes ( CFCCs) A census feature class code (CFCC) is used to identify the most noticeable characteristic of a feature. The CFCC is applied only once to a chain or landmark with preference given to classifications that cover features that are visible to an observer and a part of the ground transportation network. Thus, a road that also is the boundary of a town would have a CFCC describing its road characteristics, not its boundary characteristics. The CFCC, as used in The first character is a character is a number character is a number the TIGER/Line files, is a three-character code. letter describing the feature class; the second describing the major category; and the third describing the minor category.  Feature Class A, Road The definition of a divided highway has been the source of considerable discussion. Earlier specifications have defined a divided road as having ""... opposing traffic lanes that are physically separated by a median strip no less than 70 feet wide in former GBF/DIME areas or no less than 200 feet wide in non-GBF/DIME areas."" This definition caused confusion in the proper coding of interstates having narrow medians. To clarify the situation, the Census Bureau now uses the term divided to refer to a road with opposing traffic lanes separated by any size median, and separated to  3-28 1997 TIGER/Line Files   refer to lanes that are represented in the Census TIGER data base as two distinct complete chains. Earlier operations may have depicted widely separated lanes as a single line in the data base or created separate lines when the median was small, depending on the available source used during the update. See the list of anomalies in the Introduction chapter. The term, rail line in center, indicates that a rail line shares the road rightof-way. The rail line may follow the center of the road or be directly next to the road; representation is dependent upon the available source used during the update. The rail line can represent a railroad, a street carline, or other carline. Primary Highway With Limited Access Interstate highways and some toll highways are in this category (A1) and are distinguished by the presence of interchanges. These highways are accessed by way of ramps and have multiple lanes of traffic. The opposing traffic lanes are divided by a median strip. The TIGER/Line files may depict these opposing traffic lanes as two distinct lines in which case, the road is called separated.

Only those GT-polygons associated with an area landmark have a CFCC. Most CFCCs in the feature classification scheme apply only to complete chains. In a few instances, the same feature code may apply to complete chains as well as to point and area landmarks. Only those features required for census operational purposes are classified and inserted into the Census TIGER data base. Therefore, not all features in a county will appear in the TIGER/Line files. Since features are classified with only a single code, a road that also is a boundary will have only the CFCC of a road even though a CFCC for a boundary exists in the classification scheme.  CFCC Record Location Record Type 1 7 9  Field Name CFCC CFCC CFCC  Description Code assigned to the complete chain Code assigned to a point or area landmark Code assigned to a key geographic location  Points Describing the Complete Chain The TIGER/Line files describe the spatial/geometric position and shape of a complete chain using shape points and nodes; see the section entitled Topology in Chapter 1. Latitude and longitude coordinate fields identify the shape points and nodes. The Census TIGER data base does not support node identification numbers.  Nodes Nodes are topological objects that mark the end location of each complete chain. Every chain has two nodes, a start node and an end node (using the  3-42 1997 TIGER/Line Files   Spatial Data Transfer Standard, or SDTS, terminology). Earlier releases of the TIGER/Line files refer to these nodes as the from node and the to node. The order of the nodes establishes the left and the right sides of the line and sets the sequencing order for the shape points. The node coordinates are stored in Record Type 1.  Shape Points The Census Bureau uses the term shape points to describe the nontopological points that describe the position and shape of a chain. Shape points exist only where required; straight-line complete chains require no shape points. Shape points are associated only with one complete chain and are listed in order from start node to end node. The TIGER/Line files store shape points in Record Type 2 and link them to the nodes in Record Type 1 using the TLID. The shape points for a chain can fill several Type 2 records.  Coordinates for Nodes and Shape Points Coordinates are expressed in Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) notation, where a positive latitude represents the Northern Hemisphere and a negative longitude represents the Western Hemisphere. All coordinates are expressed as a signed integer with six decimal places of precision implied (see the section, Positional Accuracy, in Chapter 5). Actual Latitude 15 Deg. S to 72 Deg. N Longitude 64 Deg. W to 131 Deg. E  TIGER/Line File - 15000000 t o +72000000 -64000000 t o -180000000 +179999999 t o +131000000  For the 48 contiguous states, the District of Columbia, Alaska, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, the coordinates in the 1995 and 1997 versions of the TIGER/Line files are in the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). The coordinate datum for the above areas was NAD27 in all previous versions of the files prior to 1995. Regional datums are used in all versions of the TIGER/Line files for Hawaii and the Island Territories in the Pacific.  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3- 43   Coordinate Values All nodes have non-zero coordinates within the range specified in the Coordinates for Nodes and Shape Points section on the previous page. Shape point coordinates are expressed in the same manner. However, unused Record Type 2 fields are zero-filled and begin with a ""+"" sign.

Point 10, Longitude Point 10, Latitude  Record Linkages/Feature Chaining Plotting a complete chain requires using the nodes from Record Type 1 and all of the shape point records in Record Type 2 with the same TLID, if any. Plot the start node first, then search Record Type 2 for any matching records. If there is a match, the record will contain from 1 to 10 shape points. If all 10-point fields are filled with non-zero values, there may be an additional matching Type 2 record. Type 2 records are not sorted by TLID, but all records with the same TLID should appear together in sequence by the record sequence number (RTSQ). Plot the shape points from all Type 2 records and end the complete chain by plotting the end node. Street features may consist of multiple complete chains that are sequentially linked together. Linking all of the features with the same name requires the extraction of all Type 1 and Type 2 records with the same feature identifiers in Record Types 1 and 5.  3-44 1997 TIGER/Line Files   Boundary generation requires the extraction of all features that have different left and right geographic codes. The placement of the complete chains into a boundary-ring sequence requires a procedure to match the end of one complete chain to the beginning or end of the next complete chain. The complete chains will probably not have the same to-from or start-end orientation down the length of the street or boundary. Therefore, the procedure must reverse the order of the nodes and shape points that form some complete chains to achieve a correct and consistent sequence of nodes and shape points. Since the nodes that identify the ends of the complete chains do not have an identification number, the procedure must match the nodes based on the latitude and longitude coordinates. This might facilitate the match by combining the coordinates into a single peano key code composed of alternating latitude and longitude digits. Sorting nodes using the peano key will cluster nodes that are spatially close together.  Polygon Features The TIGER/Line files contain identification and geographic codes for each GT-polygon in the Census TIGER data base. These GT-polygons are the smallest areas identified in the TIGER/Line files. Geographic entities and area landmarks have specific identification codes and form more complex polygons. The TIGER/Line files link these features to GT-polygons, but do not directly identify the more complex polygons. GT-polygons are building blocks that form features. They are not features and do not have their own feature name or CFCC. However, GT-polygons may be a part of many area landmark features that have their own feature name and CFCC. GT-polygons have unique GT-polygon identification codes (CENID and POLYID), a set of geographic entity codes, and an internal point location. Refer to Chapter 2 for more information on GT-polygon identification codes and Chapter 4 for a description of the geographic entities in the TIGER/Line files.  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3- 45   Information and record linkage keys for GT-polygons are distributed over several record types:       Record Record Record Record Record Record Type Type Type Type Type Type P -- provides the GT-polygon internal point location A -- provides the 1990 census geographic entity codes and areas 8 -- links GT-polygons to area landmarks 9 -- links GT-polygons to key geographic location features I -- links GT-polygons to complete chains S -- provides current geographic entity codes and areas  Updates to the Census TIGER data base include new street and boundary complete chains that create new GT-polygons. Thus, each version of the TIGER/Line files will have a single, unique set of GT-polygons, each with a corresponding Record Type A, S, and P. The CENID and POLYID identification codes link records together, but are not permanent GT-polygon identification codes.  Geographic Entity Codes Geographic entity codes can be attributes of a set of polygons, a complete chain, or both. Refer to Chapter 6 for the data dictionary that describes the record type fields and to Chapter 4 for descriptions of geographic areas.  Internal Points The internal point is a point location within each GT-polygon that is unique to that GT-polygon. The TIGER/Line files exclude the internal points from the node-complete chain-polygon topology; do not confuse the internal point with a centroid. In a polygon with an irregular shape, such as a doughnut or crescent shape, the true centroid could fall outside the polygon. Unlike true centroids, the internal points should always fall within the GT-polygon or on the GT-polygon boundary. Some of the GT-polygons (approximately 400 nationwide) are so small that the internal point may be identical to a point on one of the lines bounding the GT-polygon, or identical to one of the nodes. Depending upon the precision of a particular software or hardware system, the data user may find the internal point outside the correct GT-polygon, or find that a GT-polygon may contain two internal points.  3-46 1997 TIGER/Line Files   Changes to the shape and location of complete chains forming polygon boundaries will change the polygon internal point coordinates even though the topology of the polygon remains the same. Such changes complicate the matching, using internal point coordinates, of polygons from different versions of the TIGER/Line files. All internal points have non-zero coordinates. Coordinates are expressed in standard FIPS PUB 70 notation. See the Coordinates for Nodes and Shape Points section in this chapter. GT-Polygon Internal Point Coordinates Record Locations Record Type P P Field Name POLYLONG POLYLAT Description Internal point longitude Internal point latitude  Record Linkages The topological network of complete chains divides the surface area of geographic entities into GT-polygons. There is a one-to-one relationship between the GT-polygons constructed from Record Types 1 and 2 and those appearing in Record Type P. In constructing the GT-polygons from Record Types 1 and 2, users are cautioned to be sure their software has the necessary coordinate precision and does not snap together complete chains that are merely close. Record Type I provides a direct link from each complete chain in the TIGER/Line file to its adjoining GT-polygons. It contains both the TLID and the polygon identification codes for each side of the GT-polygon. Record Type I facilitates the transfer of polygon geographic codes to the complete chain, but also provides the link back from polygon to complete chain. In this case, finding all complete chains associated with a GT-polygon is more difficult. The procedure involves searching every Type I record to locate all instances where a CENID and POLYID appear on either the left or the right side of a complete chain. Area landmarks also must link to the GT-polygons in order to establish their geographic location. Record Type 8 provides the link from GT-polygon to area landmark. See the Area Landmark Locations section in this chapter. Attributes of Geographic Objects 3- 47   Landmark Features The Census Bureau includes landmarks in the Census TIGER data base for locating special features and to help enumerators during field operations. Some of the more common landmark types include airports, cemeteries, parks, and educational facilities. The Census Bureau added landmark features on an as-needed-basis and made no attempt to ensure that all instances of a particular feature were included. The absence of a landmark does not mean that the living quarters, e.g., hospitals and group quarters associated with the landmark were excluded from the 1990 enumeration. The address list used for the census was maintained apart from the landmark data. Landmarks with a ZIP Code and an address are called key geographic locations (KGLs). A landmark can be either a point, Census TIGER data base permits airport or airfield might appear as depends on the size of the feature the source document. line, or area type. In some cases, the a choice of types. For instance, an a point, line, or area; the approach and the depiction of the feature in  Line features such as airfields could appear as one or more complete chains; they are not identified in the landmark record types. See the Point, Line, and Area Landmark CFCCs section in this chapter to identify the possible codes that could appear as complete chains. In addition to landmark data, the TIGER/Line files contain the CFCCs and names for bodies of water including ponds, lakes, oceans, and the area covered by large streams represented as double-line drainage. These water areas have 1990 census block numbers ending in 99. See Chapter 4 for a complete description of census blocks covering land and water. Landmark and water features can overlap. The most common situation is a park or other special land-use feature that includes a lake or pond. In this case, the GT-polygon covered by the lake or pond belongs to a water landmark feature and a park landmark feature. Other kinds of landmarks can overlap as well. Area landmarks can contain point landmarks; these are not linked in the TIGER/Line files.  3-48 1997 TIGER/Line Files   Record Type 7 contains point and area landmarks. Most water areas are identified as an area landmark whether named or not. The other landmarks may be identified only by a census feature class code and may not have a name. During the extraction of this data, the Census Bureau assigned a temporary landmark identification number (LAND) to each landmark record. Record Type 8 uses the LAND to link the area landmark records in Record Type 7 to the GT-polygons. Record Type 7 and Record Type 8 exist only when the county file contains landmark features or water features. Record Type 9 contains the KGLs in the Census TIGER data base. The KGLs are linked by the CENID and POLYID to the GT-polygons.  Point, Line, and Area Landmark CFCCs All landmarks, including KGLs, have a CFCC. In the Census TIGER data base the CFCCs of the complete chains forming the polygon boundary are independent of the CFCCs assigned to the area landmark or the water feature filling the polygon.

The text string includes upper- and lower-case characters. The feature name may carry an imbedded feature type (e.g., River, Military Reservation,  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3- 51   Garden, Park, and Lake). The Census Bureau has not standardized or edited the feature types or names for landmarks in the Census TIGER data base in all areas. The Census Bureau does not guarantee that the landmarks or water areas are consistently identified in the TIGER/Line files. Area landmarks added to the Census TIGER data base in different update actions with the same name and CFCC will produce separate landmark records in the TIGER/Line files. The landmark records may contain variant spellings of the feature name or different CFCCs even though they refer to the same feature. These differences could result in the fragmentation of a large landmark. For instance, a water body could have the name Lake Redmond with a CFCC of H31, while another part could have the same name, but a CFCC of H30, and still a third part could have the name York County Reservoir. Because area landmarks can overlap, it is possible, although not likely, for one polygon to belong to several landmarks. Area landmarks and water area labels can have alternate names. Each feature name will appear as a separate Type 7 record, but each record will have the same LAND. Type 7 Records with the same LAND will have the same landmark or water area label. Each unique combination of primary and alternate names becomes a separate landmark record even though the primary name and the CFCCs match the adjoining landmark features. The TIGER/Line files do not show all water bodies as landmark records. Using Record Type 7 (area landmarks) and Record Type 8 (polygons linked to area landmarks) will not necessarily provide all water areas. Record Type S contains a water flag (WATER) to identify polygons associated with water bodies. Water bodies are identified with a value of 1 in the WATER field. Key geographic location names uniquely identify the landmark separately from its street address; for example, Springfield Towers instead of 1605 Main St.  3-52 1997 TIGER/Line Files   Landmark Feature Record Locations Record Type 7 9 Field Name LANAME KGLNAME Description Landmark name Key geographic location name  Landmark Feature Name Codes The LANAME and KGLNAME field may include any ASCII text string. The fields can be blank where the feature is unnamed.  Point Landmark Locations The TIGER/Line files identify the location of point landmarks with a single coordinate point. The presence of coordinate data in Record Type 7 distinguishes point landmarks from area landmarks that have blank coordinate fields. Coordinates Coordinates are expressed in standard FIPS PUB 70 notation. For additional information, see the Coordinates for Nodes and Shape Points section in this chapter.

The coordinate fields for area landmarks are blank-filled.  Area Landmark Locations To find the location of each area landmark, link the basic landmark description in Record Type 7 to all of the elementary polygons that belong to the landmark. Record Type 8 serves as a bridge between these two record types. The TIGER/Line files provide a Type 8 record for each polygon linked to a specific landmark. Polygons belonging to multiple landmarks appear once for each landmark. The TIGER/Line  Attributes of Geographic Objects 3- 53   files use the LAND and the polygon identification codes (CENID and POLYID) to actually make the link. See Chapter 2 for a description of the LAND, CENID, and POLYID codes and fields. Locate the polygons for an area landmark by searching Record Type 8 for all of the CENIDs and POLYIDs with the specified LAND. Record Type 8 is in LAND sort sequence. Once the polygons are linked to the area landmark, use Record Type I to locate the complete chains that form the landmark's polygon boundaries. Record Type I contains a record for all complete chains and identifies the polygons located on either side of the complete chains. The search procedure must look for all instances of Record Type I and evaluate the left- and right-side polygon identifiers for a possible match. Data users may need to eliminate complete chains that are internal to the polygon and landmark, depending on the application.  KGLs To find the location of KGLs, link the description in Record Type 9 to the elementary polygon in which the KGL is found. Use the polygon identification codes (CENID and POLYID) to make the link. If the address of the KGL is a street address, use the FEAT field (alternate feature ID code) to link to the feature identifier in Record Type 5.  3-54 1997 TIGER/Line Files   Chapter 4: Geographic Entities Overview The 1997 TIGER/Line files contain the boundaries of legal, administrative, and statistical areas. Some boundaries are those that were in effect as of the tabulation of the 1990 census, while others are updated boundaries. The legal areas shown in the files are:        States and their statistical equivalents--1990 and current Counties and their statistical equivalents--1990 and current Minor civil divisions (MCDs) --1990 and current Sub-minor civil divisions (Puerto Rico only)--1990 and current Consolidated cities--current only Incorporated places--1990 and current American Indian reservations (both federally and state-recognized)--1990 and current  American Indian trust lands--current only  Alaska Native Regional Corporations--current only  Congressional districts--current only  The administrative areas shown in the files are:  Voting districts--1990 only  School districts--current only  Traffic analysis zones--current only  The statistical areas included in the files are:  Census areas (statistical county equivalents in Alaska)--1990 and current  Census county divisions and unorganized territories (statistical county subdivisions)--1990 and current  Census designated places (statistical place equivalents)--1990 only  Place (remainder) entities (statistical place equivalents within consolidated cities)--1990 and current  American Indian/Alaska Native statistical areas--1990 and current 1) Alaska Native village statistical areas 2) Tribal designated statistical areas 3) Tribal jurisdiction statistical areas  Census tracts and block numbering areas--1990 only  Urbanized areas--1990 only  Census blocks--1990 only  Geographic Entities 4- 1    Metropolitan areas: 1) Consolidated metropolitan statistical areas--current only 2) Metropolitan statistical areas--current only 3) Primary metropolitan statistical areas--current only  Geographic entities tabulated by the Census Bureau generally are hierarchical; Figure 4-1 shows the progression of geographic areas from the Nation to the block level. See Appendix F for a count of legal, administrative, and statistical entities. The TIGER/Line files Information Processing codes. The TIGER/Line identify geographic areas using either the Federal Standard (FIPS) codes or Census Bureau-assigned  files depict geographic areas in two ways:   The assignment of codes to the left and the right sides of the complete chains (Record Types 1 and 3)  The identification of codes that belong to each GT-polygon (Record Types A and S) The TIGER/Line files identify some geographic entities in both the complete chain and polygon records for certain boundary vintages. This chapter provides detailed information on the record types and fields for the geographic entities.  Boundary and Area Changes The boundaries identified as current for some legal areas are updated boundaries collected since 1990 as part of the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Surveys, or as part of the 1990 Count Quality Review correction process. The boundaries of all states, all counties and their statistical equivalents, all MCDs, and all incorporated places are those that were legally in effect as of the latest Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS). This may vary by county record or the date of extraction from the Census TIGER data base. The boundaries of incorporated places have a varied vintage usually based on the 1990 definition of the incorporated place. Below are general guidelines for the effective date of incorporated place boundaries:  Latest Available Boundaries--Population of 2.500 or greater  Boundaries as of January 1, 1990--Population of less than 2,500  4-2 1997 TIGER/Line Files   Figure 4-1 Hierarchical Relationship of Geographic Entities  Nation  States UAs Counties CDs School Districts VTDs County Subdivisions Sub-MCDs Census Tracts/ BNAs BGs Places AIANAs ANRCs  Blocks  Geographic Entities 4-3   Some incorporated places have boundaries of a date later than those shown in the list on page 4-2. This occurs because special censuses are conducted, counts are updated based on more current boundary information, or Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS) information for places is reported later than the deadline. Some boundary dates may be earlier than those shown on page 4-2 because of a nonresponse to the most recent BAS, in which case, the boundaries of the previous BAS are used. For all other legal areas and nearly all statistical areas, the boundaries shown were those in effect at the time of the 1990 census whether the data are identified as 1990 or current. Because unorganized territories and census designated places occupy the same level of geography as legal MCDs and incorporated places, updates to the legal boundaries may affect the current boundaries for some of these entities, including the elimination of some of the statistical entities. The metropolitan area data that appears on Record Type S are based on the latest available designations by the Office of Management and Budget, and are not the metropolitan areas for which the Census Bureau tab-ulated data in 1990. The metropolitan area information on Record Type C, however, shows both 1990 and current codes and names. In a few cases, the Census Bureau made statistical area boundary changes in order to correct errors. Since the release of the 1990 Census TIGER/Line files, the Census Bureau shifted and reshaped some line features including the lines forming some boundaries. These changes involved the realignment of complete chains associated with a legal or statistical area boundary. The shape and area of the 1990 geographic entities portrayed in the 1995 and 1997 TIGER/Line files may differ from earlier TIGER/Line versions, but the inventory of 1990 census tabulation entities remains the same. Changes in the shape and location of complete chains will change the polygon internal point locations. See the Internal Points section in Chapter 3.  4-4 1997 TIGER/Line Files   Codes for Entities Appendix A is a list of FIPS state and county codes. A list of valid codes and names for other legal entities does not appear in the documentation for the TIGER/Line files. The TIGER/Line files include Record Type C which lists the geographic codes and names plus some attribute data (FIPS 55 class code, census place description code, and legal, administrative, or statistical area description code; and entity type) for certain entities. The codes and names are identified as 1990, current, or both. Record Type C contains the TIGER/Geographic NameTM files that the Census Bureau produced as a companion to the 1992 TIGER/Line files. Record Type C also replaces the TIGER Geographic Reference File Names (GRF-N), 1990.

The FIPS publications include:  FIPS PUB 5-2, Codes for Identification of States, the District of Columbia and the Outlying Areas of the United States, and Associated Areas  FIPS PUB 6-4, Counties and Equivalent Entities of the United States, Its Possessions, and Associated Areas  FIPS PUB 8-5, Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs)--including CMSAs, PMSAs, and NECMAs  FIPS PUB 55-3 , Codes for Named Populated Places, Primary County Divisions, and Other Locational Entities of the United States, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and the Pacific Island Territories  The Census Bureau uses the codes in FIPS PUB 55-3 to identify both legal and statistical entities for county subdivisions, places, and American Indian/Alaska Native areas. FIPS PUB 55-3 includes many more entity records than those for which the Census Bureau tabulates data. The FIPS 55 codes are state-based. American Indian reservations in  Geographic Entities 4- 5   more than one state will have a different FIPS 55 code for each state portion of the single reservation. The 1994, 1995, and 1997 versions of the TIGER/Line files do not contain the census codes for places, county subdivisions, and sub-MCDs that were available in earlier versions of the TIGER/Line files. A description of the Census Bureau's codes that are assigned to higher-level geographic entities (county subdivisions, sub-minor civil divisions, consolidated cities, and places) appears in the geographic identification coding scheme (GICS) product, TIGER/GICS. The TIGER/GICS contains FIPS and Census Bureau codes, names and attributes, and demographic data for the higherlevel geographic entities included in the 1990 census.

The TIGER/Line files use multiple fields to identify a series of legal and statistical AIANAs:  4-6 1997 TIGER/Line Files   Legal Entities  American Indian reservations (AIRs) are legal entities having boundaries established by treaty, statute, and/or executive or court order over which a federally recognized American Indian tribal group has jurisdiction. The areas identified as American Indian reservations include entities with other designations, such as pueblo, colony, and community. AIRs are identified by representatives of the reservations or tribes.  American Indian trust lands included in the census are the off-reservation lands associated with a specific tribe or a reservation held in trust by the Federal Government. They are identified by representatives of the reservations or tribes. Trust lands may be either tribal (held in trust for the tribe) or individual (held in trust for an individual member of the tribe). Trust lands are assigned the same codes as the associated reservation. Trust lands not associated with a reservation are assigned codes based on the tribal name. The TIGER/Line files did not previously distinguish between AIRs and trust lands because they shared the same code. Beginning with the 1994 TIGER/Line files, American Indian trust lands are flagged in a separate field (previously the Census ANRC field).  Alaska Native Regional Corporations (ANRCs) are corporate entities established by the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (PL 92-203) to conduct business and nonprofit operations for Alaska Natives. The 12 ANRCs have specific boundaries and cover the state of Alaska except for the Annette Islands Reserve (an American Indian reservation). Statistical Entities  Alaska Native village statistical areas (ANVSAs) are 1990 census statistical areas that delineate the settled area of each Alaska Native village (ANV). ANVs represent tribes, bands, clans, villages, communities, and associations that are recognized pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (PL 92-203), but do not have legally recognized boundaries. Officials of Alaska Native Regional Corporations (ANRCs) and other knowledgeable officials delineated the 1990 ANVSAs for the Census Bureau for the purpose of presenting census data for these entities.  Geographic Entities 4- 7    Tribal designated statistical areas (TDSAs) are geographic areas that were delineated for 1990 census data tabulation purposes by tribal officials of federally and state-recognized tribes outside of Oklahoma. TDSAs do not have a legally defined reservation or associated trust lands. They define areas that contain population under tribal jurisdiction and/or areas for which the tribe provides benefits and services. TDSAs are defined for data presentation purposes only.  Tribal jurisdiction statistical areas (TJSAs) are geographic areas delineated for 1990 census data tabulation purposes in Oklahoma by federally recognized tribes that do not have a legally defined reservation. TJSAs are areas defined only for data presentation purposes. They generally contain American Indian population over which one or more tribal governments have jurisdiction. They replace the single ""Historic Areas of Oklahoma"" (excluding UAs) recognized for the 1980 census.

Also, refer to FIPS PUB 55-3 or the Census Bureau's TIGER/GICS for a list of valid codes and entity names. The type of AIANA area can be identified either by the census code or by the FIPS 55 class code on each entity record in Record Type C. The range of census codes allocated to each AIANA and the valid FIPS 55 class code(s) associated with each are as follows: Type AIR TJSA ANVSA TDSA Census Code Range 0001 to 4989 5001 to 5989 6001 to 8989 9001 to 9589 Valid FIPS 55 Class D1, D2, D3, D4, D5 D6 E1, E2, E6 D6  Block Groups (BGs) Geographic BGs Block groups are clusters of blocks within the same census tract or BNA; they have the same first digit as their 3-digit block numbers. For example, blocks 101, 102, 103,..., 199 in census tract 1210.02 belong to BG 1. BGs never cross county or census tract/BNA boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of county subdivisions, places, UAs, VTDs, congressional districts, and AIANAs. BGs generally contain between 250 and 550 housing units. Each BG usually covers a contiguous area. Each census tract/BNA contains at least one BG. BGs are uniquely numbered within census tract/BNA. Tabulation BGs Tabulation block groups are geographic BGs split to present data for every unique combination of county subdivision, place, UA, VTD, congressional district, U/R, and AIANA shown in the data tabulation products.  Geographic Entities 4- 9   The TIGER/Line files do not have a separate BG data field. Data users can determine the geographic BG by using the first digit of the block number in combination with the 1990 state, county, and census tract/BNA number. Users can identify the tabulation BG by using the geographic BG in combination with the codes for the entities listed above. STF 1A and STF 3A present data for both geographic and tabulation BGs. Block Group Number Record Locations See the section, Census Blocks, in this chapter for record locations and field names. The BG is the compilation of all blocks with the same first digit of their block number in a specific 1990 state-county-census tract/BNA combination. All polygons have a non-blank BG number. The left- and right-side complete chain block numbers should not be blank except where they are located along the outside edge of the county boundary. The TIGER/ Line files do not contain codes for areas outside the county file. BGs have a valid range of 0 through 9. Some BGs beginning with a 0 are in coastal and Great Lakes water. Rather than extending the census tract/ BNA boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the three-mile territorial sea limit, the Census Bureau delineated some census tract/BNA boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore. The Census Bureau assigned a default census tract/BNA number of 0000 and block number of 099 to the offshore areas not included in regularly numbered census tract/ BNA areas.  Census Blocks Census blocks usually are small statistical areas bounded on all sides by visible features such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad tracks, and by invisible boundaries such as property lines, legal limits, and short imaginary extensions of streets and roads. Blocks never cross county or census tract/BNA boundaries. In rare instances, parts of a block may be discontiguous, but all parts of a tabulation block will be in the same geographic or governmental unit. Blocks are composed of one or more GT-polygons; that is, several GT-polygons can share the same block number. See Figures 4-2 and 4-3.  4-10 1997 TIGER/Line Files   Census Block Numbers Blocks are numbered uniquely within each 1990 state/county/census tract or BNA. A census block must be identified by a 3-character basic block number field and a 1-character block suffix field. The suffix field often is blank. The 3-character basic block number identifies the collection block used in the 1990 census field operations. The first digit of the basic block number identifies the BG. The Census Bureau refers to the combined basic 1990 collection block number and suffix (if a suffix exists) as the tabulation block number. The 1990 tabulation block numbers identified in Record Types 1, 3, A, and S have a 1-character suffix field. The suffix character is blank for whole 1990 collection blocks that also are tabulation blocks. Block numbers with suffixes usually represent collection blocks that are split in order to identify separate geographic entities that divide the original block. For example, when a city limit runs through collection block 101, the portion inside the city may be tabulated in block 101A and the portion outside the city in block 101B. The suffix letters A and B have no correlation to the location of the block portion to which they are assigned. In other words, in the example above, the portion of block 101 inside the city could have been assigned a suffix of B, and the portion outside the city, a suffix of A. There is no limit on the number of parts into which a block can be split. Water Blocks A 3-character basic block number that ends in 99 signifies water area. As there is only one number ending in 99 within a BG, many water polygons can have the same block number. Water blocks have suffixes if parts of the same block are located in different geographic entities. Rather than extending the census tract/BNA boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the three-mile limit, the Census Bureau closed off some census tract/BNA areas using boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore. The Census Bureau assigned a default census tract/ BNA number of 0000 and block number of 099 to the offshore areas.

Census maps and other data files do not display the block numbers for water areas. The principal purpose for census block numbers assigned to water areas is to identify all areas of the United States and its territories and to allocate the water areas to geographic entities. Water GT-polygons with the same block number may not be contiguous, but will be in the same geographic area or governmental unit. Changes to shorelines or boundaries made since the release of the 1990 Census TIGER/Line files altered or removed block boundary features between parts of some water blocks and changed the block numbers (the BG designator) for those blocks. Because the water blocks had no population or housing, the tabulation of the 1990 census was unaffected. Some water blocks in the 1990 Census TIGER/Line  files Supplemental CD-ROM may contain census block suffixes that do not match subsequent TIGER/Line file. Current Geography Record Types 1, 3, A, C, and S identify changes (both codes and boundaries) since the 1990 census tabulation for some geographic entities. These records do not show new block numbers. The Census Bureau continues to conduct its annual Boundary and Annexation Survey to identify changes to the boundaries of legal entities. However, the 1990 block numbers remain for new polygons created by the post-census boundary changes. The Census Bureau will not systematically update block numbering to reflect the current geographic boundaries until it prepares for Census 2000.

When first established, census tracts should have relatively homogeneous demographic characteristics. Generally, census tracts have a population size between 2,500 and 8,000 people, and average about 4,000 people. The local data users can delineate census tracts for special land uses, such as military installations and American Indian reservations.  Geographic Entities 4- 15   BNAs BNAs are statistical areas delineated by state agencies or the Census Bureau for counties without census tracts. The delineation of BNAs follows the same basic criteria as those for census tracts. Because BNAs appear more often in less populated counties, they may have fewer people than census tracts. Numbering The TIGER/Line files store census tract and BNA numbers in a 4-character basic number field and an optional 2-character suffix number field. In printed reports and on mapping products, the Census Bureau uses a decimal point (.) to separate the basic number from the suffix. However, in the TIGER/Line files and STF data products, the decimal point is implied. The basic number and the suffix appear together in a single 6-character field in Record Types 1, 3, A, and S. A basic number smaller than 1000 will contain leading zeros. Leading zeros are shown on machine-readable products, but are not shown in printed reports and on census maps since leading zeros are not part of the basic number. The TIGER/Line files use the right-most two characters in the census tract/BNA field for the suffix. These two characters are blank if the census tract/BNA number does not have a suffix. Suffixes smaller than 10 have a leading zero. For example, census tract 0077.01 is shown as 007701 in the TIGER/Line files. The Census Bureau uses suffixes to help identify census tract changes for comparison purposes. Local data users have an opportunity to review the existing census tracts before each census. If data users split a census tract, the split parts usually retain the basic number, but receive different suffixes. In a few counties, data users approve major changes to, and renumber, the census tracts. Changes to individual census tract boundaries usually do not result in census tract numbering changes. The Census Bureau documents all changes to census tract boundaries and numbers in the TIGER/Census Tract Comparability File (19801990). Data users are cautioned to examine the census tract boundaries or the comparability file before making comparisons between past data and 1990 data.  4-16 1997 TIGER/Line Files   Boundaries and Boundary Changes Census tract/BNA boundaries generally follow visible physical features and county boundaries. The census tract or BNA boundary may follow MCD and incorporated place boundaries in New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and the New England States (and occasionally other states) because the boundaries tend to be stable and locally known. In a few rare instances, a census tract or BNA may consist of discontiguous areas. These discontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves discontiguous. Census tracts were last defined in preparation for the 1990 census. Census tracts/BNAs must nest within a county. New census tracts/BNAs were created to accommodate updates and corrections to county boundaries following the assignment of block numbers in 1988. This was necessary because existing 1990 census tracts were in place for the 1990 census and could not be shifted. At the request of some local data users, the Census Bureau resolved a number of census tract boundary discrepancies. This explains some of the less populated census tracts and the census tracts with basic numbers or suffixes that are seemingly out of range for the county. The Census Bureau generally identified the revised census tracts/BNAs with a unique suffix ranging from .70 to .98 (e.g., 1234.98) so data users could easily determine which census tracts/BNAs were affected. The Census Bureau made these changes after the release of the TIGER/Line Precensus Files, 1990. The census tract boundaries follow legal county boundaries as of January 1, 1990. Because there have been state and/or county boundary changes since 1990, users are cautioned to only use 1990 state and county areas to identify census tracts/BNAs. Census tracts next will be defined for Census 2000. Relationship to Other Geographic Entities The census tracts and BNAs represent the same level of geography and share the same field in the TIGER/Line files. Census tracts or BNAs entirely cover a county. A county contains either census tracts or BNAs, but not a combination of both. Census BGs and blocks are uniquely numbered within census tracts and BNAs.

The leftand right-side complete chain census tract/BNA numbers are not blank except where they are located along the outside edge of the county boundary. The TIGER/Line files do not contain geographic codes for the area outside of the county file. The TIGER/Line files identify the boundary complete chains by placing a 1 in the single-side segment field in Record Type 1. The Census Bureau assigned a default census tract/BNA number of 0000 to some coastal and Great Lakes water rather than extend the census tract/ BNA boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the three-mile limit. The Census Bureau closed off some census tract/BNA areas along the shore-line or just offshore, and assigned the default census tract/BNA and special block numbers to the offshore water areas.  Counties and Statistically Equivalent Entities The first-order divisions of each state are counties for 48 states, parishes for Louisiana, and boroughs and census areas for Alaska. In addition, the Census Bureau treats the following entities as equivalents of counties for purposes of data presentation: independent cities in Maryland, Missouri, 4-18 1997 TIGER/Line Files   Nevada, and Virginia; the portion of Yellowstone National Park in Montana; ""District of Columbia"" for the District of Columbia; municipios in Puerto Rico; Islands in the Virgin Islands of the United States; and a variety of entities in the Pacific Island Territories. The TIGER/Line files contain several 3-character numeric fields identifying the FIPS county code for the 1990 census and the FIPS county codes for current entities. Each individual TIGER/Line file contains state and county code fields to uniquely identify its records. See Appendix A for a list of FIPS codes for county and county-equivalent areas.

They use a single field to identify the two functional types (legal and statistical) of county subdivisions. Record Type C contains all valid codes and entity names.  Geographic Entities 4- 19   Legal Entities Minor Civil Divisions (MCDs)  MCDs are legally defined subcounty areas such as towns (in eight states) and townships. MCDs occur in 28 states, Puerto Rico, and the Island Territories.  Some states have incorporated places that are not part of any MCD. These places also serve as primary legal subdivisions and have a unique FIPS MCD code that is the same as the FIPS place code. The TIGER/ Line files will show the same FIPS 55 code in the county subdivision field and the place field.  In New York and Maine, American Indian reservations (AIRs) exist outside the jurisdiction of any town (MCD) and thus also serve as MCD-equivalent entities. Statistical Entities Census County Divisions (CCDs) CCDs are areas delineated by state officials and local data users for statistical purposes. CCD boundaries usually follow visible features and in most cases, coincide with census tract or BNA boundaries. CCDs exist where: 1) There are no legally established minor civil divisions (MCDs). 2) The legally established MCDs do not have governmental or administrative purposes. 3) The boundaries of the MCDs change frequently. 4) The MCDs are not generally known to the public.  CCDs have been established for the following 21 states: Alabama Arizona California Colorado Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Kentucky Montana Nevada New Mexico Oklahoma Oregon South Carolina Tennessee Texas Utah Washington Wyoming  4-20 1997 TIGER/Line Files   Census Subareas Census subareas are subdivisions of boroughs and census areas, the county equivalent entities in Alaska. The state of Alaska and the Census Bureau cooperatively delineated the census subareas to serve as the statistical equivalents of MCDs. Unorganized Territories (UTs) For states with partial MCD coverage, the Census Bureau defines UTs for the non-MCD area. UTs are assigned county subdivision codes and names.

Congressional districts are numbered uniquely within state. The fields for the 106th and 108th congressional districts are blank. The current congressional district field always has a value other than blank for all polygons.

The county or MCD and the separately incorporated places within the consolidated city continue to exist. The Census Bureau classifies the separately incorporated places within the consolidated city as place entities and creates a separate place (remainder) record for the portion of the consolidated city not within any other place. Refer to the Places section in this chapter for additional information. Consolidated cities are represented in the TIGER/Line files by a 5-character numeric FIPS code. Record Type C has the complete list of valid codes and entity names.  4-22 1997 TIGER/Line Files   Consolidated City Code Record Locations Record Type C C C S Field Name FIPS ENTITY NAME FCCITY Description FIPS 55 Code Entity Type Name of Geographic Area FIPS 55 Code (Consolidated City), Current  Crews-of-Vessels Crews-of-vessels represent the population on military (including Coast Guard) and merchant ships; they do not include the inhabitants of houseboats or marinas. The census population tables show the vessels' population in a unique census tract/BNA and census block. A crews-of-vessels census tract/BNA and block appear on census maps as an anchor symbol with the census tract/BNA and block numbers, rather than as a delimited area. The location of the anchor symbol is arbitrary and reflects neither the location of the vessel(s) at the time of the census, nor the location of the crews-of-vessels census tract/ BNA and block as it appears in the TIGER/Line file. See the Census Tracts and Block Numbering Areas and the Census Blocks sections in this chapter for record locations and field names. Crews-of-vessels census tract/BNA numbers use the same basic census tract/BNA number as the nearby land census tract/BNA with which the vessel is associated, plus a suffix of 99, shown in decimal notation. For example, census tract 1234.99 is shown as 123499 in the TIGER/ Line files and other machine-readable products. Crews-of-vessels block numbers use the same basic block number as the associated land block in that census tract/BNA, plus a block suffix of Z; for example, block 901Z in census tract 1234.99. In such a situation, the related land block also receives a suffix, even though it may not be split by a boundary; for example, the addition of crews-of-vessels associated with the block 901 creates blocks 901A and 901Z. The Census Bureau does not use the Z census block suffix for any purpose other than the crewsof-vessels. Either the left or right census tract/BNA and census block identified in Record Type 1 will indicate the location to which the population is assigned. The census tract/BNA and census block for crews-of-vessels  Geographic Entities 4- 23   form an extremely small, triangular-shaped polygon requiring only one complete chain with a start node equal to the end node and two intermediate shape points. Based on the coordinates found on Record Types 1 and 2, the location of the census block is on the shore inside the land block with the same 3-digit collection block number, not in the water as shown on the census maps. The Census Bureau defines as zero, the area measurement enclosed by the special crews-of-vessels census tract/BNA and block.  Metropolitan Areas The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) designates metropolitan areas to serve as statistical areas around the larger population centers of the United States and Puerto Rico. Basically, a metropolitan area must contain an urbanized area delineated by the Census Bureau or an incorporated place with a population of 50,000 or more. Metropolitan areas consist of whole counties or county equivalents in most states; in New England the OMB defines metropolitan areas using MCDs. The metropolitan area consists of the central county, county equivalent, or MCD (in New England) and additional areas based on OMB criteria related to population density, population growth, and commuting data. There are three types of metropolitan areas. If a metropolitan area has a total population of less than 1,000,000, the area is designated a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). Metropolitan areas with a population of 1,000,000 or greater qualify for designation as a Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA) that is composed of smaller Primary Metropolitan Statistical Areas (PMSAs). This designation is not automatic; the OMB solicits local opinion to designate CMSAs and their component PMSAs. The TIGER/Line files now contain three different 4-character numeric fields to identify the FIPS code for each metropolitan area and to differentiate CMSAs and MSAs from PMSAs. The FIPS codes are from FIPS PUB 8. If the metropolitan area is a CMSA then a value exists in the CMSAMSA field identifying the CMSA and the value in the PMSA field identifies the PMSA. A blank CMSA field indicates the code in the PMSA  4-24 1997 TIGER/Line Files   field is for the MSA. Record Type C uses a single metropolitan area field to identify CMSAs, MSAs, and PMSAs. The Legal/Administrative/Statistical Area code identifies the type of metropolitan area. Metropolitan Area Code Record Locations Record Type C C C S S  Field Name MA ENTITY NAME CMSAMSA PMSA  Description FIPS Metropolitan Area Code Entity Type Name of Geographic Area FIPS Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area Code, Current FIPS Metropolitan Area Code, Current  Metropolitan Area Codes Metropolitan areas are identified using the 4-character numeric FIPS codes. Record Type C in the TIGER/Line files contains all the valid codes and entity names for CMSAs, MSAs, and PMSAs. The current metropolitan areas represent the latest OMB designations and not necessarily the metropolitan areas for which the Census Bureau tabulated data in the 1990 census. Record Type C shows both 1990 and current codes and names.  Places The TIGER/Line files use a single field to identify places that are legal entities, and places that are statistical entities. The FIPS place code uniquely identifies a place within a state. Legal Entities Incorporated Places Incorporated places are legal entities incorporated under individual state law. Places may extend across county and county subdivision boundaries. An incorporated place can be a city, town, borough, village, or rarely, undesignated. But, for census purposes, incorporated places exclude:  The boroughs in Alaska (treated as county equivalents)  Towns in the New England States, New York, and Wisconsin (treated as MCDs)  Geographic Entities 4- 25    The boroughs in New York (treated as MCDs)  The remainder portions of consolidated cities (statistical equivalents of incorporated places)  Statistical Entities Census Designated Places (CDPs) CDPs are recognizable communities or concentrations of population that are not incorporated places. CDPs may have a locally recognized name, but do not have legally defined corporate limits or corporate powers. The Census Bureau defines CDPs at the time of each decennial census in cooperation with state officials, AIR officials, and local data users. In Puerto Rico, CDPs are called comunidades or zonas urbana. Since CDPs are valid only for the presentation of decennial census data, CDP complete chain information is removed from the current geography contained on Record Types 1 and A, but remains with the 1990 geography contained on Record Type 3. This change occurred in the 1995 TIGER/Line files and will remain in effect until TIGER/Line files are released containing Census 2000 geographic areas. CDPs in Hawaii are an exception. The Census Bureau, in agreement with the state of Hawaii, does not recognize any incorporated places in Hawaii. Thus, its CDP complete chain information is retained on Record Type 1.  Consolidated City (Remainder) Portions Consolidated city (remainder) portions refer to the areas of a consolidated city not included in another incorporated place. For example, Columbus city, GA, is a consolidated city that includes the separately incorporated municipality of Bibb City town. The area of the consolidated city that is not in Bibb City town is assigned to Columbus city (remainder). The name always includes the ""(remainder)"" identifier. Legally incorporated places and CDPs are mutually exclusive and are identified in the same TIGER/Line field. Users of earlier versions of the TIGER/Line files without Record Type C will need to consult the publication GRF-N, FIPS PUB 55-3, or the Census Bureau's TIGER/ GICS to identify the list of valid codes and entity names, and to differentiate between the legal and statistical entities.  4-26 1997 TIGER/Line Files   Dependent and Independent Places Depending on the state, incorporated places are either dependent within, or independent of, county subdivisions, or there is a mixture of dependent and independent places in the state. Dependent places are part of the county subdivision; the county subdivision code of the place is the same as that of the underlying county subdivision(s), but is different from the FIPS place code. Independent places are separate from the adjoining county subdivisions and have their own county subdivision code (or codes if the place lies in multiple counties). These places also serve as primary county subdivisions. The TIGER/Line files will show the same FIPS 55 code in the FIPS county subdivision code field and the FIPS place code field for independent places. The only exception is if the place is independent of the MCDs in a state in which the FIPS MCD codes are in the 90000 range. Then, the FIPS MCD and FIPS place codes will differ. CDPs and remainder portions of consolidated cities (Class C8) always are dependent within county subdivisions. Corporate Corridors and Offset Corporate Boundaries A corporate corridor is a narrow, linear part of an incorporated place (or in a very few instances, another legal entity). The corporate corridor includes the street and/or right-of-way, or a portion of the street and/or right-ofway within the incorporated place. It excludes from the incorporated place those structures such as houses, apartments, or businesses, that front along the street or road; see Figure 4-4. A corporate limit offset boundary exists where the incorporated place lies on only one side of the street, and may include all or part of the street and/or the right-of-way. It does not include the houses or land that adjoin the side of the street with the corporate limit offset boundary. It is possible to have two or more corporate limit offset boundaries in the same street or right-of-way. In order to reduce the overprinting of symbols on the printed or plotted census maps, a corporate corridor was shown in earlier map versions by only one symbol along its center line rather than by a symbol that followed its outer boundary. Corporate limit offset boundaries use the same map symbology as non-offset boundaries. Figure 4-4 depicts corporate corridors and corporate offset limits.  Geographic Entities 4- 27   Figure 4-4 Corporate Corridors--Overview This diagram, using symbology typical of a census map, shows a corporate corridor linking the two larger areas of Place 38520 (shading has been added to highlight the actual area within the corporate limits). Part of the corporate limit along Orange St is an offset boundary. A corporate limit offset covers only one side of the street or right-of-way, not the entire street or right-of-way, as is the case with a corporate corridor.  Corporate Corridor Corporate Limit Offset  Orange St  Place 38520  Place 38520  Corporate Corridor  Place Boundary  4-28 1997 TIGER/Line Files   To facilitate address coding, the street name and address ranges are generally duplicated on complete chains with a CFCC of F11 (nonvisible offset boundary) or F12 (nonvisible corporate corridor). The duplicate street names for the F11 and F12 features are on Record Type 5 and the duplicate address ranges are on Record Type 6. However, Record Type 1 will not indicate that the street or right-of-way lies within a corporate corridor or offset boundary, or that the address ranges lie outside, and are encoded on either side, of the corporate corridor or offset boundary. When data users find duplicate address ranges where one of the duplicates is on a complete chain with a CFCC of F11 or F12, they should use this address range for address geocoding rather than the range on the street feature that has a CFCC beginning with A (see Figure 4-5). Likewise, use the street name and address ranges on the related street feature (CFCC beginning with A ) for mapping or vehicle routing.

This program was designed to provide 1990 census data tabulations for school districts. The program continues to be updated and the updates are reflected in the subsequent versions of the TIGER/Line  files.  Geographic Entities 4- 29   Figure 4-5 Corporate Corridors--Detail View This diagram shows a detailed view of a corporate corridor that runs along Corporate Dr. The complete chains with the census feature class code (CFCC) F12 form the corporate corridor and have geocoding address ranges that mirror the address ranges of Corporate Dr. The geocoding address ranges exist so structures are coded to the correct block and place. For example, 311 Corporate Dr is located outside the corporate limits. Using the address range from Corporate Dr to geocode the structure will incorrectly code the structure to Place 69012. The corporate corridor (CFCC F12) splits City Line Ave at one end of the corridor and the boundary feature (F10) at the other end, creating four short complete chains. The Census TIGER data base software compensates by moving the address ranges from these short complete chains located inside the corporate corridor to complete chains outside the corridor so they geocode to the correct geographic entity.  This corporate corridor complete chain (CFCC F12) has a geocoding feature identifier (Corporate Dr on Record Types 4 and 5) and an address range (307-319 on Record Type 6).  These short complete chains are part of City Line Ave and have no address ranges.  309 303  311 319  Place 69012 Corporate Dr 307 - 319 306 - 320  Place 69012 306 These short complete chains (CFCC F10) are created to define corporate corridor polygons.  312  320  This corporate corridor complete chain (CFCC F12) has a geocoding feature identifier (Corporate Dr on Record Types 4 and 5) and an address range (306-320 on Record Type 6).

Since 1995, the intermediate level has become defunct and is no longer a separate level. The elementary and secondary levels of a school district can overlap each other because they represent different segments of the school-age population; for example, a secondary school district could cover parts of several elementary school districts.

Beikman and published by the US Geological  Survey.  The map is a regional summary of geologic formations and units that can be shown  cartographically at 1:2,500,000.  This digital dataset includes all (184) map units from the  original map.  182 are geologic units; the others are polygons for large glaciers and lakes.  This coverage is not intended to be a complete representation of the printed geologic map.  It  does NOT include the following features:  faults, locations of volcanoes or volcanic vents,  the map explanation, correlation charts or description of map units.      Purpose:       This coverage is intended to provide digital features (polygons) representing generalized geologic units in Alaska for use in small-scale spatial anlysis (statewide) with other coverages such as vegetation types, soils, geochemical values etc.     Supplemental_Information:       Procedures_Used The linework was digitized from a paper copy of the 1980 map at the EROS Data Center in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and the resulting coverage (ARC/INFO version 5) transferred to the EROS Alaska Field Office.  Although the latitude/ longitude grid shown on the published Beikman map was an Albers equal area projection, the geologic polygons were not in the same projection since they did not align with an Albers equal area coverage of the Alaskan coastline.  A rubber-sheeting operation was performed on the geologic polygons using points along the coastline and major rivers to match an Albers equal area projection.  In 1997, this coverage was imported into ARC/INFO version 7.0.4, and edited by the Alaska Section, Geologic Divsion, USGS.  Map unit (polygon)locations and attributes were checked by three reviewers, by comparing a printed copy of the coverage to the original map.  Metadata were collected using document.aml v.  7.1.1, distributed by ESRI, Inc.   Revisions: None completed or planned.

The map emphasizes metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks that were deposited along the southern margin of the Superior craton and were later deformed during continental collision at about 1850 Ma. The area includes the famous iron ranges of the south shore region of the Lake Superior district.  Base maps, both as digital raster graphics (DRG) and digital line graphs (DLG) are also provided for the convenience of users.  The map has been compiled from many individual studies, mostly by USGS researchers, completed during the past 50 years, including many detailed (1:24,000 scale) geologic maps.  Data was compiled at 1:100,000 scale and preserves most of the details of source materials.  This product is a preliminary release of the geologic map data bases during ongoing studies of the geology and metallogeny of the Penokean continental margin.  Files are provided in three formats: Federal Spatial Data Transfer format (SDTS), Arc export format (.e00) files, and Arc coverages. All files can be accessed directly from the CD-ROM using either ARC/INFO 7.1.2 or later or Arc View 3.0 or later software.  ESRI's Arc Explorer, a free GIS data viewer available at the web site:  <http://www.esri.com/software/arcexplorer/index.html>  also provides display and querying capability for these files.     Purpose:       The digital map is meant to provide accurate, accessible, and interactive information concerning the ongoing studies of the geology and metallogeny of the Penokean Continental Margin of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and Northern Wisconsin.

Minor errors become visible at larger scales.  Attribute accuracy was tested by manual comparison of the source with hard copy plots and/or symbolized display of the map data on an interactive computer graphic system.         Logical_Consistency_Report:       All internal polygons were tested for closure with vendor software and were checked on hard copy plots.  All line intersections end where intended.  All polygon areas are described with the exception of the area which represents Lake Superior.  Overshoots and undershoots, as well as small polygons and short lines have been corrected or deleted as needed.     Completeness_Report:   none applicable   Positional_Accuracy:         Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:         Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:       The accuracy of these digital data is based upon their compilation to USGS Digital Line Graph base maps that meet National Map Accuracy Standards.  The difference in positional accuracy between the map unit boundaries in the field and their digitized map locations is unknown.  The faults coverage is aligned to within approximately 20 meters (ground distance) of the alignment of the associated bedrock geology contacts.

The mylar sheets, containing line art of the geologic polygons, faults, and linear features of the region and with tic marks acting as control points at the corners of the 100,000 scale quadrangles bounding neatlines, were then scanned using an Eagle 4080 C scanner into Scansmith Scan-C version 4.2 as lineart at 300 dpi.  Within Scansmith View 3.6 the digital line art, now rasterized, was cleaned up with erasing and drawing tools and saved as a tiff image.  Within Arc-Info 7.1.1 this tiff image was registered using the bounding coordinates (in decimal degrees) of the corresponding 100,000 scale quadrangles that the geology of the area was drawn upon.  The registered tiff image was then rectified and converted to a grid and then a line coverage.  The tics of the line coverage were aligned with the control points drawn on the scanned image.  These tics were defined by entering the correct coordinates in decimal degrees, and in this way the scanned image, now a line coverage, was stretched into real world coordinates.  The line coverage was built to establish topology and then splined to clean up errors that were created in the image to coverage, raster to vector conversion process.  For running spline to straighten wavy lines a grain tolerance of 0.003 was commonly employed, however, each individual coverage demanded individual attention.  The faults and other linear features of the coverage were selected and removed from the line coverage, placed into a second coverage that would remain a line coverage, and then attributed.   The remaining lines of the original coverage were then converted into a polygon coverage representing the spatial distribution of the bedrock geology of the area and each polygon was then attributed.  In this way twelve sheets, the boundaries of which were defined by the entire or, in some cases, parts of the areas, of the 30x60 minute series 1:100,000 scale topographic quadrangle sheets.  Lines representing the geologic melange of the area, were processed and entered into Arc-Info as line coverages, later to be converted into both line and polygon coverages.  The twelve bounding 100,000 scale quadrangles were L'Anse, Iron River, Wakefield, Ironwood, Marquette, Gwinn, and Escanaba, with parts of Solon Springs, Spooner,  Park Falls, Iron Mountain, and Rhinelander also used.  All of these individual polygon and line coverages were united, in the case of the polygon coverages with the command mapjoin, and in the case of the line coverages with append.  Corresponding lines and polygon boundaries were matched between adjacent coverages in the most exact manner possible, mostly graphically matching up the lines, though in some cases rubbersheeting using the command adjust was necessary.  Within Excel a spreadsheet containing further parameters of the polygon coverages was created.  These parameters added to our definition of the polygon coverage.  They were: unit_name , map_symbol, explanation, era, period, subperiod, supergroup, group, formation/pluton, member , age, major_rocktype, major_subtype, major_lithology, minor_1_rk_type, minor_1_subtype , minor_1_lith, minor_2_rk_type, minor_2_subtype, minor_2_lith, province, terrane, subterrane, province_age, original_prov, original_subprov, orig_prov_age, environment, and tectonic_setting.  These attributes and the corresponding data and information associated with them for the individual polygons were converted into a comma delimited text file and then a look up table within Tables.  The look up table was then joined to the polygon attribute table of the polygon coverage to create the final attributed polygon coverage.  Digital Line Graphic hydrology (both polygon and line), and transportation data from the 100,000 scale quadrangles listed above was downloaded from the web and merged within Arc-View 3.1 and then added to the coverage.  Digital Raster Graphic images from the 100,000 scale quadrangle maps were likewise downloaded, then their edges were clipped and they were entered into the project as a catalogue of images.

The table contains attributes that address the following four catagories: 1.) STRATIGRAPHIC INFORMATION classifying geologic units according to stratigraphic position,2.) LITHOLOGIC INFORMATION providing three levels of detail (rock type, subtype, and lithology) to allow classification of rock types in both general and specific detail.  The classification used is a draft classification scheme being developed by the USGS for digital portrayal of lithologic information.  Information is provided for both the major lithologic type for each unit and as many as two additional significant lithologies,  3.) TECTONIC INFORMATION providing information on various aspects of the formation and deformation of units, and 4.) Fault type which classifies faults by type and age.

Title:       Digital Geologic Map of the Penokean Continental Margin, Northern Michigan and Wisconsin     Abstract:       The data on this CD consist of geographic information system (GIS) coverages and tabular data on the geology of Early Proterozoic and Archean rocks in part of the Early Proterozoic Penokean orogeny. The map emphasizes metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks that were deposited along the southern margin of the Superior craton and were later deformed during continental collision at about 1850 Ma. The area includes the famous iron ranges of the south shore region of the Lake Superior district.  Base maps, both as digital raster graphics (DRG) and digital line graphs (DLG) are also provided for the convenience of users.  The map has been compiled from many individual studies, mostly by USGS researchers, completed during the past 50 years, including many detailed (1:24,000 scale) geologic maps.  Data was compiled at 1:100,000 scale and preserves most of the details of source materials.  This product is a preliminary release of the geologic map data bases during ongoing studies of the geology and metallogeny of the Penokean continental margin.  Files are provided in three formats: Federal Spatial Data Transfer format (SDTS), Arc export format (.e00) files, and Arc coverages. All files can be accessed directly from the CD-ROM using either ARC/INFO 7.1.2 or later or Arc View 3.0 or later software.  ESRI's Arc Explorer, a free GIS data viewer available at the web site:  <http://www.esri.com/software/arcexplorer/index.html>  also provides display and querying capability for these files.

How are geographic features stored in the data set?  This is a vector data set.    What coordinate system is used to represent geographic features?  Horizontal positions are specified in geographic coordinates, that is, latitude and longitude. Latitudes are given to the nearest 0.0000003. Longitudes are given to the nearest 0.0000003. Latitude and longitude values are specified in Decimal Degrees.   The horizontal datum used is North American Datum of 1927.  The ellipsoid used is Clarke 1866.  The semi-major axis of the ellipsoid used is 6378206.4.  The flattening of the ellipsoid used is 1/294.98.         How does the data set describe geographic features?     pcmgeolg.pat Polygon attribute table for pcgeo polygon coverage.  The table contains attributes that address the following four catagories: 1.) STRATIGRAPHIC INFORMATION classifying geologic units according to stratigraphic position,2.) LITHOLOGIC INFORMATION providing three levels of detail (rock type, subtype, and lithology) to allow classification of rock types in both general and specific detail.  The classification used is a draft classification scheme being developed by the USGS for digital portrayal of lithologic information.  Information is provided for both the major lithologic type for each unit and as many as two additional significant lithologies,  3.) TECTONIC INFORMATION providing information on various aspects of the formation and deformation of units, and 4.) Fault type which classifies faults by type and age.

Date: 1999 (process 1 of 1)   The Geology of the Penokean Continental Margin was compiled manually on mylar at 100,000 scale using existing printed maps of the area at various scales.  The mylar sheets, containing line art of the geologic polygons, faults, and linear features of the region and with tic marks acting as control points at the corners of the 100,000 scale quadrangles bounding neatlines, were then scanned using an Eagle 4080 C scanner into Scansmith Scan-C version 4.2 as lineart at 300 dpi.  Within Scansmith View 3.6 the digital line art, now rasterized, was cleaned up with erasing and drawing tools and saved as a tiff image.  Within Arc-Info 7.1.1 this tiff image was registered using the bounding coordinates (in decimal degrees) of the corresponding 100,000 scale quadrangles that the geology of the area was drawn upon.  The registered tiff image was then rectified and converted to a grid and then a line coverage.  The tics of the line coverage were aligned with the control points drawn on the scanned image.  These tics were defined by entering the correct coordinates in decimal degrees, and in this way the scanned image, now a line coverage, was stretched into real world coordinates.  The line coverage was built to establish topology and then splined to clean up errors that were created in the image to coverage, raster to vector conversion process.  For running spline to straighten wavy lines a grain tolerance of 0.003 was commonly employed, however, each individual coverage demanded individual attention.  The faults and other linear features of the coverage were selected and removed from the line coverage, placed into a second coverage that would remain a line coverage, and then attributed.   The remaining lines of the original coverage were then converted into a polygon coverage representing the spatial distribution of the bedrock geology of the area and each polygon was then attributed.  In this way twelve sheets, the boundaries of which were defined by the entire or, in some cases, parts of the areas, of the 30x60 minute series 1:100,000 scale topographic quadrangle sheets.  Lines representing the geologic melange of the area, were processed and entered into Arc-Info as line coverages, later to be converted into both line and polygon coverages.  The twelve bounding 100,000 scale quadrangles were L'Anse, Iron River, Wakefield, Ironwood, Marquette, Gwinn, and Escanaba, with parts of Solon Springs, Spooner,  Park Falls, Iron Mountain, and Rhinelander also used.  All of these individual polygon and line coverages were united, in the case of the polygon coverages with the command mapjoin, and in the case of the line coverages with append.  Corresponding lines and polygon boundaries were matched between adjacent coverages in the most exact manner possible, mostly graphically matching up the lines, though in some cases rubbersheeting using the command adjust was necessary.  Within Excel a spreadsheet containing further parameters of the polygon coverages was created.  These parameters added to our definition of the polygon coverage.  They were: unit_name , map_symbol, explanation, era, period, subperiod, supergroup, group, formation/pluton, member , age, major_rocktype, major_subtype, major_lithology, minor_1_rk_type, minor_1_subtype , minor_1_lith, minor_2_rk_type, minor_2_subtype, minor_2_lith, province, terrane, subterrane, province_age, original_prov, original_subprov, orig_prov_age, environment, and tectonic_setting.  These attributes and the corresponding data and information associated with them for the individual polygons were converted into a comma delimited text file and then a look up table within Tables.  The look up table was then joined to the polygon attribute table of the polygon coverage to create the final attributed polygon coverage.  Digital Line Graphic hydrology (both polygon and line), and transportation data from the 100,000 scale quadrangles listed above was downloaded from the web and merged within Arc-View 3.1 and then added to the coverage.  Digital Raster Graphic images from the 100,000 scale quadrangle maps were likewise downloaded, then their edges were clipped and they were entered into the project as a catalogue of images.

How reliable are the data; what problems remain in the data set?     How well have the observations been checked?  The original manually created hard copy maps on mylar used as the basis for this digital version of the map were compiled at a scale of 1:100,000; therefore, the limiting scale for viewing and displaying this digital map is also 1:100,000.  Minor errors become visible at larger scales.  Attribute accuracy was tested by manual comparison of the source with hard copy plots and/or symbolized display of the map data on an interactive computer graphic system.    How accurate are the geographic locations?  The accuracy of these digital data is based upon their compilation to USGS Digital Line Graph base maps that meet National Map Accuracy Standards.  The difference in positional accuracy between the map unit boundaries in the field and their digitized map locations is unknown.  The faults coverage is aligned to within approximately 20 meters (ground distance) of the alignment of the associated bedrock geology contacts.    How accurate are the heights or depths?     Where are the gaps in the data?  What is missing?  none applicable    How consistent are the relationships among the observations, including topology?  All internal polygons were tested for closure with vendor software and were checked on hard copy plots.  All line intersections end where intended.  All polygon areas are described with the exception of the area which represents Lake Superior.  Overshoots and undershoots, as well as small polygons and short lines have been corrected or deleted as needed.        How can someone get a copy of the data set?

GTOPO30 is a global digital elevation model (DEM) with a horizontal grid spacing of 30 arc seconds (approximately 1 kilometer). GTOPO30 was derived from several raster and vector sources of topographic information.  It was developed between 1993 and 1996 through a collaborative effort led by staff at the U.S. Geological Survey's EROS Data Center (EDC).  The following organizations participated by contributing funding or source data: the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the United Nations Environment Programme/Global Resource Information Database (UNEP/GRID), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the Instituto Nacional de Estadistica Geografica e Informatica (INEGI) of Mexico, the Geographical Survey Institute (GSI) of Japan, Manaaki Whenua Landcare Research of New Zealand, and the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR).     Purpose:       The Shaded Relief image was developed to portray the terrain of North America.  It is intended for visual purposes only.  The original GTOPO30 data must be used for conducting analysis and determining elevation values.

The tiles were ingested into Arc/INFO with the IMAGEGRID command.  The resulting grids were combined into a single grid with the MERGE function.  This grid was then projected into the Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area projection.  The HILLSHADE command was used to create a shaded relief image, with a sun elevation of 45, sun azimuth of 315, and vertical scaling factor of 10x.

The 3-band TIFF image was converted to 3 GRID layers, with a GRID stack used to ensure that the bands are displayed in the proper order.  The stack is merely a list of the bands in sequential order.  Ocean areas were coded as NULL in the original image.  These pixels were changed to the appropriate ocean RGB values using the GRID command CON: new_band_n = con(isnull(old_band_n), color_n, old_band_n) where n = bands 1-3.  The western edge of the image was extended by resetting the grid bounding rectangle to match that of the National Atlas of the United States WWW application bounding rectangle using the GRID command setwindow -6087129, -2783739, 4278871, 4489261, and copying the bands into new grid bands.  The null cells in the extended area were converted to ocean RGB values using CON.  The resultant bands were converted to TIFF format using the command GRIDIMAGE to create the final TIFF file, SHDRLFI020L.TIF with an accompanying .TFW world file.

Overview_Description:    Entity_and_Attribute_Overview:  This is a collection of GPS point locations where invasive exotic plants were seen by volunteers within 30 feet  while walking or driving a trail, road, or other corridor.  Attribute fields were created by Andy Brown and Jack Ranney of the Southern Appalachian Man And the Biosphere program for the Southern Appalachian Volunteer Environmental Monitoring project.  Attribute information was supplied by volunteers.  Attribute information was then standardized by the NBII SAIN GIS members.  Attribute information was revised between 2002 and 2003 data.

The shapefile has locations for eight types of abandoned mines which are  Copper, Graphite, Iron, Lead, Mica, Manganese, Uranium and Zinc. There  are 461 abandoned mine locations in the database and they are mapped at  a scale of 1:24,000.   The abandoned mines data is prepared for distribution as an ESRI shapefile.  The shape file is combined with an ArcView Legend file called mines.avl  and FGDC compliant metadata in compressed 'zip' file for delivery over the  Internet. The shape file is a point GIS data set with associated database  files. The metadata file is in hypertext markup language (html) format.         Purpose:   To provide locations and information on abandoned mines in New Jersey.         Supplemental_Information:   The points in the shapefile represent a general location of the mines and  their workings. Some of the mines have workings more extensive than depicted  by the point in the shapefile, such as numerous shafts, entrances etc. that  extend farther out than where the point location is shown in the shapefile.  Also, some of the mines have been covered over and are not visible from the  surface. For the most current information on the conditions of the abandoned  iron mines see the reports from the New Jersey Department of Labor, Division  of Mine Safety in the references section. The reports are numbered 16-24 and  provide information on the general condition and safety of the iron mines.  Please note some of the mines in this shapefile may not be listed in the mine  safety reports.

In addition, the data is used in the National Atlas of              the United States for geographic display and analysis at the national              level, and for large regional areas. The data should be displayed              and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data. No              responsibility is assumed by the U.S. Geological Survey in the use              of these data.              Supplemental_Information:               The geographical information in the Abandoned Mines Land Inventory              System (AMLIS) is a point representing each Problem Area. For many              Problem Areas the point is the latitude and longitude of the southeast              corner of the USGS quadrangle in which the Problem Area is located.              For others it is the center of the Problem Area. For the latest information              on Problems Areas, see the AMLIS system at: < http://www.osmre.gov/aml/inven/zamlis.htm >                                       Time_Period_of_Content:                                  Time_Period_Information:                                              Range_of_Dates/Times:                                                          Beginning_Date:  198308                     Ending_Date:  199812                                                                         Currentness_Reference:  ground condition                           Status:                                  Progress:  Complete             Maintenance_and_Update_Frequency:  Irregular                           Spatial_Domain:                                  Bounding_Coordinates:                                              West_Bounding_Coordinate:  -159.603                 East_Bounding_Coordinate:  -71.466                 North_Bounding_Coordinate:  70.500                 South_Bounding_Coordinate:  28.770                                                     Keywords:                                  Theme:                                              Theme_Keyword_Thesaurus:  None                 Theme_Keyword:  Abandoned Mine Land Problem                 Theme_Keyword:  Reclamation                 Theme_Keyword:  Coal mine related problem                 Theme_Keyword:  Coal mining                 Theme_Keyword:  Public health                 Theme_Keyword:  Safety                 Theme_Keyword:  Public Welfare                 Theme_Keyword:  Mines                 Theme_Keyword:  Coal                                       Place:                                              Place_Keyword_Thesaurus:                   U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995, Countries, Dependencies,                  Areas of Special Sovereignty, and Their Principal Administrative                  Divisions (Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 10-4):                  Washington, D.C., National Institute of Standards and Technology.

Completeness_Report:           Not all coal related problems are included in the inventory. In most          cases, States and Indian tribes are responsible for finding problems and          entering them into the Abandoned Mine Land (AML) Inventory. Some have          chosen not to inventory all their problems, especially if they have a          great many problems already in the inventory. Also, not all damage to          lands and water by past coal mining qualifies for inclusion in the            inventory. To be included as high priority, problems must pose a threat            to human health, safety, or welfare.

In                  recent years the computer system use to store and manipulate the                  data, AMLIS, performs a check to see that the latitude and longitude                  data entered into the system are in the correct county. Data entered                  before this check was added may be in the wrong county. Also,                  a problem may be in one county and the southeast corner of the                  quadrangle containing the problem in another county. Problem Areas                  shown as polygons were digitized from hand-drawn maps. The boundary                  of a Problem Area is often a judgment call made by the AML Reclamation                  Specialist preparing the map.

These DLGs are produced from the largest scale topographic quadrangle maps available, are usually the USGS 7.5- minute, 1:24,000 -scale topographic maps for the contiguous United States, Hawaii, and the Virgin Islands. Large-scale DLGs also are produced from 1:25,000 - and 1:63,360-scale maps for Alaska and 1:30,000-scale maps for Puerto Rico. The DLG data are being collected for all 50 States, and the 1:24,000-scale series eventually provide comple te national coverage.

Geospatial Data Standard a. Standard Name and Steward Information SDTS - Spatial Data Transfer Standard The SDTS was approved in July 1992 as Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 173. The standard allows the exchange of digital spatial data between different computer systems. It provides a solution to the problem of spatial data transfer from the conceptual level to the details of physical file encoding. Transfer of spatial data involves modeling spatial data concepts, data structures, and logical physical file structures. FIPS - Federal Information Processing Standard The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is responsible for developing standards, guidelines, and associated methods and techniques for computer systems, including those needed to assure the cost-effective security and privacy of sensitive information in U.S. Federal computer systems. NIST adopts and publicizes U.S. FIPS standards under the provisions of Section 111(d) of the U.S. Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 as amended by the Computer Security Act of 1987. b. c.

Acquired Data Structure 1. Geospatial Data Format a. Format (raster, vector, etc.) The Large-Scale DLG data files are available in two distribution formats: Spatial Data Transfer Standard (SDTS), and Optional. The Optional format is available ""at cost"" on various magnetic media in addition to CD- ROM through the Earth Science Information Center address provided below. Large-scale DLG files are available in optional and SDTS formats. These files have been compressed with the GNU gzip utility. If you do not have access to gzip, the FTP server will uncompress the file as you retrieve it. For a complete explanation of the Large-Scale DLG format see the USGS National Mapping Program, Technical Instructions, Data User's Guide 1 ""Digital Line Graphs from 1:24,000 -Scale Maps"". For details about the SDTS format see the ""DLG- 3 SDTS Transfer Description"" draft document.

Data Extent The United States and its territories d. Horizontal and Vertical Resolution The data are either manually digitized using equipment with a resolution of 0.001 inch and an absolute accuracy of from 0.003 to 0.005 inch or are scanned on an automatic device with a resolution of 0.0013 -inch (30 points per millimeter). e. Absolute Horizontal and Vertical Accuracy Horizontal positional accuracy is based upon the use of USGS source quadrangles, which are compiled to meet National Map Accuracy Standards (NMAS). NMAS horizontal accuracy requires that at least 90 percent of points tested are within 0.02 inches of the true position. The digital data are estimated to contain a horizontal positional error of less than or equal to 0.003 inches standard error in the two component directions relative to the source quadrangle. Vertical positional accuracy is based upon the use of USGS source quadrangles, which are compiled to meet National Map Accuracy Standards (NMAS). NMAS vertical accuracy requires that at least 90 percent of well-defined points tested be within one half contour interval of the correct value. Comparison to the graphic source is used as control to assess digital positional accuracy. f. Nominal Scale 1:24,000 g. Horizontal and Vertical Datum The horizontal datum is the North American Datum (NAD) 27. The vertical datum is mean sea level. h. Projection UTM i.

Geospatial Data Structure DIRECTORY STRUCTURE The directory structure for the Large-Scale DLG FTP account is defined as follows: A -Z/mapname_STATE/layer/version where: A -Z Mapname STATE Layer Version = = = = = The The The The The first character of the map name name of the Large-Scale map two character state code used to for duplicate map names category of data (such as hydrography or transportation) version of data (1-current; 2-historical)  Example: B/bismarck_ND/boundaries/version_1 is the location for the boundary layer of the Bismarck, ND quadrangle. A ll files for each layer are contained under the layers directory. For more information see FILE EXTENT and DATA FORMAT sections of this readme. FILE EXTENT SDTS transfers are stored as compressed ""tar"" archive files. Each transfer contains a complete set of files, for a specific layer and version, covering a quadrangle. The transfer naming convention is as follows: XXX.layer.V.sdts.tar.gz. XXX layer V sdts tar gz = a unique quadrangle identifier; which consists of quad SE coordinates preceded by a D, = data category name abbreviation (such as ""pl"" for public land) followed by 0 (zero) and ""s"" or ""f"" (""s"" is for 7.5- minute and ""f"" is for 15 - minute) = file version (1-current; 2-historical) = denotes that the data is in SDTS format = represents ""tar"" file = refers to ""gzip"" compression  The ""tar"" files have been compressed to speed up the download. You will need to decompress the "".gz"" files before untarring the SDTS files. For information about tar and unzip see the FILE COMPRESSION section of this ""README"".  Railroads  5   You must download the Master Data Dictionary (MDD), (00MASTERDD_LRG.SDTS) Version 3.0, which is meant to be used in conjunction with a Large Scale (DLG- 3) SDTS transfer to form a fully compliant SDTS/Topological Vector Profile (TVP) t ransfer. The MDD can be found in this directory as a compressed tar file, (00MASTERDD_LRG.SDTS.tar.gz), or as separate uncompressed files in the 00MASTERDD_LRG.SDTS directory. Please refer to the ""README"" file found at data/DLG/LARGE_SCALE/00MASTERDD_LRG.S DTS for more MDD information. ***** PLEASE NOTE THAT YOU MUST HAVE THE MASTER DATA ***** DICTIONARY AT THE SAME DIRECTORY LEVEL AS THE DATA. Unzipping, then untarring SDTS data creates several files all having a .DDF extension. Refer to ""DLG-3 SDTS Transfer Description"" draft document for details about the SDTS format. It may be found at the SDTS information ftp site in two formats. Word Perfect - ftp://sdts.er.usgs.gov/pub/sdts/datasets/tvp/dlg3/dlg3.wp Post Script - ftp://sdts.er.usgs.gov/pub/sdts/datasets/tvp/dlg3/dlg3.ps FILE COMPRESSION The SDTS transfers are stored as compressed ""tar"" archive files. Each transfer is comprised of several files, which are combined with the Unix ""tar"" command and compressed using the GNU ""gzip"" utility. To extract t he SDTS modules, the following UNIX command could be used: gunzip < Railroads.sdts.tar.gz | tar xvBf In MSDOS, the command is: gzip - d Railroads.sdts.gz WARNING! Some uncompression utilities automatically default to ""Smart TAR CR/LF translation"". This setting must NOT be used as it will introduce errors in the data! (See ""FTP SITES"" for a list of places where DOS and MAC versions of tar can be downloaded.) Note: If you do not have access to gzip, the FTP server will uncompress the files as you retrieve them if you omit the gz extension. For example, in a ftp session, to retrieve the file ""D4212204_bd0s.1.sdts.tar.gz"" without compression, type: ""get D4212204_bd0s.1.sdts.tar"" Note that the uncompressed files are typically five times larger than the compressed versions and will take five times longer to transmit. Most web browsers will allow FTP retrieval as well. For a list of gzip sites see ""FTP SITES"".

Technical Issues a. Tiling Original data is primarily from 1:24,000 USGS topographic quadrangles ( published as 7.5 - minute ). This is changed to a county tiling. b. Compression None c. Scale 1:24,000 d. Tonal Matching None e. Edge- matching Validation software provides for checking the edges of each quadrangle against the edges of the four adjacent quadrangles. Each edge of a DLG- 3 is checked for positional and attribute matching along the neatlines of the adjoining DLG- 3 cells, provided that the surrounding data cells are available at the time the DLG- 3 is entered into the National Digital Cartographic Data Base (NDCDB).  4. Quality Control a. Procedures The Railroads file is verified against the Digital Raster Graph and the Digital Ortho Quadrangle to ensure an accuracy rate of at least 95%. b. Acceptance Criteria See above.  5. Data Steward a.

Resource Requirements 1. Hardware and Software To acquire the Cadastral data, it requires a UNIX or NT machine with approximately 50Mb of disk.  2. Staffing This will vary depending on the size of the county data.  Railroads  14   D. Integratio n Cost 1. Hardware and Software In order to reformat, reproject, and tile the data, the USDA requires: Arc/Info on UNIX or NT platform Arcview on NT 1 GB disk  2. Staffing The procedure is currently not 100% automated. If it were automated, this procedure would require personnel to check the results of the procedure and annotate the data. A rough estimate for fully automating the procedure is one programming staff member for 5 - 10 days. The automated procedure would require approximately 1/2 - 1 1/2 days to ru n. To generate maps for the US and territories with no automation, it would require approximately two staff members, familiar with ESRI software, for five days.  III.  Delivery A. Specifications 1.

ATTRIBUTE CODING This standard applies primarily to the collection of Digital Line Graphs (DLGs) from maps. Content standards for digital revision of maps and DLGs are defined in the Standards for 1:24,000-scale Digital Line Graphs and Quadrangle Maps. Maps convey a great deal of information and representing real world features and relationships symbolically is not a simple process. Digitizing maps and encoding the resulting data using 7 digit attribute codes adds yet another level of interpretation. Since DLG collection is a map interpretation process, it is not possible to provide absolute rules and guidelines to account for all possible situations. This standard does, however, provide information that will allow reasonable decisions to be made about how to encode most of the information shown on the map. A certain amount of variability is unavoidable and, in fact, acceptable. While the goal is to limit variability as much as possible, it is just as important to understand that some questions will have more than one ""correct"" answer. Some features on the maps will not be collected in the DLG. These fall into two main categories: features which have been shown on the map, but for which content requirements have changed over time, and features that were incorrectly shown on the map in the first place. Some features on the maps which seem anomalous, may, in fact, be just that and should not be collected. Therefore, map content must be evaluated based on current standards. For example, piles, dolphins, stumps, or snags will appear on topographic editions originally compiled before 1961. These features are now required only on topographic-bathymetric editions and, therefore, are not collected when shown on topographic editions. With the expanded definition and use of built-up area tint, many features within built-up areas are not collected. Examples of anomalous features include sheep crossing, ship to shore telephone outlet, diabase dike, and mushroom sheds (which could be collected as general case building). For some quadrangles, USGS has produced provisional edition maps. Map content generally is the same as for standard edition topographic maps, but modified symbolism and production procedures have been used to expedite completion of national large-scale topographic map coverage. The maps reflect a provisional rather than a finished appearance. For most map features and type, the original manuscripts which are prepared when the map is compiled from aerial photographs, including hand lettering, serve as the final copy for printing. The number of names and descriptive labels shown on provisional maps is different than that shown on standard 07/95 General Principles 3.0-1   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding editions. Symbolism and symbol sizes on provisional editions vary more than on standard editions. For some quadrangles, USGS has produced orthophotomaps, rather than conventional standard edition topographic maps. An orthophotomap combines cartographic line map treatment of some features with a color enhanced photobase. Because the ""Standards for Digital Line Graphs"" assume conventional topographic maps as the graphic source for the collection of digital data, and relate the attribute codes to conventional publication symbols, additional image interpretation is involved in the collection of DLG Hydrography files from orthophotomaps. Nodes, lines, and areas collected from orthophotomaps must be attributed as though they had been symbolized conventionally. Separate plates showing single-line drainage, open water, and the extent of swamps will be provided to aid in this process. However, considerable image interpretation may be involved in determining the extent of vegetation. The orthophotomap symbolization of most features in the Roads and Trails; Railroads; Pipelines, Transmission Lines, and Miscellaneous Transportation Features; Boundaries; and U.S. Public Land Survey System categories is identical to that of conventional maps, so the orthophotomap source has a negligible impact on the collection of these categories.  07/95  General Principles  3.0-2   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding 3.0 GENERAL PRINCIPLES Part 3 is organized as follows. This section gives the general principles for collection of DLGs from maps. It is followed by a section for each of the categories which includes general principles for the category, general principles for each element type, a list of valid attribute codes, and individual coding descriptions. Please note that within the list of valid attribute codes, and within the individual coding descriptions, previously valid codes are included, but they are struck out to indicate that they are no longer in use. It is essential to read the general principles for the entire Standard, and the general principles for the particular category to be collected. These contain critical information, including global rules that always apply unless a specific coding description indicates otherwise. The intent has been to include as much information as possible in the general principles, so that it would not be necessary to repeat the same information in every category or code description.  07/95  General Principles  3.0-3   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding 3.0.1 Coding Structure Each attribute code identifies the general data category to which a feature belongs, as well as the specific nature of the feature. Codes also provide additional descriptive information. Many features are uniquely described by a single attribute code. Others may require two or more attribute codes for a complete description. Some elements may be unattributed. If multiple attributes are needed to describe a feature, their ordering is significant only if ordering is necessary to indicate a relationship between two codes and avoid ambiguity. Code order is significant in the following situations: o Carrying contour that carries decimal fraction contour The decimal fraction descriptive attribute code must follow the whole unit elevation parameter code with which it is associated. If the carrying contour carries multiple decimal fraction contours, then the appropriate decimal fraction attribute code must be repeated so that it follows each whole unit elevation parameter code with which it is associated. o Boundary monument number exceeding 4 digits The boundary monument number must be encoded by repeating the monument number parameter code. The parameter code carrying the initial digits of the monument number must precede the parameter code carrying the final digits of the monument number. o Alphanumeric monument designators The order of the alpha and numeric parameter attribute codes must be the same as that of the actual designator. o Control station or monument that falls on a State boundary The State Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code for the State on each side of the boundary must precede the county FIPS code for the county on that same side of the boundary. o Route designators The route number must follow the descriptive attribute code for the route type with which it is associated.  07/95  General Principles  3.0-4   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding o Alphanumeric route designators The order of the alpha and numeric parameter attribute codes must be the same as that of the actual designator. A DLG attribute code is composed of two distinct numeric fields: a 3 digit major code, the first two digits of which identify the data category to which the feature belongs; a third digit, which may be used to designate the interpretation of the minor code; and a 4 digit minor code, which specifically describes the feature.  3.0.1.1  Major code description The first two digits of the major code uniquely identify the data category to which the described element belongs. Table 3.0-1 lists currently used major codes and the categories they represent. The third digit of the major code is used interpretation of the minor code in two ways: o to designate the  if it is zero, the minor code numbers represent a description or classification of a specific feature, for example, 050 0300, which identifies a spring. if it is not a zero, the minor code numbers have special interpretations as a parameter. The interpretation of each parameter code is given in each category. For example, 055 ---- is used to encode the value of a river mile mark.  o  3.0.1.2  Minor code description The first digit of the minor The remaining three digits classify specific features. particular code can generally digits: o o o o o o code of a nonparameter code is zero. of a nonparameter code are used to The type of element described by a be determined from the value of these  node: 001-099 area: 100-199 line: 200-299 single-point (degenerate line): general purpose codes: 400-499 descriptive codes: 600-699  300-399  The general purpose codes are used on features that may be digitized as a node, area, degenerate line, or line depending on the size and position of the feature. 07/95 General Principles 3.0-5   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding Table 3.0-1 Current Major Attribute Codes  Major code  Category  020 050 070 080 090 150 170 180 190  Hypsography Hydrography Vegetative Surface Cover Non-Vegetative Features Boundaries Survey Control and Markers Roads and Trails Railroads Pipelines, Transmission Lines, and Miscellaneous Transportation Features Manmade Features U.S. Public Land Survey System Supplemental Codes for U.S. Public Land Survey System  200 300 600  07/97  General Principles  3.0-6   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding The descriptive codes are generally used with another code to qualify its meaning. It has not been possible to maintain this structure completely, and changes in the standards have resulted in codes that no longer fit this scheme. Many node attribute codes apply to features that are collected as degenerate lines if they do not fall on a line. Most degenerate line codes apply to features that are collected as nodes if they happen to fall on a line. Some line or area codes are now used as general purpose codes and several general purpose codes are used for features that can only be collected as areas or only as lines. Throughout these standards, if under general principles or under the list of valid attribute codes, the standards say, for example, that there are no node codes, it does not mean that no nodes in the category are ever attributed; it simply means that there are no codes in the list of node attribute codes. Codes listed under other element types may apply to nodes. Parameter codes are a range of values, number. The meaning third digit of the feature specific. used when a minor code can legitimately assume for example, water elevation or highway route of a parameter code is derived from the nonzero major code. Parameters are both category and  3.0.2  Coding Description Each attribute coding description typically contains the following information: o o The major and minor code and the code name. A feature definition, which defines the feature by identifying which symbols represent the feature on the graphic, or provides a general description of the feature and its function, or both. Labeling information, which defines how the feature will be collected based on how it is labeled on the graphic. Delineation information, which defines any specific instructions dealing with how to delineate the feature (for example, where to place a degenerate line when digitizing a symbol). Representation information, which defines how the feature will be represented in the digital file when certain conditions are met (for example, size criteria determining  o  o  o  07/95  General Principles  3.0-7   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding whether to digitize a specific feature as an area or a degenerate line). o Use of additional descriptive or parameter codes, which define any such codes that might be used in association with the feature.  When an attribute code is specifically referenced to a standard cartographic symbol, the symbol number is cited, immediately followed by a letter reference in parenthesis. Symbol number and letter references refer to specific National Mapping Program Technical Instructions as defined in Table 3.0-2.  3.0.3  How to Measure a Feature It may be necessary to measure features shown determine if they meet collection criteria, and, if to be collected as points, lines, or areas. Some shown on the map are not collected in the DLG, and shown to scale on the map, and previously collected DLG, are now collected as degenerate lines. on the map to so, if they are small features other features as areas in the  Size criteria are given either in the category specific general principles, or in the individual coding descriptions. Size criteria may be given either in actual size on the ground, or in inches at map scale. In most cases the size criteria given assume 1:24,000scale mapping, so some judgement must be used in applying the size criteria when collecting from 1:100,000-scale maps. When measuring features, the following guidelines apply: o All measurements should be made from the outermost symbol edge to the opposite outermost symbol edge. In general, features are measured along the longest axis (length), or shortest axis (width). Square features are measured along either axis. Round features are measured across their diameter. Irregular features are measured using the concept of the best-fitting rectangle. Using this concept, a rectangle is created around an irregularly shaped feature using the outermost edges of the feature to define the sides of the rectangle. (This rectangle is aligned however necessary to best fit the feature, rather than with the neatline.) Length is then measured using the longest axis of the rectangle, width is measured using the shortest axis of the General Principles 3.0-8  o o o  07/95   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding Table 3.0-2 Symbol References  If the symbol number does not contain a decimal, and is followed by the letter reference ""A"" (for example, 207(A)), then the reference is: Standards for 1:24,000- and 1:25,000-Scale Quadrangle Maps, Part 6: ""Publication Symbols (Supplement)"" - December 1981  If the symbol number contains a decimal, begins with the number 1, and is followed by the letter reference ""B"" (for example, 145.2(B)), then the reference is: Standards for 1:100,000-Scale Quadrangle Maps, Part 4: ""Publication Symbols"" - May 1984  If the symbol number begins with the number 5 and is followed by the letter reference ""C"" (for example, 512.61(C)), then the reference is: Standards for 1:24,000- and 1:25,000-Scale Quadrangle Maps, Part 5: ""Publication Symbols"" - May 1984*  If symbol number contains 4 digits followed by a decimal and is followed by the letter reference ""D"" (for example, 2103.01(D)), then the reference is: Standards for Provisional Edition Maps, 1:24,000- and 1:25,000-Scale, Part 2: ""Compilation Symbols"" - January 1982  *A revised version of this document was published in May 1994. However, the earlier version is referenced in this standard, because this standard applies to collection from maps; few, if any, DLGs will be collected from maps which use the May 1994 symbology. In addition, the 1984 document is in color, while the 1994 version is in black-and-white. If only the 1994 version is available, it can readily be used, since the numbers used to reference symbols have been maintained between versions. Although a few symbols which are no longer referenced in the 1994 version appear on the maps, their meaning can usually be determined either from context, or by referring to the Part 6 symbol.  07/95  General Principles  3.0-9   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding rectangle, and area is measured as the total area of the rectangle. o Size criteria are intended to be used as guidelines. It is assumed that the collector will develop a feel for when a feature is the appropriate size, rather than measuring each and every feature instance. It is understood that this means some features within a few mils of a certain size criteria will not be treated as specified in the standards. This is acceptable. Variations in the size of standard symbols that can reasonably be assumed to be a result of the map scribing and reproduction process are ignored.  o  3.0.4  Where to Digitize Features Determining where to digitize a feature can depend on the methods used to collect the data. Although it is desirable for the DLG categories to be vertically aligned, in some cases it would be prohibitive to enforce this requirement. Vertical alignment is the process by which features from one DLG category are represented by the same numeric coordinates as features from an overlapping DLG category. If all the DLG categories are collected at the same time, using heads-up digitizing, features that coincide should share numeric coordinates. This includes, for example, woods that follow a road. Rather than digitizing the woods by following the edge of the tint, the edge of the woods would be digitized using the same coordinates as the centerline of the road. If it is not reasonable to collect the DLG categories as vertically aligned, then generally the features are collected as symbolized. For example, if the woods follow the casing of a road and the Vegetative Surface Cover DLG is being scanned, the resulting woods will not follow the centerline of the road. Because many features are collected as centerlines or points in the DLG, and therefore occupy less space in the DLG than they do when symbolized on the map, it is often necessary to extend lines slightly, either to reach the centerpoint of point symbols, or to form unbroken outlines of areas. For example, when a cul-de-sac is shown at the end of a road, the digitized road line must be extended to the center of the cul-de-sac. Or if one side of a small park borders a road, that edge of the small park is digitized by following the centerline of the road; even though the lines that define the two adjoining sides of the small park end at the road casing on the graphic, they are extended to meet the centerline of the road in the DLG.  07/95  General Principles  3.0-10   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding 3.0.4.1 Lines Lines are digitized as centerlines. For many features, the symbol is a single line on the map, and the digitized centerline and the symbol are, for all practical purposes, the same. However, for most roads, multiple track railroads, and other features that are symbolized with casings, like racetracks and boardwalks, the centerline must be digitized by determining the center of the symbolized feature.  3.0.4.2  Areas If the edge of an area feature, which is not shown by tint, is formed by another linear feature, the centerline of the linear feature is digitized as the outline of the area feature. Area features shown with a tint, for example, woods, mines, and pits, are digitized by following the edge of the tint. With the expanded use of built-up area, the existing tint may not match the new outline. If new built-up areas are digitized, delineate the edge by following the centerline of any bounding linear features as appropriate. The appropriate attribute code is assigned only to the area point.  3.0.4.3  Degenerate Lines and Nodes Degenerate lines and symbolized nodes are digitized in the center of the symbol, unless the coding description provides additional information.  3.0.5  Symbol Hierarchy and Symbol Suppression on the Map Some symbols are suppressed on the map because of legibility constraints, but the features must still be collected in the DLG. This occurs most often with boundary lines (civil and reservation), Public Land Survey System (PLSS) lines, and outlines of features like cemeteries and small parks. It is important to understand the rules for when the symbols were suppressed on the map, since this affects how the features are coded in the DLG. PLSS lines have traditionally been suppressed if they coincide with another feature. This means that if a road, or pipeline, or railroad or boundary line follows a PLSS survey line, the survey line will not be shown on the map. If a PLSS survey line is not  07/95  General Principles  3.0-11   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding shown on the map due to coincidence with another feature, a line is digitized to complete the survey line. Boundary lines (civil and reservation) often follow the centerlines of roads and the shorelines of lakes, streams, and oceans. The boundary lines generally are not suppressed. For roads, the lineweight of the boundary line symbol is reduced by one-half, so it may be seen. However, in some cases the boundary line may be dropped. If a boundary line has been dropped, a line is digitized, using a boundary closure line. See section 3.5.4, boundary closure line (090 0204) for additional information. There is a hierarchy of boundary line symbolization (see section 3.5.1, Boundaries, General Principles, for more information). The outlines of features, such as cemeteries, small parks, athletic fields, substations, etcetera, are often dropped because of legibility constraints. In these cases, an unattributed line is digitized to complete the outline.  3.0.6  Common Attribute Codes In general, the meaning of an attribute code is unique to the feature it describes. There are, however, several exceptions.  3.0.6.1  Outside area (000 0000) Each DLG provides a coherent description of that portion of the Earth's surface covered by a 1:24,000-scale, 7.5-minute cell, or a specific subdivision of another scale source. To maintain topological consistency and to facilitate the combination (integration) of multiple DLGs, the area outside the cell is specifically identified for each DLG. This area element, which must be the first area present in each data category, is assigned a single attribute code with major and minor codes both equal to zero.  3.0.6.2  Void area This code is applied to the area beyond the national boundary. Digital data is not collected for any portion of Canada or Mexico shown on the graphic, and this code indicates that although features in a given category may exist, they have not been included in the digital file.  07/95  General Principles  3.0-12   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding In the Hypsography category, this code is also used to identify an area where contours have been dropped due to mining activity and replaced by the disturbed surface pattern. In the Boundaries category, there is no void area code. Instead, the codes for Canada (090 0197), Mexico (090 0198), and open water (090 0199) are used as appropriate. There is also no void area code in the U.S. Public Land Survey System category. Instead, the code for area outside the public domain (300 0114) is used. The minor code for void area varies by category.  3.0.6.3  Processing line (XX0 0299) The attribute code consisting of major code XX0, where XX are the two digits uniquely identifying the category, and a minor code of 0299 indicates that a digitized line has segmented the data within a file for processing. For example: 200 0299 - Processing line code for Manmade Features When a file has more than 4,751 lines bounding an area, divide the area using a processing line so there are less than 4,751 lines in any given area. This processing line should not be connected to the neatline in most situations.  3.0.6.4  Photorevised features (XX0 0000) Map features obtained by photorevision methods are printed in purple on 1:24,000- and 1:25,000-scale maps. Map features shown in purple are described by attribute codes from the appropriate category plus a code consisting of major code XX0, where XX are the two digits uniquely identifying the data category, and a minor code of zero. The photorevised code is the first entry in the ""parameter attribute codes"" list. The decision to use the photorevised code is based on what is shown in purple. Use the following guidelines to apply the photorevised code: The photorevised code is assigned to an area point if the label or fill for that area is shown in purple. For example, a new large park, indicated on the map by purple text, would be coded as follows: 090 0000 - photorevised feature 091 00XX - State FIPS code  07/95  General Principles  3.0-13   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding 092 0XXX - county FIPS code 090 0150 - large park The photorevised code does not apply in the following categories: Hypsography, Vegetative Surface Cover, Survey Control and Markers, and U.S. Public Land Survey System. The photorevised code is generally used in conjunction with a primary code, and is used alone only when applied to an element that would otherwise be unattributed. For example, a boundary line added by photorevision would be coded as follows: 090 0000 - photorevised feature The photorevised code is assigned to a linear feature if the feature is shown in purple. For example, a class 1 road where the road symbol is shown in purple would be coded as follows: 170 0000 - photorevised feature 170 0201 - primary route, class 1 The presence of a purple label does not, in necessitate the application of a photorevised code. a road is in standard colors but has a purple route is not assigned the photorevised code. Likewise, label is in purple but the building is shown photorevised code is not applied. and of itself, For example, if shield, the road if a building's in black, the  The photorevised code is not assigned to a node except when the node represents a photorevised feature on the map. For example, a bridge abutment added by photorevision is digitized as a node and coded as follows: 170 0000 - photorevised feature 170 0001 - bridge abutment Generally, if a feature was added by photorevision methods, the symbology is the same as a standard symbol, except that the symbol is printed in purple. One exception is photorevised water bodies, which are all shown using USGS pattern 6.  3.0.7  How Names and Labels Affect the Codes Many coding descriptions contain guidelines on how to use the text shown on the map to determine if the feature should be collected and how the feature should be coded. Text may include proper names (""Woodlawn Cemetery,"" for example) or generic labels (""Cemetery,"" for example). The need to use names and labels to determine how a  07/95  General Principles  3.0-14   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding feature should be coded occurs most often in the Manmade Features category, but does occasionally occur in other categories. It is not possible to give complete lists or usage conditions for all the labels that appear on USGS maps. Variations in labels may result from regional differences, for example, the use of ""Wayside Park"" in Wisconsin versus ""Rest Area"" in other States. Changes in the standards throughout the years account for other variations. For example, a ""Swimming Pool"" was always labeled until about 1970 when the requirement for a label was dropped. Other variations are the result of unique features that have ""landmark"" value. Short of looking at all 55,000 maps and documenting all of the labels, we are left with some less than complete rules. Standard phrases are used in the coding descriptions to provide information about the names and labels. Each of those phrases is defined below. While it may appear complicated, in practice the phrases are easily understood and the definitions are needed only for occasional reference. Note that some labels may be abbreviated. For example, ""Radio Tower"" may be shortened to ""RTr,"" ""Water Tank"" may be shortened to ""WT,"" and ""Substation"" may be shortened to ""SubSta,"" if there is not enough space for the full label. Appendix 3.0.A is an alphabetical listing of many of the names and labels that appear on quadrangle maps, and the attribute codes with which they are associated. 1. Must be labeled ""text."" In this case, the code is determined based on the label. This occurs when the same symbol, but different labels, are used for several features. For the feature to be collected and described by a particular code, the label must exist and it must appear exactly as it appears within the quotes (see exception for spot labeling.) For example, under code 200 0311, the condition - Must be labeled ""Drill Hole"" - means that in order to assign the code 200 0311 (drill hole) to a degenerate line, the label on the map must be ""Drill Hole."" If a similar symbol is labeled ""Dry Well"" or ""Injection Well,"" the feature cannot be coded with 200 0311. Another example is meander corner. The condition - Must be labeled ""MC"" - means that in order to assign the code 300 0004 to a node, the symbol must be labeled ""MC."" Sometimes only ""spot labeling,"" using either a singular or plural label, is used. Spot labeling, or the use of a plural label, satisfies the criteria that a feature must be labeled. For example, the label ""Spring"" has always been used, but in 07/95 General Principles 3.0-15   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding areas of numerous springs, not all springs get labeled. However, enough springs are labeled to recognize the rest as springs. This applies to other features, including wells, mining features (pits, strip mines, open pit mines, mine shafts, mine tunnel entrances, prospects), and tanks. 2. Generally labeled ""text."" This means that the feature is generally labeled with the label shown within the quotes. This condition can be modified with the conditions ""includes (list of labels),"" ""may be unlabeled"" or ""may be named"": If the condition ""includes (list of labels)"" appears, it means that labels other than that shown within the quotes might be found on the map and that a feature shown with similar labels should be collected and given the appropriate code. This list cannot be considered exhaustive, but provides guidelines for classifying features labeled with something different from the standard label. If the condition ""may be unlabeled"" appears, it means that not every occurrence of the symbol is labeled. For example, ""Athletic Field"" is a common label, but not all athletic fields are labeled. Athletic fields that are associated with schools and are delineated by a running track, which is a universally recognized shape, are not labeled. If the feature is unlabeled, but there is no doubt about what the feature is, it should be collected and given the appropriate code. If the condition ""may be named"" appears, it means that the feature is generally labeled using the text found within the quotes, but in some cases, the feature may be named. For example, a cemetery is generally labeled ""Cemetery,"" but a proper name such as ""Greenridge Cemetery"" may be used. 3. Generally named, but may be labeled. This means that the feature is generally described with a proper name, but in some cases, the feature may be labeled. A nonexhaustive list of generic terms that can be coded with the code being described is included. For example, institutions are generally identified with a proper name as in ""Tuscon Medical Center,"" ""Tuscon General Hospital,"" ""Oak Valley Sanitarium,"" ""Wesley Willows Nursing Home,"" ""Mayo Clinic,"" and sometimes with a more generic term like ""State Hospital."" Medical center, hospital, sanitarium, nursing home, and clinic are all terms that designate a health care complex.  07/95  General Principles  3.0-16   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding 4. Common labels include This means that there is no label that has been generally used and some judgement will be required to classify the feature. For example, historical monuments have quite often been labeled and named to indicate the historical event that is being commemorated. ""Treaty Oak,"" ""Historical Marker,"" ""Historical Monument,"" ""Shrine,"" ""Meade Pyramid,"" ""Monument,"" ""Carranza Memorial,"" and ""Yorktown Monument"" are all names or labels that have appeared on USGS maps. These can all be classified as structures that commemorate people or past events and should be collected and attributed with code 200 0301 (historical marker).  3.0.8  Record of Attribute Codes This standard was first issued in January 1980 and Attribute Codes for Digital Line Graphs."" the standards have been periodically modified to in requirements, to correct errors, improve clarify meaning. as ""Computer Files Since January 1980, accommodate changes organization, and  Table 3.0-3 lists the chronological history of the standards starting with the original version and each subsequent change notice or complete revision.

The specific named or labeled feature must then be evaluated against that description to determine whether or not it meets the collection criteria, and how it is to be collected. In this list, each feature label is associated with only one attribute code; the coding description, or the general principles for that category, may identify additional codes which also must be applied. For feature labels that indicate the need for a descriptive code, this list directs the user to the descriptive code, rather than the node, area, line, single-point, or general purpose attribute code. Generally the coding description for the descriptive code will unambiguously direct the user to the appropriate ""feature"" code. For example, the feature label ""Airway Beacon"" is associated with the navigation code (200 0629). The navigation code description says that the code is used to describe a tower (200 0305) used for navigation. In a few cases, though, either the feature symbol or the remainder of the label must be used to determine the ""feature"" code. For example, the feature label ""Dry"" is associated with the dry code (050 0614), but that coding description simply says that the code describes any feature labeled ""Dry,"" or symbolized as dry.  07/95  General Principles  3.0.A-2   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding Appendix 3.0.A - Feature Labels and Associated Attribute Codes  Feature label  Code  Code name  4WD Abandoned Aboveground Academy Aerial Tramway Agriculture Inspect.

Comprehensive List of Attribute Codes The following listing gives the number and name for every code that has been used since the Standards for Digital Line Graphs were issued in January 1985. (Codes consistent with the current scheme that were deleted prior to January 1985 are included when known.) For codes added since January 1985, the date they were added is indicated. For codes that have been deleted, the date they were deleted is indicated. This standard primarily addresses collection of DLGs from graphics and therefore does not describe all codes which are used during digital revision. However, all possible DLG-3 codes are included in this comprehensive listing. Codes followed by an asterisk (*) only apply to single edition USGS/Forest Service quadrangles. Codes followed by a pound sign (#) only apply to limited update digital revisions. Individual parameter code values generally are not included in this list. However, some specific values of the origin of survey parameter code (306 00xx) which no longer appear in the appropriate appendix have been included. We recognize that other parameter codes may have specific values which are no longer valid, and therefore should also be included. Such values may be added to the listing at a later date if resources permit.  07/97  General Principles  3.0.B-2   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding Appendix 3.0.B - Comprehensive List of Attribute Codes  Number  Name  000 0000 020 0000 020 0100 020 020 020 020 0200 0201 0202 0203  020 0204 020 0205 020 0206 020 0207 020 0208 020 0209# 020 0210 020 0299 020 0300 020 0301  020 0302 020 0303 020 020 020 020 020 020 020 020 020 020 0600 0601 0602 0603 0604 0605 0606 0607 0608 0609  Outside area Photorevised feature Deleted 07/95 Void area Added 06/87 Contour (index or intermediate) Carrying contour Supplementary contour Continuation contour Deleted 10/90 Amended contour Deleted 07/95 Bathymetric contour (primary, index or Depth curve Deleted 03/88, Added 07/95 Watershed divide Closure line Added 06/87, Deleted 10/93 memo (05/94 Obsolete contour Added 05/94 Supplementary bathymetric contour Added 07/95 Processing line Added 10/90 Spot elevation, less than third order, Spot elevation, less than third order, on bridge Added 06/87, Deleted 07/95 Spot elevation, less than third order, Added 05/94 Sounding Added 07/95 Decimal fraction of 0.0 feet or meters Decimal fraction of 0.1 feet or meters Decimal fraction of 0.2 feet or meters Decimal fraction of 0.3 feet or meters Decimal fraction of 0.4 feet or meters Decimal fraction of 0.5 feet or meters Decimal fraction of 0.6 feet or meters Decimal fraction of 0.7 feet or meters Decimal fraction of 0.8 feet or meters Decimal fraction of 0.9 feet or meters  intermediate)  Standard)  ground level not at ground level, and not  on bridge  07/95  General Principles  3.0.B-3   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding Appendix 3.0.B -

Only one code from the list of line attribute codes is assigned to each line. The condition of carrying takes precedence over other characteristics; if a contour is both carrying and supplementary, it is collected as carrying only. On the map, contour lines may be broken for elevation labels. In collecting the contours, these breaks are ignored and the contours are collected as continuous lines through the breaks. When the breaks occur along curves on the contour, care must be taken to retain contour shape relative to the adjacent contours. In general, contours are collected exactly as they are shown on the map. There is no requirement to add or modify contour segments to improve the logical consistency of the file. However, limited additions or modifications may be made to maximize the utility and efficiency of quality control software. For example, if a contour carries on one end and is feathered on the other, it is not necessary to treat both ends one way or the other in the digital data, but you may choose to do so in order to simplify processing. Any short segments that are added or modified are not uniquely identified; they are simply assigned the appropriate contour and elevation codes. If contours at dams, seawalls, locks, levees, etcetera, have not been scribed or have been overprinted, they are not generally connected in the digital file. However, when the path of the contour can be readily determined (for example, when a contour  07/95  Hypsography  3.1-1   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding crosses a road at a bridge wing tick) collect the contour as a continuous line, rather than breaking it for the overprinting feature.  3.1.1.4  Single-Point Attribute Codes The elevation parameter (02N ----) is used in conjunction with all single-point attributes. Collection of Spot Elevations Spot elevations values are shown in italic type on standard graphics, and with slant lettering on provisional editions. When collecting spot elevations from graphic source, it is not always clear exactly where to collect the elevation based on its portrayal on the graphic source. The following general guidelines should be used in determining where to collect a spot elevation. Where the spot elevation is shown by symbols 224(A), 112.41(B), 512.108(C), or 2102.10(D), digitize a degenerate line at the center of the X. Where the spot elevation value is adjacent to another feature (for example, a well, windmill, or drill holes), digitize a degenerate line at the location of the coincident feature. Where the spot elevation value is shown at the intersection of two or more linear features (for example, the intersection of two or more roads, a road and a transmission line, a road and a fence line, or two streams), digitize a degenerate line where the features intersect. Where the spot elevation is shown at a horizontal control station, digitize a degenerate line coincident with the horizontal control station. Where the spot elevation is shown on a hill or top, but no spot elevation cross is shown, digitize a degenerate line at the center of the top as defined by the top contour. All spot elevations shown on the standard graphic are collected. Because spot elevations with suspect elevation values will generally be flagged by the processing software, they may be corrected in advance of processing if it is determined that this approach is more efficient than following up on processing software warning messages. Please note, however, that any spot elevation that agrees with the value shown on the graphic is not considered to be an error in the DLG; such suspect elevations are only to be corrected when it is more efficient to do so. On provisional maps, elevations labeled ""AT,"" ""DB,"" or ""DR"" are not collected.  07/95  Hypsography  3.1-2   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding Marked overcrowding of spot elevations often exists on provisional maps, and they should not be collected any closer together than every quarter mile. If it is necessary to ""thin"" spot elevations shown on provisional edition maps, elevations labeled ""T"" are eliminated first, then elevations labeled ""A"" or ""B,"" and finally unlabeled elevations. Spot elevations are generally digitized as degenerate line elements; however, they are digitized as node elements when located on a line collected in the Hypsography category. Elevations on bridges are encoded uniquely so they may be isolated from ground-level elevations used for Digital Elevation Model gridding or automatic contour tagging, and so that they may be symbolized correctly at time of product generation. Type Placement for Spot Elevations Figure 3.1-1 provides graphic examples of the preferred placement of type for spot elevations. For each situation, the placement illustrated in column 1 is most desirable, and that in column 4 is least desirable. These illustrations may be helpful in determining what location a specific spot elevation value refers to, and where to collect the degenerate line.  3.1.1.5  General Purpose Attribute Codes There are no general purpose attribute codes.  3.1.1.6  Descriptive Attribute Codes There are no general principles that apply to descriptive attribute codes.  3.1.1.7  Parameter Attribute Codes There are no general principles that apply to parameter attribute codes.  07/95  Hypsography  3.1-3   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding 1 BM 4567  2 BM 4567 BM  3 4567  4 BM 4567  1 502  2 522  3  4  532  BM  567  BM 567  BM  567  BM 567  557  567 552  4567  4567  4567  4567  572  573  574  6734  6734  6734  6734  599 576 577  578  6734  6734  6734  6734  582 583 593 592 585 594 595  586  558 563 564  565  635 503 523 543  596 587  597 588  504  524 534 535 544 545  508  503 598 540  505  525  520  530  506  526 536  570 546 550 560  507  527 537 547  529  539 549  556 554 555 559  569  579 589  Figure 3.1-1 Type placement preference for spot elevations  07/95  Hypsography  3.1-1   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding 3.1.1.8 List of Hypsography Attribute Codes o Node attribute codes There are no node attribute codes o Area attribute codes 000 0000 020 0100 o Outside area Void area  Line attribute codes 020 020 020 020 020 020 020 020 020 020 020 0200 0201 0202 0203 0204 0205 0206 0207 0208 0210 0299 Contour (index or intermediate) Carrying contour Supplementary contour Continuation contour Amended contour Bathymetric contour (primary, index or intermediate) Depth curve Watershed divide Closure line Supplementary bathymetric contour Processing line  o  Single-point attribute codes 020 0300 020 0301 020 0302 020 0303 Spot elevation, less level Spot elevation, less not at ground level, Spot elevation, less Sounding than third order, ground than third order, and not on bridge than third order, on bridge  o  General purpose attribute codes There are no general purpose attribute codes  o  Descriptive attribute codes 020 020 020 020 020 020 020 020 0600 0601 0602 0603 0604 0605 0606 0607 Decimal Decimal Decimal Decimal Decimal Decimal Decimal Decimal fraction fraction fraction fraction fraction fraction fraction fraction of of of of of of of of 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 feet feet feet feet feet feet feet feet or or or or or or or or meters meters meters meters meters meters meters meters 3.1-5  07/95  Hypsography   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding 020 020 020 020 020 020 020 020 020 o 0608 0609 0610 0611 0612 0613 0614 0615 0616 Decimal fraction of 0.8 feet or meters Decimal fraction of 0.9 feet or meters Approximate Depression Glacier or snow field Underwater Best estimate of contour elevation value Fill Rise (inside a depression)  Parameter attribute codes 020 021 022 023 024 025 026 0000 ---------------00-Photorevised feature Elevation, whole feet, greater than 9999 Elevation, whole feet, 9999 or less Elevation, whole feet below datum Elevation, whole meters Elevation, whole meters below datum Major category associated with spot height not at ground elevation Coincident Feature  029 00--  07/95  Hypsography  3.1-6   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding 3.1.2 Node Attribute Codes There are no node attribute codes.  3.1.3  Area Attribute Codes 000 0000 Outside area This code is described in section 3.0.6.1. 020 0100 Void area This code identifies an area where contours have been dropped due to mining activity and replaced by the disturbed surface pattern. The area beyond the national boundary is also coded as a void area, to distinguish it from the background area. The perimeter of the void area is collected as an unattributed line unless defined by a limiting contour. On topographic-bathymetric editions, void areas are also collected where features, such as channels and spoil areas, exist and bathymetric contours are not shown. When collecting a void area where contours have been dropped and replaced by disturbed surface pattern, the edge of the pattern is used as a general guide in digitizing the perimeter of the void area. However, the perimeter of the void area must connect to the dangling ends of the dropped contours, so in some cases it may be necessary to digitize the perimeter of the void area slightly beyond the edge of the disturbed surface pattern, or within it.  3.1.4  Line Attribute Codes 020 0200 Contour (index or intermediate) This code identifies both index and intermediate contours based on the contour interval. They are shown by symbols 300, 301 (A); 132.1, 132.2 (B); 532.1, 532.2 (C); or 2302.01, 2302.02 (D). Use descriptive codes for depression (020 0611), approximate (020 0610), glacier or snowfield (020 0612) and underwater (020 0613) as needed.  07/95  Hypsography  3.1-7   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding 020 0201 Carrying contour This code identifies a portion of a contour at cliff embankments and similar features where multiple contours merge into a single line. The carrying contour is digitized as separate line segments. Carrying contours are given the parameter elevation codes of the highest and lowest contours joined to the nodes of the carrying contour segment. Carrying contours are shown by symbols 306(A), 132.5(B), 532.5(C), or 2302.03(D). Any portion of a carrying contour that carries one or more depression contours is also assigned the descriptive code for depression (020 0611). Any portion approximate (020 0610). a portion of the carrying 020 0202 of a carrying contour that carries only contours is also coded approximate However, if any of the contours carried by carrying contour are not approximate, then contour is not approximate.  Supplementary contour This code identifies contours shown between intermediate contours to aid in defining topography in areas of minimal slope. Supplementary contours are shown by symbols 302, 309(A); 133.1, 133.2 (B); 533.1, 533.2(C); or 2303.01(D), or by dotted brown lines. If supplementary contours are shown on a map, there will be a note in the map collar, just below the contour interval note, that says either ""Supplementary contour interval XX feet"" or ""Dotted lines represent XX foot contours."" Do not confuse supplementary contours with dual contour intervals. Maps covering areas with abrupt contrasts in relief may use two different basic contour intervals in different areas of the map. The contour interval note identifies maps with dual contour intervals, and a contour diagram or key, which delineates the area for which each contour interval applies, is also provided.  020 0203  Continuation contour This code is no longer used.  020 0204  Amended contour This code is no longer used.  07/95  Hypsography  3.1-8   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding 020 0205 Bathymetric contour (primary, index or intermediate) This code identifies primary, index and intermediate bathymetric contours based on the contour interval. A bathymetric contour is a line connecting points of equal water depth. Primary bathymetric contours are only collected at certain contour intervals, and are shown in black. Bathymetric contours are shown by symbols 112.87, 112.88, 141.41, 141.42 (B) or 512.147, 512.148, 541.60, 541.61 (C). This code is used in conjunction with the parameter elevation code 021 ----, 022 ----, or 024 ----. (Note that the parameter elevation codes for feet or meters below datum are not used in conjunction with this code). Also use descriptive codes for depression (020 0611), approximate (020 0610) and rise (020 0616) as needed. Do not use this code for underwater contours. See code 020 0613. Although the sounding datum (the ""0"" bathymetric contour) may appear on some map separates containing bathymetric contours, it is not collected in this category. It is collected only in the Hydrography category. 020 0206 Depth curve This code is USED ONLY WHEN THE COLLECTION OF DEPTH CURVES HAS BEEN SPECIFICALLY AUTHORIZED AT THE REQUEST OF A COOPERATING AGENCY. Depth curves are shown by symbols 447(A) or 541.58(C). This code is used in conjunction with the parameter elevation code 021 ----, 022 ----, or 024 ----.

If supplementary bathymetric contours are shown on a map, it will be noted in the map collar. Use descriptive codes for depression (020 0611), approximate (020 0610), and rise (020 0616) as needed. 020 0299 Processing line This code is described in section 3.0.6.3.  3.1.5  Single-Point Attribute Codes 020 0300 020 0301 Spot elevation, less than third order, ground level Spot elevation, less than third order, not at ground level, and not on bridge This code is no longer used. 020 0302 Spot elevation, less than third order, on bridge This code is only applied when the elevation value is preceded by the letters BR. Since these letters indicate that the elevation occurs on the bridge, the elevation should be collected directly on the bridge itself. 020 0303 Sounding This code is USED ONLY WHEN THE COLLECTION OF SOUNDINGS HAS BEEN SPECIFICALLY AUTHORIZED AT THE REQUEST OF A COOPERATING AGENCY. Soundings are shown by symbol 454(A). They may be printed in either blue or black. This code is used in conjunction with the parameter elevation code 021 ----, 022 ----, or 024 ----.

The units are the same as those of the corresponding parameter code. The specific values are: Decimal Decimal Decimal Decimal Decimal Decimal Decimal Decimal Decimal Decimal fraction fraction fraction fraction fraction fraction fraction fraction fraction fraction of of of of of of of of of of 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 feet feet feet feet feet feet feet feet feet feet or or or or or or or or or or meters meters meters meters meters meters meters meters meters meters  020 020 020 020 020 020 020 020 020 020  0600 0601 0602 0603 0604 0605 0606 0607 0608 0609  020 0610  Approximate This code identifies contours in areas where accurate representation is not attainable through normal compilation procedures. Approximate contours are shown by symbols 303, 304 (A); 112.89, 132.3, 141.43 (B); or 532.3, 541.44 (C). All contours within glaciers or snow fields are also assigned this code (see code 020 0612). The depiction of contours as approximate is uncommon; they have been used primarily in heavily forested areas in the Pacific Northwest, and occasionally in marshy areas.  020 0611  Depression This code identifies contours surrounding a basin or sink denoted by right-angle ticks (hachures) pointing inward (downslope). Depression contours are shown by symbols 307 (A); 112.90, 112A.2, 132.6, 132.7, 133.2, 141.44 (B); 512.149, 512A.3, 532.6, 532.7, 541.63 (C); or 2302.04 (D).  020 0612  Glacier or snow field This code identifies contours in areas covered by glaciers or snow fields. It identifies contours within areas outlined by symbols 428, 429 (A); 141.27 (B);  07/95  Hypsography  3.1-11   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding 541.43, 541.44 (C); or 2205.04 (D). All such contours are also coded as approximate (020 0610), regardless of how they are symbolized on the map. When a glacier or snow field is shown with formlines, as in symbols 430(A), 141.28(B), or 541.45(C), it is not collected in the Hypsography category. 020 0613 Underwater This code identifies submerged contours compiled before an area was inundated by the construction of a dam. These areas are overprinted with blue or purple tint. 020 0614 Best estimate of contour elevation value This code is no longer used. 020 0615 Fill This code is no longer used. Portions of contours along which fill ticks are shown are not uniquely identified. 020 0616 Rise (inside a depression) This code identifies contours surrounding a rise inside a depression, shown by right angle ticks, pointing downslope, as in symbols 112.91, 112A.3, 141.45 (B); or 512.151, 512A.4, 541.64 (C). This code is used only in conjunction with bathymetric contours (020 0205 and 020 0210).  3.1.8  Parameter Attribute Codes 020 0000 Photorevised feature This code is no longer used.  07/95  Hypsography  3.1-12   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding 02N ---Elevation, whole feet or meters This parameter is used to encode the elevation value associated with a contour or spot elevation. The digitizer enters a value in place of the ""N"" in the major code as follows: 1 2 3 4 5 = = = = = whole whole whole whole whole feet, greater than 9999 feet, 9999 or less feet below datum (negative values only) meters meters below datum (negative values only)  The elevation value is then entered into the minor code, flush right. (For elevations greater than 9999 feet, only the final four digits are encoded in the minor code.) Examples: 12,400 feet is coded as 021 2400 -5 feet is coded as 023 0005  Elevations exceeding 19,999 feet must be expressed in meters. Mt. McKinley, Alaska, is the only point within United States boundaries that falls in this category. To express elevations to decimal feet or meters, use the above parameter codes in conjunction with descriptive attribute codes 020 0600 through 020 0609. Negative contour elevations are found on maps of only a few areas of the United States, such as New Orleans or Death Valley. In areas where contour feathering occurs, elevations for the feathered segments can generally be determined by referring to the compilation specifications for feathered areas. These specifications state that the last contour segment dropped in a constricted area is the first one to begin again as soon as space is available. The compilation specifications also state that when the space between index contours limits the depiction of intermediate contours, the priority for portrayal is as follows: the highest intermediate, the lowest, the second highest, the second lowest, and so on. 026 00-Major category associated with spot height not at ground elevation This code is no longer used. 07/95 Hypsography 3.1-13   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding 029 00-Coincident Feature This code is no longer used.  07/95  Hypsography  3.1-14   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding 3.2 HYDROGRAPHY--MAJOR CODE 050 Flowing and standing water and manmade features directly related to hydrography are collected in this category.  3.2.1  General Principles Coding Principles The majority of codes apply to both topographic and topographicbathymetric editions, but some codes only apply to topographicbathymetric editions. The individual coding descriptions identify these codes. If a feature appears on a topographic edition and the coding description indicates that it applies only to topographicbathymetric editions, do not collect the feature. The term ""water body"" is used to refer to any hydrographic feature collected as an area as well as any areal hydrographic feature collected as a degenerate line or as a node because of its small size. Use is not limited to a lake or a pond. All double-line streams are digitized as areas. Where double-line streams join other water bodies or other double-line streams the two features are separated from one another by closure lines. If a hydrographic feature is less than or equal to 0.030 inches in length (regardless of map scale), it is collected as a degenerate line or node; no shoreline code is added. Do not collect islands that are less than or equal to 0.030 inches in length (regardless of map scale), unless they are named. Feature Classification and Delineation In the real world, hydrographic features vary considerably. The treatment of these features on USGS maps also varies considerably, making determination of the appropriate code difficult in some cases. In many cases, symbol references provide only a general idea of what a feature may look like. It is necessary, when collecting hydrographic features, to pay attention to such things as shape or form, context within the map, names, labels, and marginal information, some or all of which may be important aids to classification. Generally, use the code that best describes the feature, even if the symbolization of that feature varies from the symbolization that is referenced. Lakes are defined as standing bodies of water with predominantly natural shoreline. Reservoirs are constructed basins formed to  07/95  Hydrography  3.2-1   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding contain water or other liquids for various purposes. The names and labels of these features do not always convey the proper classification, and care must be taken not to use names and labels alone in determining how to classify them. Many features that are known as ""Reservoirs"" or labeled on the graphic as ""Reservoir"" may in fact, be lakes or ponds. As a general rule, if a water body has a regular geometric shape or other information indicates it is contained by a constructed basin, then it is a reservoir. If it does not appear to be contained by a constructed basin, then it is a lake or pond. Many constructed reservoirs found on the map can be coded according to their specific type. Individual codes exist for covered reservoir, salt evaporator, aquaculture pond, industrial water impoundment, sewage disposal pond, tailings pond, soda evaporator, and filtration pond, all of which are types of reservoirs. The code for reservoir (050 0101) is used only when no other specific attribute code is available to describe the type of reservoir. Swimming pools and nonwater reservoirs are collected in the Manmade Features category. Where a stream or river has been dammed, use the following guidelines in determining whether to collect the water body above the dam as stream or lake. o Collect the water body as stream if it retains its river-like appearance, and the width of the water body above the dam is similar to the width of the water body below the dam. Many rivers have been dammed to maintain water levels for navigation, or for flood control, in which case there is commonly a series of dams on the river. Collect the water body as lake if it is actually an impounded water body created by the dam, and the width of the water body above the dam is significantly greater than the width of the water body below the dam. If a submerged river is shown within an impounded lake, collect both a lake and submerged stream.  o  To determine whether a given feature should be collected as a stream or as a ditch or canal, use the appearance and location of the Do not rely only on names and labels, because in some feature. regions of the country the term ditch is used as a synonym for creek. Ditches and canals have regular geometric shapes and are cut through land to provide irrigation or drainage, and for navigation around obstacles or between water bodies. If contours have been turned upstream and dropped at a hydrographic feature, as in symbols 312(A), 532.8(C), or 2302.07(D), or if the feature parallels a contour and has little or no gradient, collect the feature as a ditch or canal. Streams are naturally occurring, do not have a 07/95 Hydrography 3.2-2   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding regular geometric form, and normally have a gradient and flow downslope. Streams that have been relocated or altered for purposes other than drainage or irrigation are considered to be streams and not ditches. In some cases, only a portion of a stream has been realigned, and the purpose of that realignment cannot be determined from the map. Unless the realigned portion is identified by a ditch label, or a change in name to a named ditch, collect it as a stream. Streams that have been channelized or canalized for navigation (the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers, for example), are collected as streams and not canals, even though a set of locks and dams may have transformed portions of the river from a free-flowing water body to a series of slack water pools. Hydrographic features form networks where large and small rivers, streams, lakes, ponds, and so on, flow in and out of each other. On the map, these networks appear as blue areas with no dividing lines. However, in collecting digital data, each part of the network must be classified as the appropriate feature and assigned a code. What the feature is and where it begins and ends is not always clear. The following guidelines can be used to help make these determinations: o There are cases where it is difficult to classify the ""bumps"" or ""fingers"" of water bodies. Where a single-line stream appears to widen as it enters a double-line stream or lake, a judgement must be made as to whether the widened area is part of the double-line stream or lake (a ""finger"" in the larger water body that extends to the single-line stream) or if the single-line stream has widened to a double-line stream, which then enters the larger water body (double-line stream or lake). As a general rule, lakes tend to have many ""fingers"" and most of the time these are considered to be part of the lake. A single-line stream usually enters a lake without becoming a double-line stream. However, ""fingers"" on a double-line stream are usually part of the incoming stream. In both cases, the length and width relationship of the incoming water body must be taken into consideration. If it is longer than it is wide, or has a narrow neck, it may be considered as a separate incoming feature from the single-line stream. o A single-line stream may flow into something other than a double-line stream, which then connects to the larger water Determine the feature based on shape, size, and body. positioning of the feature. For example, a single-line stream may flow into a partial oxbow (lake or pond) that connects to Each of these three features is a double-line stream. collected as an individual feature.  07/95  Hydrography  3.2-3   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding o Where a ""finger"" occurs in a water body, whether there is an entering stream or not, the overall size and the size of the opening neck are criteria that can be used to decide if it is part of the larger water body or not. Generally, the larger the size of the ""finger"" and the more narrow the neck, the more likely it is to be a separate, and possibly different, feature. Whether a widened portion of single-line stream is collected as a small lake or as a double-line portion of the single-line stream, is dependent on its relative width, shape (linearity versus roundness), and name. Use judgement and common sense in determining whether you have a lake or a stream. The ""fingers"" on impounded water bodies are considered part of the impounded water body up to the point where the entering stream returns to its normal channel. The normal channel of a stream can be recognized by its fairly consistent width or may be indicated on the map by the previous stream bed or contours. Name is not always an indicator of the feature classification and should be used only in conjunction with other criteria. In all cases, use your knowledge of what these features look like on the ground, along with your best judgement and common sense. Recognize that there may not be a single ""right"" way of delineating and coding connecting water bodies; several different solutions may all be equally ""correct.""  o  o  o  o  The classification of some hydrographic features added during photorevision cannot be determined solely on symbology, because earthen and manmade shoreline are both shown in purple, and the intermittent nature of features cannot always be determined from photography. Classification of these features must, therefore, be based on context. If photorevised shoreline has a regular, geometric shape or similar nearby shoreline is shown as manmade, or both, collect the shoreline as manmade. If in doubt, collect the shoreline as earthen (050 0200). In deciding whether or not to collect a feature as intermittent, look at the overall drainage pattern in the area. Hydrographic features are only collected as perennial if there is little doubt that they contain water year round; if uncertain, collect them as intermittent. Flow Direction The direction of flow is indicated on the map by the contours and the overall pattern of the drainage network. Information on the flow of water bodies is collected to support data users who model network flow on hydrographic phenomena for scientific studies. Flow For double-line is coded in one of two ways in the DLG data. 07/95 Hydrography 3.2-4   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding features, the descriptive attribute codes for right bank (050 0605) and left bank (050 0606) are applied. For single-line features, the node attribute codes for upper origin (050 0001), upper origin at water body (050 0002), sink (050 0003), entering water body (050 0004), and exiting water body (050 0005) are applied. For double-line features, capture the direction of flow by theoretically looking downstream and indicating right and left bank. For streams that have complex channels or islands, apply right and left bank codes to the outermost double-line channel, so long as the outermost channel can reasonably be considered to be a diverging and converging channel of the stream. Remember that the stream must maintain a roughly linear shape. The shore of any land area between the right and left banks is collected as shoreline. In some areas, adjoining quadrangles must be consulted in order to determine direction of flow. Node codes and right and left bank codes are only used when flow can readily and confidently be determined from the topography and overall pattern of the drainage network as shown on the map. Do not spend more than a few minutes looking for indications of direction of flow. If in doubt, do not code flow. Usually the direction of flow of streams and ditches in very flat areas, and of ditches in arid areas, cannot be determined unless contours cross the feature, the feature connects up with water bodies for which elevations are shown, or flow arrows are shown on the map. In coastal areas where flow cannot be determined, the gut code (050 0122) may be applied to water between the lowest contour and the open sea.  3.2.1.1  Node Attribute Codes Node attribute codes assist in determining the direction of water flow of single-line hydrographic features. Node attribute codes are not used at the origin of double-line hydrographic features, or where double-line hydrographic features enter or exit water bodies. They are, however, used where single-line hydrographic features enter or exit double-line hydrographic features, including where single-line hydrographic features widen to, or narrow from, doubleline hydrographic features.  3.2.1.2  Area Attribute Codes In a structured file, it is not necessary to explicitly code the line around an area unless the line itself has characteristics that must be described. However, USGS maps have traditionally described characteristics of the limits of some hydrographic features. This  07/95  Hydrography  3.2-5   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding includes whether a shoreline is earthen (blue) or masonry (black), and whether or not it can be accurately located (dashed versus solid). (The limits of a perennial versus intermittent stream or lake have also been symbolized differently. However, because it is the lake or the stream that is perennial or intermittent, that information is explicitly encoded on the area, rather than on the shoreline.) Where the characteristics of a line around a hydrographic feature can vary, the line is always attributed. For example, sewage disposal ponds may have earthen shorelines (blue) or they may have masonry shorelines (black). Therefore, the line around a sewage disposal pond must always be attributed. Sometimes, however, the line around a hydrographic feature is simply a symbol, and it is collected as an unattributed line and the line symbology is derived from the area code. For example, the blue lines around evaporators, cranberry bogs, duck ponds and the like have been described as being ""ditches."" However, on the ground, the limits of these features are in some cases ditches, in some cases embankments, and in some cases ditches on embankments. The blue line on the map shows the extent of the hydrographic feature, but does not describe any characteristics of the line; the line is, therefore, unattributed. Please note that although in the past aquaculture ponds, filtration ponds, and industrial water impoundments have been shown with either earthen shorelines (blue) or masonry shorelines (black), the distinction is no longer considered important, and in the future these features will always be outlined in black; the line is, therefore, unattributed. Where the outline of a water body is attributed, the entire outline is attributed. Although the shoreline may be interrupted by a manmade structure, which is collected either in this category or in the Manmade Features category, the line of contact between a water area and a land area is always also collected as some type of shoreline. Appendix 3.2.A provides unambiguous information on the attribution of the outlines of hydrographic features collected as areas. In general, if the outline of the feature is always shown on the map with the same symbology, the line is unattributed because it is in essence a symbol. Follow these guidelines even if an individual feature on a map is outlined using a nonstandard symbol. In some cases, the outlines of two hydrographic features may coincide, so the instructions for coding of the outlines of both features must be considered. Also, if part of the outline of an area is formed by another hydrographic feature, that portion of the outline is collected as that feature.  07/95  Hydrography  3.2-6   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding Additional hydrographic features can exist within a larger hydrographic feature. This is most common in a bay, estuary, gulf, ocean, or sea, or a gut, but can also occur in a lake, or a doubleline stream or canal. Even though the additional features can be collected as areas, the integrity of the larger hydrographic feature is not affected. All areas within a larger hydrographic feature receive the code of the larger feature and their own code or codes. This includes areas that are created by linear features that close, and features collected as areas. An exception to this general principal is any area where the blue water tint has been cleared; some flats (see code 050 0115), some channels (see code 050 0419), spoil area, dredged area, or dump area (050 0424), and holiday area (050 0426).  3.2.1.3  Line Attribute Codes Line attribute codes are used only where specific characteristics of a line that surrounds an area must be described. Unlike general purpose attribute codes, line attribute codes apply to features that can only be collected as a line. USGS maps use line symbology to distinguish between earthen shorelines (blue) and manmade shorelines (black) and to describe the accuracy of the location, definite (solid line) versus indefinite (dashed line). There are unique codes to collect these characteristics: 050 0200 for earthen definite shoreline; 050 0201 for manmade shoreline; 050 0203 for earthen indefinite shoreline. Apparent shoreline (050 0207) is a special type of indefinite shoreline shown only on topographic-bathymetric editions. The descriptive attribute codes for right bank (050 0605) and left bank (050 0606) are used instead of the earthen definite shoreline code (050 0200) on double-line features where flow is collected. For all other shoreline characteristics, the right bank and left bank codes are used in addition to the appropriate shoreline code. Additional line codes are used to collect other hydrographic features symbolized on the map, for example, Carolina bays (050 0205) and limiting danger lines (050 0206). Closure lines (050 0202) are used to code lines that are not shown on the map and must be added to the DLG. Where no specific information is required to describe characteristics of the line, an unattributed line is collected. Unattributed lines can be collected regardless of whether an area If the perimeter of an feature has a symbolized perimeter or not. area is always symbolized in a particular way, the line symbol can be derived from the area feature and no specific line coding is required.  07/95  Hydrography  3.2-7   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding A closure line is used where it is necessary to separate polygons that represent different hydrographic features when the separation is not explicitly indicated on the graphic. For example, in order to separate a stream polygon from a lake polygon, a closure line is collected where the double-line stream enters the lake. Closure lines are required whenever flow is collected from one water body to another. For example, a closure line is collected where a double-line stream flows into another double-line stream and left bank and right bank are collected to indicate flow. Closure lines between like features are not necessary when flow is not coded. For example, no closure line is collected where two sections of doubleline ditch connect with one another, if the direction of flow cannot be determined and the banks of both sections of ditch are coded as shoreline or manmade shoreline rather than left bank and right bank. Closure lines are not used to close small gaps in linear features where the symbology has been broken on the map, although they have been used in this way in the past. In most cases, the symbology has been intentionally broken, because the feature is not visible on the earth's surface. In particular, map editors took great care to ensure that the dash and dot pattern of an intermittent stream, symbol 405(A), was adjusted to clearly indicate stream junctions. For example, editors made sure that intermittent streams started, and joined other streams, with the dash portion of the symbol, and that the dot portion of the symbol did not occur at sharp bends or other places where it might be confusing. If a gap is clearly the result of a scribing or registration error, and not an intentional break in the symbology, then the gap is ignored and the hydrographic feature is collected as a continuous line through the gap. The closure line code is not assigned to the line segment digitized across the gap created where the symbol for an underpassing feature is broken back from the symbol of an overpassing feature, although it has been used in this way in the past. Instead, the line segment is assigned the underpassing code (050 0617) and the code or codes of the hydrographic feature. If a feature collected as an area is intermittent, the intermittent code (050 0610) is applied only to the area, not to the line that bounds the area. See section 3.2.1.2 attribute code and specific area. See more information on on Area Attribute Codes for when to apply a line when to collect an unattributed line around a the description for closure line (050 0202) for the use and placement of these lines.  07/95  Hydrography  3.2-8   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding 3.2.1.4 Single-Point Attribute Codes There are no general principles that apply to the single-point attribute codes.  3.2.1.5  General Purpose Attribute Codes Hydrographic features that are symbolized as single-line are collected as lines, whereas features that are symbolized as doubleline are collected as areas.  3.2.1.6  Descriptive Attribute Codes There are no general principles that apply to the descriptive attribute codes.  3.2.1.7  Parameter Attributes The bank code For bank descriptive attribute codes for right bank (050 0605) and left (050 0606) are used instead of the earthen definite shoreline (050 0200) on double-line features where flow is collected. all other shoreline characteristics, the right bank and left codes are used in addition to the appropriate shoreline code.  07/95  Hydrography  3.2-9   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding 3.2.1.8 List of Hydrography Attribute Codes o Node attribute codes 050 050 050 050 050 o 0001 0002 0003 0004 0005 Upper origin Upper origin at water body Sink Entering water body Exiting water body  Area attribute codes 000 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 0000 0100 0101 0102 0103 0104 0105 0106 0107 0108 0109 0110 0111 0112 0113 0114 0115 0116 0117 0118 0119 0120 0121 0122 0123 0124 0125 0126 Outside area Alkali flat Reservoir Covered reservoir Glacier or permanent snow field Salt evaporator Inundation area Aquaculture pond Industrial water impoundment Area to be submerged Sewage disposal pond Tailings pond Marsh, wetland, swamp, or bog Mangrove area Rice field Cranberry bog Flat (tidal, sand, gravel, mud, etcetera) Bay, estuary, gulf, ocean, or sea Shoal Soda evaporator Duck pond Void area Obstruction area in water area Gut Drydock chamber Filtration pond Foul ground Mine danger area  o  Line attribute codes 050 050 050 050 050 050 0200 0201 0202 0203 0204 0205 Shoreline Manmade shoreline Closure line Indefinite shoreline Apparent limit Outline of a Carolina bay Hydrography 3.2-10  07/95   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding 050 050 050 050 050 050 o 0206 0207 0208 0209 0210 0299 Limiting danger line Apparent shoreline Sounding datum Low-water line Airboat trail Processing line  Single-point attribute codes 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 0300 0301 0302 0303 0304 0305 0306 Spring Nonflowing well Flowing well Riser Geyser Windmill Cistern  o  General purpose attribute codes 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 0400 0401 0402 0403 0404 0405 0406 0407 0408 0409 0410 0411 0412 0413 0414 0415 0416 0417 0418 0419 0420 0421 0422 0423 0424 0425 0426 Rapids Falls Gravel pit or quarry filled with water Gaging station Pumping station Water intake Dam or weir Lock chamber Spillway Gate Rock Crevasse Stream Braided stream Ditch or canal Aqueduct or pipeline Flume Penstock Siphon Channel Wash Lake or pond Reef Sand in open water Spoil area, dredged area, or dump area Fish ladder Holiday area  07/95  Hydrography  3.2-11   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding o Descriptive attribute codes 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 050 o 0601 0602 0603 0604 0605 0606 0607 0608 0609 0610 0611 0612 0613 0614 0615 0616 0617 0618 0619 0620 0621 0622 0623 0624 0625 0626 0627 0628 0629 0630 0631 0632 0633 0634 0635 0636 0637 0639 Underground Overpassing Elevated Tunnel Right bank Left bank Under construction Salt Unsurveyed Intermittent Abandoned or discontinued Submerged or sunken Wooded Dry Mineral or hot Navigable -

This code is used only at the true beginning of a watercourse, where it first appears on the map; it is not used where one hydrographic feature diverges from another, or where a particular name first appears. Do not use this code for a single-line feature that originates at a water body (see code 050 0002). Use this code in conjunction with code 050 0300 if a single-line hydrographic feature originates at a spring. 050 0002 Upper origin at water body This code identifies the node where a single-line hydrographic feature originates either within the limits of, or at the point of exit from, a water body. It is not used to identify any subsequent exits from water bodies further downstream (see code 050 0005). When a single-line hydrographic feature beginning within, rather than at, a water body, is applied only to the beginning point, not to where the feature crosses the perimeter of body. 050 0003 Sink This code identifies the definite point where a singleline or double-line hydrographic feature disappears. This code is used only if the sink is shown by symbols 407(A), 141.8(B), 541.12(C), or 2202.04(D), or labeled ""Stream Disappears."" On a single-line feature, digitize a node at the apex of the sink symbol, where it intersects the stream, and assign the node this code. On a double-line feature, digitize a line across the end of the feature and assign the line this code. 050 0004 Entering water body This code identifies the node where a single-line hydrographic feature enters a water body, or ends within the limits of a water body. (This includes the node 07/95 Hydrography 3.2-14 is shown this code the point the water   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding where a single-line hydrographic feature widens to a double-line hydrographic feature.)

Do not use this code for an artificially impounded water body with a predominantly natural shoreline (see code  07/95  Hydrography  3.2-15   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding 050 0421). See ""Feature Classification and Delineation"" in section 3.2.1 for more information. 050 0102 Covered reservoir This code identifies an area shown by symbols 180(A), 512.62(C), or 2106.08(D). Generally labeled ""Reservoir,"" but may be named. The outline of the area is unattributed. This code does not apply to 1:100,000-scale maps.  050 0103  Glacier or permanent snowfield This code identifies an area shown by symbols 428, 429, 430 (A); 141.27, 141.28 (B); 541.43, 541.44, 541.45 (C); or 2205.04(D). The outline of the area is unattributed.  050 0104  Salt evaporator This code identifies each section of a salt evaporator shown by symbols 439(A), 141.15(B), 541.27(C), or 2205.10(D). Must be labeled ""Salt Evaporator."" The outline of the area and any internal separators are unattributed.  050 0105  Inundation area Inundation areas, which are lands subject to flooding, may be either controlled or uncontrolled. Controlled inundation areas, shown by symbols 448(A), 141.38(B), or 541.56(C), have structures, such as dams or embankments, to control the water and inundate specific areas. Controlled inundation areas include debris basins, dewatering areas, percolator basins, retarding basins, and spreading grounds, as well as the area between the normal operating level and the high water line in lakes impounded by dams. If the high water line is labeled with an elevation value, the elevation parameter code is also assigned to the area. The outline of a controlled inundation area is unattributed.  07/95  Hydrography  3.2-16   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding Uncontrolled inundation areas include areas along the coast where flooding is natural and periodic, as shown in the description following symbol 454(A), 146.1(B), or 546.1(C). Only the low-water line of the uncontrolled inundation area is coded (see code 050 0209). The line for the approximate limit of flooding is unattributed. 050 0106 Aquaculture pond This code identifies an area used for production of finfish, shellfish, or aquatic plants. These areas may be shown by a variety of treatments generally similar to that for fish hatchery, which is shown by symbols 179(A), 112.6(B), 512.61(C), or 2205.11(D). Must be labeled to indicate that it is an aquaculture site, but the label may vary depending on the species and the controlling agency. Includes fish hatchery, fish farm, minnow pond, catfish farm, crayfish farm, shrimp farm, watercress pond. The outline of the area and any internal separators are unattributed. Fish ponds, which are shown in the ocean on maps of Hawaii, are not collected in the DLG. 050 0107 Industrial water impoundment This code identifies a basin for the storage or treatment of water related to industrial use. Common labels include ""Industrial Waste Pond,"" ""Cooling Pond,"" ""Fly Ash Pond,"" ""Clarification Pond,"" ""Settling Basin."" If unlabeled, may still be identifiable as an industrial water impoundment because of proximity to an industrial site. The outline of the area and any internal separators are unattributed. 050 0108 Area to be submerged This code identifies an area shown by symbols 702(A); This 141.39(B); 541.57(C); 2108.02 or 2203.07 (D). symbol is used when a dam is under construction and the limits of the intended reservoir are known. If the high water line is labeled with an elevation value, the elevation parameter code is also assigned to the area. The outline of the area is unattributed. 07/95 Hydrography 3.2-17   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding All features shown within the area to be submerged are collected in the appropriate category. Any hydrographic features collected as areas within the area to be submerged are assigned this code in addition to all other appropriate codes. For example, a double-line stream within an area to be submerged is coded 050 0412 and 050 0108. 050 0109 Sewage disposal pond This code identifies an area related to the treatment of sewage, which may be shown by symbols 178(A); 112.5,(B); 512.59(C); or 2205.12, 2205.13 (D). Generally labeled ""Sewage Disposal Pond."" If unlabeled, may still be identifiable as a sewage disposal pond because of proximity to a sewage disposal plant. The outline of the area and any internal separators are coded shoreline (050 0200) or manmade shoreline (050 0201). 050 0110 Tailings pond This code identifies an area shown by symbols 323(A), 134.2(B), 538.1(C), or 2112.05(D). Generally labeled ""Tailings Pond."" The outline of the area is unattributed. 050 0111 Marsh, wetland, swamp, or bog This code identifies an area shown by symbols 431(A), 143.1(B), 543.1(C), or 2205.05(D). Any portion of a wetland that is overprinted with blue as in symbols 433(A), 143.2(B), 543.2(C), or 2205.06(D), or is overprinted with both blue and green as in symbols 143.4(B) or 543.4(C), is also coded submerged or sunken (050 0612). The green tint indicates woods, which are collected in the Vegetative Surface Cover category. Wetlands less than or equal to 0.10 inches in length may be shown on the graphic, but they are not collected in the DLG. The outline of the area, which follows the edge of the pattern or open window negative, is unattributed.  07/95  Hydrography  3.2-18   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding 050 0112 Mangrove area This code identifies an area shown by symbols 437(A); 144.1(B); 544.1(C); or 2205.08, 2402.06 (D). The outline of the area, which follows the edge of the pattern or open window negative, is unattributed. 050 0113 Rice field This feature is no longer collected. 050 0114 Cranberry bog This code identifies an area shown by symbols 438(A), 141.36(B), 541.49(C), or 2205.09(D). Must be labeled ""Cranberry Bog."" The outline of the area is unattributed. Internal separators may be shown on the map, but are not collected in the DLG. 050 0115 Flat (tidal, sand, gravel, mud, etcetera) This code identifies a number of features that fall into the general category of flat (foreshore flats, areas that uncover within or alongside reefs, and the area between the shoreline and sounding datum line on topographicbathymetric editions). On topographic editions, these features are shown by symbols 232(A), 517.1(C), or 2113.01(D). On topographic-bathymetric editions, flats are shown by symbols 135.7(B) or 535.10(C). Areas that uncover within or alongside reefs, which may be shown by either black sand pattern or brown tint, depending on whether the edition is topographic or topographic-bathymetric, are collected as flats. If a reef encircles an area and the closed portion of the reef symbol points outward, then the area within the reef uncovers (even though it may be shown with the blue water symbology); digitize the area within the reef and assign it the flat code. Do not add the code for the larger hydrographic feature in which the flat occurs, since the blue tint should have been cleared within the reef. Except as just noted, any area of flat overprinted with blue tint is also assigned the code of the larger hydrographic feature in which it occurs.  07/95  Hydrography  3.2-19   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding If the area is labeled boulder, sand, gravel, rock, mud, shell, or coral, also add the appropriate descriptive code (see codes 050 0630 through 050 0636). Do not apply this code to sand dunes, sand in open water (see 050 0423), or beach areas on dry land. The outline of the area is coded shoreline (050 0200), apparent shoreline (050 0207), sounding datum line (050 0208) or reef (050 0422). If the outline of the area is not symbolized, it is unattributed. 050 0116 Bay, estuary, gulf, ocean, or sea This code identifies a seaward area of water. Where a double-line stream enters a bay, estuary, gulf, ocean, or sea, a closure line (050 0202) is digitized to separate the stream from the seaward area of water. The line is placed where the conformation of the land and water make the division obvious, or, if no division is obvious, where the stream reaches a width of 1 nautical mile (6,080 feet) with no further constrictions. Where a gut adjoins a bay, estuary, gulf, ocean, or sea, a closure line (050 0202) is digitized to separate the gut from the seaward area of open water. The outline of the area is manmade shoreline (050 (050 0207), sounding datum (050 0209), or closure line coded shoreline (050 0200), 0201), apparent shoreline (050 0208), low-water line (050 0202).  This code is not used for named bays on streams and lakes. Such embayments are simply collected as part of the stream or lake on which they occur. 050 0117 Shoal This code identifies a 243(A), or 512.142(C). labeled. shoal area shown by symbols Generally named, but may be  When collecting from topographic editions, the outline of the area is coded limiting danger line (050 0206). When collecting from topographic-bathymetric editions, the outline of the area, which is indicated by a bathymetric contour, is collected as an unattributed line.  07/95  Hydrography  3.2-20   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding The shoal area is also assigned the code of the larger hydrographic feature in which it occurs. This code does not apply to 1:100,000-scale maps. 050 0118 Soda evaporator This code identifies each section of an evaporator shown by symbols 439(A), 141.15(B), 541.27(C), or 2205.10(D). Must be labeled ""Soda Evaporator."" The outline of the area and any internal separators are unattributed. 050 0119 Duck Pond This code identifies an area shown by symbols 141.17(B), or 541.29(C). Must be labeled ""Duck Pond."" The outline of the area and any internal separators are unattributed. 050 0120 Void area The area beyond the national boundary is coded as a void area to distinguish it from the background area. The outline of the void area is unattributed, unless it is defined by a symbolized feature in the Hydrography category. 050 0121 Obstruction area in water area This code identifies an obstruction area in a water area shown with a double dashed line as in symbols 245(A), 512.143(C), or 2113.06(D). Must be labeled ""Cable Area,"" ""Pipeline Area,"" ""Cable-Pipeline Area,"" or ""Pipeline Obstruction Area."" The portion the dashed (050 0202) ends. The the larger of the outline of the area that is shown with symbology is unattributed, and closure lines are collected to close off the open end or obstruction area is also assigned the code of hydrographic feature in which it occurs.  This code does not apply to 1:100,000-scale maps.  07/95  Hydrography  3.2-21   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding 050 0122 Gut A gut is a channel that is influenced by the tide of the body of water into which it flows, and within which the direction of water flow alternates with the rise and fall of the tide. Although some portion of almost every hydrographic feature that connects to a bay, estuary, gulf, ocean, or sea technically meets this definition, this code is only used in coastal areas where the nontidal direction of flow cannot be determined readily and confidently. These are generally fairly extensive areas of marsh, wetland, swamp, or bog (050 0111) and/or lowlying land, intersected by a network of interconnecting water bodies. Named bayous, legs, narrows, slough, slues, creeks, inlets, or passages are often indicators of tidal influence on direction of flow. The landward extent of a gut is wherever the direction of flow can be determined readily and confidently. This is typically at or near the lowest contour. Where a doubleline stream enters a gut a closure line (050 0202) is digitized to separate the stream from the gut. The seaward extent of a gut is where open water begins. A closure line is digitized to separate the gut from the bay, estuary, gulf, ocean, or sea. Typically a gut is collected as a single fairly extensive area; the shoreline around all of the interconnecting water bodies is collected and the entire water area is collected as a single area. The individual water bodies and channels within a gut are not closed off from one another, unless they are features distinct from the gut. For example, the pipeline canals shown on maps of gulf coast oil fields must be closed off from the surrounding gut and collected as ditch or canal (050 0414). The outline of the area is manmade shoreline (050 (050 0207), sounding datum (050 0209), or closure line 050 0123 Drydock chamber A drydock consists of a rectangular basin, a gate, and various walls. This code identifies only the drydock chamber, which is collected as an area. The gate at the end of the drydock chamber is collected as a line using code 050 0409; this line connects the side walls and 07/95 Hydrography 3.2-22 coded shoreline (050 0200), 0201), apparent shoreline (050 0208), low-water line (050 0202).   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding passes through the apex of the gate symbol. If the side walls are parallel to one another, this line is perpendicular to the sidewalls. However, if the side walls are not parallel to one another, this line is parallel to an imaginary line that passes through the endpoints of both legs of the gate symbol. The walls that form the chamber of the drydock, shown on the map with black lines, are collected as manmade shoreline (050 0201). The drydock chamber is also assigned the code of the larger hydrographic feature in which it occurs. 050 0124 Filtration pond This code identifies an area related to purification and distribution of water, which may be shown by symbols 178(A), 112.5(B), 512.59(C), or 2205.13(D). Generally If labeled ""Filtration Pond"" or ""Filtration Bed."" unlabeled, may still be identifiable as a filtration pond because of proximity to a filtration plant or waterworks. The outline of the area and any internal separators are unattributed. 050 0125 Foul ground This code identifies an area shown by a treatment similar to that in symbol 240(A), where the holding qualities for an anchor are poor, or where danger exists of striking or fouling the ground or other obstructions. Must be labeled ""Foul Ground"" or ""Foul Area."" The outline of the area, which is indicated by a bathymetric contour, is collected as an unattributed line. The foul ground area is also assigned the code of the larger hydrographic feature in which it occurs. This code is used only when collecting from topographicbathymetric editions. This code does not apply to 1:100,000-scale maps. 050 0126 Mine danger area This code identifies unexploded ordnance. an area having a danger from The symbolization is similar to  07/95  Hydrography  3.2-23   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding that for shoal area--see symbols 243(A), or 512.142(C). Must be labeled to indicate danger from explosives. The outline of the area, which is indicated by a bathymetric contour, is collected as an unattributed line. The mine danger area is also assigned the code of the larger hydrographic feature in which it occurs. This code is used only when collecting from topographicbathymetric editions. This code does not apply to 1:100,000-scale maps.  3.2.4  Line Attribute Codes 050 0200 Shoreline This code identifies a natural shoreline shown by symbols 400(A), 141.1(B), 541.1(C), or 2203.01(D). This code is also used to define the shorelines of double-line streams and ditches when the direction of flow cannot be determined (when direction of flow can be determined, use codes 050 0605 and 050 0606, rather than this code). 050 0201 Manmade shoreline This code identifies a constructed shoreline shown by a black line. Although breakwaters, jetties, piers, docks, causeways, and wharfs are collected in the Manmade Features category (see code 200 0466) any portion of a single-line breakwater, jetty, pier, dock, causeway, or wharf that defines the shoreline (that is, has water on one side and land on the other) is assigned the manmade shoreline code. When a breakwater, jetty, pier, dock, causeway, or wharf is collected as an area, any portion of the outline that is symbolized as manmade shoreline is collected as manmade shoreline. Although covered piers and wharfs are collected in the Manmade Features category as buildings (general case), any portion of the perimeter of a covered pier or wharf that bounds water is collected as manmade shoreline.  07/95  Hydrography  3.2-24   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding 050 0202 Closure line This codes identifies a line segment digitized to form the closure of an areal feature whose outline is not explicitly symbolized. The most common uses of closure lines are to separate two or more areas that must be assigned different sets of attribute codes, and to separate double-line hydrographic features that flow into one another and are coded with right and left bank. For example, a closure line is used wherever a double-line stream enters a lake or pond, or a bay, estuary, gulf, ocean, or sea, or wherever a double-line stream enters another double-line stream (if either of the streams is coded with right and left bank). Digitize a closure line across the water body from one shoreline to the other shoreline at the place where it appears that one water body flows into the next. In complex areas, where it may not be clear which of one or more branches flows into the other, it does not matter which branch is closed with the closure line; select one. A closure line is also digitized to close off areas that have only a portion of the perimeter symbolized when the symbolized portion is collected as an unattributed line and the unsymbolized portion has not been suppressed because of symbol conflict with a higher order feature. For example, a channel is shown by dashed lines along its length; the channel ends are left unsymbolized. The portrayed dashed lines are collected as unattributed lines and the ends of the area are closed off with closure lines. 050 0203 Indefinite shoreline This code identifies a line shown by symbols 401, 415 (A); 141.3(B); 541.3(C); or 2203.02(D), which indicates that the shoreline cannot be definitely established. Note that on 1:24,000-scale quads compiled using older Part 6 symbology, the same symbol which is now used for indefinite shoreline was used for both indefinite shoreline and the shoreline of intermittent water bodies. Only apply this code to the outlines of areas as indicated in Appendix 3.2.A, and do not apply this code to the outline of intermittent or dry water bodies. 050 0204 Apparent limit This code is no longer used. 07/95 Hydrography 3.2-25   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding 050 0205 Outline of a Carolina bay This code identifies the outline of a Carolina bay as shown by symbols 401(A), 141.7(B), 541.17(C), or 2205.19(D). A Carolina bay is always collected as a line, even if the outline forms a closed ellipse, so the interior area is not assigned an attribute code unless it is a hydrographic feature in its own right. Because a Carolina bay is not collected as an area the codes for upper origin at water body (050 0002), entering water body (050 0004), and exiting water body (050 0005) are not used in conjunction with this feature. 050 0206 Limiting danger line This code identifies a line which represents the limit of an area considered to be dangerous for navigation. An example is shown by symbol 244(A). This code is used only when collecting from topographic editions; on topographic-bathymetric editions bathymetric contours indicate the extent of areas dangerous for navigation. Only limiting danger lines related to rocks (050 0410), shoals (050 0117), and wreckage (which is collected in the Manmade Features category using codes 200 0467 and 200 0468) are collected. See the individual coding description for instructions on collecting the feature within the limiting danger line. The area within a limiting danger line is also assigned the code of the larger hydrographic feature in which it occurs. 050 0207 Apparent shoreline This code identifies a line shown by symbols 141.2(B) or 541.2(C), which represents a coastal shoreline in areas of marsh, grass, mangrove, or other similar marine vegetation. This symbol is shown at the outer edge of vegetation, instead of the mean high-water line. This code is used only when collecting from topographicbathymetric editions.  07/95  Hydrography  3.2-26   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding 050 0208 Sounding datum This code identifies a line shown by symbols 141.40(B) and 541.59(C), which represents the starting elevation (0) for bathymetric contours and is the mean lower lowwater line. This code is used only when collecting from topographicbathymetric editions. 050 0209 Low-water line This which water limit areas high 050 0210 code identifies a line shown by symbol 546.1(C), represents the mean low-water or mean lower lowline. The low-water line is shown as the lower of uncontrolled inundation areas in flat coastal where natural and periodic flooding occurs and the water line cannot be located.  Airboat trail This codes identifies a line shown by symbols 141.9(B) and 541.16(C). Generally named, but may be labeled ""Airboat Trail."" Canoe trails or wilderness waterways, also shown by these symbols, are not collected in the DLG.  050 0299  Processing line This code is described in section 3.0.6.3.  3.2.5  Single-Point Attribute Codes 050 0300 Spring This code identifies a spring shown by symbols 427(A), 141.25(B), 541.40(C), or 2205.03(D). Must be labeled ""Spring."" The spring is digitized at the center of the circular part of the symbol, and the tail is ignored. Unless the center of the circle falls directly on a line collected in this category, the spring is collected as a degenerate line. When the spring falls directly on a stream it is collected as a node, and the general alignment of the  07/95  Hydrography  3.2-27   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding stream, rather than the tail symbol, is followed when digitizing the stream. Use this code in conjunction with code 050 0001 if the spring is the upper origin of the stream. 050 0301 Nonflowing well This code identifies a well shown by symbols 426(A), 141.26(B), 541.39(C), or 2205.02(D). Must be labeled ""Well."" 050 0302 Flowing Well This code identifies a well shown by symbols 426(A), 141.26(B), 541.39(C), or 2205.02(D). Must be labeled ""Flowing Well"" or ""Artesian Well."" 050 0303 Riser A riser is a vertical overflow pipe controlling the water level in a reservoir, and is shown by symbols 198(A), 112.1(B), 512.72(C), or 2111.03(D). Must be labeled ""Riser."" 050 0304 Geyser This code identifies a special type of spring that ejects hot water or steam periodically, shown by symbols 426, 427(A), 141.25, 141.26 (B), 541.39, 541.40 (C), or 2205.02, 2205.03 (D). Must be labeled ""Geyser,"" ""Gas Vent,"" ""Mud Pot,"" ""Fumarole,"" or ""Steam Vent."" 050 0305 Windmill This code identifies a windmill shown by symbols 199(A), 112.3(B), 512.69(C), or 2111.04(D). If the label indicates the well is dry or salt, also assign code 050 0608 or 050 0614. The windmill is digitized at the point where the arms of the symbol cross, or on older symbology, at the center of the circle. 050 0306 Cistern This feature is no longer collected.  07/95  Hydrography  3.2-28   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding 3.2.6 General Purpose Attribute Codes 050 0400 Rapids This code identifies a rapids shown by symbols 442, 443 (A); 141.31, 141.32 (B); 541.53, 541.54 (C); or 2205.16, 2205.17 (D). Generally labeled ""Rapids,"" but may be named. On a single-line stream, if the upstream and downstream tick are less than 0.02 inch apart, collect the rapids as a node equidistant between the ticks. If the upstream and downstream tick are 0.02 inch or more apart, or if several ticks (often irregularly spaced) are shown, the rapids is collected as a line, by assigning the section of stream between the ticks this code in addition to the stream code (050 0412). Use your best judgement in determining whether to collect a particular section of stream as a single long rapids or a series of short rapids. Factors to consider include the distance between ticks, and the placement of the ""Rapids"" label. On a double-line stream, a rapids is always collected as an area. If the rapids extends completely across the stream, unattributed lines are digitized from bank to bank along the upstream and downstream edges of the rapids. If the rapids does not extend completely across the stream, an unattributed line is digitized along the extent of the rapids. The banks of the stream are collected as right and left bank, shoreline, manmade shoreline, or indefinite shoreline, as appropriate. The rapids area is also assigned the stream code (050 0412). 050 0401 Falls This code identifies a falls shown by symbols 440, 441 (A); 141.29, 141.30 (B); 541.51, 541.52 (C); or 2205.14, 2205.15 (D). Generally labeled ""Falls,"" but may be named. On a single-line stream, a falls is collected as a node. On a double-line stream, a falls is collected as a line that extends from one shoreline to another. If the falls is symbolized by a pattern of ticks parallel to the shore, as in symbols 440(A), 141.29(B), 541.51(C), or 2205.14(D), the line is digitized along the upstream edge of the pattern of ticks.  07/95  Hydrography  3.2-29   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding 050 0402 Gravel pit or quarry filled with water A gravel pit or quarry filled with water is collected as a lake or pond (050 0421). This code is no longer used. 050 0403 Gaging station This code identifies a gaging station, shown by symbols 200(A), 112.45(B), 512.113(C), or 2111.05(D). If the center collected in collected as a collected as a of the symbol falls directly on a line this category, the gaging station is node. Otherwise, the gaging station is degenerate line.  If the gaging station is labeled ""Tide Gage"" or ""Tidal Gage,"" also apply code 050 0637. 050 0404 Pumping station A pumping station may be shown as an individual building, or a group of structures. Must be named or labeled to indicate it is a pumping station. Use this code only for pumping stations associated with water (canals or ditches). Pumping stations associated with oil or gas are collected in the Pipelines, Transmission Lines, and Miscellaneous Transportation Features category. A pumping station is collected as a degenerate line if the area occupied by the individual building or group of structures is less than 120 feet in the shortest dimension. If the area occupied is 120 feet or more in the shortest dimension, it is collected as an area. When collected as an area, the outline of the area is unattributed. Individual buildings within the area are collected as general case buildings (200 0400) in the Manmade Features category. Do not collect individual pumps shown with a circle or a located object symbol.  050 0405  Water intake This code identifies a water intake shown by a variety of treatments. It may be shown by the located object symbol, 198(A), 512.72(C), or 2111.03(D), or by a small  07/95  Hydrography  3.2-30   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding outlined perimeter, either at the end of a pipeline, or by itself in open water. The intake itself, or the pipeline, may be labeled ""Water Intake,"" ""Waterworks Intake,"" or ""Intake."" The actual intake at the end of the pipeline may not be symbolized at all. Regardless of how it is shown, collect the intake as a degenerate line in open water, or as a node at the end of the pipeline. The pipeline itself is collected using code 050 0415. This code does not apply to 1:100,000-scale maps. 050 0406 Dam or weir This code identifies a feature shown by symbols 152, 153, 155 (A); 112.63, 112.65 (B); 511.20, 512.35, 512.37 (C); or 2108.01, 2108.02, 2108.04 (D). Generally labeled ""Dam,"" ""Weir,"" or ""Diversion Weir,"" but may be named. When shown as a single-line, the feature is collected as a line, and assigned this code. If the feature is carrying a road, as in symbols 155(A); 112.65(B); 511.20, 512.37 (C); or 2108.04(D), digitize it as the centerline equidistant between the two road casings. When shown to scale, the feature is collected as an area. The portion of the outline of the area that bounds water is coded manmade shoreline (050 0201), and the remainder of the outline is unattributed. The radiating digitized. lines within symbol 153(A) are not  When an earthen dam is shown by symbol 132.14(B), digitize a line along the dam and assign it the shoreline (050 0200) code. Dams of earthen construction shown by contours are collected only in the Hypsography category (except during limited update digital revision). 050 0407 Lock chamber A lock consists of a rectangular basin, gates, and various walls. This code identifies only the lock chamber. The gates at either end of the lock chamber are collected as gate (050 0409). The walls that form the chamber and any other wall-like structures associated with the lock, and shown on the map with black lines, are collected as manmade shoreline (050 0201).  07/95  Hydrography  3.2-31   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding If a single gate is shown on a single-line stream and labeled ""Lock,"" the gate symbol represents both the lock chamber and its gates. Digitize a node and assign it this code. If two gates (indicating the gates at both ends of the lock) are shown on a single-line stream and labeled ""Lock,"" collect each gate as a node using code 050 0409 and collect the line between the gates, which is the lock chamber, using this code in addition to the stream socde (050 0412). If the lock is shown to scale, digitize the lock as an area that is bounded by the gates on each end and by the walls that enclose the chamber. Use this code only on the area. Digitize each gate as a line using code 050 0409; this line connects the side walls and passes through the apex of the gate symbol. If the side walls are parallel to one another, this line is perpendicular to the side walls. However, if the side walls are not parallel to one another, this line is parallel to an imaginary line that passes through the endpoints of both legs of the gate symbol. Digitize the walls and other associated structures using code 050 0201 (manmade shoreline). If the lock is shown to scale, but the lock is shown only by gates across a double-line stream (there are no symbolized sidewalls), digitize the lock as an area that is bounded by the gates on each end and by the shorelines of the stream. Use this code only on the area. Digitize each gate as a line using code 050 0409; this line connects the side walls and passes through the apex of the gate symbol. If the side walls are parallel to one another, this line is perpendicular to the side walls. However, if the side walls are not parallel to one another, this line is parallel to an imaginary line that passes through the endpoints of both legs of the gate symbol. Digitize the shorelines using codes 050 0605 and 050 0606. When collected as an area, the lock chamber is also assigned the code of the larger hydrographic feature in which it occurs. 050 0408 Spillway This code identifies a constructed passage for surplus water to run over or around a dam. Since a spillway may 07/95 Hydrography 3.2-32   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding be shown by a variety of treatments and is not always labeled, considerable judgement may be involved in identifying and collecting this feature. If shown by a small circle or dot, the feature is collected as a degenerate line. If shown by either a perennial or intermittent single-line hydrographic feature, it is collected as a line. If shown by a black outline, collect the feature as an area; any portion of the outline of the area that forms the shoreline of an adjacent water body is collected as manmade shoreline (050 0201), and the remainder of the outline of the area is unattributed. If shown as an integral part of the dam, collect the feature as a node on the digitized line of the dam. If a spillway elevation is shown, add parameter code 05N ---- , which is used to encode the water surface elevation, to the node, point, line, or area. If the label ""Spillway Elevation NNNN,"" placed within the impounded water body, is the only indication that a spillway exists, do not collect a spillway; add the spillway elevation value to the impounded water body area instead. If another elevation value is shown for the impounded water body, do not collect the spillway elevation value. A spillway shown by contours is collected only as contour in the Hypsography category, even if labeled. If a spillway elevation is shown, collect it as described in the preceding paragraph. 050 0409 Gate This code identifies a variety of gates used to control or divert the flow of water. Common labels include ""Lock,"" ""Sluice,"" ""Drydock,"" ""Flood,"" ""Tidal,"" ""Head,"" or ""Check."" If shown by a > pointing upstream on a single-line hydrographic feature collect as a node at the apex of the symbol, unless it is labeled ""Lock."" See code 050 0407 for collection of a lock chamber symbolized by a single gate. If shown by a straight tick or black line on a single-line hydrographic feature collect as a node where the tick or line crosses the feature.  07/95  Hydrography  3.2-33   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding If shown by a > pointing upstream on a double-line hydrographic feature collect as a degenerate line at the apex of the symbol, unless it is a drydock gate or lock gate. If shown by a straight tick or black line on a double-line hydrographic feature, the entire extent of the tick or line is digitized and assigned this code. A drydock gate or lock gate shown by a > on a areal hydrographic feature is collected as a line that connects the side walls of the drydock or lock on either side of the gate, and passes through the apex of the gate symbol. If the side walls are parallel to one another, this line is perpendicular to the side walls. However, if the side walls are not parallel to one another, this line is parallel to an imaginary line that passes through the endpoints of both legs of the gate symbol. 050 0410 Rock This code identifies a rock shown by symbols 236, 237, 246 (A); 112.97, 112.99 (B); 512.136, 512.137, 512.158, 512.159, 512.160(C); or 2113.03(D), or an individual rock within a group of rocks shown by symbols 238(A); 112.98(B); 512.138, 512.159 (C); or 2113.04(D). Each rock is digitized as a degenerate line. A sunken rock shown by symbols 246(A), 112.99(B), or 512.160(C) is also assigned descriptive code 050 0612. If a dotted line is shown around a rock or rocks, as in symbols 236, 238 (A); old symbol 112.98(B); 512.136, 512.138 (C); or 2113.04(D), the line is collected as a limiting danger line (050 0206). 050 0411 Crevasse This code identifies a crevasse shown by symbol 453(A). If a crevasse field contains three or fewer crevasses, each individual crevasse is collected as a line. If a crevasse field contains four or more lines it is The outline of the field is collected as an area. unattributed.

Streams are shown by symbols 402 through 406, 408 (A); 141.4 through 141.6 (B); 541.4 through 541.9 (C); or 2202.01 through 2202.03, 2202.05 (D). See ""Feature Classification and Delineation"" in section 3.2.1 for guidance in distinguishing between a stream and a ditch or canal. If shown as perennial, as in symbols 402, 403 (A), 141.4(B), 541.4, 541.5 (C), or 2202.01(D), this code is used alone. Any stream shown by these symbols is collected as a perennial stream, even if named or labeled as a wash. If shown as intermittent, as in symbols 405, 406 (A), 141.6(B), 541.7, 541.8 (C), or 2202.02(D), add the descriptive code for intermittent (050 0610). Any stream shown by these symbols is collected as an intermittent stream, even if named or labeled as a wash. If shown as unsurveyed, as in symbols 408(A), 141.5(B), 541.10, 541.11 (C), or 2202.05(D), add the descriptive code for unsurveyed (050 0609). When a stream is collected as an area, the outline of the area is coded right bank (050 0605) and left bank (050 0606), shoreline (050 0200), manmade shoreline (050 0201), indefinite shoreline (050 0203), closure line (050 0202). (See section 3.2.1.3 on Line Attribute Codes for more information.) A submerged stream within an impounded water body, shown by dashed blue lines, is digitized as a separate area and assigned this code and the descriptive code for submerged or sunken (code 050 0612). The outline of the area is unattributed, except for the open ends, which are collected as closure lines (050 0202). 050 0413 Braided Stream This code identifies a braided stream, which is shown by a treatment generally similar to that in symbols 404(A), 541.6, 541.9 (C), or 2203.03(D). Although a braided stream is typically perennial in nature, at its prevailing stage it does not entirely cover its bed. Instead, it flows in a number of sub07/95 Hydrography 3.2-35   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding channels that expose island-like sand or gravel bars. The course of these sub-channels changes frequently. This code is only used when the braiding involves at least five sub-channels, or covers an extensive area at least one-quarter mile in width and one mile in length. The braided stream is collected as an area. The limit of the area on either side is the far bank of the outermost channel, or the limit of the sand or gravel stream bed, whichever extends furthest. These limiting lines are coded as right bank (050 0605) and left bank (050 0606). The upstream and downstream extent of the area is the point where the stream is unbraided, or insufficiently braided. The braided area is separated from a doubleline stream using closure lines (050 0202). If the braided area occurs on a single-line stream, the nodes where the stream enters and exits the braided area are coded 050 0004 and 050 0005, respectively. No streams (either single-line or double-line, intermittent or perennial) are collected within the braided area. The sand or gravel is collected in the Non-Vegetative Features category. The descriptive code for intermittent (050 0610) is never used in conjunction with this code, regardless of how the braided stream is symbolized on the map. 050 0414 Ditch or canal This code identifies any manmade, flowing water feature used for irrigation, drainage, or transportation shown by symbols 416 through 422 (A); 141.19, 141.20 (B); 541.31, 541.32 (C); or 2204.01 through 2204.06 (D). See ""Feature Classification and Delineation"" in section 3.2.1 for guidance in distinguishing between a stream and a ditch or canal. The descriptive code for intermittent (050 0610) is never used in conjunction with this code, regardless of how the ditch or canal is symbolized on the map. The only descriptive attribute codes used in conjunction with ditch or canal are underpassing (050 0617), overpassing (050 0602), and tunnel (050 0604). When a ditch or canal is collected as an area, the outline of the area is coded right bank (050 0605) and 07/95 Hydrography 3.2-36   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding left bank (050 0606), shoreline (050 0200), manmade shoreline (050 0201), indefinite shoreline (050 0203), closure line (050 0202). (See section 3.2.1.3 on Line Attribute Codes for more information.) If a canal is labeled ""Pipeline Canal,"" the canal is collected using this code. The pipeline, which carries oil, is collected in the Pipelines, Transmission Lines, and Miscellaneous Features category.  050 0415  Aqueduct or pipeline This code identifies features represented by symbols 416, 418, 419, 421, 423, 424, 425 (A); 141.19 through 141.23 (B); 541.31 through 541.36 (C); or 2204.01, 2204.03, 2204.04, 2204.06 through 2204.09 (D). Generally must be labeled ""Aqueduct"" or ""Pipeline,"" but some pipelines associated with water intakes may be labeled ""Water Intake,"" ""Waterworks Intake,"" or ""Intake."" (See code 050 0405 for coding of the intake itself, which is collected even if only the pipeline is symbolized on the map.) An aqueduct in a tunnel is shown by symbols 424(A), 141.23(B), 541.35(C), or 2204.08(D) regardless of size. The portion of the aqueduct that is in the tunnel is digitized as a line and assigned this code and the code for tunnel (050 0604). A feature shown by symbol 424(A) and labeled ""Water Tunnel"" is coded the same way. The only other descriptive attribute codes used in conjunction with aqueduct or pipeline are underground (050 0601), overpassing (050 0602), elevated (050 0603), submerged or sunken (050 0612), and underpassing (050 0617). Pipelines which carry gas or oil, shown in black on the map, are collected in the Pipelines, Transmission Lines, and Miscellaneous Transportation Features category. If a canal is as a ditch collected in Miscellaneous labeled ""Pipeline Canal,"" it is collected or canal (050 0414). The pipeline is the Pipelines, Transmission Lines, and Features category.  07/95  Hydrography  3.2-37   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding 050 0416 Flume This code identifies a feature shown by symbols 416, 418, 419, 421, 423, 425 (A); 141.19, 141.21, 141.22 (B); 541.31 through 541.34, 541.36 (C); or 2204.01, 2204.03, 2204.04, 2204.06, 2204.07, 2204.09 (D). Must be labeled ""Flume."" A flume is an open, inclined, artificial channel. No descriptive attribute codes are used in conjunction with flume. 050 0417 Penstock This code identifies a feature shown by symbols 423, 425 (A); 141.21(B); 541.34, 541.36 (C); or 2204.07, 2204.09 (D). Generally labeled ""Penstock."" If unlabeled, may still be identifiable based on context; a penstock is pipe conveying water from a canal or a dam into the turbine of a hydroelectric generating plant. If a pipe that conveys water into hydroelectric generating plant is 424(A), 141.23(B), or 2204.08(D), aqueduct or pipeline (050 0415) in a rather than a penstock. 050 0418 Siphon This code identifies a feature shown by symbols 452(A), 141.21(B), 541.41(C), or 2205.18(D). Must be labeled ""Siphon."" No descriptive attribute codes are used in conjunction with siphon. 050 0419 Channel This code identifies a dredged channel shown by symbols 444(A); 112.94, 141.34 (B); or 512.154 through 512.156, 541.15 C), or a named undredged channel shown by periodic labeling. A dredged collected outline of (050 0202) portion of channel shown as an area. the area is is digitized the outline. by parallel dashed lines is The symbolized portion of the unattributed. A closure line to close off any unsymbolized the turbine of a shown by symbols collect it as an tunnel (050 0604),  07/95  Hydrography  3.2-38   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding Any portion of a named waterway (generally the Intracoastal Waterway) that is undredged, and therefore shown only by periodic labeling, is collected as a line and assigned both this code and the undredged descriptive code (050 0639). The line is digitized following the course of the waterway and passing through the center line of the periodic occurrences of the label. On topographic editions, a channel area is shown with blue tint, and is therefore, also assigned the code of the larger hydrographic feature in which it occurs. On topographic-bathymetric editions, a channel area is cleared of tint, and therefore, is not assigned the code of the larger hydrographic feature in which it occurs. This code does not apply to the course of a submerged river in an impounded water body (see code 050 0412). 050 0420 Wash This code identifies a wash, which is a portion of a stream bed that is usually dry and contains water only during or after a rainstorm or snowmelt. A single-line wash shown by an irregular dotted brown line (similar to a stipple pattern) is normally collected as a line. However, where a single-line wash is shown as a channel through an areal wash it is not collected in the DLG. Any feature shown by symbols 409(A), 141.6(B), 541.13(C), or 2202.06(D) is collected as an intermittent stream, even if named or labeled as a wash. An areal wash is shown by brown sand pattern, as in symbols 317(A), 134.1(B), 534.3(C), or 2112.04(D). The outline of the area is unattributed. Since a wash is never perennial, any feature named or labeled as a wash, but symbolized as perennial, is collected as a stream (050 0412) rather than a wash. If any perennial streams, or several interlacing intermittent streams, are shown running through an area of brown sand pattern, the area may be a braided stream (see code 050 0413), or it may be an area of sand adjacent to a stream (such sand is collected in the NonVegetative Features category).  07/95  Hydrography  3.2-39   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding 050 0421 Lake or pond This code identifies a standing body of water with a predominantly natural shoreline. Lakes or ponds are shown by symbols 410, 411, 412, 414 (A); 141.12, 141.13, 141.14 (B); 541.23, 541.25, 541.26 (C); or 2203.03, 2203.04, 2203.05, 2203.06 (D). An artificially impounded water body with a predominantly natural shoreline is collected as a lake or pond, even if named or labeled as a reservoir or river. See ""Feature Classification and Delineation"" in section 3.2.1 for more information. If shown as perennial, as in symbols 410(A), 141.12(B), 541.23(C), or 2203.03(D), this code is used alone. If shown as perennial salt, as in symbols 411(A), 141.12(B), 541.23(C), or 2203.04(D), add the descriptive code for salt (050 0608). If shown as intermittent, as in symbols 412(A), 141.13(B), 541.26(C), or 2203.05(D), add the descriptive code for intermittent (050 0610). If shown as dry, as in symbols 414(A), 141.14(B), 541.25(C), or 2203.06(D), add the descriptive code for dry (050 0614).  When a lake or pond is collected as an area, the outline of the area is coded shoreline (050 0200), manmade shoreline (050 0201), or indefinite shoreline (050 0203). 050 0422 Reef This code identifies a reef shown by symbols 233, 234 (A); 135.8, 112.100 (B); 512.135, 512.161, 517.2, 517.3, 535.11 (C); or 2113.02(D). Except when collected as a degenerate line, a reef is collected as a line that connects the high points of the closed, outer portion of The appropriate descriptive code is the reef symbol. also added to the line to indicate whether the reef is rock (050 0633) or coral (050 0636). Areas that uncover within or alongside reefs, which may be shown by either black sand pattern or brown tint, depending on whether the edition is topographic or are collected as flats topographic-bathymetric, (050 0115). In addition, if a reef encircles an area and the closed portion of the reef symbol points outward, 07/95 Hydrography 3.2-40   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding then the area within the reef uncovers (even though it may be shown with the blue water symbology) and it is collected as flat. Do not add the code for the larger hydrographic feature in which the flat occurs, because the blue tint should have been cleared within the reef. If a reef encircles an area and the closed portion of the reef symbol points inward, then the area within the reef shown with the blue water symbology is a reef pool and is assigned the code for the larger hydrographic feature in which the reef occurs. 050 0423 Sand in open water The code identifies an area of sand in other than tidal waters, shown by symbols 322(A), 134.3(B), 534.4(C), or 2112.03(D). Where collected as an area, the outline of the area is unattributed. 050 0424 Spoil area, dredged area, or dump area This code identifies a feature shown by symbols 112.95(B) or 512.157(C), or by a dashed blue line. Must be labeled ""Spoil Area,"" ""Dredged Area,"" ""Dump Area,"" or ""Dump Site Area."" Where shown by a single dashed blue line that does not form a closed area, it is collected as a line. When shown by a single dashed blue line that does form a closed area, or by parallel dashed black lines, it is collected as an area. Where collected outline of the (050 0202) is portion of the as an area, the symbolized portion of the area is unattributed. A closure line digitized to close off any unsymbolized outline of the area.  Because a spoil area, dredged area, or dump area is cleared of blue tint, the area is not assigned the code of the larger hydrographic feature in which it occurs. This code is used only when collecting from topographicbathymetric editions.  07/95  Hydrography  3.2-41   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding 050 0425 Fish ladder This code describes a feature shown by symbol 512.39(C) or as a labeled section of a stream. Must be labeled ""Fish Ladder."" When shown by symbol 512.39(C), the feature is collected as an area. The outline of the area is coded shoreline (050 0200) or manmade shoreline (050 0201). The area is not assigned the code of the larger hydrographic feature, because the fish ladder is not actually part of the feature. The channels connecting the fish ladder to the stream are collected as ditch or canal (050 0414). If shown as a labeled section of a single-line stream, this feature is collected as a line. Unattributed nodes are digitized at the upstream and downstream limits of the ladder, and the segment of the stream between the nodes is assigned this code in addition to the stream code. If shown as a labeled section of a double-line stream, this feature is collected as an area. The upstream and downstream limits of the ladder are digitized as unattributed lines, and the section of the stream between those lines is assigned this code. The banks of the stream are coded as right bank (050 0605) and left bank (050 0606). The area is also assigned the code of the larger hydrographic feature on which it occurs. 050 0426 Holiday area This code identifies an area of inadequate or nonexistent survey data, shown by symbols 112.93(B) or 512.153(C). Must be labeled ""Holiday Area"" or ""No Data."" The symbolized portion of the outline of the area is unattributed. A closure line (050 0202) is collected to close off any unsymbolized portion of the outline of the area. Because a holiday area is cleared of blue tint, it is not assigned the code of the larger hydrographic feature in which it occurs. This code is used only when collecting from topographicbathymetric editions.  07/95  Hydrography  3.2-42   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding 3.2.7 Descriptive Attribute Codes 050 0601 Underground This code describes a feature labeled ""Underground,"" or an underground aqueduct or pipeline (050 0415) shown by symbols 423(A), 141.21(B), 541.34(C), or 2204.07(D). 050 0602 Overpassing This code describes the portion of a feature that passes over rather than intersects another feature, as indicated by wing ticks as in symbols 425(A), 141.22(B), 541.36(C) or 2204.09(D). This code is used only where wing ticks are present, and the code is applied only to the portion of the hydrographic feature between the wing ticks. Wherever wing ticks are present, this code rather than the elevated code (050 0603) is used, even if the feature is labeled as elevated. 050 0603 Elevated This code describes a ditch or canal (050 0414) or aqueduct or pipeline (050 0415) labeled ""Elevated."" If the portion of the feature labeled elevated is also indicated by wing ticks, as in symbols 425(A), 141.22(B), 541.36(C) or 2204.09(D), then use the overpassing code (050 0602) rather than this code. 050 0604 Tunnel This code describes the portion of a feature that is carried through a tunnel, shown by symbols 424(A), 141.23(B), 541.35(C), or 2204.08(D), or by the label ""Tunnel."" Since a tunnel is by definition underground or underpassing, codes 050 0601 or 050 0617 are not added to the portion of a feature coded tunnel. 050 0605 Right bank This code describes the limit of a double-line feature on the right side when facing downstream. It is used instead of shoreline code (050 0200). 050 0606 Left bank This code describes the limit of a double-line feature on the left side when facing downstream. It is used instead of shoreline code (050 0200). 07/95 Hydrography 3.2-43   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding 050 0607 Under construction This code describes a canal (050 0414) or dam (050 0406) labeled to indicate that it was under construction at the time the map was made. 050 0608 Salt This code describes any feature that is labeled ""Salt."" 050 0609 Unsurveyed This code describes an unsurveyed stream shown by symbols 408(A); 141.5(B); 541.10, 541.11 (C); or 2202.05(D). 050 0610 Intermittent This code describes any hydrographic feature that is shown as intermittent, as in symbols 405, 412 (A); 141.6, 141.13 (B); 541.7, 541.11, 541.26 (C); or 2202.02, 2203.05 (D). This code overrides the assumed default value of perennial. This code is not added to a ditch or canal (050 0414), or a braided stream (050 0413), regardless of how they are symbolized on the map. 050 0611 Abandoned or discontinued This code is no longer used. If a hydrographic feature is portrayed on the map as abandoned or discontinued, it is collected using all appropriate codes, but not specifically identified as abandoned or discontinued. 050 0612 Submerged or sunken This code describes any feature labeled ""Submerged"" or ""Sunken,"" or overprinted by blue tint to indicate that it is submerged, such as a marsh, or an old river course in an impounded water area. The outline of a submerged river course is digitized as an unattributed line. This code is not applied to channels (050 0419). 050 0613 Wooded Woods are collected only in the Vegetative Surface Cover category. This code is no longer used.  07/95  Hydrography  3.2-44   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding 050 0614 Dry This code describes any feature labeled ""Dry,"" or symbolized as dry, such as a dry lake, shown by symbols 134.7(B) or 534.5(C). 050 0615 Mineral or hot This code describes any well, spring, or water source that is labeled to indicate the water is hot or contains minerals. Includes mineral, hot, sulphur, alkali. 050 0616 Navigable - transportation This code is no longer used. 050 0617 Underpassing This code describes a feature or a section of a feature that passes underneath, rather than intersects, another feature. This code is used only when the symbol for the underpassing feature has been broken back from the overpassing feature to indicate that it is underpassing. This code is generally applied to a linear feature, such as an aqueduct under a canal. The underpassing segment is also assigned the code or codes of the hydrographic feature on which it occurs. 050 0618 Earthen construction This code is no longer used, except during limited update digital revision. Dams of earthen construction shown by contours are collected only in the Hypsography category. 050 0619 Interpolated elevation This code is no longer used. Only water surface elevations that are printed on the map are collected. 050 062Decimal fractions Descriptive attribute codes 050 0620 through 050 0629 are used to represent decimal fractions of feet or meters. They are used only in conjunction with the water surface elevation or river mile mark parameter attribute codes when the elevations or river mile marks are expressed to decimal fractions. It is not necessary to distinguish between feet and meters, because the unit of measurement is encoded in the associated parameter code.

This code is added to any feature collected as a node, line, point, or area that is shown in purple on the graphic. If a feature is shown with purple tint or pattern, this code is added to the area point. If the line that bounds an area is shown in purple, this code is added to the line, even if the line would otherwise be unattributed. This code is not added to closure lines (050 0202), since these lines do not appear on the map and therefore are never shown in purple. An unattributed line is used to separate the photorevised portion of a water body from the non-photorevised portion. If a photorevised water body completely encloses the original water body shown in blue (that is, the entire shoreline is shown in purple) the original water body is not distinguished from the photorevised portion in the DLG; the entire water body is collected as photorevised. 05N ---Water surface elevation This parameter is used printed on the map.

If a value in feet exceeds 9999, only the final four digits are encoded in the minor code. To express elevations in decimal feet or meters, use this parameter code in conjunction with descriptive attribute codes 050 0620 through 050 0629. Examples: 421 feet is coded as 051 0421 10014 feet is coded as 054 0014 101.5 meters is coded as 052 0101, 050 0625 -3 meters is coded as 057 0003  053 0---  Angle of rotation This code is no longer used.  055 0---  River mile mark This parameter code is used both to identify a river mile mark, as shown by symbol 512.109(C), and to encode the mile value. A mile value is encoded for each symbolized mile mark, although on the map the mile value may be printed only at intervals, such as every fifth mark. The mile mark is digitized at the center of the cross symbol. If the cross occurs directly on a line that is digitized in the Hydrography category, the mile mark is digitized as a node on that line. Otherwise the mile mark is digitized as a degenerate line. Enter the mile value in the minor code flush right. If the river mile mark is expressed to a decimal fraction, use this code for the nondecimal value and code 050 0620 through 050 0629 for the decimal value.  07/95  Hydrography  3.2-48   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding 058 0000 Best estimate of classification or position This code is no longer used. 059 00-Coincident feature This code is no longer used.  07/95  Hydrography  3.2-49   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding Appendix 3.2.A - Attribution of Outlines of Hydrographic Areas  APPENDIX 3.2.A Attribution of Outlines of Hydrographic Areas  07/95  Hydrography  3.2.A-1   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding Appendix 3.2.A - Attribution of Outlines of Hydrographic Areas The following list provides unambiguous information on the attribution of the outlines of hydrographic features collected as areas. This list, which is arranged alphabetically, includes features from the list of area attribute codes, and those features from the list of general purpose attribute codes that may be collected as areas. In general, if the outline of the feature is always shown on the map with the same symbology, the line is unattributed because it is in essence a symbol. Follow these guidelines even if an individual feature on a map is outlined using a nonstandard symbol. In some cases, the outlines of two hydrographic features may coincide, so the instructions for coding of the outlines of both features must be considered. Also, if part of the outline of an area is formed by another hydrographic feature, that portion of the outline is collected as that feature.  07/95  Hydrography  3.2.A-2   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding Appendix 3.2.A - Attribution of Outlines of Hydrographic Areas  Area  Outline of area  Alkali flat Aquaculture pond  unattributed line unattributed line (including internal separators) right bank/left bank, shoreline, manmade shoreline, indefinite shoreline, closure line unattributed line shoreline, manmade shoreline, apparent shoreline, sounding datum line, low-water line, closure line right bank/left bank, closure line unattributed line, closure line unattributed line unattributed line (do not collect internal separators) unattributed line unattributed line, shoreline, manmade shoreline right bank/left bank, shoreline, manmade shoreline, indefinite shoreline, closure line manmade shoreline and gate unattributed line (including internal separators) unattributed line (including internal separators) right bank/left bank, shoreline, unattributed line (for upstream/downstream limits), manmade shoreline  Aqueduct or pipeline  Area to be submerged Bay, estuary, gulf, ocean, or sea  Braided stream Channel Covered reservoir Cranberry bog  Crevasse Dam or weir Ditch or canal  Drydock chamber Duck pond  Filtration pond  Fish ladder  07/95  Hydrography  3.2.A-3   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding Appendix 3.2.A - Attribution of Outlines of Hydrographic Areas  Area  Outline of area  Flat  shoreline, apparent shoreline, sounding datum line, unattributed line, reef right bank/left bank, shoreline, manmade shoreline, closure line unattributed line unattributed line  Flume  Foul ground Glacier or permanent snow field Gut  manmade shoreline, shoreline, apparent shoreline, sounding datum line, low water line, closure line unattributed line, closure line unattributed line (including internal separators) unattributed line (if controlled), low-water line (if uncontrolled) shoreline, manmade shoreline, indefinite shoreline, closure line right bank/left bank, manmade shoreline, gate unattributed line unattributed line  Holiday area Industrial water impoundment Inundation area  Lake or pond  Lock chamber Mangrove area Marsh, wetland, swamp, or bog Mine danger area Obstruction in water area Pumping station Rapids  unattributed line unattributed line, closure line unattributed line unattributed line (for upstream/downstream limits), right bank/left bank, shoreline,manmade shoreline, indefinite shoreline  07/95  Hydrography  3.2.A-4   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding Appendix 3.2.A - Attribution of Outlines of Hydrographic Areas  Area  Outline of area  Reservoir Salt evaporator  shoreline or manmade shoreline unattributed line (including internal separators) unattributed line shoreline or manmade shoreline (including internal separators) limiting danger line or unattributed line unattributed line (including internal separators) manmade shoreline, unattributed line unattributed line, closure line  Sand in open water Sewage disposal pond  Shoal Soda evaporator  Spillway Spoil area, dredged area, or dump area Stream  right bank/left bank, shoreline, manmade shoreline, indefinite shoreline, closure line unattributed line unattributed line unattributed line  Tailings pond Void area Wash  07/95  Hydrography  3.2.A-5   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding 3.3 VEGETATIVE SURFACE COVER--MAJOR CODE 070 This category includes woods or brush-wood, scrub, orchards or plantations, scattered trees, and vineyards. Additional vegetative features that are associated with wetland or submerged areas, such as marshes and swamps, mangrove, and cranberry bogs, are collected under Hydrography (major code 050). The photorevision code is not applicable to Vegetative Surface Cover. Normally photorevised vegetation is shown in green, rather than purple, and, therefore, it is not distinguishable as photorevised.

While numerous other nonvegetative features exist, they are digitized in other categories that are more applicable. For example, features that are the result of human activity, such as mines, are digitized in Manmade Features (major code 200), and features associated with water, such as glaciers, are digitized in Hydrography (major code 020). It is important to note that most non-vegetative features are shown with the same, or very similar, pattern. At 1:24,000 scale, gravel areas and glacial moraines are shown using pattern USGS 22. The context and label must be used to decide if an area is a gravel area or glacial moraine. At 1:100,000 scale, only one pattern (USGS 17) is used for all of the features in this category, except lava. The context and label must always be used to decide which is the appropriate code to use. On provisional edition maps, all of the features in this category are outlined with a dashed symbol. The context and label must always be used to decide which is the appropriate code to use.  3.4.1  General Principles  3.4.1.1  Node Attribute Codes There are no node attribute codes.  3.4.1.2  Area Attribute Codes Non-vegetative surface features are shown on the map as an area of pattern or tint.

The international boundaries of the United States were established through treaties made by the nations concerned, and State boundaries have been defined by the Congress of the United States. Subdivisions within the States, counties or county equivalents, can be further divided into minor civil subdivisions. Incorporated places include cities, towns, and villages. Incorporated places can be within, exclusive of, or coextensive with, the county or minor civil division in which they are located. Quadrangle maps show only subdivisions that are reasonably stable. Refer to Appendix 3.5.A for more specific information on the civil divisions of the States, the District of Columbia, the Outlying Areas of the United States, the Freely Associated States, and the Trust Territory. In addition to civil boundaries, a variety of reservations are also collected in this category. Appendix 3.5.B provides generic examples of the kinds of reservations that are associated with each reservation type, regardless of jurisdiction. Appendix 3.5.C is divided into separate parts for national, State, and county, and lists the DLG-3 code used to collect each kind of reservation. Where boundaries of two or more units of different rank coincide, only the symbol for the higher ranking unit boundary is shown on the map. Boundaries are ranked in the following order: national; State, commonwealth, and territory; county, parish, borough, and municipio; township or minor civil division; city or incorporated place; Federal reservation; other reservation; large park and small park.  3.5.1.1  Node Attribute Codes There are no general principles that apply to the node attribute code.  3.5.1.2  Area Attribute Codes All areas in this category are attributed. The codes for Canada, Mexico, and open water are independent codes, and no other codes are applied to these areas. Coastal water areas may occasionally require only the State FIPS code. All land areas require State and county FIPS codes as a minimum, and additional codes as needed to  07/95  Boundaries  3.5-1   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding describe the area. For example, a small park in an incorporated city which is part of an active township will be coded with State FIPS, county FIPS, incorporated city code, township code, Township FIPS, and the small park code. National, State, and county reservations are all shown with the same symbology. If the reservation boundary also has pink stippling, it is a national reservation; however, the pink stippling has not always been used, so many national areas are shown without the stippling. The name of the reservation may indicate jurisdiction but often does not. Ancillary sources may be required to determine jurisdiction. It is not uncommon for a reservation to be shown as completely overlapping, partially overlapping, or entirely within another reservation. It may be difficult to determine if the area in question is part of just one of the reservations, or both. However, for forests and parks, any area within the proclamation boundaries is considered to be part of the forest or park. Therefore, any other reservations shown within a forest or park are coded with both the forest or park code appropriate for the jurisdiction, and any additional reservation code or codes that apply. Areas normally shown with the reservation boundary symbology may be shown with a dashed line if the area is quite small. Hawaii is divided into five counties. Four of the counties are subdivided into minor civil divisions called districts. Ahupuaas and homesteads reflect historical ownership patterns and although they are not civil boundaries, they are important features and are collected. The boundaries of ilis and leles, further subdivisions of ahupuaas, are not collected.  3.5.1.3  Line Attribute Codes Boundary lines are not attributed if they are implicitly defined by the bounding area. For example, a civil township boundary is deducible as such from the area codes on either side of it. However, boundary lines that are shown in purple have 090 0000 (photorevised feature) attached to the line segment itself.  3.5.1.4  Single-Point Attribute Codes There are no general principles that apply to the single-point attribute code.  07/95  Boundaries  3.5-2   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding 3.5.1.5 General Purpose Attribute Codes There are no general purpose attribute codes.  3.5.1.6  Descriptive Attribute Codes There are no descriptive attribute codes.  3.5.1.7  Parameter Attribute Codes There are no general attribute codes. principles that apply to the parameter  07/95  Boundaries  3.5-3   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding 3.5.1.8 List of Boundaries Attribute Codes o Node attribute codes 090 0001 090 0002 o Boundary monument Boundary turning point  Area attribute codes 000 0000 090 0100 090 0101 090 090 090 090 090 090 090 090 090 090 090 090 090 090 090 090 090 090 090 090 090 090 090 0103 0104 0105 0106 0107 0108 0109 0110 0111 0113 0129 0130 0131 0132 0133 0134 0135 0136 0150 0151 0197 0198 0199 Outside area Civil township, district, precinct, or barrio Incorporated city, village, town, borough, or hamlet National park National forest National wildlife area National wilderness area Indian reservation Military reservation Non-military government reservation Federal prison Miscellaneous Federal reservation Land grant Miscellaneous State reservation State park State wildlife area State forest State prison Miscellaneous county reservation Ahupuaa (Hawaii) Hawaiian homestead Large park (city, county, or private) Small park (city, county, or private) Canada Mexico Open water  o  Line attribute codes 090 090 090 090 090 090 0200 0201 0202 0203 0204 0299 Approximate boundary Indefinite or approximate boundary Disputed boundary Historical line Boundary closure line Processing line  o  Single-point attribute codes 090 0301 Reference monument for boundary point Boundaries 3.5-4  07/95   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding o General purpose attribute codes There are no general purpose codes o Descriptive attribute codes There are no descriptive codes o Parameter attribute codes 090 091 092 093 0000 00-0--00-Photorevised feature State or State equivalent FIPS code County or county equivalent FIPS code Civil township or civil township equivalent FIPS code, first two digits Civil township or civil township equivalent FIPS code, last three digits Monument number Alphabetic portion of any monument number Best estimate of classification or position Coincident feature  094 0--095 096 098 099 ---XXYY 0000 00--  07/95  Boundaries  3.5-5   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding 3.5.2 Node Attribute Codes 090 0001 Boundary monument This code identifies a physical monument shown by symbols 222, 223, 225, 226 (A); 512.104, 512.105, 512.107 (C); or 2102.08, 2102.09 (D) or any other point represented with a black boundary monument symbol. Boundary monuments with geodetic position are also collected in the Survey Control and Markers category. International boundaries will occasionally have points on the boundary, over water, which are depicted with the located object symbol and numbered. These points are to be collected and given this code. These points will also have a reference monument in the vicinity (see code 090 0301).

Codes 090 0111 and 090 0129 are not used for Hawaiian homesteads because they are not reservations. More explanation of this code is given in section 3.5.1. 090 0150 Large park (city, county, or private) This code identifies a point placed within a regional, city, county, or private park delineated by symbols 207(A), 112.78, 112.79 (B), 512.128(C), or 2107.05(D). If the boundary is not symbolized, the park may be delineated by cleared tint or by corner ticks indicating what part of the cleared area is used as a park. This feature will always be labeled ""Park"" or named. In some cases, named parks may have the term field in their name, rather than the term park (for example, ""Farwell Field""). Some judgement must be used in determining if a named field is a park or an athletic field (which is collected in the Manmade Features category, using code 200 0122).  07/95  Boundaries  3.5-9   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding In digital revision, use this code only for county parks greater than or equal to 0.5 square miles. 090 0151 Small park (city, county, or private) This code identifies a point placed within a regional, city, county, or private park delineated by symbols 209(A), 512.129(C), or 2107.06(D). If the boundary is not symbolized, the park may be delineated by cleared tint or by corner ticks indicating what part of the cleared area is used as a park. This feature will always be labeled ""Park"" or named. In some cases, named parks may have the term field in their name, rather than the term park (for example, ""Farwell Field""). Some judgement must be used in determining if a named field is a park or an athletic field (which is collected in the Manmade Features category, using code 200 0122). This code does not apply to collection from 1:100,000scale maps; see code 090 0150. In digital revision, use this code for all city and private parks, and for county parks less than 0.5 square miles. 090 0197 Canada This code identifies a point placed within the boundaries of Canada. The boundary between Canada and the United States is delineated by symbols 202(A), 112.74(B), 512.123(C), or 2107.01(D). 090 0198 Mexico This code identifies a point placed within the boundaries of Mexico. The boundary between Mexico and the United States is delineated by symbols 202(A), 112.74(B), 512.123(C), or 2107.01(D). 090 0199 Open water This code identifies a point placed within water areas on coastal quadrangles, where State boundaries are dropped at the shoreline.  07/95  Boundaries  3.5-10   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding 3.5.4 Line Attribute Codes 090 0200 Approximate boundary This code is no longer used. Approximate boundaries are collected using code 090 0201. 090 0201 Indefinite or approximate boundary This code identifies a boundary for which the accuracy of location does not meet National Map Accuracy Standards for well-defined features. Indefinite boundaries of county rank or higher appear on 1:100,000- and 1:24,000-scale maps with standard symbolization but reduced to one-half the specified lineweight and labeled ""Indefinite Boundary"" or ""Approximate Boundary."" Those of less than county rank are shown with normal symbolization and lineweight and are labeled ""Indefinite Boundary."" Indefinite boundaries are shown by symbols 212(A), 112.80(B), or 512.130(C). 090 0202 Disputed boundary This code identifies a State, county, or national reservation boundary which is unmarked and cannot be located on the ground from other substantial evidence, which has a disputed location, or for which the recorded description cannot be reconciled with local conditions. Disputed boundaries are labeled ""Indefinite"" on the map with an additional marginal note. 090 0203 Historical line This code applies only to the Von Schmidt line along the California and Nevada border. Any other historical lines shown on the map (such as the boundaries of old Indian, military, or lighthouse reservations) are not collected in the DLG, unless they limit public lands, in which case they are collected in the U.S. Public Land Survey System. 090 0204 Boundary closure line This code identifies lines digitized to complete unclosed boundaries. The boundary closure line code is used wherever a boundary line is not shown on the map. The only exception is where a boundary is broken for a label, such as in the center of a stream; in this case the unattributed line is carried through the center of label.  07/95  Boundaries  3.5-11   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding Where a boundary is not shown on the graphic because of a symbol conflict with a higher order feature such as a shoreline, road, or railroad, the shoreline, the centerline of the road, or the railroad is followed and assigned the boundary closure line code. If a boundary line comes up to another feature, and the symbolized boundary line turns the corner and is then dropped, the boundary closure line is collected from the point where the boundary turns the corner or intersects the second feature. The unattributed line is not carried around the corner. All States extend at least three miles into open water, so they are treated as extending into the open water to the quad edge. Counties may or may not extend into the open water. The digital treatment is based on the graphic treatment. If a quadrangle lies entirely within one State, and the county boundary stops at the shoreline, the shoreline is digitized and assigned the boundary closure line code. The offshore area is assigned the State FIPS only. In the case of a national or State boundary that stops at a shoreline, a line approximating the shoreline is digitized and assigned the boundary closure line code. The offshore area is then coded 090 0199 (Open water). In the case where a national, State, or county boundary is extended out from the shore and dropped, an arbitrary line is digitized by extending the line from the drop point to the quadrangle neatline and assigned the boundary closure line code. The water area within the boundary is given the same codes as the equivalent land area. Offshore islands are included with the onshore political entity, even where the political boundaries stop at the shoreline. Extend the closure line to include any coastal features which can logically be assumed to be included in the political entity. An offshore island without a boundary but labeled as a park, wildlife area, etcetera is assigned the appropriate park or wildlife area code, and otherwise coded consistently with the onshore political entity. A line that follows the shoreline is digitized and assigned the boundary closure line code. 07/95 Boundaries 3.5-12   Standards for Digital Line Graphs Part 3: Attribute Coding The code 090 0000 (Photorevised feature) is not used in conjunction with this code. 090 0299 Processing line This code is described in section 3.0.6.3.  3.5.5  Single-Point Attribute Codes 090 0301 Reference monument for boundary point This code identifies a monumented point not on a boundary line, but serving as a reference to establish the location of a point on the boundary.

Metadata (or ""data about data"") describe the content, quality, condition, and other characteristics of data. Metadata are used to organize and maintain investments in data, to provide information to data catalogs and clearinghouses, and to aid data transfers. The  Federal Geographic Data Committee  (FGDC) publishes the  Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata . Many organizations within and outside of the federal government have adopted the FGDC metadata standard and are using automated indexing and serving mechanisms to provide access to their holdings through the Internet.

The data were derived from       the National Transportation Atlas Databases 1997 (NTAD97) produced       by U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) which is based on       information provided by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).       A subset of the complete list of airports was extracted, based       on airport passenger enplanement of greater than or equal to       250 passengers per year.        Purpose:         These data are intended for geographic display and analysis       at the national level, and for large regional areas. The data       should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale       data.

Metadata (or ""data about data"") describe the content, quality, condition, and other characteristics of data. Metadata are used to organize and maintain investments in data, to provide information to data catalogs and clearinghouses, and to aid data transfers. The  Federal Geographic Data Committee  (FGDC) publishes the  Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata . Many organizations within and outside of the federal government have adopted the FGDC metadata standard and are using automated indexing and serving mechanisms to provide access to their holdings through the Internet.

It is a subset of data contained in the Office of Surface Mining (OSM) Abandoned Mine Land Inventory.                                        Purpose:               This data set provides information needed to implement Title IV              Abandoned Mine Reclamation, of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation              Act (SMCRA) of 1977. One of the major uses of this data set is for              the reporting of annual Abandoned Mine Land Program accomplishments              to Congress. In addition, the data is used in the National Atlas of              the United States for geographic display and analysis at the national              level, and for large regional areas. The data should be displayed              and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data. No              responsibility is assumed by the U.S. Geological Survey in the use              of these data.              Supplemental_Information:               The geographical information in the Abandoned Mines Land Inventory              System (AMLIS) is a point representing each Problem Area. For many              Problem Areas the point is the latitude and longitude of the southeast              corner of the USGS quadrangle in which the Problem Area is located.

Completeness_Report:           Not all coal related problems are included in the inventory. In most          cases, States and Indian tribes are responsible for finding problems and          entering them into the Abandoned Mine Land (AML) Inventory. Some have          chosen not to inventory all their problems, especially if they have a          great many problems already in the inventory. Also, not all damage to          lands and water by past coal mining qualifies for inclusion in the            inventory. To be included as high priority, problems must pose a threat            to human health, safety, or welfare.

In                  recent years the computer system use to store and manipulate the                  data, AMLIS, performs a check to see that the latitude and longitude                  data entered into the system are in the correct county. Data entered                  before this check was added may be in the wrong county. Also,                  a problem may be in one county and the southeast corner of the                  quadrangle containing the problem in another county. Problem Areas                  shown as polygons were digitized from hand-drawn maps. The boundary                  of a Problem Area is often a judgment call made by the AML Reclamation                  Specialist preparing the map.

GPS data converted to DEM's and ARC/INFO coverages by Vince Caruso; funding provided by the USGS, the National Park Service, and the South Florida Water Management District.  Data collection done by Charles Henkel, Gordon Shupe, Bob Glover, Ed Cyran, and Greg Desmond of the USGS and contractors.      To whom should users address questions about the data?    Greg Desmond  U.S. Geological Survey  Project Chief  521 National Center  Reston, VA 20192  USA    703 648 4728 (voice)  703 648 4165 (FAX)  gdesmond@usgs.gov     Hours_of_Service:   8:30-4:30 ET M-F             Why was the data set created?    Modeling of sheet flow and water surface levels in the Florida Everglades is very sensitive to changes in elevation due to the expansive and extremely low relief terrain. Hydrologists have determined minimum vertical accuracy requirements for the elevation data for use as input to hydrologic models. As a result, elevation data with a vertical accuracy of about 15 centimeters (cm) (6 inches), relative to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88) are being collected in critical areas using state-of-the-art differential global positioning system (GPS) technology and data processing techniques. These data are being provided for use as input to hydrological models being developed by the scientific and resource management communities. The primary data collection strategy is to use the helicopter-based Airborne Height Finder (AHF) instrument, developed during earlier phases of this project, to collect data and produce elevation points spaced approximately 400 meters apart throughout Everglades National Park (ENP) and the surrounding region. Additional professional surveying services are also being utilized through contractual means.   The regional elevation datasets being generated by this project are the most accurate ever produced for the Everglades and surrounding environs. Tests and statistical analysis have shown that these GPS surveying techniques are producing repeatable results with absolute accuracies that are averaging to within 3 to 5 centimeters for known points, which provides confidence that the 15 cm vertical accuracy specification is being met within the Everglades.  These data will be used in the development of digital elevation models (DEMs), which in turn are used to parameterize hydrologic models to simulate and predict water flow direction, depth, velocity, and hydroperiod. Water resources and land management decisions will rely in part on these models.        How was the data set created?     From what previous works were the data drawn?   How were the data generated, processed, and modified?     Date: 2002 (process 1 of 1)   The process consists of the following steps:   1.  Collection of GPS data in and around the Everglades swamp and environs using the helicopter-based Airborne Height Finder (AHF) developed by the USGS.  Additional elevation data were acquired through contracted professional surveying services.   2.  The GPS data are processed into an ASCII list of coordinates in column order of point number and/or descriptor attribute data (maximum of 20 characters), NAD83 geographic XY coordinates, and NAVD88 elevation Z value.  This file is transformed through CORPSCON (a conversion program available from the National Geodetic Survey, NGS) to NAD83 UTM XY and NAVD88 Z coordinates.  The file is output as an ASCII text file and is disseminated through the South Florida Information Access (SOFIA) web site at  <http://sofia.usgs.gov> .   3.  The coordinates are then processed into an ARC INFO POINT COVER format.   An annotation file is created and appended to the POINT cover file for the tabular elevation value in meters to the decimal value of 100th of a meter (centimeter).  This annotation value is later used in creating the browse graphic of the large area point plot file in GEO TIFF format.   4.  The POINT cover is then transformed to other distribution formats.   a. The POINT cover is exported into ARC/INFO Exchange Format (.e00) and transferred to the SOFIA web site.   b. The POINT cover is used as input to ARC TOPOGRID to create the ARC GRID elevation file.   c.  The ARC GRID cover is then used as input to ARC GRIDPAINT in combination with a color ramp and color map file to create a pseudo-color elevation plot.

How reliable are the data; what problems remain in the data set?     How well have the observations been checked?     How accurate are the geographic locations?  Horizontal positions are established by GPS observations and are referenced to the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83).  The desired horizontal accuracy is  +/- 15 centimeters.  This level of accuracy is consistent with GPS differential techniques which use two geodetic quality dual-frequency GPS receiver reference base stations along with a roving GPS antenna.  Where possible, the GPS base reference stations have an ellipsoid height to an accuracy of two centimeters relative to the Continuously Operating Reference Stations (CORS) or the High Accuracy Reference Network (HARN), both operated by the National Geodetic Survey (NGS).    How accurate are the heights or depths?  For all elevation data the vertical accuracy falls within +/- 15 centimeters and is referenced to NAVD 1988.   This elevation data is intended primarily for use in hydrologic modeling.    Where are the gaps in the data?  What is missing?  not available    How consistent are the relationships among the observations, including topology?  not applicable        How can someone get a copy of the data set?

The quadrangles have         been joined into a single data set, but have not been edgematched.         The USGS major and minor attribute codes have been replaced with         the codes shown in this metadata record.         See  http://nris.state.mt.us/nsdi/nris/dlg2.dbf  for dates of         the source quadrangles.      Purpose:          Base map data.     Time_Period_of_Content     Beginning_Date:   1948      Ending_Date:      1996    Access_Constraints:          None     Use_Constraints:          Not for use at scales greater than 1:24000.     Native_Data_Set_Environment:        Arc/Info coverages or ESRI shapefiles     Data_Quality_Information:     Attribute_Accuracy_Report:          Attributes were interpreted from the original DLG files by         a computer program.  The accuracy of this interpretation         has not been extensively checked.  Attribute accuracy of the         original Digital Line Graph data is estimated by the USGS         at 98.5 percent, and was tested by them as follows:         - manual comparison of the source with hard copy plots.         - symbolized display of the digital line graph on an         interactive compter graphic system.         - Selected attributes that could not be visually verified on         plots or on screen, were interactively queried and verified         on screen.         In addition, U.S. Geological Survey  (USGS) Production         System (PROSYS) software tested the attributes against a         master set of valid attributes for the category; it also         checked for selected valid attribute combinations, and for         valid attributes relative to topology and dimensionality.         All attribute data conform to the attribute codes current         as of the date of digitizing.     Completeness_Report:          For DLG data, Digital Revision Status = Not revised:         Data completeness reflects the content of the source         quadrangle.  Features may have been eliminated or         generalized on the source graphic, due to scale and         legibility constraints.         For DLG data, Digital Revision Status = Limited Update:         This file has undergone limited update digital revision.         The file contains only (1) those features that are         photoidentifiable on monoscopic source, supplemented with         limited ancillary source, and (2) those features, present on         the original source quadrangle, that can not be reliably         photoidentified but that are not considered particularly         prone to change.         For DLG data, Digital Revision Status = Standard Update:         This file has undergone standard update digital revision.         The data completeness of this file meets National Mapping         Division standards for feature content.     Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:          Approximate accuracy is 12 meters, assuming the source maps         meet National Map Accuracy Standards (NMAS).  NMAS         horizontal accuracy requires that at least 90 percent of         points tested are within 0.02 inches of the true position.         The digital data are estimated to contain a horizontal         positional error of less than or equal to 0.003 inches         standard error in the two component directions relative to         the source quadrangle.  Comparison to the graphic source is         used as control to assess digital positional accuracy.         Cartographic offsets may be present on the graphic source,         due to scale and legibility constraints.  Digital map         elements require edge alignment between data sets.  Data         along each quadrangle edge are tested against the data set         for the adjacent quadrangle using PROSYS; tests check for         positional accuracy between data sets within a 0.02 inches         tolerance.  Features with like dimensionality, and with or         without like attribution, that are within the tolerance         are adjusted by moving the feature equally in both data         sets.  Features outside the tolerance are not moved.
