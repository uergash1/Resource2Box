GX245-54-0912104	"Women Legislators of Maryland   A Caucus of the Maryland General Assembly            Marsha C. Wise,  Executive Director   Caucus homepage   In 1995, the women of Maryland and all over the United States celebrated the 100th anniversay of the first election of women to a state legislature. In 1894, three women were elected to served in the Colorado House of Representatives and they were sworn in in January 1895. The next year, the first woman in a state senate was elected to the Utah Senate.  Maryland's first woman legislator,  Mary Eliza Watters Risteau , was elected in 1921 from Harford County and took office in 1922. She served for four sessions, 1922, 1924, 1931, and 1933. In 1934, she became the first woman elected to the Maryland Senate and served in the 1935 and 1937 sessions. In 1950, she was again elected to the House of Delegates and served in the 1951 session.  In 1958,  Verda F. Welcome  and  Irma George Dixon  became the first African American women to be elected to the House of Delegates, and, in 1962, Verda Welcome became the first African American woman to be elected to the Maryland Senate.   In February 1972, Senator  Rosalie Abrams  introduced a resolution that the women in the Maryland General Assembly form a Women's Caucus that would meet regularly to ""push for the recognition of women and their abilities."" Acting on that resolution, eight women delegates and three women senators created the Women Legislators of Maryland, a group that has grown in membership, resources, and political strength. The overall mission of the group is to improve public policy that affects women's lives and to increase the number of women elected and appointed to public service in Maryland. On February 21, 1997, the Women Legislators of Maryland marked the 25th anniversary of this caucus which has grown from an ""informal support group"" with no staff or resources to a professionally managed, fiscally strong organization. This anniversary was officially celebrated with a Joint Session of the Legislature on March 7, 1997.   There are now 55 women serving in the Maryland General Assembly and a total of 153 women have served since 1922. Women have held and continue to hold positions of power and leadership in the General Assembly, and the Executive and Judicial branches of Maryland government. Women have, indeed, claimed their voice in Maryland.       Presidents  of the Women's Caucus, 1974-1999       History  of the Women's Caucus      Women Who Served  in the Maryland General Assembly, 1922 - 1999      Executive Directors  of the Women's Caucus, 1976 - 1999       Remarks  of the State Archivist at the Joint Session of the Maryland General Assembly marking the 25th Anniversary of the Women's Caucus,  March 7, 1997                             [  Archives' Home Page  ||  Visitors' Center  ||  Search the Archives  ||  Staff Directory  ||  Maryland & Its Government  ||  Maryland Manual On-Line  ||  Reference & Research  ||  Education & Outreach  ||  Government House  ||  State Art Collection  ||  Archives of Maryland  ]  Governor      General Assembly     Judiciary      Maryland Electronic Capital         © Copyright February 28, 2001Maryland State Archives"

Over a 24 hour period, Governor Warner will make six economic                  development announcements across Southside and Southwest Virginia,                  totaling 1208 new jobs, 180 saved jobs, and more than $50 million                  in private investment. Including today's announcements, Governor                  Warner has announced more than 3,750 new jobs and nearly $290                  million in investment in Southside and Southwest since taking                  office in January. Statewide, Governor Warner has announced more                  than 22,000 new jobs and $2.32 billion in investment.

""It's clear that we made the right decision last year when                  we chose to locate Sherwood's new plant in Southside, Virginia,""                  said Mr. Uziel Frydman, President and Chief Executive Officer                  of Sherwood Brands. ""Our state-of-the-art facility has only                  been operating for a few months, yet we already are moving aggressively                  to expand significantly. Obviously, we are delighted with every                  aspect of doing business in Chase City. We've found top-quality                  workers, excellent transportation, and a business-friendly environment.                  We look forward to continuing to grow together with this wonderful                  community.""                  Governor Warner approved a $125,000 grant from the Governor's                  Opportunity Fund to assist Mecklenburg County with the project.

SPECIAL INTERESTS: Parenting, baking, scrabble, backgammon, guitar; and exercising my civic duties to better our state.  STATEMENT: A former Anchorage Mayor paid me an outstanding compliment. ""Andre, every morning when I met with my staff to review policy and proposals, I'd ask.....what can McLeod find wrong with this policy?"" An editorial writer describes me as a person who thoroughly does her homework when working on issues. One assembly member continually tells me about my persistent efforts to take things to the nth degree without letting up. After years of attending public hearings, assembly and school board meetings, consistently challenging others to address injustices, and reform and rethink failings of the system, I'm running to represent the people of District 24. We need to elect legislators with enough nerve, good sense and integrity to critically oversee special interests in a civil and constructive manner. Anchorage must elect legislators who owe their allegiance to the general public and not merely a few select contributors. I've taken on special interests at the Anchorage Municipal level and was the prime force behind the citizens' movement to adopt a Municipal Lobbying Ordinance. The state law to protect family privacy rights against prying public health officials and the social work bureaucracy was strengthened because of my steady pressure and constant advocacy before legislators. We need special interests in Alaska to promote and maintain our handsome quality of life. But we also need legislators who can say no when they reach too deep into the public pocket and home. My opponents are for special interests down the line. My only special interest is you.

""Our state-of-the-art facility has only                  been operating for a few months, yet we already are moving aggressively                  to expand significantly. Obviously, we are delighted with every                  aspect of doing business in Chase City. We've found top-quality                  workers, excellent transportation, and a business-friendly environment.                  We look forward to continuing to grow together with this wonderful                  community.""

The finalists were selected from among a group of 53 state small business persons of the year representing the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Guam.     ""The 53 small business owners who are selected to represent their states at National Small Business Week run the gamut from candy-making to lumber, from amusement parks to fitness clubs,"" said Acting SBA Administrator John Whitmore.  ""They are a mosaic of American entrepreneurship.       ""It’s a privilege to welcome these entrepreneurs to Small Business Week here in Washington, and a special honor to be able to choose the national winner from among them.""

Winners are: Richard Hodges of New Bern for outstanding personal achievement;    the Rev. and Mrs. Oliver Robinson of Elizabeth City, outstanding volunteer award;    St. Mary's of the Hills Episcopal Church of Blowing Rock, outstanding congregation    award; Hospitality House of Asheville, outstanding community impact; and Cisco    Systems of Research Triangle Park, outstanding corporate award.    ""These folks truly embody what helping the homeless is all about,"" said    Kevin FitzGerald, director of the NC Division of Social Services. ""We are honored    to be able to recognize them for all the good things that they do to benefit    so many people.""    The awards were given by the North Carolina Interagency Council for Coordinating    Homeless Programs, which hosted about 400 people at the council's annual conference,    held at the Jane S. McKimmon Center Tuesday and today.    Homelessness touches people in every county in North Carolina. It is a community    problem magnified this year by the devastation that flooding from Hurricane    Floyd brought to thousands of homes and families in eastern parts of the state    in September.    In 54 counties where 121 agencies received emergency shelter grants through    the N.C. Office of Economic Opportunity, more than 43,000 people, including    6,289 families, were served in the year ending last June 30. Causes of homelessness    include domestic violence, sexual abuse, unemployment, drug abuse, alcoholism,    eviction, mental illness, natural disasters, underemployment and runaway children.     Those honored are:        Outstanding personal achievement - Richard Hodges, New Bern. After years      of fighting alcoholism and being homeless, Hodges sought help from Religious      Community Services of New Bern. While a resident of the RCS shelter, Hodges      attacked his alcoholism head-on through shelter support sessions and weekly      Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. He now lives in permanent housing and drives      the organization's van providing transportation to shelter residents to jobs,      appointments, and he picks up food for the shelter. He provides moral support      and serves as a mentor to many of the shelter residents.       Outstanding Volunteer Award - Rev. Oliver Robinson and Jessie Robinson,      Elizabeth City. The Rev. and Mrs. Robinson saw the need for a shelter and      services for homeless people in Elizabeth City, and committed themselves to      seek and provide the help needed. Through their own resources and those of      a few others, they founded the Tabernacle of Faith Outreach Center, which      operates the area's only shelter for homeless women and children, and a soup      kitchen which feeds anyone in need. The center has thrived despite being started      in one of the city's most drug-infested communities. The shelter helped transform      the street on which it is located to a safe, clean drug-free place to live.      The Rev. and Mrs. Robinson are familiar to the elected officials and service      agency staff of Elizabeth City and Pasquotank County for their advocacy for      increased funding and services for the homeless. No job is too small, no need      too great to escape their attention and concern.      Outstanding Congregation Award - St. Mary's of the Hills Episcopal Church      of Blowing Rock. St. Mary's of the Hills Episcopal Church of Blowing Rock      has a long history of service to the homeless of Watauga County. The congregation      has supported the Hospitality House of Boone since the shelter opened in1985.      The support of St. Mary's has been a primary factor in the success of programs      operated by Hospitality House of Boone. A share of St. Mary's annual fundraiser      is allocated to the House. Church volunteers prepare and serve meals for the      House's Bread of Life program which provides evening meals to the homeless      and hungry of Watauga County. Recently, the congregation initiated a project      to help the residents of Hospitality House establish their own homes. The      program provides residents with ""start-up boxes"" filled with essential food      and housekeeping items. The congregation secured one grant to fund this program      and is seeking additional support for the program from other area organizations      and businesses.      Outstanding Community Impact - Hospitality House of Asheville. Since 1986      Hospitality House of Asheville has provided shelter, food, employment, health      care and hope to thousands of homeless people. Hospitality House is an organization      of four programs representing a continuum of care for the homeless in Asheville      and Buncombe County. The philosophy of the organization incorporates compassion,      empowerment and community as a holistic approach to addressing the problems      of homelessness and poverty. Five homeless or formerly homeless people are      employed as staff members of the organization and at least two serve on the      organization's board. The newest program, AHOPE Day Center and Safe Haven,      provides assistance to the most hard-core of the homeless - those who have      been banned from other area shelters and service providers. Such people tend      to be socially isolated and ostracized and have limited access to any type      of subsistence aid. Since the inception of the Day Center and the assertive      street outreach of its staff, there have been no deaths among the homeless      from exposure in Buncombe County.       Outstanding Corporate Award - Cisco Systems Inc., Research Triangle Park.      In a time when large corporations are often accused of having no social conscience      or heart, Cisco Systems has demonstrated a spirit of caring for the hungry      and homeless that is remarkable. One year after beginning operation in San      Jose, Calif., Cisco Systems established a foundation and targeted the basic      needs of food and shelter as specific funding areas. Among the stated goals      of the foundation is support for the basic needs of individuals in extreme      hardship. Cisco Systems also encourages its employees to be active in community      service and matches in cash the volunteer time given by its employees to organizations      serving the poor and homeless. Since opening an operations center in the RTP,      Cisco Systems has continued its philanthropy. Beneficiaries of Cisco's contributions      of funding and employee volunteer time include The Women's Center of Wake      County, the Raleigh Rescue Mission, the Food Bank of North Carolina, Urban      Ministries of Raleigh and the Wake AIDS Service Agency. More than 3,000 poor      and homeless individuals and families have received assistance as a result      of the generous contributions of funding and volunteer time of Cisco Systems      and its employees.                             # # #                                        Public Affairs Office 101 Blair Drive, Raleigh, NC 27603 (919)733-9190 FAX (919)733-7447                   Debbie Crane Director"

TCB Brief: I Need Your Help - Following up                    on the Arts                      More on Richard Florida and what you think - an online survey.                                         Quote of the Week                                                           Dear Business Leader,                    As most of you know best, our nation's economy is a creative                    economy. Growth comes from innovation, discovering new ways                    of doing things, and valuing the promise of new ideas. Last                    week, I was reminded of this notion at our 2nd Annual Arts and                    Culture Town Meeting. We invited a professor of economic development                    at Carnegie Mellon University, Richard Florida, to discuss a                    topic critical to the future of Baltimore and all cities - one                    that doesn't get talked about enough - the harnessing power                    of creativity to endow a city.                    Second to safety and cleanliness, people want to live in a                    city that is vibrant, stimulating, and energetic. A city that                    has an art scene, or a music scene, an overall atmosphere for                    creativity - no matter what the muse might be.                    At the town meeting, we talked about things many of us already                    know. Baltimore has an extraordinary quantity and quality of                    arts and cultural assets and activities that set us apart. First                    and foremost, we have human capital - creative people, in every                    neighborhood in our city. From the the publishers of RADAR to                    self-starting arts programs like Black Cherry Puppet Theater,                    Fluid Movement or Kids on the Hill that stimulate creativity                    and nurture performance throughout city neighborhoods. We have                    institutions like the Walters, the Visionary Art Museum, BMA,                    the BSO, Peabody Institute, the Patterson Center for the Arts,                    the Reginald F. Lewis Museum of African American History and                    Culture and MICA, and many neighborhood institutions that are                    a source of tremendous pride for our city. And we have a government                    that is not stuck in the old paradigms of economic development                    but rather shares a common ethos with artists - one that values                    innovative ideas and creativity.                    We talked about the important activity that is already underway                    in our city - the development of the Station North Arts &                    Entertainment District and the newly designated Highlandtown                    Arts & Entertainment District; our success in doubling our                    Artist-in-Residence Program, bringing more art educators to                    our schools; our community grants that are supporting local                    arts organizations; and our murals program that every year begins                    and completes numerous projects that become ongoing sources                    of community pride and energy.                    There is so much underway in our city, but so much more to                    do. Arts and Culture is not an issue or subject that Government                    itself can drive. We are going to be looking for ways to partner                    with Baltimore's great art institutions and business community                    to make our resources go as far as they can.                    Some simple ways the business community can begin to help is                    to make networking opportunities available between entrepreneurs                    and the artistic and cultural communities of Baltimore. Or by                    taking a much closer look at Baltimore's assets, particularly                    in neighborhoods where arts and culture-related growth has taken                    root. It is critical that we do a better job of understanding                    how, when, where and why cultural economic development occurs                    - and how we can help lay the groundwork and cultivate a climate                    for even more arts-based economic development and prosperity                    in the future.                                      CitiStat: Managing Evictions                    Last year landlords made over 150,000 complaints about tenants                    not paying their rent on time, leading to over 7,000 evictions.                    From the associated court processes and the delivery of tenant                    notifications, to the clean up of eviction debris and attempts                    to mitigate the human impacts of evictions, multiple agencies                    of government have stakes in this issue.                    CitiStat has been examining the issue of eviction from a human                    service perspective during our meetings with the Office of Homeless                    Services (OHS) and from an operational perspective during our                    Solid Waste sessions. CitiStat's discussions are being fueled                    in part by a report on evictions from The Abell Foundation (http://www.abell.org/pubsitems/arn303.pdf).                    For context, consider that a survey conducted through OHS earlier                    this year found that over 25 percent of homeless people identified                    eviction as a reason for their homelessness-a cause mentioned                    only slightly less often than drug or alcohol abuse. Additionally,                    the clean up, removal, and storage of eviction debris annually                    costs the City's Department of Public Works in excess of $1                    million.                                                        The human consequences and financial costs of evictions are                    obviously enormous. Through CitiStat, we are working to try                    and develop strategies that not only promote the timely payment                    of rents, but also safeguard the rights of tenants and minimize                    the many ancillary effects of evictions.

Dr. Florida has distinquished                    himself as author of The Rise of the Creative Class for advancing                    the notion that cities that have a wide range of culture, tolerance                    and self-expressive opportunities are cities that lead in bottom-line                    economic progress. This premise is based on a number of studies                    and indicators and can be summarized in a recent review in the                    Washington Monthly:  http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2001/0205.florida.html                                         I'd like to hear what you think.

Kilpatrick and Detroit Police Chief Jerry Oliver said Thursday they welcome an agreement reached with the U.S. Department of Justice at the end of a two and one-half year investigation of the Detroit Police Department.        There are two separate agreements between the City and the department.  One deals with the use of force as well as arrest and witness detention practices while the other deals with conditions of confinement of prisoners.        ""When I took office, I pledged in my inaugural message to undertake a major restructuring of the Police Department,"" the Mayor said.  ""The agreements we have reached provide for exactly the kinds of reforms I had in mind when I made that pledge. That was why I brought in Chief Jerry Oliver - because he had demonstrated the creativity and resolve needed to bring about fundamental change.""        Oliver said, ""The agreements reached today with the U.S. Department of Justice is a major milestone in our efforts to bring about constructive change within the Detroit Police Department.  In fact, working with the Board of Police Commissioners we already have implemented or begun implementing some of the revisions to policies, procedures, training, management, supervision and discipline spelled out in this agreement.""        The agreement calls for the appointment of an independent monitor, Sheryl L. Robinson of Kroll Associates.  The monitor will provide technical assistance to the department; ensure that the DPD complies with the agreement and issue periodic reports on progress in implementing the reforms.        Among the provisions of the agreement related to the use of force are requirements that the Detroit Police Department:                               Revise its policies governing use of force to specify the types of conduct by individuals that would justify the use of various levels of force and specify that de-escalation, area containment or calling in specialized units are often appropriate responses to a situation.                        Require Detroit Police officers to successfully qualify with their department-issued firearms every six months.                        Select an intermediate force device between chemical spray and firearms for use by officers, such as a collapsible baton.                        Revise its chemical spray policy to require a verbal warning and time for a subject to comply with an order prior to the use of chemical spray.                 Among the provisions of the agreement related to arrest and witness detention policies are:                               The DPD will require written supervisory review of all arrests for probable cause.                        The DPD will develop an internal process to ensure prompt judicial review.                        The DPD will require a court order prior to taking a material witness into custody.                        The DPD will require an accurate and auditable record identifying the length and basis of each detention.                 Conditions of the agreement related to confinement of prisoners include:                               The DPD will develop and implement a comprehensive fire detection, suppression and evacuation program for all holding cells.                        The DPD will develop a comprehensive medical and mental health screening program for all persons who are arrested.                        The DPD will provide appropriate clothing to all prisoners placed under suicide watch, remove all hazards from holding cells and ensure adequate prisoner checks.                        The DPD will ensure that all holding cells are cleaned and sanitary.                           Other conditions of the agreement include:                               Revised procedures for receiving, investigating and reviewing misconduct allegations.                        Enhanced supervisory oversight of incidents involving injury of a prisoner and use of force.                        Expansion and enhancement of the department's risk management system.                        Training for all officers and recruits regarding conditions of the agreement between DPD and DOJ.                 ""I appreciate the openness, candor and commitment that Ralph Boyd and Jeffrey Collins and their staffs and Detroit Corporation Counsel Ruth Carter and her staff have brought to this process,"" the Mayor said.  ""They have worked long and hard to arrive at agreements that serve the best interests of both the people of Detroit and the men and women of the Detroit Police Department.        ""I want to emphasize my belief that the men and women who make up the Detroit Police Department are dedicated public servants who literally put their lives on the line every day for the people of this city.  However, the problems that brought in the Justice Department and that are the focus of this agreement are very real problems and this agreement was arrived at out of a shared commitment to eliminating them.""        Chief Oliver said the department already has begun implementing changes that are called for in the agreement.        ""For instance,"" he said, ""after years of having minimal annual firearms qualifications by department members, a concerted effort by our training staff resulted in more than 3,500 members of the department qualifying with firearms by the end of last year.  Last August we began random audits and inspections of facilities with holding cells and the Detroit Fire Department approved all department emergency action plans.        ""In December we purchased the computer hardware needed for a state of the art records management system.  This March we began distributing a completely revised departmental policy manual.  Also in March we reached an agreement to implement a pilot program with Wayne County Sheriff Warren Evans to house prisoners arrested for major/violent crimes at the Wayne County Jail.        ""In March and April we began risk management training for all department executives as well as quarterly labor relations seminars for department executives for the first time in department history.  And we have purchased and installed nearly 640 in-car video cameras.        ""These are just some of the changes already underway that are mandated by today's agreements.  I look forward to working with the independent monitor as we move forward with these and the other reforms to which we have committed ourselves.  These reforms will produce the kind of police department the people of Detroit want and deserve.""

GX010-82-9054858	For Immediate Release    STEPHEN C. ROBINSON--U.S. ATTORNEY FOR THE STATE OF CONNECTICUT      April 27, 1998    Mr. President, there are few issues as important as protecting our citizens and keeping our communities free of crime. Americans should feel secure in their homes, at their schools, and in their neighborhoods, and in recent years we have made tremendous progress in this area, reducing the crime rate for a record five years in a row. But more work needs to be done. One of the most effective ways to make our streets safer is attracting talented and committed individuals to work in law enforcement. That is why I am so pleased that my Senate colleagues have displayed great wisdom and unanimously confirmed Stephen C. Robinson to serve as U.S. Attorney for the State of Connecticut.  Mr. Robinson has extensive and varied law enforcement experience in the public sector and his legal and investigative work for the private sector well qualify him to serve in this position. I was proud to recommend his nomination to the President, and I believe that he will bring a sense of intelligence, integrity, and energy to this office.  After graduating from Cornell University and Cornell Law School, Mr. Robinson was in private practice for several years. He then became an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York where he directed the prosecution of narcotics cases and tax fraud and securities fraud cases. He also argued appeals in the U.S. Court of Appeals in the Second Circuit. In 1990, Mr. Robinson received the Department of Justice's Director Award for Superior Performance as an Assistant U.S. Attorney.  Mr. Robinson also has served as Associate General Counsel and Managing Director at Kroll Associates, the world's largest private investigation firm. In 1993, FBI Director Louis Freeh asked Mr. Robinson to join the Bureau as his Special Assistant and General Counsel. At the FBI, he oversaw counter-terrorism and counter-espionage policy and investigation; revision of the selection and promotion process for Special Agents; and FBI undercover investigation proposals. Mr. Robinson has most recently worked as Chief Compliance Officer for Aetna U.S. Healthcare in Middletown, Connecticut, and he is also an instructor of Trial Practice Law at Yale Law School.  Mr. Robinson's confirmation is particularly significant in Connecticut, because he is the first African-American to ever serve as our State's top federal prosecutor. He has spoken publicly about the sense of hopelessness amongst young blacks throughout the country. And having grown up in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, Mr. Robinson hopes that young people from inner cities will look at him and see someone who can not only relate to their circumstances, but who also illustrates that if you get your education and work hard you can attain your goals, regardless of where you come from. Mr. Robinson stands as a positive role model for African-American youths, and in fact all young people.  By taking the post of Connecticut's U.S. Attorney, Mr. Robinson is renewing his connection to public service. But this may have never been possible were it not for a conversation between Steve and his mother in 1996. During the Thanksgiving holidays, his mother encouraged him to return to public service and give more back to his community. Mr. Robinson has frequently stated that this conversation prompted him to reevaluate what he wanted to do with his life. Upon reflection, he decided to take his mother's advice, and he decided that he should return to public service. On behalf of the people of Connecticut, I would like to thank Steve's mother. Steve Robinson is a man of outstanding character and intelligence, and we are fortunate to have him serve as our next U.S. Attorney.

GX268-87-16549079	6 Women and Politics Highlights !  In 1974, Iowa women made up just 14 percent of those serving on state boards and commissions. In May 2001, that number reached 46 percent. In 2001, Iowa women comprised 22 percent of the state's General Assembly, up from 10.7 percent in 1977. In 2000, Iowa women made up 36 percent of all of the state's elected county officials. From 1990 to 2000, the number of women judges has increased in Iowa--from 6.0 percent to 17.8 percent of all judicial positions. The percentage of female registered voters who vote has dropped considerably since the 1984 general election, when 82 percent of female voters turned out at the polls. In 1996 and 2000, female voter turnout for the general election lagged at 72 percent.  !  !  !  !    Status of Iowa Women Report/53  --Chapter 6--  Women and Politics 6.1 Introduction Women's involvement in all aspects of politics is crucial for the elevation of the status of women in Iowa and nationwide. Equal participation of women and men in politics will provide a necessary balance that more accurately reflects the composition of society. Although advances have been made in the number of Iowa women who hold public office or serve on state boards or commissions, they continue to be gravely underrepresented in the majority of the public decision-making bodies in the state.  6.2 State Boards and Commissions The State of Iowa has made great strides over the past twenty-five years in attaining equal gender representation on boards and commissions. In 1974, only 14 percent of all people on state boards and commissions were women. Governor appointments steadily increased that percentage until 1987, when Iowa's gender balance law was enacted-- the first of its kind in the nation. In May of 2001, 46 percent of members of Iowa's boards and commissions were female. (SEE FIGURES 6.1 and 6.2) While Iowa has instituted gender balance on state boards and commissions, only one city in the state, Iowa City, has engendered such a policy.

It is one of only six states that has failed to send a woman to the U.S. Congress, and it ranks 29th nationwide in the number of women that serve in state legislatures.1 Since the first year in which a woman was elected to the Iowa General Assembly in 1929, the total percentage of women legislators has increased from .6 percent to 22 percent in 2001. Even with this increase, women, who total 50.9 percent of Iowa's population, represent about one-fifth of the General Assembly. (SEE FIGURE 6.4) Eleven women serve as Senators, while 22 serve as Representatives in 2001. Representation of women of color in the General Assembly is also deficient; only two women of color have served in the Iowa General Assembly. Furthermore, few Iowa women have served as elected state officials. (SEE FIGURE 6.5) Likewise, few women lead Iowa's cities. According to the Iowa League of Cities, of the 949 cities in Iowa, 101 women serve as mayors. Iowa's record of electing women to county offices surpasses its record of electing women to state and national offices. In 1996, 34 percent of all county elected offices in Iowa were held by females. Since 1970, there has been a continual increase in the percentage of women elected as county officials in the state.

Until recently, several types of judicial positions were held exclusively by men. That, however, is slowly beginning to change as Iowa is improving its representation of women on judicial seats. According to the Iowa Judicial Branch, from 1990-2000 women magistrate judges increased from 7 to 28; associate juvenile judges from 2 to 6; district associate judges from 5 to 12; district court judges from 4 to 11; court of appeals from 1 to 3, and supreme court judges from 1 to 2. There were no female senior judges in 1990 or 2000. (SEE FIGURE 6.7) In 2000, women comprised 17.8 percent of the state judiciary positions, compared to 6 percent ten years earlier.

The number of female voters has exceeded the number of male voters in every presidential election since 1964.2 The same holds true for Iowa. In 2000, women comprised the majority of registered voters in the state at approximately 53 percent, men totaling 47 percent, the same as in 1996 and 1984. Since women make up 50.9 percent and men 49.1 percent of the population of the state, Iowa women have a higher voter registration rate than men. Iowa females also have a higher voter turnout rate than men. In the 2000 and 1996 presidential election, voter turnout was 72 percent for females and 70 percent for males. Nonetheless, this was down from the 1984 presidential election when 82 percent of female registered voters and 81 percent of males voted. (SEE FIGURE 6.8) According to a survey by The Women's Vote Project,  declining voter turnout for women can be attributed to several barriers, including getting time off work, finding child care, and lack of adequate information about candidates.3 The survey also found that white women were more likely than African-American or Hispanic women to receive information by mail or phone about election issues.4 Young adults, aged 18 to 24, had the lowest turnout rate for both men and women, with just 42 and 44 percent, respectively, of those registered to vote casting ballots. This is a substantial drop since 1984 when 63 percent of women and 62 percent of men in that age group voted in the general election. The largest turnout of female registered voters in 2000 was in the 50 to 64 age category at 84 percent. For males, those 65 years and older showed the largest voter turnout at 84 percent. (SEE FIGURE 6.9) Since 1994, both men and women have been leaving the rolls of registered Democrats and Republicans to register as No Party (Independent). From 1984 to 2000,  Iowa Commission on the Status of Women   56/Status of Iowa Women Report  there was an increase of 53 percent of women registered as Independents, while male affiliation increased by 50 percent. In fact, more people are registered as Independent than either Republican or Democrat.

It is crucial that women's active participation and incorporation at all levels of decision making, including that of city and county governments, be promoted by the establishment of measures that would substantially increase the number of women who serve on community decision-making bodies. This could include a legislative mandate for gender-balanced boards and commissions on city and county levels.  ! Education of judicial nominating commission members regarding the need to increase the number of women in the Iowa judiciary should be continued. Furthermore, the judicial nominating commission members need to be encouraged to give weight and consideration to relevant background and experience in the selection of candidates, rather than favoring the time served in a law office. ! Although the existence of a gender gap in voting has been debated since women won the right to vote in 1920, over the past two decades tangible political differences between women and men have increased.7 (The gender gap refers to differences between women and men in their political attitudes and voting choices.) For example, in 1996, the largestever recorded gender gap--11 points--was made during a presidential election, with women favoring Bill Clinton and men preferring Bob Dole.8 !  Women's service in state and national legislatures not only establishes a more representative governing body, but also works to advance the status of women in other ways. According to a national survey of women officeholders, women who hold elective office reshape the public policy agenda by giving a priority to women's rights policies and to women's traditional roles as caregivers in the family and society.5 Women elective office holders also serve as role models for other women. According to a groundbreaking study by the National Women's Political Caucus in 1994, women who run for elective office win as often as men do.6 Indeed, there are so few women in Iowa's elective offices because women just do not run. To encourage more women to run for office, work must be done to eliminate discriminatory attitudes and unequal gender power relations in private life that preface inequality in the public sphere. ! 1  Voter education at an early age is an important factor in getting people out to the voting booths. Education on the history of women's struggle to obtain the right to vote in the U.S. should be increased in Iowa's schools.  ! Political parties and candidates must provide more equitable information by mail or phone to women of varying races and ethnicities.

The imagery depicts an aerial view                                  of the prehistoric Hohokam Salt River irrigation                                  system combined with streetscape elements of the                                  surrounding neighborhood and McDowell Road, circa                                  1950.                                                                                                                                                                           Roberto Delgado’s murals depict images of                                  ‘50s architecture, the ancient Hohokam irrigation                                  system, and the people who live and work in the                                  city of Phoenix. The resulting painting is abstract                                  in style, filled with secrets that make each visit                                  a new journey. As traffic roars along the SR 51,                                  the brightly colored mural greets passersby with                                  new details that might have been overlooked the                                  first time.                                   Delgado                                  is used to working in this manner. His mixed media                                  monotypes have been exhibited throughout Los Angeles                                  County for many years. Using his signature bright                                  palette, a little mystery is the key to his success                                  as an artist. Between the layers of imagery and                                  color, his goal is to leave the viewer looking                                  rather than providing all of the visual information                                  in one sitting.                                                                   Delgado has said that the thrill of working on                                  a mural is in the audience: “It’s                                  more accessible to the public. Not on an intellectual                                  level – I’m not talking about easy                                  to read – just accessible in their day to                                  day activities, as opposed to a museum or gallery                                  system, which is theoretically accessible but                                  isn’t”. In addition to his work with                                  the city of Phoenix, Roberto Delgado has created                                  murals in Mexico City, Southern Mexico, Los Angeles,                                  and Spain.|                                                                     About the Artist                                  Roberto Delgado studied at the Academy of Fine                                  Arts in Rome, Italy, and earned a B.F.A. and an                                  M.F.A. from the University of California, Los                                  Angeles. His murals can be seen in Mexico, Nicaragua,                                  Spain, and throughout the United States.

The so-called ""gifting""                                pyramid is currently most active in Klamath, Lake,                                Jackson and Josephine counties but reports of meetings                                have been received from the Portland area and from                                throughout Central Washington.                               ""The name is new but the scheme is not,""                                Myers said. ""We have dealt with similar gifting                                pyramids since 1994, and we have little tolerance                                for pyramid organizers and participants."" Earlier                                pyramids with similar characteristics included the                                Airplane Game, Friends Network and The Gift Club.                               Literature from the Northwest Family Reunion solicits                                payment of a $2,000 ""gift"" in order for                                individuals to join the pyramid. Using race car                                driving terms, participants start at the bottom                                of the pyramid as part of an eight-member ""pit                                stop crew"" and advance to ""mechanics""                                then to ""pace car drivers"" and complete                                the cycle as ""lead drivers."" Supposedly,                                participants will rise to the top of the pyramid                                and receive a $16,000 payoff. In order to achieve                                the promised profits, a continuous chain of members                                must be recruited. To help avoid law enforcement                                officials, all ""earnings"" are collected                                at ""reunion"" meetings held in Washington.                               Prospective players are told that the scheme is                                legal because it is a gift between friends and relatives,                                that they are not required to report the ""earnings""                                to the Internal Revenue Service, and that both Oregon                                and Washington Attorneys General have approved the                                scheme. These representations are false.                               ""All pyramids are illegal because they are                                designed to collapse, making money for a few at                                the expense of many,"" Myers said. ""When                                this one falls apart, we will not be able to spend                                tax dollars to assist individuals who lost money                                as willing participants in an illegal scheme.""

GX245-14-8931856	"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE         Contact: Agena Aziz, Chief of Staff     (503) 986-1437   February 28, 2001              REPRESENTATIVE KROPF GIVES SUPPORT TO REPUBLICAN’S ""OREGON    WOMEN’S INITIATIVE""     Salem, OR –  State Representative Jeff Kropf (R-Halsey) gave his support today to the Republican’s Oregon Women’s Initiative. The initiative was announced today by Republican women legislators and is a package of legislation aimed at helping Oregon’s women, children and families. The initiative covers a wide range of issues, including pay equity, domestic violence and child care. All 11 Republican women in the Oregon Legislature joined together to present the initiative at a press conference.    ""Oregon women face an array of challenges, and the state legislature should do what it can to strengthen domestic violence laws, provide women options for raising their children and ensuring women receive equal pay for equal work,"" Kropf said. ""I am proud to throw my support behind this key package of legislation.""    Highlights of The Oregon Women’s Initiative include:       Domestic Violence:  Legislation allowing previous acts of domestic violence into the record if a defendant is charged with new counts.    Pay Equity:  Creation of a Task Force on Promotional and Career Opportunities for Women in Oregon. The task force will study all aspects of women and wages in the workforce, with particular emphasis on pay equity. The task force will make recommendations to the 72 nd  Legislature based on its findings.     Child Care:  Establishes a tax credit for women who leave their jobs to care for their children at home.      The initiative was announced by Representative Karen Minnis (R-Wood Village), the House Majority Leader, as well as Senator Bev Clarno (R-Bend), Representative Janet Carlson (R-Salem), Representative Betsy Close (R-Albany), Representative Jan Lee (R-Clackamas), Representative Susan Morgan (R-Myrtle Creek), Representative Donna Nelson (R-McMinnville), Representative Patti Smith (R-Corbett), Representative Tootie Smith (R-Molalla) and Representative Jackie Winters (R-Salem).

Deputy Sonoma County District Attorney Dani Jo Handell said                      most of the women were previously too embarrassed to talk                      about investing $5,000 in the Women's Garden Circle, whose                      promoters promise a $40,000 payoff to those who join.                     But with news of a 10-month undercover investigation that                      could result in criminal charges against the most active proponents,                      Handell said: ""If someone has been involved in this,                      the best and only way they can help themselves is to get in                      touch with us and come forward immediately.""                     The Garden Circle is a sophisticated version of women-helping-women                      gifting schemes that have circulated during the past several                      years.                     Though Handell said she expects Garden Circle losers ultimately                      will outnumber winners, investigators believe millions of                      dollars have changed hands.                     While the basic appeal is the promise of money, the program's                      pitch is couched in terms of empowerment, altruism, female                      unity and new-age spirituality.                     ""I was told I was chosen,"" said one woman who was                      asked to join but ultimately declined.                     Some women with experience in similar gifting circles defended                      what participants call the women-helping-women movement.                     ""For me the best part was sitting in circle and hearing                      women tell their dreams, and how overwhelmingly it was about                      things that made the world better,"" said one woman, speaking                      on condition of anonymity.                     Healdsburg financial adviser Deborah Price said she has tried                      to discourage women from participating, but found they often                      lack financial sophistication, and trust the friends or family                      members who recruited them.                     ""I think people inherently, especially today, are very                      desperate about money ... so that most women who are already                      kind of living on the edge, the idea they might make a quick                      buck is very appealing,"" said Price, the author of a                      book called ""Money Therapy.""                      But authorities say any such scheme violates state law prohibiting                      operation of pyramid schemes or ""endless chains,""                      through which participants attempt to make money simply by                      recruiting new members.                     No arrests have been made in connection with the Garden Circle                      Investigation.                     But, Handell said, anyone ultimately arrested also could                      face fraud, securities fraud and conspiracy charges, as well                      as federal tax evasion, mail and wire fraud charges.                     In the Garden scheme, each circle has 15 positions. Eight                      participants are called buds, four are blossoms and two are                      blooms. They are arranged around a single person dubbed the                      bouquet, who can only cash out when all spots are filled.                     The blooms divide the circle, becoming bouquets and allowing                      each of the other participants to move up a rank. Eight more                      buds must be recruited to ""gift"" $5,000 for each                      respective bouquet to receive her cash.                     A 26-page packet given to one recruit describes a powerful,                      healing process ""that has helped women to embrace leadership,                      overcome shyness, competitiveness and scarcity.""                     Punctuated with inspirational quotes and readings, the new-age                      verbiage offers ""a safe place to share and support personal                      dreams, needs and goals.""                     It contends that buying in to the circle ""primes the                      pump"" of the ""Field of Plenty"" and leads to                      an opportunity to experience abundance as a ""physical                      expression in the body on a cellular level.""                     Authorities said members are disproportionately single, attesting                      to the appeal of sharing and camaraderie.                     They say the group's meetings are sometimes like revivals,                      with tearful testimonials about dreams realized.                     Members are required to participate in mandatory weekly and                      biweekly conference calls that amount to pep rallies, Handell                      said.                     They're also coached in recruiting new members and told to                      handle naysayers by refusing to focus on negativity, she said.                     Florida attorney Lewis B. Freeman, an expert in pyramid schemes,                      said they're all ""somewhat like cults.""

GX256-24-2199582	"The Third Branch Vol. 6, No. 1 A PUBLICATION OF THE WISCONSIN JUDICIARY http://www.wisbar.org/sct/ Winter 1998  `An Extraordinary Decision' If one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours. --Henry David Thoreau he day after Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Janine P. Geske went public with what the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel called ""an extraordinary decision that will shock the legal community,"" one of her former colleagues, a Milwaukee judge, spoke volumes in a short message: ""As much as we stood to gain from six more years of your published opinions,"" he wrote, ""I suspect you conveyed more of value in the one unwritten decision I read about in the paper yesterday."" Reaction to Geske's announcement that she will leave the bench on September 5, 1998, has been swift and strong. She has been inundated with calls, letters and e-mails (not to mention job offers, pleas to run for Congress and interview requests). Much of the correspondence has come from people whom the justice has never met. Many have indicated that Geske's decision has inspired them to take stock of their own lives. In announcing her decision in a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel column by Bill Janz, Geske said: ""I believe. . . I can best use my talents outside the formal court structure. I'm not leaving for a more prestigious, more-income kind of job. I need to find things more important to me, which will give me the opportunity to touch people's lives."" She said she plans to mediate state and federal civil disputes, get involved more in her community and help people, especially the poor. She has talked about mediating disputes in Third World countries and opening a center for spirituality in the workplace. Among the responses she has received, many stand out:  Please know how many of us also abundantly blessed people are re-inspired by your public affirmation of priorities. . . . (a lawyer).  I (have) quietly included you on my short list of heroes. (a court staffer).  I admire your courage and appreciate your drive to reach out to those in need. (a U.S. senator).  Your life continues to be a marvelous story and it took a great deal of courage to make the decision which you did. For this I am sure you are the pride of your family and you certainly have the admiration of so many, especially myself. (a priest).  Adults need heroes too! And, in your scenario, we have an opportunity to witness someone accepting, believing, and performing God's will. (a member of the public).  What you did and how you did it could change the world. (a fellow Gesu parishioner).  Thank you from the bottom of my heart for what you are about to do for so many, and for what you have already done for others. ( a member of the public).  T  Justice Janine P. Geske   I noted the importance of having someone on the Supreme Court who has spent time working with the poor. Now I can say with confidence that it is good having someone work with the poor who has spent time on the Supreme Court. (a lawyer). continued on page 16  Chief Justice's Statement on Geske Resignation Chief Justice Shirley S. Abrahamson read this statement at a February 15, 1998, press conference where Justice Janine P. Geske announced her intention to resign from the Court.  I  speak from two perspectives on the resignation of Justice Janine Geske. First, I speak as Chief Justice. Second, I speak as a close personal friend of Janine Geske. Justice Janine Geske has been an important voice on this court, bringing to the court her vast experience as a trial judge, her specialized training as a mediator and her extraordinary gifts as a judicial educator. As important, she has brought to the court her personal qualities -- she is a warm, wonderful human being who cares deeply about all the people of the state, about the judicial branch of government and about judicial independence. continued on page 16   Judge Barry Named Judge of the Year udge Dennis J. Barry, who has spent 17 years on the bench in Racine County, was named 1997 Judge of the Year by the State Bar of Wisconsin. ""His dedication and experience have gained him the respect of his colleagues on the bench as well as the respect of the practicing bar,"" a spokeswoman for the bar told the Racine Journal Times. Barr y, 50, was nominated by Judge Wilbur Warren III, Kenosha County Circuit Cour t. Not know ing he ha d b e en  J  nominated, Barr y was sur prised when Just ice Jon P. Wilcox cal le d w ith the good news. ""There are so many hardworking judges in the state, I just feel very grateful for the award,"" Barry said. ""I feel stunned and very pleased."" B ar r y ser ve d as chair man of the Wisco nsin Juve nile Just ice St udy Committee, which helped to re-write the state's juvenile code.  He started his career in law as an assistant district attorney in Kenosha County and then served as Racine County district attorney before his appointment to the bench in 1980. In announcing the award, the State Bar said of Barry: ""During his 17-year tenure on the court, he has demonstrated professional excellence, high ideals, personal character and a willingness to advance the quality of justice by the creation or implementation of innovative programs."" y  Supreme Cour t Appoints Skwierawski Chief Judge he Wisconsin Supreme Cour t has ap p o inte d Judg e Micha e l J. Skwierawski chief judge of the First Judicial Administrative District. Skwierawski will assume the position August 1, when Chief Judge Patrick T. Sheedy retires.

He currently serves as viceJudge chair of the National Conference of State Frederic W. Fleishauer Trial Judge's Ethics Committee. Fleishauer is one of approximately 1,600 U.S. grant recipients who will travel abroad for the 1997-98 academic year under the Fulbright program. The recipients are selected based on their academic and professional qualifications and their ability and willingness to share ideas and experiences with people of diverse cultures. The program is named for former Senator J. William Fulbright of Arkansas and designed to increase mutual understanding between the people of the United States and citizens of other countries. y  T  J  Dane County Circuit Cour t and COA District IV Exchange Judges pilot program to exchange judges between the Dane County Circuit Court and the District IV Court of Appeals got underway in early February. Cour t of Appeals Judge Charles P. Dykman took pleas, conducted preliminary hearings, issued temporary restraining orders and handled a variety of civil and criminal motions as well as some stipulated divorces and a small claims de novo. Dane County Circuit Court Judge P. Charles Jones sat on a Court of Appeals panel on February 4 and more circuit court judges are scheduled to participate on the Court of Appeals through the spring.  A  The Judicial Exchange Program allows appellate judges to sit on the trial bench and trial judges to sit on the Court of Appeals. The length of each exchange depends on the type of cases assigned. The program was started last year in the Ninth Judicial District, which exchanged with the District II Court of Appeals. Judges from both courts gave the program high marks. Other participating Court of Appeals judges, who will be receiving circuit court assignments in the next several months, are Chief Judge William Eich and Judge David G. Deininger. Other participating circuit court judges are: Angela B. Bartell, Mark A.

Freeburg spoke with Wausau's City Pages newspaper, detailing his philosophy on the role of a judge: ""I remember one judge was talking to some students and they asked why everyone stands up in court when the judge walks in,"" he said. "" he said `to show respect for the judge.' No. The reason is to show respect for the law, and that represents what our community feels is important. It is not your courtroom. You represent something bigger."" Freeburg is married with four children.  D  white-collar crime unit and the sensitive crimes unit.

Poppy was applauded by The Post-Crescent (Appleton) for ""shedding daylight on the juvenile court system."" Poppy decided to open his courtroom to the news media for certain portions of proceedings relating to a CHIPS matter which has received national attention. He said, ""it's important that the public knows what goes on in juvenile court"" so that they can begin to understand it better. Judge David G. Deininger, District IV Court of Appeals, was pictured in the Monroe Times with his dog Abby. He likened the job of a Court of Appeals judge to a bomber who makes a large impact from high above and compared his former post as Green County Circuit Court judge to a soldier doing battle on the front lines. ""There are aspects of the trial court I miss,"" he said. ""And, there are parts of it I don't miss."" Judge Charles B. Schudson, District I Court of Appeals, has been doing more reading lately. Schudson has immersed himself in a batch of Spiderman comic books. The National Committee to Prevent Child Abuse, for which he served on the board of directors for six years, produces a series of the comic books to help children in grades four through six to prevent, understand and cope with such issues as peer pressure, abuse (physical, sexual, verbal) and bullying. The Committee asked Schudson to write the teaching manual for the Spiderman comic book on fatherhood, which underscores the importance of positive male role models for children. The books are distributed nationally and internationally which, Schudson said, can present an editorial challenge because of language and cultural differences. For example, he said, in the Hmong culture, corporal punishment is acceptable while isolating a child as punishment is considered abusive. Debate continues regarding the revised juvenile code, reported The Journal Times (Racine). Dane County Circuit Court Judge Gerald C. Nichol told a reporter, ""Kids grow up faster. I have no problems seeing 17-year-olds in adult court,"" while Judge Sarah B. O'Brien, Dane County Circuit Court, said she is cautious: ""We don't have any options specially designed for that age group. Sentencing options as they are now are designed for people with adult living skills."" Earlier this year the Rock County Bar Association presented the county with a portrait of retired Judge J. Richard Long. Long retired from Rock County Circuit Court in 1996. At the dinner, the judge was honored for his integrity, intelligence, hard work, dignity ""and of course, punctuality."" Long's portrait was hung in the Rock County Courthouse in February, reported the Beloit Daily News. Wisconsin State Journal's ""Snoop"" caught Wisconsin Supreme Court justices at play after a snowstorm. Eyewitnesses reported that Justice Ann Walsh Bradley ""lobbed a high hard one"" at state Re p rese ntat ive Tammy Baldw in . Chie f Just ice S hir le y S. Abrahamson and Justice N. Patrick Crooks reportedly either joined in the fun or watched in horror, depending upon the source. Eau Claire County Circuit Court Judge Thomas H. Barland wants to see the crime of fleeing from an officer reduced from a felony back to a misdemeanor, according to The Daily Reporter. Barland said since the law was changed in 1994 he has noticed longer court time for those charged with fleeing and fewer plea  C  agreements. He said the ""young men caught in these situations are not criminals or likely to become offenders again."" At the 13th annual City-County Observance Honoring Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Dane County Circuit Court Judge Paul B. Higginbotham urged listeners: ""It is imperative that we embark on a new civil rights strategy and the word for today's civil rights strategy is action."" He encouraged the audience to vote, to get an education, to protect affirmative action and equal opportunity housing and to serve on juries, according to The Capital Times. The Dodge County Courthouse recently installed a video conferencing network which allows a defendant or witness to give and hear testimony without actually being in the courtroom, reported the Daily Citizen (Beaver Dam). This new technology is expected to save time and money and increase security. The system includes a video evidence presenter which allows juries to view the evidence charts and other items on the 10-foot screen. ""Too often the jury feels left out,"" said Dodge County Circuit Court Judge John R. Storck. ""The presenter gets the jury more involved."" A reporter from The Daily Reporter interviewed Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Donald W. Steinmetz at his Lake Okauchee home. The justice, who began practicing law in 1951, when asked about his work style said, ""I write everything longhand. When we had ordered the last batch of computer equipment for everybody, I said, `Why don't you just cancel my order and give me two boxes of No. 2 pencils? That's all I need for the job.'"" Circuit Court Judge Michael W. Gage was pictured in The PostCrescent (Appleton) tr ying out equipment to assist hearing impaired jurors at the Outagamie County Justice Center. The goal, Gage said, is to have as many people as possible eligible to serve as jurors. An alternative is real-time court reporting, where the proceedings may be read from a computer screen. Dane County Circuit Court Judge C. William Foust recently appointed John C. Albert as Dane County court commissioner, reported The Star (Sun Prairie). Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Jon P. Wilcox was given an opportunity to reminisce at the dedication of the new and remodeled facilities in the Wild Rose School District, where he was raised and attended school. He recalled what was once the gymnasium and cafeteria where he delivered his valedictorian speech. It is now the wrestling training room and extra commons. Dane County Circuit Court Judge Daniel R. Moeser and District Court Administrator Gail Richardson gave a brief civics lesson in McFarland Community Life. ""We do try very hard to make sure people realize that this is their court system,"" said Richardson. While Moeser said that he is concerned about keeping the courts open and accessible to citizens, he warned that the courts ""are not the solution to all ills in the world."" The Wisconsin State Journal talked to the judges of Dane County's experimental Drug Treatment Court, a program mostly funded by a federal grant. The program seeks to end the ""revolving door of criminal drug courts."" If offenders opt to join the treatment program they must submit to urine tests, counseling, frequent court appearances (before the same judge), home visits, job checks and caseworker interviews. Currently, participants continued on next page  THE THIRD BRANCH  5   come before circuit court judges Steven D. Ebert and Stuart A. Schwartz. While the process demands a lot of participants and it is too early to declare it a success, Ebert said it feels good to watch the graduation of participants who have worked their way through the program. Journalist turned jurist describes Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Diane S. Sykes. Sykes, who worked for the Milwaukee Journal for 18 months before going to law school, told The Daily Reporter, ""Journalism not only teaches you to write thoroughly, but also to discover facts,"" she said. ""That's what lawyering is all about and that's what the trial process is intended to do."" She has been on the bench since 1992. The Leader-Telegram reported on the upcoming retirement of Dunn County Circuit Court Judge Donna J. Muza, who is stepping down at the end of her term in July. According to Muza, retirement plans include spending more time with her husband, Robert, continuing her well-known hobby of knitting mittens (which adorn her Christmas tree and are offered to anyone who wants them) and serving as a reserve judge. Circuit Court Judge Elsa C. Lamelas is the ""one and only Hispanic elected official in both the city and county of Milwaukee,"" according to an article in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. A Cuban refugee who came to the United States at the age of 10, Lamelas remembers her mother's words as she boarded the plane for Florida 32 years ago: "". . . never forget where you come from."" That could explain why she regularly speaks to Hispanic groups, why she is proud to be a role model for Hispanic children and why a small Cuban flag stands in her china cabinet. As Municipal Judge Edmund Nix prepares to step down from the bench in April he shared some advice in a La Crosse Tribune article. Nix is known for sentencing juvenile shoplifters with writing an essay about why stealing is wrong. ""I find that about 95 percent of the (children) opt voluntarily to do the essay, and many of the essays are inspiring,"" he said. ""And I've found the recidivism rate is extremely low. That is the most gratifying thing."" The Walworth County Bar Association dedicated a plaque in memory of Judge Ernst John Watts, who held the bench from 1960 to 1973. After leaving his judicial post he served as dean of the American College of the State Judiciary at the University of Nevada, Reno. Later, he traveled the world lecturing and training judges. Watts died on February 2, 1997. Walworth County Circuit Court Judges Michael S. Gibbs, John R. Race and James L. Carlson were pictured in the Elkhorn Independent attending the ceremony. The Capital Times photographed Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice N. Patrick Crooks swearing in fifteen students from Mendota Elementary School as ""peer mediators."" These students are part of the PEACE (Peers in Education Addressing Conflict Effectively) program sponsored by the State Bar of Wisconsin and Attorney General James Doyle. Trempealeau County Circuit Court Judge John A. Damon reported on the first year of small claims mediation in The Blair Press. The program has received positive evaluations from participants. ""It has been great in saving court time and it has allowed greater participation in the court system by our citizens,"" he said. One of Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Patricia D. McMahon's biggest influences was the civil rights struggle of the '60s. It led her to become one of only four women in the 1968 class at Emory University Law School in Atlanta. She graduated first in  her class. According to McMahon, ""the South was not particularly receptive to women lawyers,"" so her search for work brought her to Foley & Lardner in Milwaukee, she told The Daily Reporter. Still interested in constitutional law, McMahon was recently recommended for a vacancy on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. She did not receive the nod. Last October, Chief Justice Shirley S. Abrahamson asked Chief Judge Barbara A. Kluka, Kenosha County Circuit Court, to join a group of judges who were traveling to China to teach judges there about the American judicial system, an invitation Kluka gladly accepted. Upon Kluka's return she was interviewed by the Kenosha News. The purpose of this trip, which was sponsored by the Ford Foundation, was to bring the perspective of foreign judges to China as they consider reforming their judicial system. Manitowoc's Herald Times Reporter reminded readers: ""Court isn't only way to end disputes."" The paper was talking about Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR). ""The idea is to end disputes quickly and not incur substantial costs preparing for a trial neither party wants,"" said Manitowoc County Circuit Court Judge Fred H. Hazlewood. Langlade County Circuit Court Judge James P. Jansen gave an overview of the U.S. Constitution, referring to the document as a ""work of art,"" at the Langlade County Historical Society's annual meeting, reported the Antigo Daily Journal. Dorothy L. Bain, recently appointed Marathon County Circuit Court judge, was awarded the Athena Award, reported the Wausau Daily Herald. The award is given annually to top Wausau business and professional women. Bain is the second judge to receive the award. In 1990, the award was given to Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Ann Walsh Bradley. District I Court of Appeals Judge Charles B. Schudson attributes much of his career success, according to The Daily Reporter, to two early failures in his life. That is why Schudson said he tells students, ""The question is not `Will you fail?' Of course you will -- many times. The question is `How will you deal with failure?'. . . And can you, as the saying goes, take those lemons and make lemonade?"" Dodge County Circuit Court judges were congratulated for their creative juvenile sentencing strateg y by state Senator Scott Fitzgerald in The Reporter. Fitzgerald was talking about Dodge County's Responsibility Adjustment Program (RAP) initiated and supervised by judges Andrew P. Bissonnette, David W. Klossner and John R. Storck. Each month, judges, local law enforcement and volunteers supervise approximately 80 youth offenders in a community service projects. Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Ann Walsh Bradley studied religion, English and philosophy in college, she told The Daily Reporter. After graduation, she taught religion at Aquinas High School in La Crosse, but her interest in the law made her return to school. ""There is, with this kind of background, almost a natural attraction toward a system of justice,"" Bradley said. ""You're concerned with ethics. You're concerned with reflecting on the law and reflecting on the facts."" In January, Judge Gregory A. Peterson, Eau Claire County Circuit Court, served on a panel to discuss issues of life and morality such as physician-assisted suicide, living wills, cloning, the right to die, human dignity and ""do not resuscitate"" orders. The panel continued on back cover  6  THE THIRD BRANCH   Cour ts' Sesquicentennial Celebration Moves Forward Colorful Court, Legal Lore Comes to Life Think it's difficult to build a courthouse today? In 1882, ten months after the Wood County Board appropriated funds for a new courthouse, the building sat partially built and the workers went without pay as a legal battle over the expenditure wore on. The local paper wrote: ""Let rather the accursed building be sold to the highest bidder and the debts be paid, and let us hold court in a log house or on some hospitable lumber pile, where the curses of the toilers and the cries of the children for bread will not reach our ears; where the Great Judge will not frown, holding us to account for such inequity."" Courthouse security concerns? In Clark County's first courthouse, county officers were seldom in their offices, so residents needing information from county records simply entered the building and helped themselves. On the rare occasion when the door was locked, they would crawl through the window, which was always open. This and other colorful information on local court history and legal lore has been distributed to every judge and court administrator in the state. Each individual received information on his or her home county, but may request additional counties. The quality and quantity of material located on each county varies greatly. The Wisconsin Supreme Court and the Director of State Courts Office -- with help from many judges, clerks of circuit court, attorneys, local historical societies and Supreme Court interns -- collected and distributed the material in hopes that it will be useful in speeches or for handouts or plaques in honor of the state's sesquicentennial. The material is now part of a permanent archive at the state Supreme Court. Further contributions are welcome and should be sent to Karen Leone de Nie at P.O. Box 1688, Madison, Wis., 53701-1688.  Publications Tailored for Sesquicentennial A number of publications have been, or will be, produced in honor of the state's sesquicentennial. These include:  The 1998 Law Day Kit, Sesquicentennial Edition. This was mailed to local bar associations, county courthouses and others interested in organizing Law Day events. The kit includes synopses of 23 famous Wisconsin Supreme Court cases, local court history / legal lore, mock trial transcripts, 20 articles on important people / events in Wisconsin's legal history and other useful material for counties to use in Law Day / sesquicentennial activities. Call (608) 264-6256 to obtain a copy.  A bio g r aphy b o ok, il lust r ate d w ith p o r t r aits and photographs of all Wisconsin Supreme Court justices since statehood, is in production. Two judges have volunteered their time to help edit the book. They are Judge Paul C. Gartzke and Judge Thomas E. Fairchild. For more information, call (608) 261-8297.  A packet of biographies of Wisconsin's deceased chief justices since statehood is available now to visitors of the court and by calling (608) 266-1298.  A special sesquicentennial version of retired Chief Justice Roland B. Day's brochure on the artwork of the Supreme Court has been produced with funding from the Statehood Day Commission. These are available in bulk to all courthouses; call (608) 266-1298.  Simple, low-cost visitors' guides for local courthouses continue to be produced through the State Bar of Wisconsin. continued on next page  THE THIRD BRANCH  7   The guides feature maps, phone numbers, courthouse history and more. For more information on how to put one together for your county, call (608) 264-6256.  A poster which will feature photographs of about 20 of the state's roughly 40 historic courthouses is in the works. The 20 are the best examples of the various types of architecture reflected in Wisconsin's courthouses. The Director of State Courts Office will distribute these to courthouses statewide. The State Historical Society is producing the poster.  Rope of Sand Tickets Now Available The Glover / Booth stor y will be brought to life in an original play, Rope of Sand, which will be performed at the Madison Civic Center, Starlight Room, on Thursday, May 28 (7:30 p.m.) and Friday, May 29 (1 p.m. and 7:30 p.m.). The play, commissioned by the Linda Franklin Wisconsin Supreme Court with a grant from the Wisconsin Sesquicentennial Commission, is by Madison playwright Marc Kornblatt and directed by Betty Diamond. Vocalist Linda Franklin will serve as music director and will play one of several Joshua Glover roles written, Greek-chorus style, into the play. Ellen M. Castro, an employee of the office of the Clerk of Supreme Court and Court of Appeals, will be stage manager. James McDuffie Rope of Sand was recently read for the first time at the Wisconsin Supreme Court, with Franklin, along with Madison firefighter James McDuffie and former Madison Affirmative Action Director Eugene Parks reading the lead roles. University of Wisconsin Law Professor Gordon B. Baldwin, Reserve Judge Paul C. Gartzke, Supreme Court Commissioner Joseph M. Wilson, Interim Assistant to the Chief Justice Trina E. Haag and local actors Mark Bluel, James Buske, Robert Curry, Patrick Fernan, Jack Math and Steven Montagne all read parts. Tickets for Rope of Sand are $3 and may be ordered by writing: Rope of Sand, P.O. Box 1688, Madison, Wis. 53701-1688. Checks should be made out to Wis c onsin Supre me Cour t. Please indicate a first and second choice for show date and time, along with a telephone number and the number of seats requested. Anyone interested in auditioning for a part may call Betty Diamond at (608) 257-5548. Those willing to volunteer for a variety of duties at the show should call Amanda K. Todd, court information officer, at (608) 264-6256.  Oral History Project Well Underway The project to record an oral history of the Wisconsin court system is continuing, with Trina E. Haag, interim assistant to the chief justice, interviewing long-serving judges. The latest interview subject was Senior Judge Thomas E. Fairchild of the U.S. Court of Appeals. The project began at the Judicial Conference last fall, where 21 judges met with reporters to discuss the campaigns they ran, the qualities a judge should have, the best / worst parts of the job, their most high-profile cases, their relationship with the media and the bar, and much more. The transcripts will be donated to the State Historical Society and the law schools at Marquette University and the University of Wisconsin to be used by researchers. In addition, the material may be used as the basis for newspaper articles on the history of the courts during the state's sesquicentennial year. Portions of the videotaped interviews may be edited into an educational piece for schools, but this will not be completed as a project for the sesquicentennial. The following judges have provided general interviews covering their years on the bench: John Ahlgrimm, John G. Buchen, William E. Crane, Robert F. Curtin, Edwin C. Dahlberg, Roland B. Day, Thomas E. Fairchild, Paul C. Gartzke, Harry F. Gundersen, Gerald W. Jaeckle, Ronald D. Keberle, Ernest C. Keppler, Robert W. Landry, Russell J. Mittelstadt, Peter G. Pappas, Robert Parins, Robert F. Pfiffner, James Wilbershide and David Willis. In addition, Justice William A. Bablitch and Judges Thomas H. Barland, Frederick Kessler and James W. Rice participated together in an interview about the court reorganization of 1978. Bablitch, who was Senate Majority Leader at the time, shepherded the reorganization through the Wisconsin Legislature.  The Glover / Booth Story When it was still in its infancy, the Wisconsin Supreme Cour t b e came involved in one of the major northern struggles against slavery. The case centered on a fugitive slave named Joshua Glover who sought freedom in Wisconsin only to be tracked down by his former owner, captured in Racine and jailed. A Milwaukee newspaper publisher, Sherman Booth, who fought for Glover's freedom, was arrested for violating the Fugitive Slave Act. The legal battle over Booth's role in Glover's e ventual escap e from the Milwaukee jail (after a crowd of citizens broke down the jailhouse door) pitted the Wisconsin Supreme Court against the federal courts and dramatically framed the argument over states rights versus the ultimate authority of the federal government as the nation faced civil war. The play Rope of Sand will retell this impor tant stor y on May 28 and 29 (see above).  8  THE THIRD BRANCH   Glover / Booth Video in Production A different treatment of the Glover / Booth story (taking less dramatic license and weaving in more Civil War history) is being produced with Wisconsin Public Television, also with a grant from the Wisconsin Sesquicentennial Commission. The show will be either a half-hour or one hour long, depending upon the material uncovered and the availability of several well-known African-American actors who have expressed preliminary interest in being part of the project. Harvard University Professor Richard Newman, who recently published a book on African-American spirituals, is consulting on music for the production. The piece will include interviews with Chief Justice Shirley S. Abrahamson, University of Wisconsin Law Professor Gordon B. Baldw in, Universit y of Wisconsin Afr icanAmer ican Studies Depar t ment Chair Richard Ralston, historian / scholar Ruby West Jackson (who is working on a book about Joshua Glover) and more, and will air statewide when it is completed next fall. It will also be made available through the Department of Public Instruction to schools statewide along with teaching materials on the state and federal courts and on the case.

Supreme Court History Showcased at Sesquicentennial Reception History came to life for close to 400 people who attended a sesquicentennial reception at the Supreme Court held in conjunction with the State Bar's Midwinter Convention in January. Lawyers, judges, legislators, clerks of circuit court, court staff and other guests gathered in the Supreme Court Hearing Room and chambers, and the State Law Library, as live jazz and classical music from a grand piano filled the air.  Supreme Court Will Host Open House for Law Day The art and antique furniture that has been restored to the Wisconsin Supreme Court Hearing Room and chambers will provide the backdrop for a special Supreme Court open house on Law Day, May 1. While details are still being worked out, the open house will run for much of the day. The general public, school groups, media and anyone else with an interest is welcome to attend. Members of the Court will be on hand to give tours and answer questions and a variety of court-related publications will be available.  Writing Contest Will Net Law Student $1,500 The Wisconsin Supreme Court, in cooperation with both the University of Wisconsin Law School and Marquette University Law School, is sponsoring a writing contest which will focus on the importance of law in our lives, how the law has shaped American society and how progress and change have shaped the types of cases the courts handle. Professors Arthur McEvoy (UW) and Gordon Hylton (Marquette) have developed the materials and are overseeing the contest. A private, anonymous donor has put up a $1,500 prize for the w inning essay. The w inner w ill be announced on Statehood Day, May 29, 1998.  Guests toured the Wisconsin State Law Library and admired the special sesquicentennial displays organized by the staff.  Chief Justice to be Featured in March ""Sesquicentennial Minute"" Chief Justice Shirley S. Abrahamson will be featured during the week of March 15 in a one-minute spot on Lavinia Goodell, the first woman admitted to practice before the Wisconsin Supreme Court. The piece is part of a 52-part series by Wisconsin Public Television. Goodell, a Rock County lawyer, petitioned for admission to the bar of the state Supreme Court in 1875. Chief Justice Edward George Ryan initially denied the application, writing: ""There are many employments in life not unfit for the female character. The profession of the law is surely not one of these. . . ."" Shortly after, the state Legislature passed a bill to admit Goodell to the bar. When her application again came before the Supreme Court, Ryan dissented but two justices agreed and she was admitted. y  In preparation for the event, mahogany and oak furniture, commissioned in the early 1900s for the Supreme Court, was brought back to the Court from other state offices and storage units and arranged as it might once have looked. Artwork long kept in boxes, depicting former justices and courtrooms, now decorates the walls. Since 1848, there have been 76 justices on the high Court. The Court located missing portraits of five out of the six justices from the Court's early days who have never hung with the rest. Old newspaper clippings, Blue Book entries and memorial addresses were used to create brief biographies of the justices that now hang alongside their portraits. These biographies and portraits are being reproduced in a booklet. Each justice has an interesting story. For example, the Court traced a picture of Justice Theodore Lewis (who served on the  10  THE THIRD BRANCH   Law Clerks Bring Myriad Life Experiences to Cour t by: Karen Leone de Nie Editor's note: The Wisconsin Court of Appeals is 20 years old this year. In honor of this milestone, each 1998 issue of The Third Branch will feature stories about the Court and the people who work there. Judge Patricia S. Curley suggested the first feature subjects. aw clerks Hays Ellisen and Sara J. MacCarthy have spent the past year researching and edit ing opinions and learning about the Wisconsin Court of Appeals. Like many of their colleagues in the appellate courts, Ellisen and MacCarthy bring to the job a fascinating array of life experiences. In this case, those experiences include advocacy for migrant farmworkers, a Peace Corps stint in Cameroon and a teaching job with kids so frightening that turning one's back to write on the chalkboard was risky. Before accepting a clerkship with Judge Patricia S. Curley at District I of the Court of Appeals, Ellisen spent more than a year as a le g al inte r n f o r the Mig r ant Farmworker Justice Project in Belle Glade, Fla. He visited labor camps to talk with the Latino and Haitian workers about their living and working conditions. These farm laborers, who acquire special certification to work seasonally in the United States, do not have union organizing rights, Ellisen said. The Justice Project advocates for the rights of these laborers who perform jobs, it says, that most American workers would not. His next clerkship took him to Detroit from 1995 to 1996. As part of the National Lawyers Guild-Sugar Law Center, Ellisen worked with local community groups and the Nat ional Asso ciat io n fo r the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) to halt construction of a wood-burning incinerator in Flint, Mich. The incinerator was slated to take the wood waste, often containing lead-based paint, from buildings being demolished in Detroit. While they did not stop the construction, they did win a court ruling that the incinerator's emissions must be regularly monitored. Ellisen won his first jury trial as a student attorney at the Child Advocacy Law Clinic in Ann Arbor, Mich., where he successfully argued a termination of parental rights case. At the clinic, he worked closely with abused children and with parents accused of neglect or abuse. THE THIRD BRANCH  L  B o r n in Ne w Yor k and r aise d in Appleton, Ellisen attended the University of Minnesota with plans to pursue a degree in English, but later decided that the field, as he said, ""was kind of mur k y."" He graduated summa cum laude in 1993 with a bachelor's degree in philosophy and a minor in Norwegian. Reviewing his educational background, Ellisen realized that he could either teach philosophy or move to Norway. Because neither option was appealing, he decided to take the LSAT. He graduated from the University of Michigan Law School in December 1996. Since June of last year, Ellisen has served as a law clerk in the Court of Appeals. He said the job has helped him to lear n Wisconsin law. While he may eventually return to practice social justice law, he acknowledged the burden of law school loans and hopes to find litigation work with a Milwaukee firm. El lisen, a die-hard bicyclist, r ides through the winter (which has not been too difficult this year). He also enjoys reading, playing guitar and cheering on the Green Bay Packers. When asked about his family, Ellisen replied: ""single, but looking."" Dow n the hall in Judge Charles B. Schudson's chambers, Sara J. MacCarthy has brought her own colorful credentials to the Court of Appeals. Said Schudson: ""I never thought that I would hire a law clerk who was fresh out of law school and I had countless applicants and I was ready to hire any one of them and she just blew them all away. She has been everything I had hoped for and more. ""Despite the fact that she had just come out of law school, she had wonderful life experience, and particularly life experience outside of law that I consider to be a critical asset,"" he said. MacCarthy said Schudson has helped her improve her editing skills and has taught her self discipline and how to work as part of a team. As she drafts an opinion, MacCarthy said that Schudson frequently reminds her, ""What do you want the court and the human being [the defendant, victim, attorney] to take away from the opinion?"" He has taught her to move away from the legalese and get directly to the essence of the issue. As a Peace Corps volunteer, MacCarthy was stationed in Cameroon, Africa, for  Law Clerk Hays Ellisen  Law Clerk Sara J. MacCarthy  more than two years, teaching English to French-sp eaking youth. T here, she w itnessed vast differences between the African and American cultures. For example, she said, the profession of teaching was hig hl y resp e c te d in Afr ica and her colleagues boasted master's and doctorate d e g re es from we l l-know n Europ ean institutions. She also found that the people of Cameroon place less priority on their work and more on their families and personal relationships. MacCarthy said the Peace Corps gave her an op p or t unit y to explore other cultures and gain a new perspective. ""I would encour ag e e ve r yone, esp e cial ly retiring judges, to join the Peace Corps,"" she said. A nat ive of ce nt r al Massa chuse tts, MacCarthy was inspired to learn about other cultures while still in college. An anthrop olo g y p ro f essor, w ho m she described as a ""fantastic mentor,"" helped her decide to pursue a degree in anthropology. She also earned a minor in French. For her senior thesis, MacCarthy studied second language acquisition in the Hmong people and taught English as a second language to young men. Upon her return to the United States in 1991, she found work as a school counselor and substitute teacher at Robert F. Kennedy Action Corps in Lancaster, Mass. Her stud e nts we re v ic t ims w ho ha d b e co me offenders and there she faced new challenges. The discipline problems were so severe that she felt she could not turn her back to the class to write on the chalkboard. The experience was, she said, ""very sad and very frightening."" While MacCarthy acknowledged she did not have the heart for this work, the job did convince her to enroll in law school.

As individuals, we have much to offer because of our par ticular life exper iences. Because of our for tunate circumstances, we are in a position to make contributions of time and energy. Finally, there is the satisfaction that comes from making a difference in a child's life. There are, of course, constraints that we judges operate under in our community activities that other citizens don't have. We do not want to be involved in advocacy organizations that are, or might be, involved in litigation and we must be careful not to use the influence of our office in ways that would violate our code of ethics. The constraint of time, of demanding work schedules, is also significant. But if we look, we can find ways to participate in volunteer activ ities in our communities that are consistent with our ethical obligations and our schedules. I would like to encourage other judges to write about their volunteer experiences in their communities and to let the rest of us know of programs that are suitable for judges' participation and need volunteers. No doubt there are stories that would enlighten and inspire us as we go about our work of judging. y  A Partnership for Justice it was recording his singing (with back up) and science experiments (preferably the kind that fizzed and sparked and made a mess). With Jimmy, so far, it is drawing and learning the alphabet. With each child, a real bond developed. I still think often of Joey and Sam, and if either comes back to Madison, I would like to reestablish a relationship. Meanwhile, when Jimmy sees me at the classroom door each Monday, he races over with a grin and a hug. As judges, we regularly volunteer our time to professional organizations and to speaking in our communities on judicial and legal topics. I think it is just as important that we participate as citizens in our communities by volunteering in programs f o r childre n that ne e d assistance. Participating in our communities outside of our judicial roles may give us insights, knowledge and relationships that we might miss if we limit ourselves to our usual professional and social circles. We see in the courtroom all the time the results of children not having the adult guidance and support that ever y child ne e ds. I am guessing that there are programs in all of our communities that are trying to address this: Big Brothers and Big Sisters, after school or evening tutoring and mentor programs through service organizations, to name just a few.  Volunteer Work With Children Gives Judge New Insights by Judge Margaret J. Vergeront Court of Appeals, District IV onday no ons find me having lunch at Franklin Elementary school with 100 5- and 6year-olds. I am there because I participate in the O.K.

The p ro g r am pairs childre n ide nt ifie d by parents or teachers as needing more attention with adults who are interested in providing that. The idea is that the mentor will build a long-term relationship with the child, encouraging and supporting the child in his or her schooling and being a friend. Jimmy is the third child with whom I have been paired during my several years of participation. (Both the other children moved from Madison due to traumatic family circumstances). With each child, it took some time to develop trust and to find activities that engaged the child and that we could enjoy together. With Joey, it was puzzles and being read to.

Haag Interim Assistant to the Chief Justice few year s back, a young woman in Barron Count y was in financial trouble. Convicted of welfare fr aud, she served a short jail term and was then pla ce d w ith a Judge public housing Edward R. Brunner agency to perform community service. Now, she has a full-time job as assistant director of the agency. Judge Edward R. Brunner implemented Barron County's community service program in 1992. It allows judges to impose community service in lieu of jail time and / or fines in certain cases involving minor criminal charges or traffic violations. Community service sentencing has long been an option, but there was not an organized way to do it. Now, in an average month, Barron County has between 50 to  A  60 offenders completing approximately 400 hours of community service at 20 to 30 sites. Usually two to three offenders are referred back to court. Br unner said co mmunit y ser v ice sentencing saves tax dollars and improves community life. Each summer in Barron, for example, the Kiwanis Club organizes flower planting throughout the city. Juvenile offenders, ordered by the cour t into communit y service, plant and water the flowers. The youth sp end t ime w ith p otent ial role models while providing tangible benefits to the community. Those benefits come in many forms. In 1997, Barron County saved $71,486 in jail and detention costs (it costs $130 per day to place a juvenile in secure detention and $65 per day to jail an adult) by carefully placing selected offenders in community se r v ice sites. Br unner note d that the program also allows offenders to forge positive relations within their communities and build self-esteem. Key to the program's success, according to Brunner, is for judges to play a visible role. Brunner said that community agencies  respect the bench and appreciate the judges' active participation. This means maintaining contact with the agencies and resolving problems quickly. Last April, at the Volunteers in the Courts conference in Madison, Brunner gave a p resentat ion o n the B ar ro n Count y community ser vice program. After the conference, about 70 people requested packets of material about the program. Almost a year later, word continues to spread. Brunner said the Barron County program has been flooded with phone calls. Eau Claire is one of several counties interested in implementing the Barron County model. The Eau Claire Circuit Cour t judges, at the request of Judge Benjamin D. Proctor, invited members of the community to the county courthouse on March 11 to gauge interest and encourage discussion. They hope to develop a netwo r k of g ove r nmental age ncies and non-profit organizations to provide placement options for offenders. To receive an informational packet on the community service sentencing program, contact Judge Edward R. Brunner or Coordinator Bruce Sockness at (715) 537-6399. y  Love, Marriage and Divorce at Jef ferson High School by: Trina E. Haag Interim Assistant to the Chief Justice his year, 16 students enrolled in Jefferson High School's Contemporary Family Relations Course. However, the success of a new program incorporated into the class, ""Real Life: Marriage and Divorce,"" has more than doubled the class size for next year. The program, a joint effort between the Jefferson County Bar Association and the school board, uses volunteer attorneys, social workers, judges and divorcees in a six-week module that educates students about the realities of marriage and divorce, including partner selection, sexual relations, financial difficulties and child custody battles. A similar program, organized by Attorneys Raymond E. Krek and Richard Podell, was piloted at Shorewood High School in 1993 to address high divorce rates. The program is now running at Jefferson High School under the direction of teacher Carolyn Behrens and Attorney Bennett Brantmeier. ""The growth in my kids has been amazing. . . they absolutely loved the course and have talked it up so much that other kids are signing up,"" Behrens said. THE THIRD BRANCH  T  Two sophomore students at Jefferson High School said that because of the course they are better listeners, take fewer things for granted and believe that teenagers are too young to be thinking about marriage. Behrens said that they used the 1993 program as a model, but altered several components. For instance, instead of discussing problems with sexual intimacy in marriage, she asked a social worker to talk collectively about sex, love and friendship. Her objective was for students to understand the relative importance of sex in a relationship and realize that companionship helps make a marriage work. The local bar association arranged all the speakers and Behrens wrote objectives ahead of time, to direct the discussion. The group of lawyers, Behrens said, was ""very committed, present at all the events. . . just terrific to work with."" A major component of the program was a mock divorce trial at the county courthouse. Reserve Judge Arnold Schumann acted as the presiding judge. Four Jefferson County lawyers acted as litigants and counsel and convincingly played out the drama. Schumann used a ""humorous, honest and straightforward approach"" to connect to the students, Behrens said.

Jensen, Court Improvement Program Coordinator ddressing a diverse crowd of nearly 60 child welfare professionals attending the Coordinated Approach to Family Law Cases conference U. S. Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala stressed that the courts, the government, educators, human services and law enforcement must stop protecting their own turf and work together to win the battle against child abuse and neglect. ""We need a seamless system so that no child ever falls through the cracks,"" said Shalala. Shalala, keynote speaker at the three-day conference held at the Wingspread facility in R a cine, a dvo cate d a c hild w e lfare strategy of prevention, protection and permanency that would support existing families when possible and create new families when necessary. The purpose of the conference was to increase par t icipants' unde r standing , through presentations and dialogue, of the problems and potential for improving services for families in court. Also, through a series of facilitated small group exercises, participants were asked to develop a co mpre he nsive invento r y of pro je c ts that could be implemented over the next few years as part of the Court Improvement Program. During one session, a panel of biological parents, foster parents and young adults shared what it was like for them to go through the child abuse and neglect system. Moderated by Rosemarie Carbino, Clinical Professor of Social Work at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the panel members indicated that:  families involved in the system often do not understand what is happening to them and the process itself creates as many problems as it attempts to address;  sensitivity towards cultural differences should be an important component of the child welfare system;  problems need to be addressed quickly and comprehensively before they become serious crises; A panel of biological parents, foster parents and young adults shared what it was like for them to go through the child abuse and neglect system.  A  U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala was keynote speaker at the conference, which explored the problems and potential for improving services for families in court.   judges, attorneys and human services practitioners need to better understand the lives of people caught-up in the system, particularly the lives of people with very limited resources. Whe n de ve loping p ote nt ial cour t improvement projects, participants were divided into four multi-disciplinary work teams, with judges, attorneys, human services providers, law enforcement officials, educators, legislators and child advocates in each group. Below are a few of the suggested projects: 1. develop and implement an ongoing inter-agency CHIPS training program; 2. p re pare a co mp re hensive CHIPS resource guide; 3. establish a child advocacy team; 4. conduct a statewide conference on Native American and other diverse cultural perspectives on responding to  child abuse and other family problems; 5. establish a series of county CHIPS improvement projects and 6. create more Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) Programs. The Wingspread conference, sponsored by the Wisconsin Supreme Cour t, the Johnson Foundat ion and the U.S. D e par t me nt of Health and Human Services, is one many projects being undertaken as part of the Court Improvement Pro g r am. T he Cour t Imp roveme nt Pro g r am is a fe d er al g r ant pro g r am designed to help states assess and improve the handling of Child in Need of Protection or Services (CHIPS) cases.

The conference will showcase pilot projects developed and implemented as a result of Wingspread and will expand the network of child welfare professionals working to improve the system. y  14  THE THIRD BRANCH   Quick Reference Sheets Available  T  he Wisconsin Supreme Court and Director of State Courts Office have produced a series of informational sheets designed to improve understanding -- both within and outside of the courts -- of the many offices of the court system.

Nichol, Michael W. Nowakowski and Paul B. Higginbotham. Other trial judges may participate in future years. The program is modeled on an exchange program that has been on-going in the federal courts. Federal judges who participated in the program found it to be a rewarding, but humbling, experience. When U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist presided over a civil rights trial in Richmond, Virginia -- marking the first time this century that a U.S. Supreme Court justice had presided over a trial -- he was reversed on appeal. Judge Richard Posner, of the U.S. Court of Appeals, volunteered to preside over a case involving copyright infr ingements and he, to o, found his ruling overturned.  Judges from both courts are anticipating that the program will be a success and that it will make the judges more aware of the issues faced by colleagues at different levels in the system. ""This program will enable appellate judges to broaden their understanding of the practices, procedures and problems faced by trial judges, and this experience will assist us in reviewing cases on appeal,"" said Eich. ""Trial judges must make their rulings, many of them involving complex rules of law, from the bench, in the urgency of trial; it can only benefit appellate judges to gain some first-hand experience with the actual conditions and pressures under which the trial judges must carry out their responsibilities on a daily basis."" Judge Daniel R. Moeser, chief judge of the Fifth Judicial District, said the program will be equally valuable for the trial judges. ""I  Chief Judge William Eich  Chief Judge Daniel R. Moeser  think we will see trial judges coming through this program with a deeper understanding of what it takes to create a trial court record that will pass appellate review,"" he said. ""The exchange will offer judges a truly unique opportunity for continuing education and the bottom line will be improved service to the people of the state."" y  A Cour t of Appeals Judge Takes the Circuit Bench by Charles P. Dykman, District IV Court of Appeals Judge  I  have asked a number of times to spend a week or so as an acting circuit court judge. I felt that this would be helpful to me when I reviewed transcripts of trial court proceedings. The experience was even better than the idea. Overall, I am impressed with the  volume of work which gets done in a very short time. When I discussed this with a circuit judge, he put it in familiar terms -- the struggle between quantity and quality. Monday morning I ""took charge of "" about 20 misdemeanors which had been scheduled for a jury trial that week. Chief Judge Moeser explained that only a few of these cases would actually go to trial and this was correct. Of the 20 or so cases, all  of w hich could not be settled ear lier because one or both parties would not accept a negotiated plea, two went to trial. I picked a jury for one of them and Judge Moeser picked the other. (I had told Judge Moeser that I would prefer not to try a jury trial, though I now think that I was being too conservative). We accepted pleas on the remaining 18 or so cases, which was no easy task for me.

I admire your willingness to give up the security of your position in order to be of more direct service to ALL of the people of this state. (a teacher).

You also challenge me to use my talents in the best manner possible. (a judge).  Bravo!! (a judge).  Chief Justice Shirley S. Abrahamson added a simple and eloquent statement to the mix (see full text accompanying this story): ""We have been close personal friends and agreed on cases and administrative matters. We have been close personal friends and disagreed on cases and administrative matters. That's what being close personal friends and being judges is all about. I have over many months urged her to complete her term. She has decided not to do so. I will miss my friend more than I can tell you."" y  Love, Marriage. . . Continued from page 13 Schumann, 66, was a perfect candidate to be involved in the program--he has been married for 46 years. He said he volunteered his time to the program because he enjoys educating children about the work of the courts. Schumann was a circuit court judge  in Jefferson County for 12 years before retiring in 1995 Brantmeier, who coordinated this effort with the Jefferson County Bar, said Reserve Judge Schumann was ""fantastic."" The judge's involvement let the students know that judges command respect, but are approachable. In addition to participating in the mock trial, the judge came to school a week  later to discuss in more depth what the students observed. If you have questions on the program, or if you would like a copy of the curriculum guide and / or the 20-minute promotional video from the Jefferson County program, please contact Attorney Bennett Brantmeier at (920) 674-4567. y  Law Clerks Geske Resignation Continued from page 1 Justice Geske has in her tenure on the Court made a difference. She has made a difference in the oral arguments, in the written opinions and at the conference table. We will miss her. We wish her well. We know that whatever career paths she takes, she will do her work extraordinarily well and that she will continue to serve the people and the state in important ways. Let me now speak as a friend -- I knew of Janine Geske and had met her several times before Governor Thompson appointed her to the Wisconsin Supreme Court. When we began to work together on the Court Janine and I became close personal friends. We have been close personal friends and agreed on cases and administrative matters. We have been close personal friends and disagreed on cases and administrative matters. That's what being close personal friends and being judges is all about. We will continue to be close personal friends, but we both know it will be different. I have learned a great deal from Janine about life and law. I have over many months urged her to complete her term. She has decided not to do so. I will miss my friend more than I can tell you. As the Chief Justice of the Wisconsin Supreme Court and as Janine Geske's friend, I accept, with great reluctance, Justice Geske's decision to resign as Justice of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin. y Continued from page 11 time something went wrong, ""the first person they [the students] called for was their lawyer,"" she said. She returned to Wisconsin to attend Marquette University Law School (she also received her bachelor's degree at Marquette) and graduated in 1996. MacCarthy was a student intern in the Wisconsin State Public Defender's office in Milwaukee for one year while in law school. There, she handled motions and briefs, argued evidentiary motions and assisted in pretrial plea negotiations and client interviews. MacCarthy said the number of people in the system and the slow and deliberate pace can make it easy to become callous. She tried to remember that, while the cases might be routine for the attorneys, they can be very traumatic for the people involved. This experience raised her comfort level in the courtroom and helped her decide where she eventually hopes to work -- in the public defender's or district attorney's office. When asked how she handled stress, she recalled a phone call from her brother in Los Angeles. He saw a billboard that made him think of her. It read, ""The softest pillow is a clear conscience."" With that in mind, MacCarthy said she focuses on doing her best and doing what she enjoys. MacCarthy is married to Paul Tiffin, who works in the Milwaukee County District Attorney's Office. They enjoy taking long walks with their dogs Buster Brown and Nico (named after the singer from the Velvet Underground) and making great dinners. MacCarthy and Tiffin plan to stay in Wisconsin. MacCarthy said, ""I love the Midwest. . . the people are very kind, sincere."" y  16  THE THIRD BRANCH   Spring Election Continued from page 3  Delforge, Waggoner Contest Oconto County Circuit Court he race will determine who will sit in Oconto County's new Branch 2.

It is easy enough to say that a defendant should make a knowing and voluntary waiver of a trial and enter a plea, but another thing to do it, knowing that a mistake may jeopardize a future case which depends upon a valid conviction. This is done with attorneys and defendants milling around, all of them with time constraints. Judge Charles P. Dykman I also worked intake and set bail and, again, the number of cases impressed me. Most of the answers were easy, but several cases raised problems of liberty versus availability for trial. Harassment injunctions (temporar y restraining orders, or TROs), are perhaps the most difficult matters I faced. Most litigants are pro-se, which requires the judge to develop the facts. I was told that these hearings are of vital importance to the persons bringing them and that was the case in one that I tried. I had 18  thought that determining witness credibility would be easy, but I was quite wrong. These cases can also be used as a vehicle for harassment. One of the cases to which I was assigned might well have been an attempt at revenge. One of the week's more interesting moments came during a hearing on a TRO. The case could be described as a girlfriend suing a wife for an injunction to prevent the wife from driving back and forth in front of the girlfriend's home, calling the answering machine and running the tape out and doing something with a pager. The husband, in jail at the time for violating a TRO brought by the wife, was living with the girlfriend and needed the answering machine for his business. The husband and wife were in the middle of a divorce. The first document the girlfriend submitted was a certified copy of a name change showing she had changed her last name to that of the husband and the wife in anticipation of marrying the man as soon as the divorce was final. In a final twist, the wife's attorney wanted to call the girlfriend's attorney as a witness, because at trial it came out that the vehicle in question had been signed over to the girlfriend's attorney as compensation. Though perhaps amusing to an outsider, this was very serious for the parties and their attorneys. I was a bit taken aback at the reactions when I concluded that the girlfriend had failed to meet her burden of proof. y THE THIRD BRANCH   Obituaries Judge Richard Bardwell Dane County Circuit Court etired Judge Richard Bardwell, known for his imposing size and dry wit, died February 27 of cancer. He was 82. Bardwell retired in 1987 after 30 years on the bench. His retirement was hastened by injuries he suffered in a 1986 bicycle accident. Friends told the Wisconsin State Journal that the turning point in the judge's recovery from the devastating accident came when a hospital visitor suggested that he retire early and allow Governor Anthony Earl to appoint a successor. Bardwell, who is said to have abhorred the appointment of judges, immediately began to rip the bandages off his head (or so the story went).

Ten months ago, on 13 March 2000, Governor Leavitt signed into law House Bill 157  Online Access at Public Libraries , which had been passed by the 2000 Legislature. The law requires that local library boards adopt and enforce a policy that restricts access by minors to Internet sites containing obscene material in order for the library to maintain eligibility to receive state funds. In less than six months, on 1 July 2001, the law will take effect. By that time, librarians and library boards statewide are required to take informed and responsible action.   Under the law, the State Library Division is charged to establish ""standards for the public library online access policy,"" and to enforce the intent of the Legislature that public libraries not having an Internet access policy that meets these standards shall not receive state funds, specifically the Public Library Development Grants.   The Division has proposed a formal rule to govern its administration of the law. A public hearing on Administrative Rule R223-2 ""Public Library Online Access for Eligibility to Receive Public Funds"" was held on 4 January 2001 at the State Library to receive comment from librarians and the public. The February 2001 issue of  Directions  will report that hearing, give the status of the Rule, and discuss the relationship between the Rule and local library Internet access policies.   Note:  The text of H.B. 157, Administrative Rule R223-2, and an analysis of R223-2 can be accessed easily at the Division's  web site  under ""Timely Topics.""   Public Libraries and the Internet: Thinking About Policy    Information available through the Internet has come to be a revolutionary component of the services offered by libraries to the public. The State Library Division has advocated local library board action to frame sound and thorough Internet access policies to govern the use of this rich resource. The  Online Access at Public Libraries Act  (H.B. 157) simply reinforces the case.   Aside from mere compliance with the law so as to qualify for state dollars, why does a library need an online access policy? A new publication from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,  Developing Computer and Internet Policies for Public Libraries *, suggests several reasons. An Internet access policy helps in the day-to-day scheduling and management of a highly popular and limited resource. The policy can support librarians in anticipating and resolving problems and concerns. And the policy can be most useful in educating the public about the nature of the Internet. Working from these basic purposes, individual library Internet policies will differ; no single policy can fit the widely differing circumstances of all public libraries.   The Internet provides access to information from all over the world that might be unique, time-sensitive, or otherwise beyond the library's budget. Making an  affirmative   statement  about the value of Internet access to library patrons is a productive first step in the board's consideration of a policy. Linking the advantages of Internet access to the library's mission statement and service goals is a good way to begin a policy statement, and a creative way to stimulate a productive discussion by the board of the wide-ranging issues surrounding an Internet policy.   An Internet access policy should have  disclaimers;  place them up front. For example, it is the nature of the Internet that technical difficulties may interfere with patron access to selected web sites on occasion. Patrons should be told that the library cannot guarantee access to any given web site. Librarians understand that some Internet sites contain biased, outdated, and incorrect information, but patrons may be unaware of these problems. A warning about the varied quality and reliability of Internet information resources will help the patron to use information from the Internet more effectively.   The Internet contains content that is controversial—some even illegal. Using the Internet to transmit obscene material, for example, is against the law. It is a good idea to warn patrons about the existence of potentially offensive content, and to outline very specifically the library's expectations about the patron's responsible use of Internet resources. For example, most public library Internet policies make it clear that parents are ultimately responsible for monitoring what their children access on the Internet.   A library board may choose to use an Internet filter to screen out certain categories of sites or content deemed objectionable. Using a filter on Internet workstations reserved for children and youth (minors) may be persuasive. But even if a library uses a filter, patrons of any age may still be able to find—either by deliberately seeking, or by innocently stumbling upon—objectionable sites. On the other hand, filters inevitably block access to some web sites that are completely legitimate, highly informative, and of great value. Internet filters are simply technically imperfect, and the Internet is growing too quickly for filtering software vendors to stay abreast of all new web sites that may be objectionable.   The bottom line here is that  an   Internet filter does not equal an Internet access policy . At most, a filter is a mechanism approved and directed by the board to help implement the board's intentions. A decision to use a filter should be based on a thoughtful, informed consideration of the library's mission and role, and should take into account and respond to the information needs and personal welfare of all patrons, both children and adults.   Privacy and confidentiality  must also be covered in an effective and thorough policy. Laws regarding the patron's right to privacy change. The board should seek counsel on what laws pertain and then inform both patrons and staff.  Security  is a closely related issue, for without paying close attention to computer security, the library cannot protect patron confidentiality. The way computer settings are configured may allow patrons to see web sites that a previous patron has accessed. The library must take precautions to avoid such breaches of confidentiality.   Prohibited behaviors  must be spelled out clearly. For example, illegal and unethical uses of the Internet such as accessing and misusing private information, violating copyright law, slandering or harassing others, and violating software agreements are behaviors that could be prohibited in the policy. Further, the library's expectations about what patrons can and cannot do to computer settings need to be spelled out.   Clearly described  procedures for public access  must be given so that patrons can know how to get themselves seated at an Internet workstation, and what they can do while they are there. Such procedures will include age limitations, as well as requirements for parental permission for minors if the library board decides to take that approach. Scheduling procedures, including time limits and whether access is by walk-in or sign up, should be specified. If reservations are allowed, the policy should outline how this is to be done. Procedures should address whether the patron's floppy disks—which bring the risk of transmitting computer viruses—are allowed for downloading content, as well as printing requirements and limitations. While board members and library directors may worry most about the controversial issues surrounding Internet access, front-line staff will more often encounter the mundane challenges raised by such issues as the scheduling of workstations, traffic control around the computers, and how much printing can be done.   The keys that will make a conceptually sound and thorough Internet access policy truly effective in practice are  communicating  its provisions, and  training  in its enforcement. Both the  staff and the public  must be informed of the policy and its implications. How will the policy be communicated to the public? What are the consequences for violating the policy? How many warnings should be given before computer access is denied? At what point do legal consequences come into play? How is the patron informed that he or she is in violation of the policy? Are patrons required to sign (either a physical signature or a click on the computer screen) to indicate they have read the policy and agree to abide by it?   Library  staff must be thoroughly trained  in the procedures adopted by the board for the enforcement of the policy. They must be able to make appropriate, timely, and effective interventions with those patrons who simply need help, information, and guidance in effectively using the Internet, and those other patrons—the minority—whose actions deliberately violate the library's Internet access policy. The policy must be enforced, and only people—trained librarians and informed patrons working together—can do this.   *  Developing Computer and Internet Policies for Public Libraries  can be a helpful resource for librarians and library boards as they create or review their Internet use policy.

The guest instructor will be Michael Wright from the Bibliographic Center for Research (BCR) in Denver. UPLIFT training is, first and foremost, for library directors and their assistants who need professional training to meet the State Library's certification standards. Registration materials will be mailed directly to those participating libraries. Other library employees, who may be interested in this class, should inquire about available openings. For information about UPLIFT and other State Library training programs, contact  Pat Montgomery , Continuing Education Coordinator, 1-800-662-9150, 801-715-6776.       Utah News   Sherratt Library Leads Cultural Resource Consortium   Thanks to a National Leadership Grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), the Sherratt Library at Southern Utah University will head a consortium of regional museums and libraries in an ambitious project aimed at sharing cultural resources through the innovative use of Internet technologies. The two-year project,  Voices of the Colorado Plateau , is a cooperative effort among regional libraries in Utah, Arizona, and Nevada to create a series of web-based multimedia exhibits portraying the complex history of the Colorado Plateau. The narration for the exhibits will be taken from oral history recordings, which will enliven the photos and artifacts that make up the exhibits.   The project was one of 14 out of 72 proposals that were funded this year by IMLS. The Utah Historical Society, the Edge of the Cedars Museum in Blanding, and the Iron Mission State Park Museum in Cedar City are other Utah participants. Dianna Graff of Southern Utah University is excited about the project. ""Cooperative efforts like this one are a good way for libraries and museums to share their valuable collections with a larger community.""       Connections   Martin Luther King, Jr.  Internet Resources  on Pioneer, Utah's Online Library http://pioneer.lib.ut.us   by Pam Barringer   In 1983, the third Monday in January was designated as a federal legal holiday to honor a champion of Civil Rights and one of the most influential men in the 20 th  century, Martin Luther King, Jr. His quest for nonviolent resistance to racial discrimination began in December of 1955 when Rosa Parks refused to relinquish her bus seat to a white man. The Black community was understandably offended and angered to the point that a yearlong protest and boycott of the transportation system in Montgomery, Alabama was undertaken. Martin Luther King, Jr. was chosen to lead that effort which resulted in a Supreme Court decision to outlaw segregated public transportation in the city.   There are many King resources on the Internet, but a few are outstanding for their accuracy and source reliability. A good introduction to Dr. King can be found in the FunkandWagnalls.com Encyclopedia. A search for Martin Luther King, Jr. in the encyclopedia results in a link to information about Dr. King, born in 1929, his life, work, and assassination in April of 1968. This information is interspersed with a variety of photographs. The encyclopedia thoughtfully provides additional links to background information related to King, such as African-Americans, Georgia, Selma, Civil Disobedience, Jesse Jackson, Ralph David Abernathy, and gun control, among others. This additional information would be helpful in writing a well-rounded article or school paper.   The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project  at Stanford University is ""a major research effort to assemble and disseminate historical information concerning Martin Luther King, Jr. and the social movements in which he participated."" The project resulted in a four-volume set of books titled  The Papers of Martin Luther King, Jr.  Although these books are for sale on the web site, the majority of the content is free. Eleven famous speeches given by Dr. King include the well-known ""I Have a Dream"" address at a march on Washington for jobs and freedom, and ""I've Been to the Mountaintop,"" given the day before his assassination. Another section contains sermons from 1954 to 1968, and a biography of King written by Clayborne Carson, also editor of Dr. King's autobiography. Of great interest is the excellent and detailed chronology of Dr. King's life from birth to death, which includes a simple genealogy of his family in Georgia going back as far as 1810. The chronology is interspersed with related links. The staff of the King Papers Project wrote many articles about Dr. King that appeared in various newspapers and journals, and these articles are available on the site as well.    Contemporary articles written about Dr. King and his legacy can be found in the free periodicals resource,  FindArticles.com   (from LookSmart and Gale Group). This periodical archive has full-text articles from more than 300 magazines and journals dating from 1998 to the present. It is immediately apparent that Dr. King is still on the minds and in the hearts of many people because of the proliferation of articles. Of special interest are articles featuring King's children and how they have carried on his legacy, and reports contending that James Earl Ray was not a lone gunman, that in fact government agencies were involved.       FYI   Writers Encouraged to Contribute to Directions   As noted in the ""People"" column of this issue, the editor of  Directions , Chip Ward, is leaving the State Library Division to become Assistant Director at the Salt Lake City Public Library.

It is dedicated to the preservation and support of the surviving families of Correctional Peace Officers who have lost their lives. It also offers an assistance program to assist correctional officers and/or their families in times of emergency, extreme personal crisis or other critical need. More information on the foundation can be found at  www.cpof.org  .                Photo above and below: The Sumter CI Honor Guard represents Florida's officers as it performs at CPOF ceremonies in Colorado Springs.             On June 8-11, the CPOF Conference was held in Colorado Springs, Colorado. A memorial service paid tribute to the fallen correctional officers of 1999. The Sumter CI Honor Guard was given the privilege of participating in this event. Everyone who attended was very grateful for the experience to participate in the memorial and, furthermore, proud to be an employee of the Florida Department of Corrections. The following are thoughts of those who attended the service.   I was very fortunate to be given an opportunity to attend. The memorial service honoring our fellow officers from around the nation who were killed in the line of duty was conducted under a B-52 Bomber in front of the United States Air Force Academy (with the picturesque Rocky Mountains in the background). It was an honor to attend this conference and see what the Correctional Peace Officers Foundation is really all about. This is one of the only organizations that will actually assist a correctional officer or a probation officer in a genuine time of need.   -Circuit Administrator  Carrol Dzina, Sarasota Circuit 12 P&P                 Flag bearers at CPOF opening ceremonies      ""I have been in corrections for over 28 years, but have never experienced the level of support, caring and concern shown by the members of the CPOF to correctional employees and their families. The memorial service was an emotional experience that left me feeling proud to be in corrections, proud to be a member of the CPOF and humbled at the outpouring of support for the families of officers who ""gave their all.""   -Circuit Administrator Robert Gordon, Daytona Beach P&P   Before attending the National CPOF Memorial Ceremonies, I felt that we had finally found an organization that would truly support our employees and we have! I experienced so many emotions and they all made me proud that the employees of Lancaster CI have supported the foundation so generously.   -Staff Assistant Bonnie Lord, Lancaster CI    The theme: ""Taking Care of Our Own"" not only covers the fallen officers but their families and children as well. On each occasion, when the pipe band marched in playing ""Amazing Grace,"" I did not see anyone seated nor did I see a dry eye in the house.   -Warden Gary Thomas, Okaloosa CI                 View from the head table at the CPOF ceremonies in Colorado Springs     Afterwards, our Honor Guard was granted the privilege of presenting the spent rounds from the 21 gun salute to the families at the banquet. This is where my heart just grieved, looking in the eyes and faces of the families and seeing their pain and suffering.   -CO Juan Santiago, Sumter CI Boot Camp    It was truly an honor for Sumter CI Honor Guard and this warden to represent Florida DOC, CPOF and the nation to recognize, honor and pay tribute to the ""fallen officers"" and their families. I am most proud of my staff for the fine job and personal touch.   -Warden David Lehr, Sumter CI                   In photo above officers and guests walk to the memorial service     During my stay I had the opportunity to join in a lunch banquet seminar, where a video was shown telling a little about each person whose life was taken over the past year. When I go to work I never really think I may not be going home, although I am well aware of my surroundings and the fact that a situation could arise. Now even more so after seeing the video and hearing how some of these people lost their lives, I have new respect for my job and my fellow employees.   -CO C. Vega, Sumter CI    After the service there was a luncheon in which Sumter CI Honor Guard presented the families of the fallen officers with a spent shotgun shell. This moment was very special for me. It gave me the opportunity to let someone know that just because I did not know their loved one personally that they will be remembered for their ultimate sacrifice.   -CO Shane Landgraff, Sumter CI    I've been in the most elite group in the military and been, done, seen and experienced different things and situations around the world. So, I figured this would be a walk in the park mission for us. I'm here to tell you that this ceremony has ranked in the top three in my book.   -CO R. Silva, Sumter CI Boot Camp              The following officers participated in the ceremony:  CO Adam Burke  CO Colette Kleber  CO Shane Landgraff  CO Roy McDowell  CO Juan Santiago  CO Roberto Silva  CO Michael Slagle  Lt Wayne Studebaker  CO Tris Tanner  CO Cheryl Vega           The fellowship that I saw displayed, the willingness to put it all on the line for your comrades, their devotion to protect the  public made me proud to be associated with these correctional officers and probation and parole officers. I am also proud to say, ""I work for the Florida Department of Corrections.""   -CPS Joseph Feinberg, Pompano P&P    We marched to the sound of bagpipes by the Emerald Pipe Bands from New York City and the Connecticut DOC to our positions by the B-52 bomber. My body and my heart swelled with pride to be there. At times, keeping focused throughout the ceremony was difficult, my eyes swelled with tears.   -CO Colette Kleber, Sumter CI             Florida is the the site of the 2001 Annual CPOF Conference to be held at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa.

He said he has not studied all of the information available on their web site, but it could probably be utilized by various communities as desired, coinciding with Constitution Week.         Mr. Zimmerman indicated that the function of the organization seems to be the same as the Committee, i.e., acting as a spearhead to encourage and help programs propagate throughout the state, except on a national basis and focusing on September 11.    He believes some type of federal funding and private funding is provided to the organization.         Chairman Fink noted that Mr. Zimmerman would like to send a newsletter to the organization.    She indicated that she does not believe it is a federal agency.            Mr. Zimmerman added that as the cities send information to the Committee, the same report should also be sent to their web site. The contact person is Tom Kevorkian and his web site address is  tkevorkian@participateamerica.org .         Report from Constitution Week Subcommittee         Chairman Fink noted that Ms. Makula could not attend, but gave her the following update:         Avondale :    Same program as last year with an essay contest and event at Estrella Mountain College.         Surprise/El Mirage : Students in the Dysart School District will shadow city elected officials and a mock city council will be held, as well as an essay contest.         Glendale :     Large standup display of the Bill of Rights and a self-test on the Constitution at the main library north of Glendale Community College.    Also, a bibliography of books on the Constitution and the self-test will be available at the three Glendale libraries.         Litchfield Park :    Essay contest with students and perhaps an event with the city council.            Lake Havasu :    The person who spearheaded the program is now running for Mayor, so a citywide celebration may be possible later.         Mesa :    “Take Your Hat Off” when the flag goes by (lots of songs and acting).         Payson :    Possible signing of the Constitution.         Peoria :    Same program as last year with the city council and throughout the Peoria School District.         Scottsdale/Paradise Valley/Fountain Hills : Same program as last year involving essays, band, speakers, and military participation.         Gilbert :    Awaiting a report from Mr. Chesley.         When Mr. Zimmerman asked if someone could be contacted in Chandler, Mr. Anderson offered to see if Representative Bob Robson, who was a former council member, could give him the name of a person to contact.         Chairman Fink stated that a complete list of events will be provided at the next meeting with the dates, times, etc., and Members will be assigned to attend in support of the local communities.         Report from Education Subcommittee         Chairman Fink stated that Mr. Cordes could not be present, but provided her with an update.    At    the last meeting, he indicated that he would attend a meeting about changing the State Board of Education (SBE) rules to correspond with the new state standards. There was a misunderstanding initially, but he is working with the SBE on that.            Chairman Fink said Mr. Cordes received all of the Members' e-mail addresses, but is waiting until next week when schools resume to send out information to curriculum directors.    Although it is not confirmed yet, he plans to go to Lake Havasu to help schools with curriculum, and Snowflake is also interested in obtaining information to align the civics and government standards.         Mr. Kirtley asked if Mr. Cordes would send the Members a copy of the survey on curriculum alignment when it is sent out, and Ms. Fink indicated that she will e-mail him.         Mr. Williams asked what kind of program Tucson is having this year.         Chairman Fink responded that Tucson did a proclamation last year. She is aware that   Linda Barber has been working with city representatives, but was unable to make much headway.         Mr. Kirtley commented that former Representative Kathleen Dunbar, who is on the city council now, may be able to help plan an event next year.         Mr. Kirtley related that accountability legislation did pass and requires that every superintendent and school board president sign an affidavit that every district's curriculum will be aligned with the standards, and the affidavit must be submitted to the Arizona Department of Education by the beginning of this school year. He noted that at an Arizona School Boards Association meeting in Flagstaff the previous Friday, there was much grousing about the issue, but it must be done.    This is the first step in the accountability process.    The first school labels will be released on   October 15, 2002. If a school is labeled as underperforming, there are a number of solutions, and part of that is reviewing the curriculum and standards.    The affidavit is essentially an accountability tool for leadership.    If a district aligns curriculum to the standards, the schools should not be underperforming.         Discussion followed about how the Committee could possibly offer assistance. Mr. Kirtley suggested waiting until after the schools are labeled and indicated that he will have a list for the Members to review at a later meeting.         Constitution Commemoration Dinner         Chairman Fink acknowledged that the dinner is six months away, but she would like to update the Members. Regarding the speaker, she had no way of contacting David McAuliffe except through Simon & Schuster, and she has not heard back.    She spoke with Alan Keyes' scheduler and e-mailed information about the event, but she has not received a response.    She indicated that she gave the speakers a few different dates, basically the third and fourth weeks in January.    She added that several other suggestions were made for a speaker and asked the Members for recommendations.            Mr. Anderson said the National Constitution Center may have a Speakers Bureau.         Mr. Kirtley pointed out that former Vice President Dan Quayle is teaching in Arizona and is well known by former legislator, John Kaites.         Chairman Fink stated that the Vice President of the Mesa Constitutional Celebration Committee indicated that their church is available for the dinner. There would not be any cost to utilize the facilities.    The room could easily hold 220 or 230, but if there is an overflow, video equipment is available.    She acknowledged that there will be a cost for the dinner.    The church has caterers and the cost would be $20. There is also plenty of room for people to display information about celebrations.         Discussion followed about how people might feel about holding a state event in a church and the fact that the location is somewhat far for some individuals.    Mr. Anderson suggested discussion of other locations at the next meeting.         Mr. Kirtley remarked that Grand Canyon College might have a facility.         Mr. Zimmerman recommended the East Valley Institute of Technology (EVIT), which has a catering school that is huge and could feed many people.          (Tape 1, Side B)         Mr. Anderson volunteered to call EVIT.         Chairman Fink said she talked with the Mesa Committee about having a five-or-ten-minute segment of “Take Your Hat Off” when the flag is flying.            Discussion followed about soliciting sponsors, which is usually done in October, and the fact that there will be new legislators on the Committee.    Mr. Anderson said he and Ms. Chase could begin the process and indicated that he would request appointment to the Committee next year.         Chairman Fink pointed out that she is expecting a baby in the middle of December, so someone will have to take over the organizational part of the dinner, which is why she is attempting to find a speaker now.             Without objection, the meeting adjourned at 2:42 p.m.                                                                                             ________________________________                                                                             Linda Taylor, Committee Secretary                                                                             July 31, 2002         (Original minutes and tape are filed in the Office of the Chief Clerk.)                                       ---------- DOCUMENT FOOTER ---------                                  CONSTITUTIONAL COMMEMORATION COMMITTEE    5                             July 29, 2002         ---------- DOCUMENT FOOTER ---------"

Attorney General John Ashcroft swore in the new Americans and Attorney General John Ashcroft (left) sitting next to Mel Martinez, director of Housing and President George W. Bush Urban Development, prepares to address the addressed them in a video citizenship candidates. message. ""On behalf of the American people, I congratulate you on taking one of the most significant steps of your lives,"" Ashcroft said. He acknowledged the dedication and perseverance of the newly sworn-in citizens and reminded them of the importance of the oath they had just taken. He also stressed the new citizens' new found rights of citizenship and other duties such as defending and upholding the Constitution. ""You have chosen to participate fully in the most enduring democracy ever created,"" he said. ""I applaud your choice because I believe your individual lives will be better and your contributions as citizens will make our country even stronger and more vibrant."" Along with the memorable honor of having the attorney general presiding, the candidates were also the first in the country to view a 90-second video message from the president welcoming them as U.S. citizens. ""Today, America is not only your home, it is your country. With a single oath, all at once, you became as fully American as the most direct descendents of the founding fathers,"" Bush said. His message also encouraged continued hard work, the spirit of entrepreneurship, love of family, and love of country. The welcoming video will be made available to all INS offices conducting naturalization ceremonies. The president's welcoming video accompanies a personalized letter that new citizens receive upon completion of the naturalization process. The citizenship ceremony featured new citizens ranging in age from 18 to 100 years old and representing 80 nations. Candidates receiving special recognition sat on stage with the guests of honor.  KIDNAPPING for ransom, alien smuggling and trafficking, and the Japanese Yakuza were among the many fascinating topics presented at the 24th International Asian Organized Crime Conference, which the INS hosted this year for the first time in its history. The Chicago office of the INS had the honor of organizing this prestigious event, which is one of the largest educational gatherings of criminal justice professional in the world, drawing several hundred participants from more than a dozen countries on four continents. The event is sponsored by the International Association of Asian Crime Investigators (IAACI), a non-profit organization that serves as a conduit for information and criminal intelligence aimed at identifying and apprehending Asian criminals, thereby contributing to the quality of life of Asian communities worldwide. Conference proceeds fund scholarships Every year, IAACI partners with host law enforcement agencies to conduct the conference and uses the proceeds to fund scholarships to aid Asian students pursuing criminal justice degrees. ""Each day conference attendees had the opportunity to participate in educational workshops to learn new techniques and share experiences with other professionals in the same field,"" said Supervisory Special Agent Monica MapelKoszala. ""This group of criminal justice representatives also benefited immensely from the networking and friendships acquired throughout the week."" Mapel-Koszala took on the daunting task of leading the preparations for this event--held March 25-29 at the Chicago Sheraton Hotel and Towers--along with Deputy District Director for Investigations William Riley and a crew of agents and supervisors. Organizers worked many long hours ""The organizing committee worked many long, tedious hours--including weekends--and we were presented with some unforeseen obstacles throughout the year, including the tragedies that faced the world on Sept. 11,"" she said. ""An exorbitant amount of work was placed on all law enforcement officials in the nation post Sept. 11--planning a conference of this magnitude seemed like an impossible mission for the Chicago crew volunteering their efforts."" She noted that according to professional meeting planners, conferences in general were down 40 percent for all professions after Sept. 11. Law enforcement conferences were even more severely affected. Despite the aftermath of Sept. 11 and the additional workload placed on the agents in the Chicago office, the Continued on page 7  4  INS www.ins.doj.gov   First woman Park Police chief says leadership is about style, ability--not about race or gender fears and mastering leadership breaks through glass ceilings, said the first woman appointed to the position of chief of the U.S. Park Police at INS' National Women's History Month celebration. Style and ability most important ""People care more about a leader's style and ability than they care about a person's race or gender,"" Chief Teresa Chambers said. ""They want to be with people who feel good about being on a winning team."" Chambers was the keynote speaker at the March 20 Headquarters event with the theme ""Women Sustaining the American Spirit."" Her informative address focused on the secrets to her success and ways to deal with gender issues. Before becoming the first woman to hold the position of chief of the U.S. Park Police, a position she was appointed to Dec. 18, 2001, she served as chief of the Durham (N.C.) Police Department from January 1998 to her current appointment. Before that she worked for 21 years for the Prince George's County (Md.) Police Department, beginning as a police cadet in 1976 and rising to the rank of major in 1993. When she retired in 1997 to accept the job of chief of police in Durham, she was the commander of District 1. Few women role models Chambers said there were very few women role models when she was coming up through the ranks of Prince George's Police Department, so her role models were two young African-American men promoted to leadership positions. ""They didn't apologize for their race, age, or gender,"" she remembered. ""If you wanted to be on the team, you found a way to jump on board."" From watching them, she said she learned that finding people who share your vision is key to effective leadership as well as the ability to simply make decisions. ""People would rather you make a wrong decision than no decision,"" she said. ""Make a decision, take charge, do what's right, not what's popular.""  CONQUERING  Overcoming common fears Another secret she said was overcoming four common fears: the fear of taking risks, failure, success, and criticism. Women, she said, are more stopped by the fear of success than men since women tend to internalize failure and externalize success, while men tend to externalize failure and internalize success. As a result, women will often diminish their successes and deflect compliments while men will often seek credit when it is due them. ""When you've done something good, accept it,"" she told the women. As an example of women being stopped by the fear of success she noted that when women receive compliments on their outfits, they are much more likely than men to respond with something about the outfit being old or purchased on sale. ""The next time someone compliments you, I want you to say `thank you,''"" she said. Chambers recommended women use humor to deal with uncomfortable gender situations but use it sparingly to not give the message that inappropriate behavior is OK. She also suggested they just be straight with people. ""I'm not comfortable when you call me `babe.' Will you call me lieutenant?'"" she said of a way to handle a real-life situation she encountered. It's never too late In the question-and-answer period at the end of the event, Chambers noted she went to night school for both her bachelor's in law enforcement from the University of Maryland and her master's in applied behavior science from Johns Hopkins University. She said people interested in leadership positions--but lacking academic credentials-- should not give up on their dreams. ""It took me 11 years to get my bachelor's degree,"" she said. ""It is never too late.""  Park Police Chief Teresa Chambers tells the women in the audience to accept rather than deflect compliments.

One said several times, ""I'd like to ride in those pretty buses."" The air time did not turn out to be a public relations fiasco, however, but the beginnings of a well-deserved public relations success as Mexican television right away picked up on the story of INS hitting a management home run. ""Although they are big and impressive, they are safer and much more efficient and $100,000 less than the previously ordered buses the service used,"" said Charles R. Welke of Headquarters Logistics, Fleet Management Branch. The new long-range coach buses the disc jockeys spotted are one of three new state-of-the-art vehicles--developed through the Detention and Removals' Vehicle Working Group after several prototypes--now rolling off assembly lines and undergoing retrofitting to INS specifications.

""The Detention and Removals' Vehicle Working Group has an extensive planning process and feel we have developed a great product, and with field input, will continue to improve,"" Welke said. Formed in July 2000, the group consists of Headquarters Logistics, Fleet Management Branch; senior Detention and Removals staff; supervisory detention officers; and detention enforcement officers. The working group's goal was to design a new generation of vehicles with improved safety, security, and efficiency--at a lower cost. Using years of experience of the veteran officers and the fresh ideas of the new officers, the group did just that. Key to getting everything the working group wanted--including the ability to make rapid, custom changes based on field input--at a lower price was the partnership INS entered into with the Federal Prison Industries program, also known as UNICOR. The program employs inmates in federal prisons and provides skills training and rehabilitation. Inmate workers at the Federal Correctional Institute in Three Rivers, Texas, are retrofitting and customizing the INS vehicles.

Colonel Sanders, however, is not the original or the only Kentucky Colonel. Other noteworthy Kentucky Colonels include Pope John Paul II, President Lyndon B. Johnson, English Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and now several INS employees in the Cincinnati Sub-Office. ""I consider it a great honor to have had three district employees recognized for their contributions,"" said Cleveland District Director Mark B. Hansen. Kentucky Governor Paul E. Patton recently awarded commissions into the Honorable Order of Kentucky Colonels to Steven C. Thompson, supervisory immigration inspector, Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport; Brian D. Nicholas, supervisory immigration inspector, Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport; and Kim S. Sovern, administrative support assistant/ congressional liaison, Cincinnati SubOffice. Being appointed a Kentucky Colonel is the highest honor awarded by the Commonwealth of Kentucky. The Colonels are Kentucky's ambassadors of goodwill and fellowship around the world, and Kentucky's governor commissions individuals in recognition of their  THE  noteworthy accomplishments and outstanding service to a community, state, or the nation.

The Kentucky Colonel tradition began when Kentucky's first governor, Isaac Shelby, gave his son-in-law, Charles S. Todd, the title of colonel of his staff. Shelby later issued commissions to all who enlisted in his regiment in the War of 1812. Later, Kentucky governors commissioned colonels to act as their protective guard; they wore uniforms and were present at most official functions. The Honorable Order of Kentucky Colonels was founded in 1932 by Governor Ruby Laffoon and has since been officially incorporated as a charitable organization. Over the years the colonels have contributed thousands of dollars to worthy causes. The governor and the lieutenant governor of Kentucky serve as the commander-in-chief and deputy commander-in-chief, respectively. Kentucky Colonels, who serve with no remuneration, can be found in business, government, and industry all over the globe. And, yes, Colonel Sanders was a real Kentucky Colonel. Governor Laffoon admitted Sanders to the Honorable Order of Kentucky Colonels in 1935 in recognition of his contributions to the state's cuisine.  Chicago Continued from page 4  conference drew more than 600 attendees to the opening ceremony and about 530 paid attendees from all over the world. ""Not bad for a group who has never organized a formal conference of this size, while at the same time diligently performing their duties as law enforcement professionals,"" MapelKoszala said. She said she is extremely grateful to everyone from the INS who sacrificed many hours of their free time to assist in making  this conference a success. This includes the entire crew from Headquarters (Julie Shifflet, Stacey Richardson, Stacy Smith, Kim Corbino, Kyle Hutchins, Dan Cadman, and Louis Nardi as well as the audio-visual crew which stepped in at the last minute); Supervisory Special Agent William Orr of the Chicago Office; and Special Agents Cathy David, James Turner, Mathew Emrich, and Robert Butterfield, all of the Chicago Office.

""We've come a long way. We are doing a lot of positive things, and we've got to get out there and promote them,"" said Glenn Pritchard, director of the Headquarters EOSH Division, in his opening remarks. EOSH Director Glenn Pritchard The three-day conference on INS' role in safety. brought together INS employees from as far away as Hawaii. It highlighted programs, policies, training, and INS' safety and health role in the workplace. Karen Dove and George Jarvis, workers' compensation program managers, coordinated the conference. Glenn Pritchard summarized the two most important goals of the conference: get information from the speakers and cross-polination of ideas from each other. For the first time, the conference combined safety, health, and workers' compensation and featured speakers from agencies such as the Department of Energy, Department of Justice,  GROWING,  Department of Labor, Department of the Treasury, Department of Veterans Affairs, Environmental Protection Agency, and the Virginia State Police. Conference attendees discussed and shared policies, improvements, achievements, statistics, and the most up-to-date research and findings. The INS is working toward meeting the five-year Presidential 2000 Accident Reduction Initiative, and for the first two out of five years, 50 percent of districts gives a presentation and sectors have successfully reduced their injury/illness rates, and that's ""very encouraging and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration is very encouraged,"" Pritchard said. The division promotes a close relationship between field safety and health managers and workers' compensation specialists who are encouraged to work together on preventative measures that are likely to reduce the probability of injury and illness. David Yentzer, INS' Designated Agency Safety and Health Official, expressed appreciation to the audience for their continuing efforts to make the EOSH Program the best in the department. ""Do things before you're asked to. Everyone's a leader,"" he said.  Commissioner announces several personnel changes  James W. Ziglar recently announced several personnel changes to address immediate needs in immigration procedures, services, and enforcement. ""These changes begin the process of accountability as we move forward with the restructuring of INS by separating its service and enforcement functions,"" he said. Changes included the following: Rene Harris has been named the acting director of international affairs. Harris, who has been serving as the acting deputy chief of the U.S. Border Patrol, replaces Jeff Weiss who remains with the Department of Justice.  COMMISSIONER  Johnny Williams, formerly the INS western regional director, was named executive associate commissioner for field operations. Williams replaces Michael Pearson who is now with the U.S. Marshals Service. Janis Sposato was named assistant deputy executive associate commissioner for immigration services after serving as special counsel to the commissioner.

On March 26, federal agents arrested four people allegedly involved in the long-running scheme, which included a quiz on American history and politics and an obligatory pledge of allegiance, according to the Central District of California U.S. Attorney's Office. The arrests stemmed from Operation Charade, a year-long investigation by INS and the Office of the Inspector General for the Social Security Administration. Most of the 25 known victims were Korean and Filipino nationals who paid as much as $25,000 each after being promised that their immigration applications would receive fast-track processing. The suspected ring leader, Elzbieta Malgorzata Bugajska, 50, of Los Angeles, is a Polish citizen who masqueraded as an immigration consultant named ""Jerry Ann Mitchell."" The real Jerry Ann Mitchell had died as an infant in 1943, but Bugajska appropriated Mitchell's identity and had obtained a U.S. passport and California driver's license in Mitchell's name.  court documents, Bugajska told victims that she was a former CIA employee and a current federal judge, who had the power to bypass the normal naturalization application process. As part of the scheme, she fraudulently obtained genuine Social Security cards and numbers for the victims. Lorena Velasquez Garcia, 39, of South Gate, an employee of the Social Security Administration for more than 15 years, allegedly colluded with Bugajska to issue the illegal Social Security numbers. The third defendant, John Patrick Bradley, 56, of Los Angeles, is accused of posing as a federal judge and leading victims in the pledge of allegiance at phony naturalization ceremonies. The fourth defendant, Yolanda Miel Lubiano, 62, Sun Valley, is accused of introducing Filipino victims to Bugajska and collecting payments from them. All four defendants are charged with one count of mail fraud. Additionally, Bugajska and Bradley have been charged with impersonating federal judges, and Bugajska has been charged with using a falsely obtained passport. Garcia also faces charges of accessing a government computer with intent to defraud.

""The attorney general and I both deeply appreciate what you do. We both deeply appreciate your willingness to be in the middle, certainly the centerpiece of the Department of Justice's efforts in the war on terrorism,"" he said. ""What you do really represents the best of professionalism and the best of public service."" He commended people within INS and the Department of Justice for coming together in a manner that few people, if anyone, would ever think possible. Enormous sacrifices made ""People have been working extended hours that require enormous sacrifices, none bigger than not being able to spend time with your family and friends and draw strength from the comfort they provide,"" Thompson said. Photo by Seth Affoumado   THANKING  ""Their extraordinary sense of purpose and steadfast determination has allowed them to work beyond the point of exhaustion, and still perform admirably in dealing with matters of great sensitivity and even greater urgency."" Counterterrorism coordination effective He commended special agents, intelligence analysts, detention officers, and others for working closely with FBI-led counterterrorism task forces to arrest more than 700 aliens for a variety of administrative and criminal charges. These agents have also been working with officials from the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control to identify and freeze the assets of terrorist organizations and terrorist front groups. Thompson also thanked INS detention and deportation officers, Border Patrol agents, and immigration inspectors for supporting nationwide enforcement efforts and strengthening port and border security. ""Of course, all these efforts aimed at bringing to justice those responsible for the horrific events of Sept. 11, and to prevent further terrorist attacks, are being backed by technical support specialists and other operational and administrative staff,"" he said. ""And they are as deeply dedicated to succeeding as everyone else."" More done with less He also noted the considerable amount of time, energy, and resources spent tracking down terrorists and strengthening homeland security has meant INS has had ""to do more with less."" Yet, he said, the agency still has Continued on page 19  Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson applauds the agency for doing more with less.  Inclusive nature of restructuring plans emphasized HOW a restructured INS might look and operate with separate service and enforcement functions was discussed in broad terms throughout the Commissioner's Conference 2001. ""The restructuring proposal is a framework for action. And we need your leadership, your expertise, and your commitment,"" said Richard Cravener, director of the Office of Restructuring during a presentation on restructuring on the third day of the conference. ""We want your perspective on where are the pitfalls, where are the rugs, where are the stumbling blocks, what are the issues that we need to look at from your perspective."" Commissioner James W. Ziglar touched on the restructuring during his opening remarks. He emphasized the restructuring would be a large operation, not a tinkering at the edges, and would modernize the system, simplify the chain of command, and adjust the workload. ""It is important to remember that this is a restructuring, not a reduction in force. I want you to remember that,"" he said. ""This is an employee-friendly restructuring effort."" The commissioner had been scheduled to speak in greater detail on the restructuring plan on the third day of the conference, Thursday, March 14, but was called back to Washington. In place of the commissioner, Deputy Commissioner Mike Becraft and Cravener provided the update, which was followed by small working group discussions led by professional facilitators. ""I am pleased with the attendance we've had today. It hasn't always been like this, that you could catch a crowd this size on the last day of the conference,"" Becraft said. ""It means people are really concerned about the agency, and they're looking to moving forward with the agency.  10   Integrating 5 new core values key to creating more leaders for the positive  Leadership in a changing world  Everyone is a leader ""Everyone is a leader whether they know it or not. I am going to tell you that every person whether it's the janitor or the commissioner or the president of the United States or whoever it happens to be, it's a leader,"" he said at the Commissioner's Conference 2001. ""If you come to work with a positive attitude, the attitude of everyone else around you goes up."" Values are behind leaders for the positive, the commissioner said. Values define people as individuals, provide the basis for effective leadership, and support the foundations of vibrant organizations. Core values provide strength ""I firmly believe that these five core values can guide us and provide the strength necessary to address successfully whatever challenges the INS faces now and in the future,"" he said. The first core value is Professionalism. ""This means fulfilling our duties with the highest quality work,"" Ziglar said, noting that it ""is also a state of mind that says I will never lower my standards and I will never cut corners because I know the fiduciary duty of those who depend on me.""  The commissioner announces new core values: professionalism, accountability, integrity, respect, and service.  The second core value is Accountability. ""We take responsibility for our actions, we learn from our mistakes, and celebrate our achievements,"" Ziglar said, noting ""we can not learn from our mistakes unless we admit those mistakes and then take responsibility for them."" `Right is might' Integrity, the third core value, focuses on doing the right thing, rather than the popular thing. ""I can tell you right is might,"" the commissioner said. Respect, the fourth core value, ""makes the difference between whether we're perceived as callous or caring,"" he Continued on page 18  And that's what Jim Ziglar has been trying to do, and what he's hoping for, and he's back there right now defending us at the highest levels to the nation."" Cravener repeatedly emphasized the inclusive nature of the restructuring process he is leading. ""This is a unique opportunity to participate in the planning and the implementation of an initiative that will provide clarity of function and accountability to enhance the professionalism of our workforce and facilitate service delivery to those we serve,"" he said. ""We plan to fully integrate our leadership as our subject matter experts into the process."" He noted this would include a field advisory board to analyze the feasibility of proposed changes and serve as a conduit of information back to the field, training on leading change for senior staff, threaded conversations on  the INS Intranet, programs on INS television, and a INS restructuring e-mail account on cc: Mail (ins.restructuring@usdoj.gov). ""Please use the mailbox yourselves,"" he said. ""Please have town hall meetings and let your employees know that that mailbox exists."" Becraft emphasized that change was on its way but the future is still bright. ""Given our circumstances right now and the issues on the table and in the national press, I think people are realizing that this is a pretty amazing organization and with the right leadership we're going to move forward,"" Becraft said. ""Just remember they are talking about us. And now it's up to us to show them what we can do.""  Photo by Seth Affoumado   LEADERSHIP is about influencing and affecting the actions of others, making people with positive attitudes leaders for the positive and people with negative attitudes, leaders for the negative, Commissioner James W.

His duties that day were fairly routine and consisted of watching a section of border fence for people entering illegally from Mexico. It was fairly calm in his area with long periods of quiet. The situation quickly changed, however, when a concerned citizen stopped at his location and told him that a car had plummeted into the All American Canal. He immediately called the station and drove to the location. As Sanford arrived at the scene, he saw a partially submerged car and a woman frantically flailing in the water. He then dove into the dangerous All American Canal and heroically saved the woman from drowning with little regard for his own personal well being. He rescued the woman and swam with her to safety, saving her from certain death.

No woman had ever served as an agent; Davis was the first woman hired by the Border Patrol and one of the first five to graduate from its academy. Her first assignments were with the Chula Vista Station, Calif., and Detroit, Mich., where she served for nearly two years, before being promoted to criminal investigator, first in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and then in San Diego, Calif. In 1985, she was promoted and moved into Detention and Deportation (D&D), as a staging facility manager in the San Diego District. She rapidly worked her way up to assistant regional director for D&D, a position in which she oversaw a huge expansion of facilities and personnel. Davis joined the staff at INS' Advanced Training Facility in Artesia, N.M., in late 1990 as the assistant chief of enforcement. She co-managed a task force charged with providing the training agency employees needed to deal with the sweeping changes to immigration law passed by Congress earlier in the year. Under her leadership, that project delivered training to more than 10,000 INS officers worldwide in less than a year's time. She returned to field operations in 1992, as the officerin-charge of INS' detention facility in El Paso, Texas.  Former New Orleans District Director Christine Davis (left) accepts her award from Deputy Commissioner Mike Becraft.  During her three-year tenure there, Davis implemented an expansion that would more than double the facility's capacity. She then moved to the Las Vegas Sub-Office, where she spent two years before taking the job as deputy district director in Chicago, Ill., where she successfully improved delivery of services. Her next and final career stop before her retirement was district director in New Orleans, La.  Richard Cravener Texas native Richard Cravener joined the INS in February 1972 after attending the State University of New York at Buffalo. He began his career as an immigration inspector at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City. Subsequent to this he transferred to the Border Patrol in southern California and later served as a senior patrol agent and assistant chief patrol agent at the Border Patrol Academy at Glynco, Ga. In 1980, Cravener was transferred to San Juan, Puerto Rico, where he served as a special agent and later a supervisory special agent at the INS District Office. In 1984, he was promoted to the position of assistant district director for investigations for the Philadelphia District. In 1987, Cravener was appointed deputy district director of the Washington, D.C., District Office. Following a brief lapse in government service, Cravener was appointed the director of parole for the Immigration Service in the Office of Foreign Operations in 1990. From 1991 to 1994, Cravener was the INS  Photo by Seth Affoumado   Distinguished Career Service Award  Director of Restructuring Richard Cravener (left) accepts a Distinguished Career Service Award from Deputy Commissioner Mike Becraft.  assistant attach at the American Embassy in Rome, Italy, and the INS attach at the American Consulate General in Hong Kong. In May of 1996, Cravener transferred to Houston, Texas, where he assumed the position of district director. Cravener was appointed to the senior executive service in October 1997 and retired from government service in June 2001. In November 2001, Commissioner James W. Ziglar appointed Cravener to the position of INS director of restructuring.  16  Photo by Seth Affoumado   Distinguished Career Service Award   Commissioner, motivational speakers suggest ways to lead in a changing world  Leadership in a changing world  and respecting employees, managing change, and taking risks were stressed throughout the Commissioner's Conference 2001: Leadership in a Changing World. ""The people of the INS are the number one asset. When you don't defend your assets, you are likely to lose them,"" Commissioner James W. Ziglar said during his opening remarks on Tuesday, March 12. ""If your people are not respected, if they are not rewarded, if they don't have a sense that this is a place they want to be at, if Photo by Seth Affoumado   REWARDING  The commissioner's themes were backed up by two motivational speakers. Krish Dhanam with The Zig Ziglar Corporation spoke on goal setting and empowering employees on Tuesday, March 12, and Rick Maurer, an advisor to the Change Leadership Practice of Deloitte Consulting, spoke on change management on Thursday, March 14. Dhanam used examples from his own life-- immigrating from India; being hired as a sales representative of Zig Ziglar Corporation; and moving on to teach, speak at, and facilitate seminars across the world--to give an uplifting presentation on making strengths out of weaknesses, staying committed regardless of circumstances, and not letting mistakes make you feel like a failure. ""Your plans just failed, you didn't,"" he said of failure. He also emphasized that research has shown that individuals rate ""having interesting work"" as their number one desired requirement from a job. He said it is important to stress the importance of every job and for managers to frequently ask their employees three questions: What do you do? What would you like to do? How would you like to get there?  Motivational Speaker Krish Dhanam inspires conference attendees to charge ahead.  they don't have any fun in their jobs, if they don't see that there is a path for their career and to achieve their goals, then they are not going to be with you. And if the people in your organization aren't with you, you're going to fail."" He stressed that leadership means taking risks; empowering, respecting, and listening to employees; and sometimes even making mistakes. ""Being timid and being risk adverse is a road that takes you nowhere,"" he said. ""Don't be afraid to make mistakes because everybody makes them. Mistakes become problems only if we fail to admit them.""  The answers will direct managers to those who are committed, point out the ones who are happy, and build trust and gratitude. ""Gratitude is the healthiest of all human emotions,"" he said. Maurer spoke about the cycle of change and how to break through walls of resistance. He said for employees to accept a change they must understand it, agree with it, and believe in their leaders' ability to implement it. He said giving people more information--better arguments, detailed facts, etc.--will not necessarily break through resistance. Often times, emotional reactions also need to be managed, particularly when change may be interpreted as creating a loss of power, control, status, or respect or make managers feel incompetent, abandoned, or worn out. Maurer suggested engaging employees in conversation--not presentation--to determine the root causes of their resistance while keeping three questions in mind: What's in it for me? What's in it for you? What's in it for us?  He said managers can build a commitment for change when employees understand the importance of the issue in their heads and their guts, have time to digest the information, and trust their manager's judgement. ""I get it, I like it, and I have confidence in you to lead this,"" he said of a successful end result.  17   Values Continued from page 11  Commissioner's Conference 2001  said. ""There's a very common, very sensible rule, but that's the way we ought to operate. We ought to do unto others as we would have done unto us."" He pointed to the The order of the five core values agency's community spells PAIRS, an easy to remember acronym that also implies teamwork. relations officers whose respectful manner made a huge difference when they reached out to Arab, South Asian, and Muslim communities after Sept. 11. Anger diverted to understanding ""They reached out to communities to let them know exactly what was going on,"" he said. ""These actions diverted anger to understanding and in a few cases actually had people support what we were doing."" Similarly, the final core value, Service, is about understanding the needs of colleagues or the specific needs of someone from a different culture. Calling on employees to ""surpass the expectations of our customers,"" the commissioner gave the example of honoring religious practices requiring a third party be present when a man is interviewing an observant Muslim woman, thereby  avoiding having the interviewee perceived as ""unresponsive or uncooperative."" Some 280 values suggested Ziglar said the Core Values Initiative introduced last fall resulted in some 450 responses from working groups and individuals from 200 INS offices worldwide. These responses included 1,700 core values suggestions, which when synonyms and duplicates were accounted for, yielded 280 different core values. ""There was a striking consensus, though, around five of those core values,"" he said. ""The order we have listed them here does not necessarily mean that, that was the order of preference. We have done that to create an easily rememberable acronym. That's PAIRS."" The commissioner also suggested people carry the core values, positive leadership, and a positive mental attitude into all areas of their lives. ""If you're miserable at the office, I guarantee that you're going to take it home with you, and you're going to make your wife or your husband miserable. ... If you're miserable at home, you're going to take it to the office,"" he said. ""Try to be a leader in all of your relations in all of your lives. The question we should be asking ourselves is `what kind of leader am I now, and what kind of leader do I want to be?''""  ""  --Commissioner Ziglar  18  "" Deputy Commissioner Becraft (left) and Commissioner James W. Ziglar emphasized throughout the conference that everyone is a leader, and leadership is about influencing and affecting the actions of others.  We take responsibility for our actions, we learn from our mistakes, and celebrate our achievements.  Photo by Seth Affoumado    Ideas for innovative customer service handed out at Western Region exhibit By Jorge Swank  Leadership in a changing world  TO highlight customer service innovations throughout INS, Janna Evans, Western Region director of community relations, working closely with the San Francisco District, developed a Customer Service Exhibit for the Commissioner's Conference 2001. ""Everyone we talked to really wants to put their best foot forward, so that the customer gets the service they deserve,"" Evans said. The exhibit consisted of an interactive customer service wheel, which was divided into the six most frequent customer service problem areas: Customer care--how we take care of our customers Employee morale--how to build it and keep it Status checks--how to ensure our customers are kept updated Information flow--how to ensure accurate dissemination of information both internally and externally Access--how to facilitate customers' access to INS Quality and consistency--how to ensure we provide top quality service throughout INS The ""Put a New Spin on Service"" idea cards Deputy Director of the California Service Center, Christina X. Poulos, spins to win at the customer service exhibit at the Commissioner's Conference.  Conference participants were asked to spin an arrow on the customer service wheel and then asked to share their ideas about how to improve service. Participants were also handed idea cards with solutions that other districts and sectors have used successfully to address  customer service issues. The idea cards, which were spiral bound, included a point of contact and phone number so that people could call for further details about how to solve a particular customer service issue. To obtain a copy of the customer service idea cards, please call the Western Region Community Relations Office at (949) 360-3582.  Thanks Continued from page 10  produced impressive results in both enforcement and services. Responsibilities a privilege ""At the same time that INS is working diligently to thwart terrorists, drug-traffickers, human smugglers, and other isolated individuals who are intent on trying to tear us down, you are also assisting the many more people who are eager for an opportunity to join us in building up America,"" he said.  ""These people share the ideals and principles that are the foundation of our great nation, and you are enormously privileged to be charged with guarding the cornerstone of that foundation: citizenship."" Thompson specifically thanked the agency for cutting the national average processing time for naturalization applications by more than half over the past three years as well as the Office of International Affairs for its efforts in the area of refugee admissions this fiscal year.  In closing, he applauded the audience for their leadership and vision and Congress for backing the agency with needed resources. ""The most important contributions, however, have come from you,"" he said. ""No amount of resources or strategic planning could have produced these results without the dedication, integrity, professionalism, and pride you bring to the job every day.""  19   About one mile away from where the child was last seen, Chelsea eagerly ran back to her handler, Border Patrol Agent Robert Noziska, announcing that she had found something. That something turned out to be the  given a pass to chat with him for 10 to 15 minutes. DeMore usually meets with three to four customers each time, time permitting. INS customers have widely praised the program for increasing understanding of their experience.

Western Region quells fears of Middle Eastern community INS' Western Region has consistently led by example with numerous outreach meetings with the Middle Eastern and South Asian communities in an effort to allay fears and quell rumors of INS enforcement actions. By speaking with and not talking over community voices, INS community relations officers have developed and/or built on established relationships in Phoenix, San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland, and Honolulu. Muslim Public Affairs Council Representative Sireen Sawaf of Los Angeles said the INS' willingness to be open and direct has helped allay the fears of many Muslim people who feel that the federal government is scrutinizing their communities.

Ten months ago, on 13 March 2000, Governor Leavitt signed into law House Bill 157  Online Access at Public Libraries , which had been passed by the 2000 Legislature. The law requires that local library boards adopt and enforce a policy that restricts access by minors to Internet sites containing obscene material in order for the library to maintain eligibility to receive state funds. In less than six months, on 1 July 2001, the law will take effect. By that time, librarians and library boards statewide are required to take informed and responsible action.   Under the law, the State Library Division is charged to establish ""standards for the public library online access policy,"" and to enforce the intent of the Legislature that public libraries not having an Internet access policy that meets these standards shall not receive state funds, specifically the Public Library Development Grants.   The Division has proposed a formal rule to govern its administration of the law. A public hearing on Administrative Rule R223-2 ""Public Library Online Access for Eligibility to Receive Public Funds"" was held on 4 January 2001 at the State Library to receive comment from librarians and the public. The February 2001 issue of  Directions  will report that hearing, give the status of the Rule, and discuss the relationship between the Rule and local library Internet access policies.   Note:  The text of H.B. 157, Administrative Rule R223-2, and an analysis of R223-2 can be accessed easily at the Division's  web site  under ""Timely Topics.""   Public Libraries and the Internet: Thinking About Policy    Information available through the Internet has come to be a revolutionary component of the services offered by libraries to the public. The State Library Division has advocated local library board action to frame sound and thorough Internet access policies to govern the use of this rich resource. The  Online Access at Public Libraries Act  (H.B. 157) simply reinforces the case.   Aside from mere compliance with the law so as to qualify for state dollars, why does a library need an online access policy? A new publication from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,  Developing Computer and Internet Policies for Public Libraries *, suggests several reasons. An Internet access policy helps in the day-to-day scheduling and management of a highly popular and limited resource. The policy can support librarians in anticipating and resolving problems and concerns. And the policy can be most useful in educating the public about the nature of the Internet. Working from these basic purposes, individual library Internet policies will differ; no single policy can fit the widely differing circumstances of all public libraries.   The Internet provides access to information from all over the world that might be unique, time-sensitive, or otherwise beyond the library's budget. Making an  affirmative   statement  about the value of Internet access to library patrons is a productive first step in the board's consideration of a policy. Linking the advantages of Internet access to the library's mission statement and service goals is a good way to begin a policy statement, and a creative way to stimulate a productive discussion by the board of the wide-ranging issues surrounding an Internet policy.   An Internet access policy should have  disclaimers;  place them up front. For example, it is the nature of the Internet that technical difficulties may interfere with patron access to selected web sites on occasion. Patrons should be told that the library cannot guarantee access to any given web site. Librarians understand that some Internet sites contain biased, outdated, and incorrect information, but patrons may be unaware of these problems. A warning about the varied quality and reliability of Internet information resources will help the patron to use information from the Internet more effectively.   The Internet contains content that is controversial—some even illegal. Using the Internet to transmit obscene material, for example, is against the law. It is a good idea to warn patrons about the existence of potentially offensive content, and to outline very specifically the library's expectations about the patron's responsible use of Internet resources. For example, most public library Internet policies make it clear that parents are ultimately responsible for monitoring what their children access on the Internet.   A library board may choose to use an Internet filter to screen out certain categories of sites or content deemed objectionable. Using a filter on Internet workstations reserved for children and youth (minors) may be persuasive. But even if a library uses a filter, patrons of any age may still be able to find—either by deliberately seeking, or by innocently stumbling upon—objectionable sites. On the other hand, filters inevitably block access to some web sites that are completely legitimate, highly informative, and of great value. Internet filters are simply technically imperfect, and the Internet is growing too quickly for filtering software vendors to stay abreast of all new web sites that may be objectionable.   The bottom line here is that  an   Internet filter does not equal an Internet access policy . At most, a filter is a mechanism approved and directed by the board to help implement the board's intentions. A decision to use a filter should be based on a thoughtful, informed consideration of the library's mission and role, and should take into account and respond to the information needs and personal welfare of all patrons, both children and adults.   Privacy and confidentiality  must also be covered in an effective and thorough policy. Laws regarding the patron's right to privacy change. The board should seek counsel on what laws pertain and then inform both patrons and staff.  Security  is a closely related issue, for without paying close attention to computer security, the library cannot protect patron confidentiality. The way computer settings are configured may allow patrons to see web sites that a previous patron has accessed. The library must take precautions to avoid such breaches of confidentiality.   Prohibited behaviors  must be spelled out clearly. For example, illegal and unethical uses of the Internet such as accessing and misusing private information, violating copyright law, slandering or harassing others, and violating software agreements are behaviors that could be prohibited in the policy. Further, the library's expectations about what patrons can and cannot do to computer settings need to be spelled out.   Clearly described  procedures for public access  must be given so that patrons can know how to get themselves seated at an Internet workstation, and what they can do while they are there. Such procedures will include age limitations, as well as requirements for parental permission for minors if the library board decides to take that approach. Scheduling procedures, including time limits and whether access is by walk-in or sign up, should be specified. If reservations are allowed, the policy should outline how this is to be done. Procedures should address whether the patron's floppy disks—which bring the risk of transmitting computer viruses—are allowed for downloading content, as well as printing requirements and limitations. While board members and library directors may worry most about the controversial issues surrounding Internet access, front-line staff will more often encounter the mundane challenges raised by such issues as the scheduling of workstations, traffic control around the computers, and how much printing can be done.   The keys that will make a conceptually sound and thorough Internet access policy truly effective in practice are  communicating  its provisions, and  training  in its enforcement. Both the  staff and the public  must be informed of the policy and its implications. How will the policy be communicated to the public? What are the consequences for violating the policy? How many warnings should be given before computer access is denied? At what point do legal consequences come into play? How is the patron informed that he or she is in violation of the policy? Are patrons required to sign (either a physical signature or a click on the computer screen) to indicate they have read the policy and agree to abide by it?   Library  staff must be thoroughly trained  in the procedures adopted by the board for the enforcement of the policy. They must be able to make appropriate, timely, and effective interventions with those patrons who simply need help, information, and guidance in effectively using the Internet, and those other patrons—the minority—whose actions deliberately violate the library's Internet access policy. The policy must be enforced, and only people—trained librarians and informed patrons working together—can do this.   *  Developing Computer and Internet Policies for Public Libraries  can be a helpful resource for librarians and library boards as they create or review their Internet use policy.

UPLIFT Spring Class Scheduled   The annual spring session of UPLIFT has been scheduled for March 20-22, 2001 and will be held in the College Library on the campus of Utah Valley State College in Orem. The class that will be taught is Introduction to Cataloging, which is one of the four core courses that make up the UPLIFT curriculum. Among other topics, students will learn about the overall organization of libraries, how to create a catalog record, and why MARC records are important. The guest instructor will be Michael Wright from the Bibliographic Center for Research (BCR) in Denver. UPLIFT training is, first and foremost, for library directors and their assistants who need professional training to meet the State Library's certification standards. Registration materials will be mailed directly to those participating libraries. Other library employees, who may be interested in this class, should inquire about available openings. For information about UPLIFT and other State Library training programs, contact  Pat Montgomery , Continuing Education Coordinator, 1-800-662-9150, 801-715-6776.       Utah News   Sherratt Library Leads Cultural Resource Consortium   Thanks to a National Leadership Grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), the Sherratt Library at Southern Utah University will head a consortium of regional museums and libraries in an ambitious project aimed at sharing cultural resources through the innovative use of Internet technologies. The two-year project,  Voices of the Colorado Plateau , is a cooperative effort among regional libraries in Utah, Arizona, and Nevada to create a series of web-based multimedia exhibits portraying the complex history of the Colorado Plateau. The narration for the exhibits will be taken from oral history recordings, which will enliven the photos and artifacts that make up the exhibits.   The project was one of 14 out of 72 proposals that were funded this year by IMLS. The Utah Historical Society, the Edge of the Cedars Museum in Blanding, and the Iron Mission State Park Museum in Cedar City are other Utah participants. Dianna Graff of Southern Utah University is excited about the project. ""Cooperative efforts like this one are a good way for libraries and museums to share their valuable collections with a larger community.""       Connections   Martin Luther King, Jr.  Internet Resources  on Pioneer, Utah's Online Library http://pioneer.lib.ut.us   by Pam Barringer   In 1983, the third Monday in January was designated as a federal legal holiday to honor a champion of Civil Rights and one of the most influential men in the 20 th  century, Martin Luther King, Jr. His quest for nonviolent resistance to racial discrimination began in December of 1955 when Rosa Parks refused to relinquish her bus seat to a white man. The Black community was understandably offended and angered to the point that a yearlong protest and boycott of the transportation system in Montgomery, Alabama was undertaken. Martin Luther King, Jr. was chosen to lead that effort which resulted in a Supreme Court decision to outlaw segregated public transportation in the city.   There are many King resources on the Internet, but a few are outstanding for their accuracy and source reliability. A good introduction to Dr. King can be found in the  FunkandWagnalls.com Encyclopedia , a free resource of excellent quality. A search for Martin Luther King, Jr. in the encyclopedia results in a link to information about Dr. King, born in 1929, his life, work, and assassination in April of 1968. This information is interspersed with a variety of photographs. The encyclopedia thoughtfully provides additional links to background information related to King, such as African-Americans, Georgia, Selma, Civil Disobedience, Jesse Jackson, Ralph David Abernathy, and gun control, among others. This additional information would be helpful in writing a well-rounded article or school paper.   The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project  at Stanford University is ""a major research effort to assemble and disseminate historical information concerning Martin Luther King, Jr. and the social movements in which he participated."" The project resulted in a four-volume set of books titled  The Papers of Martin Luther King, Jr.  Although these books are for sale on the web site, the majority of the content is free. Eleven famous speeches given by Dr. King include the well-known ""I Have a Dream"" address at a march on Washington for jobs and freedom, and ""I've Been to the Mountaintop,"" given the day before his assassination. Another section contains sermons from 1954 to 1968, and a biography of King written by Clayborne Carson, also editor of Dr. King's autobiography. Of great interest is the excellent and detailed chronology of Dr. King's life from birth to death, which includes a simple genealogy of his family in Georgia going back as far as 1810. The chronology is interspersed with related links. The staff of the King Papers Project wrote many articles about Dr. King that appeared in various newspapers and journals, and these articles are available on the site as well.    Contemporary articles written about Dr. King and his legacy can be found in the free periodicals resource,  FindArticles.com   (from LookSmart and Gale Group). This periodical archive has full-text articles from more than 300 magazines and journals dating from 1998 to the present. It is immediately apparent that Dr. King is still on the minds and in the hearts of many people because of the proliferation of articles. Of special interest are articles featuring King's children and how they have carried on his legacy, and reports contending that James Earl Ray was not a lone gunman, that in fact government agencies were involved.       FYI   Writers Encouraged to Contribute to Directions   As noted in the ""People"" column of this issue, the editor of  Directions , Chip Ward, is leaving the State Library Division to become Assistant Director at the Salt Lake City Public Library.

The story above is the kind managers love to tell in corporate America, but a lot of people are not used to hearing this philosophy in state government. As state employees our duty is to ser ve Florida's taxpayers. One of the ways we do this is to help make state go v ernment leaner and more efficient. We are faced with budget constraints, a growing offender population and security staff shortages. These are real challenges. We must find ways of tightening our belt without compromising public safety. But all this talk about budget leaves out something important. I believe we have the most dedicated men and women working today in state government. I am proud that every day, thousands of our employees in our institutions and field offices work hard to ensure public safety in Florida. Governor Bush strongly supports our mission and his leadership made many of our priorities a reality this year. The Governor and I are committed to this agency's mission and all of our employees. We employ some of the very best correctional professionals in the country and as a result our agency is distinguished nationally as a top correctional system. For example, the department is very proud of Shannon Summers, (Largo Road Prison/Pinellas Wo rk Release Center) who is 2 Southern States Correctional Association officer of the year. Congratulations also to SSCA Correctional Probation Officer of the Year Craig Rioux (Sarasota North P&P). The department passed the tri-annual American Correctional Association (ACA) accreditation audit statewide. ACA standards are the national benchmark for the effective operation of correctional systems throughout the United States. Each of you contributes to the department's reputation and the recognition for outstanding performance extends across all areas of expertise. We currently have the lowest escape rate in two decades. Across the board escapes dropped 45 percent in just one year. Your work matters. Your commitment to the safety of the people of Florida makes it possible to fulfill our mission. The Governor and the Legislature acknowledged the dedication of community corrections employees earlier this year by including ""special risk"" retirement benefits for correctional probation officers (CPOs) in the FY 2000-2001 budget. This is something which had been sought by CPOs for nearly two decades. As a system-wide team we have already cut expenses and  Photo above: In Tampa, Governor Bush (center) signs into law new special risk benefits for Correctional Probation Officers.

Our department has historically been a stable agency in terms of job security. Layoffs are not common. It is difficult to stand in front of a group of employees and give them the news that layoffs are headed their way. Yet, we must address the loss of approximately 1,200 vacant positions and a reduction in position funding. The 2000-01 budget authorizes 27,669 fulltime employee (FTE) positions for the department, which is a smaller number of positions than previously funded. In addition, we face a $13.8 million shortfall if all positions currently filled remain the same. This shortfall requires that we eliminate 479 jobs, some of which are not vacant. In keeping tr ue to the Governor's publicsafety principles, no correctional officers or probation officers will be affected by these changes. Let me reiterate that this means the necessary reductions will occur in administrative areas, including Central Office.

We encountered numerous obstacles and learned valuable lessons. ""We are faced with a limited budget, a growing offender population, and security staff shortages.

While policy changes had occurred since that time, the same organizational structure designed to fit the demographics  ""Many public employees have seen several administrations come and go. Their attitude toward change is often ""here we go again.""  Put simply, there are often good reasons why people resist change.  Some of you are probably asking yourselves, ""How did he come to these conclusions about the culture of the bureaucracy?"" The answer is simple: I was part of it in Texas, where I spent 14 years with the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. I saw directors come and go, each with their own set of ideas on how to make the place better. When I became deputy director, I was still a part of the culture. Luckily, I was working for a director who took the time to engage me in discussions about the perspective I was bringing to the table. During those discussions I found myself using terms like ""We have always done it that way"" or ""We use a more traditional approach."" But no matter how I attempted to sugar coat it,  of the late 1970s was still in place at the dawn of the twentyfirst century. ""Unfortunately, when we unveiled our plan for reorganization, some employees claimed that change was neither positive nor necessary.  The culture of corrections fosters resistance to change. ""Many employees are 2nd or 3rd generation correctional employees. They receive as much knowledge from their grandfathers, who worked in corrections more than four decades ago, as they do from departmental training.

Milligan, Polk CI In March of this year, a sergeant was knocked unconscious and two officers stabbed in an incident at Polk CI. This incident would have been less serious if that homemade knife (shank) had been found in the day-to-day searches in the dorm. In two separate incidences, CO Jacob Dodd, and CO Micah Turner found shanks in other dorms. Those searches possibly prevented a recurrence of the previous incident. The question that begs an answer is, ""Why do some officers find contraband and others don't?"" ""Who do we search?"" Do we search the property of the same inmates over and over? This leads to a pattern that inmates are quick to pick up on. We need a method to not only search everyone, but to do it in a random way to keep from setting a pattern. A separate, and less important, aspect, is that a continual search of a small number of the population causes confrontation problems. So, we need to develop a fair and thorough method of who we search. ""What are we looking for?"" Are we really looking for contraband? If the inmate isn't supposed to have it, do we take it, or let it slide, ""this time."" Some inmates have the ""pack rat"" habit and accrue a lot of junk that is truly contraband, even as nonlethal as it is. What we must realize is that this large store of stuff may hide the lethal things. The less property an inmate has, the quicker the contraband and lethal objects will leap out at us. So, we must insure that the inmates adhere to the authorized property rules. ""When are we searching?"" Are we searching when it is time to fill the daily quota, or when we have plenty of time? By searching to fill a required number of searches, we may not be devoting the time that we need to make a thorough search. We need to set aside time enough to be both thorough and efficient. Time management is a factor. ""Where are we searching?"" Are we just searching inmate property? We need to use our imagination. Body searches, bunks, drawers, footlockers, rooms and common areas, both inside and outside. We need to be suspicious of any area and, just for safety, look there. Some officers might try to think like an inmate, but it is hard for an honest person to put themselves in an inmate's mind when it comes to devious behavior. Like they say in the business world, ""The secret of a successful business is location, location, location."" Finally, ""How are we searching?"" Do we have a method or system? (Personally, I intend to keep a close eye on how CO Dodd and CO Turner are doing it because they get results). Those who have a tried and true method of searching that yields results could give pointers to the rest of us. It's like an exercise routine. A good routine is thorough, gets results, and tells us when we are finished. So, we need a method of how to search. When we put all of this together, it is interesting that it comes down to: WHO, WHAT, WHEN, WHERE and HOW. As a law enforcement organization in a correctional setting, we would classify these as search operations that we are conducting. The end result must be the successful interdiction of contraband because we can't live with the alternative.  Do we search the property of the same inmates over and over? This leads to setting a pattern that inmates are quick to pick up on.  Every week in Florida an average of 11 correctional and correctional probation officers are assaulted by inmates.  Assault!  In 1999 there were 601 incidents of batter y on cor rectional officers. In 2000 there have already been 679.

It is dedicated to the preservation and support of the surviving families of Correctional Peace Officers who have lost their lives. It also offers an assistance program to assist correctional officers and/or their families in times of emergency, extreme personal crisis or other critical need. More information on the foundation can be found at www.cpof.org. On June 8-11, the CPOF Conference was held in Colorado Springs, Colorado. A memorial service paid tribute to the fallen correctional officers of 1999. The Sumter CI Honor Guard was given the privilege of participating in this event. Everyone who attended was very grateful for the experience to participate in the memorial and, furthermore, proud to be an employee of the Florida Department of Corrections. The following are thoughts of those who attended the service.

Staff Assistant Bonnie Lord Lancaster CI  On June 5, while I was walking across the compound at North Florida Reception Center Main Unit, I observed a large plume of smoke billowing up behind the NFRC West Unit. Upon investigation it was discovered that a wildfire had started in the woods approximately two miles from the institution. Officers from NFRC outside grounds, K-9 unit, safety office and administration responded to offer what assistance they could. NFRC's two water trucks responded with the outside grounds officers and started watering down houses that were in the path of the fire. Other officers from the K-9 unit were helping to evacuate people and their property from their houses while the safety officer assisted in directing traffic until the Florida Highway Patrol could get set up. Once all the people were evacuated, the officers assisted fire fighters in putting out the fires that were approaching the homes. Once the fire was contained, NFRC officers assisted fire fighters in putting out hot spots with their water trucks. During this time of intense activity, the food service department was providing bagged lunches, water and Gatorade to fire fighters and officers involved in fighting the fires. Due to the efforts of the fire fighters and correctional staff that responded to the fire, there was no loss of life or property. Congratulations for a job well done.

On June 8th the entrance of St. Joseph's Childrens Hospital was filled by a silent crowd.

Notes and pictures were attached by victims and their families and red roses were placed on shoes.

Prior to his arrest, Rhoden ""would spend three days up here (from south Florida) distributing several kilos each week,"" said Sam Maddox, supervisor of the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Fugitive (HIDTA) task force. ""He's the main guy in the organization."" Agents were looking for Rhoden, 27, since a warrant was issued for his arrest in October. He is charged with distributing cocaine throughout central Florida. The seizure netted $47,905 to  CO Sergeant Hallie Hall with one of Big Pine Key Road Prison's key deer.

FDLE Commissioner Tim Moore and DOC Secretary Michael Moore stated their commitment to the concept and their enthusiasm for the project's possibilities. ""Clearly, public safety is the department's primary mission and Crime Trax is a tremendous step in the right direction,"" said Secretary Moore. According to DOC Director of Program Services Richard J. Nimer, ""Crime Trax,'is ""an exciting new concept in crime prevention and accountability for offenders."" Local law enforcement agencies will send crime location and time data to a central ser ver at FDLE. Ideally, the department will eventually have the means and authority to hook up all community supervised offenders with a wristwatch size tracking device which will collect ""points"" (offender location) throughout the day and download them daily into the same server. This system is passive as opposed to the present Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) system, which is active in nature, therefore it is less expensive. (In the interest of public safety the department will maintain active GPS units to continue super vision of the most violent offenders). Until the new wristwatch size device is ready for mass production and distribution and pending the necessary statutory authority to hook up all targeted offenders, the department will provide offender location data from GPS cases only.  KUDOS  When the two sets of data are overlaid, several ""hits"" occur leading to identification of a possible pool of suspects or witnesses. Elimination of other suspects or witnesses also occurs. Being able to focus on or eliminate suspects or witnesses makes CrimeTrax a workforce multiplier for investigators. For the demonstration, participants were shown a ""hit list"" which a detective at a law enforcement agency might typically see on his or her desk at the beginning of a work shift. The list gave the specific address and time of a reported crime, in this case, a burglary in Tampa. The list also provided the names of two offenders on GPS surveillance under supervision of the department who were in the area within a few minutes of the reported crime occurrence. These individuals were now possible suspects or witnesses. The information is further analyzed with additional tools available. Utilizing a map of the area showing the location points of each of the individuals, the speed they were traveling and the path they traveled, it was apparent that unless an accomplice threw the stolen merchandise in one of the offender's moving vehicle, he could be eliminated from consideration. He never traveled less than 15 MPH through the scene. The other individual, however, showed some suspicious tracks before and after the incident. The offender crossed the street several times and hovered for several minutes in the area until just after the crime. These factors led investigators to question the individual about the incident. The Governor was very positive in his response to the presentation. The pilot phase begins this fall. The following counties are involved in the pilot: Citrus, Orange, Pinellas, Hillsborough and Leon. Offices at each location will receive appropriate training to ensure maximum benefit and data are gathered during this phase. As funding becomes available we can look forward to this revolutionary supervision tool being available in more locations.

Tomoka CI Employees Club sponsored its annual barbecue cookout on May 5 in honor of Correctional Employees Week. Colonel Stewart, Major Pelham, Major Spence and Maintenance Superintendent Gary Coffman volunteered their cooking skills for this event. The cooks not only prepared meals for the day shift, but again cooked for the 4-12 and 12-8 shifts as well. The event was a huge success and all institutional departments participated. The staff appreciated the meal and culinar y talents of the four chefs. Holmes CI celebrated the week with a barbecue. During the luncheon Warden Bill Davis extended his thanks to each employee for the hard work that each do everyday. D avis fur ther stated that Holmes CI was a superior facility, due to everyone's teamwork and willingness to help their fellow worker. Also assisting with the luncheon were Assistant Wa r dens E ddie Childs and H enr y Bo y d , Colonel Pippin and a variety of staff from each department. The team cooked up a great feast and no one went away hungr y. Madison CI celebrated Correctional Employees Week with a breakfast. Scrambled eggs, sausage, grits and biscuits were served to employees, complete with a pat on the back and a thank you for a job well done! At the grill were Warden J. Thompson, Assistant Warden V. Dukes and Food Service Director A. Thigpen. Lunch and dinner were also ser ved compliments of Sgt. Williams and company. Madison CI is very proud of all their employees and appreciates the opportunity to be a part of this annual recognition.  Cor rectional Employees Week  Photo above: CO Sgt.

After the statewide meeting ended in Jacksonville, correctional employees trekked to North Florida Reception Center's Training Facility at Lake Butler for the Correctional Employees Appreciation Luncheon. The event was a huge success with approximately 700 in attendance. Secretar y Michael Moore, Deputy Secretary Michael Wolfe, Region 2 Director George Denman, Chaplaincy Services Administrator Alex Taylor and NFRC Chaplain Bruce W. Hill gave remarks before the meal was served. Barbecue was served to the correctional employees and it was a wonderful day of food, fellowship and fun.

In Remembrance Story and photo by Lt. Robert Hendry Okaloosa CI Sgt. Britt Reaves died April 30 at home of a heart attack. Reaves was the type of officer who gave his all for his fellow officers and the department. We all miss him. Our lo v e and prayers are with his family. Sgt. Reaves was a member of the Okaloosa CI Rapid Response Team for nine years. The camaraderie that officers have, referred to as brotherhood and sisterhood, stems from depending on the men or women next to you to watch your back and protect you from harm with no questions asked. We all have experienced this at one time or another and Sgt. Reaves was one of those men. He was always there for us as we were for him. Sgt. Reaves is gone now but not forgotten. He is by our sides as we enter the gates ever yday, watching over us. He is one of the unsung heroes of our great department. The men and women of the Florida Department of Corrections are the best. We have a bond with one another. Every day strive to be there for your fellow officer. That commitment is all we have behind the gates. Sgt. Reaves taught me this and will always be a hero to me.

Many DOC facilities throughout Florida participated in this event. Below are some of the highlights. Tomoka CI Employees Club celebrated this event by providing breakfast, hot dogs, hamburgers, sodas and sundaes for all the children. The children were provided CPR and gun safety training, videos, demonstration by the K-9 unit, visit by a local fire engine truck, and demonstration of a police car and helicopter. It was a very  Photo right: The sons and daughters of DOC employees produced a mock news program including reading copy from the teleprompter. The effort was organized by the public affairs staff in the video production studio at Central Office.  Laura Wolfe takes her turn at the news desk Officer Whitfield Jenkins  educational day for the children and exhausting for the staff. We had a lot of fun and look forward to the event next year.  Gainesville Service Center-- 20 children participated in this event. They learned how public safety is ""Job 1"" in the Department of Corrections. Many examples were given to the children for consideration: prison operations, food service, accounting, community control, programs, human resources, maintenance, purchasing and even the Internet. The day was fun yet educational for all who participated. This year's event at Central Office consisted of a tour of work stations for the children. Each station gave the participants a better understanding of all the different types of work involved at DOC. This year's 10  stations included demonstrations from Wakulla CI tracking dogs, webmaster on DOC website, self defense techniques, testing of a ION drug scanner, making of ID badges and a mock news program (put on by members of the public affairs staff ).  Photo left : Children at Tomoka CI had a full day as they attended demonstrations by the police helicopter, the local fire department and the K-9 unit. They also received gun safety training.  At the Gainesville Service Center children learned how service centers serve public safety.  In January 2000, Correctional Training Officer Whitfield Jenkins became the chair of the Florida Commission on Human Relations (FCHR) for the 2000-2001 term. ""My involvement in the work of FCHR provides me an opportunity to contribute to the quest of making the state of Florida a mecca of love, unity and common purpose in the interest of humanity,"" Jenkins said. His tasks include the commission's policy-making responsibilities to identify and eliminate unlawful discrimination in employment, housing, private clubs, or services at a public lodging or food service establishment, according to Ronald McElrath, executive director. The commission is comprised of 12 members appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the state Senate. Jenkins currently serves as an adjunct teacher in the criminal justice department of the Central Florida Community College and has been with Department of Corrections since 1972.   ""Change"" continued from page 3  Fear generates rumors. An employee might hear part of a plan and assume the worst. When those assumptions are shared with coworkers, misinformation is the result.  it in others.  Overcoming the skeptical outlook of public employees is difficult because fear beats down idealism and skepticism often begins at the management level. ""Many managers worked their way up through the organization. Their strongest asset is experience. When changes are made, their subordinates know as much as they do. Managers, like their subordinates, must start over from ground zero and often feel that their authority is threatened by change. ""We all have ""comfort zones"" and our experiences and seniority give us that comfort zone. During my time as deputy director in Texas, the director was not only challenging my comfort zone, she was tearing it down.  "" I have to be honest. At first, I was convinced that change was going to lead to chaos. But I was wrong. The only chaos was my sense that my knowledge base was gone. When I accepted that as a leader in the organization it was my obligation to look for real innovation, the idea of real change became easy. ""As a result, my skeptical outlook  not my knowledge base  was gone.  faster, but they don't stay put as long as the truth."" It is never easy to explain that the few must sometimes be sacrificed for the sake of the many.

"" If we do, the taxpayers we heartbreaking. coworkers, misinformation is the result. When those assumptions are serve have much to gain. shared with coworkers, misinformation is often the result. The only weapon against rumors is information. As Will Secretary's Message continued from page 2 Rogers put it, ""Rumors travel We continue to analyze the personnel situation carefully and are working to make any reductions consistent with our reorganization goals. My commitment to administrative staff is that we will do everything possible to help affected employees. Any person who may be adversely affected will have full access to job fairs, resume writing classes and employability-skills training. In addition, I will ask every agency to give serious consideration to any of our employees affected by our budget reduction. We also have posted information on our internet and intranet sites that is intended to answer many questions about the budget and work-force reduction process. So far, we have reduced the number of service centers from seven to four (Marianna, Lake City, Orlando and Ft. Lauderdale will remain open.) This brings the service centers in line with the four institutional regions, which makes sense because the mission of the ser vice centers is to support the facilities in the institutional regions. I also want to maximize the benefits of technology to streamline operations and reduce duplication of effort. If we standardize the delivery of services to the greatest extent possible, then fewer resources will be required to deliver those services. Despite the hardships, remember, we are moving in a positive direction. Our goal is to manage the agency with a business-like philosophy so we can provide our front-line COs and CPOs with the resources they need to accomplish our core mission: protect, incarcerate and control.   Put simply, sometimes there are good reasons why people resist change: Change always means giving up something. The greater the personal sacrifice the more they resist. For example, if health care privatization occurs in South Florida, we will insist that the vendors look at current prison employees for available positions. However, even if a prison employee continues to work at a prison for the private vendor, he/ she will not be able to live in staff housing. Housing is a benefit for state employees only. Therefore, a healthcare employee currently living in staff housing is likely to strongly oppose even the possibility of privatization.  Florida State Employees Charitable Campaign at Central Office On April 28, a luncheon was held for Florida State Employees Charitable Campaign in Central Office. Employees who had given $1,000 or more were acknowledged and others were encouraged to continue contributing. DOC raised $416,787 and Florida state employees raised more than $4.1 million in 1999. DOC employees achieved these results in a year of transition for our agency. The entire FSECC campaign Photo above: Secretary Moore addresses the FSECC luncheon at Central Office. was revised to meet the agency's new needs. In the midst of change, DOC employees continued supporting our community agencies, thus demonstrating DOC's commitment and belief in leadership giving.  11   Moving Up and Moving On INSTITUTIONS-REGION 1-APALACHEE CI- Christopher Honnen from Chaplain F/C to Sr Chaplain F/C at CALHOUN CI.

GX229-43-15737862	"Monthly from the Missouri State Library  June 2001  Legislators support library services in Missouri IN THIS ISSUE concluded its first regular session on May 18, 2001. Legislawhich includes state aid for public libraries, the Remote Electronic Access for Libraries (REAL) Program, and the Out of State Athletes and Entertainers Income Tax. The bill goes to Governor Holden, who has until July 14, 2001, to sign the bill into law. Among the provisions of House Bill 12:  Public libraries will receive $3,770,657 in state aid. This represents an increase of $488,786 over the last fiscal year. The Conference Committee specified the additional funds be used to increase per capita state aid from 50 cents to 55 cents, with the remainder to go to the equalization program (see following article).  The REAL Program will receive $3,325,000. This includes $1,325,000 for online reference resources for public libraries, schools, academic institutions, and state government.  The athletes and entertainers tax was set at $463,991 for library materials grants. Also approved by the General Assembly were personnel and operating costs for the State Library, Wolfner Library for the Blind and Physically Handicapped, and appropriations for the Library Services and Technology Act, Literacy Investment For Tomorrow (LIFT) program, MOBIUS (common library platform for academic libraries), and MOREnet.

A total of $938,530 has been allocated for the fiscal year 2001 program. Missouri statutes provide for equalization payments to be made to county, city/county, urban public, or consolidated libraries. These ""equalization funds"" provide additional support for libraries in counties having significant levels of poverty, where provision of library resources is especially difficult, and where financial need is greatest. The funds supplement the per capita payments made to libraries certified to receive state aid. To determine library districts with the most need, counties were ranked top to bottom on assessed valuation and percentage of people in poverty. Four tiers were then established to determine the distribution of funds: Tier 1 -- counties in the bottom 25% on both assessed valuation and the largest percentage of people in poverty Tier 2 -- counties in the bottom 25% on one factor, and in the bottom 50% on the other factor Tier 3 -- counties in the bottom 25% on one factor, but not in the bottom 50% on the other factor Tier 4 -- counties in the bottom 50% on one or both factors       (continued on page 2)   Equalization payments (continued from page 1)  Librarian's Office"" at http://www.sos.mo. gov/council/sosc.asp.  newsline June 2001 Vol. 6, No. 6 newsline (ISSN 1088-680X) is published monthly by the Library Development Division of the Missouri State Library, PO Box 387, Jefferson City, MO 65102; telephone 800325-0131 in Missouri or 573751-2680; fax 573-751-3612. Contents of newsline may be reprinted with reference given to the publication and its date of issue. The Missouri State Library is a division of the Secretary of State's Office.  Libraries use the equalization funds for basic operating expenses or to meet specific local needs in the areas of collection development, creation of special programs for children or seniors, and building improvement. Overall, the equalization program helps to improve library services for Missourians and to achieve the goals in the state's long-range plan, Charting Missouri's Library Future into the New Century.  Wolfner Library's summer reading program Every summer, public libraries all over Missouri offer summer reading programs for the children and teens in their communities. These programs include story times, programs, activities, and reading goals. For a number of years, Wolfner Library for the Blind and Physically Handicapped has offered its own version of a summer reading program for its young library users. Wolfner Library does not have story times and programs; instead, children and teenagers participate in the summer program through reading goals, writing contests, and suggested activities, including games and crafts. This summer, Wolfner Library is once again offering two summer reading programs--one for youth reading between the preschool through elementary level and one for those reading between the middle school through high school and adult level. In April, invitations were mailed to all the children, teens, and schools registered for Wolfner Library services. The child or teen may choose whichever program is best for him or her, regardless of age. Wolfner Library participates in the Missouri Youth Library Program Committee's summer reading program. Each summer reading club member receives a packet of activity ideas and suggested reading lists related to the theme. During the program, members call the library to report on their reading accomplishments. The library staff keeps reading logs for them. Youth who reach the various goals of the program receive awards. The prizes for 2001 include tactile globes, braille Monopoly games,  Secretary Blunt names new library council members Ten Missourians have joined the Secretary's Council on Library Development, a statewide advisory group. The council meets quarterly in various locations across the state to discuss issues pertinent to the Missouri library community and to develop public policy for Missouri libraries. Its members represent libraries, government bodies, state agencies, educational institutions, and the general public. Annie Busch, director of SpringfieldGreene County Library, is the new council chair. She replaces Donell Gaertner, who served as chair since the council's establishment in 1996. Other new members include Senator Roseann Bentley, Springfield; Meredith Black, Trenton; Ryan Burson, Jefferson City; Representative Rod Jetton, Marble Hill; Cheryl Polk, Creve Coeur; Senator Steve Stoll, Festus; Lynne Sullivan, Albany; and Ann Sundermeyer, Hannibal. They join the following current members: Bill Burris, West Plains; Sharon Early, Lee's Summit; Karen Horny, Springfield; Jerry Howard, Dexter; C. Lee Jones, Kansas City; Emory Melton, Cassville; Kathryn Nelson, St. Louis; Lawrence Onsager, Kirksville; Susan Singleton, St. Louis; Representative Deleta Parmley Williams, and Virginia Young, Columbia.

Missouri library literacy survey under way The State Library is conducting a statewide survey to gather information about literacy activities in public libraries. The survey has been sent by e-mail to be completed online and returned as an attachment or printed out and returned by mail or fax. Although most library services have connections to literacy, this survey covers activities with the intentional goal of improving the literacy of participants. For the sur-  vey, literacy means ""an individual's ability to read, write, and speak in English and to compute and solve problems at levels of proficiency necessary to function on the job and in society, to achieve one's goals, and develop one's knowledge and potential."" (National Literacy Act, 1991) For children, literacy means gaining emergent and pre-literacy skills such as adequate language development, phonemic awareness, and familiarity with picture context and conventions of print so they can move toward mastery of the reading-writing process and succeed in school. Karen Jones, the State Library's literacy consultant, says the survey will have an impact on funding decisions at the state level and provide a way to share ideas about unique literacy programs with others. The survey also will update Literacy Activities of Missouri Public Libraries, a publication last issued by the State Library in 1997.

Internet Brothers: Tips and T ools http://internetbrothers.com/ tiptool.htm  A new Missouri union catalog Show-Me the World is the name selected by Secretary of State Matt Blunt for the new union catalog of materials owned by Missouri libraries. Missourians will not only have access to library collections in the state but also to those of libraries throughout the U.S. and other countries. The 4.1 million Missouri records are part of WorldCat, a bibliographic database of more than 43 million bibliographic records maintained by the Online Computer Library Center. If Missourians do not find the material they need at their local library, they can check WorldCat to find out if the the material is available at another Missouri library or outside the state. Librarians will then request the material through interlibrary loan.  Subtitled ""Helpware for the Cybercommunity,"" this site helps website developers at all levels.

The request for the Office of Library Services is $168,078,000 and for the Office of Museum Services, $24,899,000. The budget request focuses on two major goals. Each of these goals will be addressed through library programs, museum programs, and collaborations between libraries and museums: x increasing technological access to library and museum resources for all Americans, and x building community partnerships to address serious and persistent community needs. Building the educational capacity of libraries and museums and sustaining equitable access to their resources is at the heart of the federal vision for these institutions. IMLS uses federal funds to: x Invest in Education: promoting the roles of museums and libraries as centers for lifelong learning, x Invest in Access: using technology and training to give all citizens equitable access to information, x Invest in Families and Children: supporting museum and library use for all ages, x Invest in Communities: strengthening the role of museums and libraries as centers of civic engagement, and x Invest in Cultural Heritage: studying, preserving, and showcasing the unique heritage at the heart of America. The Institute's library programs help libraries use new technologies to identify, preserve, and share library and information resources across institutional, local, and state boundaries and to reach those for whom library service requires extra effort or special materials. Museum programs strengthen museum operations, improve  Trade Secrets workshops scheduled for September The weeks of September 10 and September 17 have been set aside for a series of Trade Secrets workshops, sponsored by the Library Development Division of the State Library. The workshops will provide library staff with an opportunity for networking and discussion of programs and service ideas for youth services. Dates and locations will be announced in mid-summer and publicized in newsline and on MO-YAC, the youth services electronic discussion list.  care of collections, increase professional development opportunities, and enhance the community service role of museums. The President's budget would abolish funding for the National Commission on Libraries and Information Science (NCLIS). The budget narrative states, ""Other agencies can effectively perform the necessary functions for which the Commission has been responsible."" Funding for FY 2001 for NCLIS was $1.4 million. Congress will debate the President's budget proposals throughout the summer and into the fall. During this time, the House of Representatives and the Senate will release their own budget proposals for FY2002. All three proposals will be considered until they reach agreement on a compromise budget.  Public libraries win delay on filtering mandate The deadline by which public libraries will be required to install Internet filtering software on their public access computers has been extended until July 2002, according to a recent agreement reached in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia. The agreement between federal attorneys, library advocates, and Internet publishers came during a hearing on two lawsuits that challenge the constitutionality of the Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA). CIPA requires that schools and libraries receiving a broad array of important federal funding, including the ""E-rate"" program, install and use blocking technology to filter out ""obscene"" or ""harmful to minors"" material. The statute was passed as part of last fall's massive budget appropriations bill and became effective on April 20, 2001.

This publication was developed in part from recommendations made by individuals participating in 19 public forums on library services held throughout the state. The State Library has used ""Charting"" as the basis for both fiscal and program planning. In the fall of 2000, State Librarian Sara Parker directed the State Library staff to prepare a mid-term report on the progress made in reaching the goals outlined in ""Charting."" Each State Library division reviewed statewide programs and held meetings with colleagues to determine whether major projects were meeting goals. The result of this work is the recently published Charting Missouri's Library Future: A Progress Report. The 52-page report contains sections on access to information, improving current library services, coopera-  tion between libraries and their partners, leadership, library training, funding, evaluating library services, a demoCharting Missouri's Library Future graphic sketch of into the New Century Missouri, A Progress Report and charts showing state and federal support for Missouri libraries. All libraries and presidents of library governing boards will receive a copy of the new report in June. Additional copies may be requested from the Library Development Division (800-325-0131) while supplies last.  Sky High on Reading Last year, Springfield author David Harrison initiated a reading program called Sky High on Reading. The ninemonth program challenges students in Springfield public and area schools to read enough books during the school year to reach a mile into the sky. The students more than met that goal last year, having read 2.2 million books. This year, students reached their ""milehigh"" goal by reading more than 1.5 million books. T honor the students and o their success, the Springfield-Greene County Library hosted a celebration program with special guest Colonel Mike Mullane, an astronaut who completed three space missions and logged 356 hours in space aboard the shuttles Discovery and Atlantis. Mullane has written the books Liftoff: An Astronaut's Dream and Do Your Ears Pop in Space? The celebration also featured a Huey helicopter, which landed on the library parking lot, as well as hang gliders and parachutists. About 200 people attended the celebration.  Spring library grants round-up Thirty-three Missouri public libraries will receive funds in the spring award of Basic Equipment grants. Secretary of State Matt Blunt has approved grants totaling $634,655 from this program, which is supported through the federal Library Services and Technology Act. Libraries use the grant funds to purchase computers, printers, scanners, microfilm readers, photocopiers, and other equipment.

U.S. 66 was officially decertified in 1985 and ""replaced"" by Interstates 55, 44, 40, 15, and 10. On July 10, 1990, the Governor of Missouri signed legislation designating Old U.S. Highway 66 as a historic highway in Missouri. Around the same time, the Route 66 Association of Missouri was officially incorporated and has assisted the Missouri Department of Transportation in placing Historic Route 66 markers along the entire length of old 66 in Missouri.

The national essay contest invites students to write a letter to an author--living or dead--explaining how that author's work somehow changed their view of the world or themselves. The contest offers two competition levels: Level 1 for grades 4 to 7 and Level 2 for grades 8 to 12. Wallace is a 7th grade student at Lange Middle School in Columbia. She wrote a letter to Dr. Martin Luther King about his ""I Have a Dream"" speech. White, a senior at North Nodaway R-VI High School, wrote to novelist John Irving about his book The Cider House Rules. This was the fourth time White placed in the Missouri contest. She has been a second-place winner twice and also received an honorable mention. Two second-place winners and six honorable mentions were named in the Missouri contest. They also won cash prizes. Second-place winners were Jessica Scott, a 7th grade student at LaSalle Middle School in Glencoe for Level 1, and Anna Compton, a sophomore at Harrisonville High School, for Level 2.

In FY2003, IMLS anticipates awarding over $2 million * for partnerships that address the needs of 21st century learners. As part of its 21st century learner initiative, IMLS will host a conference in Washington, DC from November 7 to 9, 2000, to examine actual experiments in creating community partnerships for lifelong learning and to explore innovative ideas and resources. The Concept: Communities must take responsibility for fostering a learning culture in the information age. Continuing developments in technology and the increasing mobility and pluralism of populations present and demand opportunities to increase skills, knowledge, and understanding. Both libraries and museums are among the most vital providers of new learning opportunities as well as promoters of community partnerships. Who should attend: All who have an interest in, or experience with, creating community partnerships for lifelong learning-- from libraries, museums, colleges and other educational institutions, to representatives of the broadcast, technology, and research  fields, and the funding and public policy sectors. Registration is free. To register for the conference or for more information, contact Elizabeth Lyons at the Institute of Museum and Library Services, 202-606-4649 or elyons@imls.gov. * subject to Congressional appropriation  Everything in the world exists to end up in a book.

GX020-62-1010574	Dr. Marie E. Zakrzewska                                                                                         In 1862, Dr. Marie Zakrzewska opened her own hospital, The New England Hospital for Women and Children.  It was the first hospital in Boston, and only the second in America to be run by women physicians.  Dr. Zakrzewska had been part of the first generation of women physicians in America.  Barred from working in existing hospitals and excluded from teaching jobs at medical schools,  some of these women went on to found dispensaries, hospitals, and schools to train women students and employ women physicians.  Marie Zakrzewska was born in Berlin, the daughter of a midwife.  As a young woman, she accompanied her mother on her rounds.  She trained at the Royal Charité Hospital, and in 1852 become a midwife.  When her promotion to Head Midwife not long after she had finished her training  was met with disapproval from some of the faculty, she left to study medicine in the United States.  Although opportunities in America were also limited, Marie Zakrzewska was aided by Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell,  the first woman to graduate from medical school in America.  With Dr. Blackwell's help, she enrolled at Cleveland Western Reserve College,  traditionally, an all-male medical school.  Marie Zakrzewska was one of only six women admitted to the school in the 1850s.  She graduated with her M.D. in 1856.  Dr. Blackwell and her sister Emily became an inspiration to Dr. Zakrzewska  by planning to found a small hospital where women physicians could work and learn.  Dr. Zakrzewska joined their effort, and the New York Infirmary for Women and Children opened in 1857.  She served as resident physician at the hospital for two years.  She moved to Boston to accept the position of Professor of Obstetrics at the New England Female Medical College.  Her students, encountering the same obstacles as other women physicians, found it difficult to get work after graduation.  Dr. Zakrzewska also disagreed with the founder of the New England Female Medical College over the school's curriculum.  She had proposed courses in dissection and microscopy to enhance the training of students  and keep up with the developing field of scientific medicine.  But the director intended to limit women physicians to a lower educational level.  Three years later, she resigned, to open her own hospital.  The New England Hospital for Women and Children flourished under Dr. Zakrzewska's direction.  There, women physicians who were excluded from the majority of hospitals, could acquire clinical experience.  She believed that women physicians must have the same training and base of scientific knowledge as their male counterparts  to achieve the same levels of research and standards of practice.

Sweat               I                want to personally invite you to participate in one of the upcoming                community focus groups our Department is hosting. Your involvement                in these focus groups is critical as we continue our efforts to                meet the needs of our most at-risk youth and their families.               As                you are aware, the Department is currently in the midst of making                decisions about the type, number, and locations of replacement youth                development centers. Because these decisions are more about who                the youth we serve are rather than the buildings we place them in,                we are gathering input from the public, stakeholders, the State                Advisory Council on Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention,                and DJJDP employees so that we can develop a full range of options                regarding these facilities. From the options generated via the process                we have, we will select a course of action.               I                am looking forward to seeing you and hearing your ideas. Together,                we will stay focused on our youth, put families first, and do what                is best for North Carolina.                                        The North          Carolina Department of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention released          this month its plan for obtaining community input to assist in the development          of a plan for juvenile facility replacement. The replacements will enable          the state to better address needs of today's youth, as the current facilities          were designed for different purposes and have an average age exceeding          60 years.          Four evening          meetings in conjunction with already scheduled area conferences will be          held in Winston-Salem, Asheville, Southern Pines and Greenville during          September and October. Attendees will learn about the youth served by          the department and will participate in focus groups during which they          will share their views about programming, staffing, facility design and          location, and community engagement (particularly as youth are receiving          aftercare services from the Department.) The information from the focus          groups will be compiled and considered by DJJDP as it makes decisions          about future actions.

Bullies Don't Belong, Parents Do, and Everyone Needs to Be          Ready for a Crisis         Three          school safety issues top the minds of school officials and parents as          students return to classrooms this fall across North Carolina. Based upon          its work with school officials and parents, the Department of Juvenile          Justice and Delinquency Prevention - Center for the Prevention of School          Violence sees bullying, parent involvement and crisis response as the          issues of greatest interest.         ""The          top strategies we continue to be contacted about by principals, teachers,          and parents are preventing bullying, involving parents, and responding          to crises,"" says DJJDP - Center director Joanne McDaniel. ""It          is interesting and worth noting that these issues serve as a common thread          among these different perspectives. Principals, teachers, and parents          have in common an interest in student safety, and they know that preventing          bullying, involving parents, and being ready to handle a crisis are keys          to that safety.""         To help educate          parents, school administrators, teachers, and students about the seriousness          of bullying, DJJDP - Center and the Attorney General's Office are sending          a school-year calendar to every school and many educator and parent groups.          The calendar features information about bullying, tips to prevent it,          and artwork by North Carolina students; the calendar's theme is  ""Bullies          Don't Belong"" .         With regard          to parent involvement, DJJDP - Center encourages schools to take early          action to begin developing positive relationships with parents and likewise          encourages parents to do the same with schools. The DJJDP - Center suggests          schools open lines of communication with parents from the beginning of          the school year and that schools work to make parent involvement meaningful          and positive.  Parents          need  to become and stay informed about their children's school.         To aid schools          in preparing for possible crises, DJJDP - Center and the Attorney General's          Office continue to work with schools on the critical incident response          project. Begun two years ago when starter response kits were sent to schools          across the state, continuous effort is being put forth to ensure that          schools have critical incident response kits and crisis response plans.          Schools continue to receive training in crisis response and are now able          to be recognized by the DJJDP - Center and Attorney General's Office for          their preparedness through the  Critical          Incident Response Recognition Program .

Three former          YDC students are the first recipients of the new YDC Scholarships to local          community colleges, thanks to a scholarship program introduced into law          (as part of the Community College System budget for this year) by Senator          Steve Metcalf.          The students          are attending Durham Technical Community College, Piedmont Community College,          and Davidson County Community College this fall. Earlier this year, Sen.          Metcalf gave the keynote address at Swannanoa Valley Youth Development          Center's GED graduation. During his remarks, Sen. Metcalf challenged the          youth by telling him he would find a way to help pay for their college.          Two of the scholarship recipients are among the original group of GED          graduates who took Sen. Metcalf on his word.          Court counselors          and YDC staff are working with other students to help them acquire these          scholarships. The scholarships apply to students who have received their          high school diploma or GED at a YDC on or after June 1, 2002. There more          than 75 YDC students that have earned their GEDs since June 1, 2002, through          classes offered at the schools by Asheville-Buncombe Technical Community          College, Vance-Granville Community College, Lenoir Community College,          Sandhills Community College and Rowan-Cabarrus Community College. We see          bright futures for our youth thanks to the efforts of Senator Metcalf          and the General Assembly. For more information about the scholarship program,          please contact  DJJDP Educational          Services .          DJJDP          Educational Services:  2002-2003          Accomplishments                   YDCs            Focus on Learning Opportunities for Students             During            the 2002-03 school year each of the five Youth Development Center Schools            participated fully in the North Carolina ABCs of Public Education accountability            program for the second consecutive year. The schools, designated as            alternative schools by the Department of Public Instruction, set local            goals and participated in the state student-testing program. This year,            schools also utilized substitute teachers on a regular basis so that            students' learning is not interrupted by teacher absences. Non-English            speaking students had interpreters present in classes and meetings for            the first time in 2002-03. In the spring of 2003, principals worked            with Central Office Education staff to develop an expanded set of course            offerings for students, such as literature courses and advanced technology            classes.                                    Online            Learning and Technology Discounts Expand            At the end of the 2002-03, four of the five Youth Development Center            Schools had operational online computer labs, including a projection            device for teaching technology to students. During the 2002-03 school            year a contract was negotiated to provide online learning at four YDCs            starting in the summer of 2003. In addition, educational services was            successful in applying for a federal grant program that will provide            90% discount rates for internet access, telephone service, and internet            connections at all five YDCs for the 2003-04 school year.                                    Annual            Planning Process Initiated at Youth Development Centers             Under            a renewed emphasis on long-range planning, all YDC's now have school            improvement, safe schools and technology plans. These plans address            technology needs, student and staff safety and academic goals. Examples            of goals include increasing the use of technology through application            of technology and student presentations, implementation of an after-school            tutoring program, and increasing the variety and number of methods to            disseminate information from the school program to stakeholders. These            plans will be updated annually.                                    Special            Education Continuous Improvement Monitoring Process Completed              The            Exceptional Children's Program Continuous Improvement Monitoring System            (""CIMS"") process was completed and an executive summary compiled.            The findings of this monitoring process indicate the department has            numerous strengths that include: No formal parent complaints have been            made in the last five years, all special education classes are within            the Department of Public Instruction class size guidelines, and services            are delivered to a population representative of the general population            within each facility and the department in general. Findings also suggest            several areas of need. These areas include: records compliance, transition            planning, teacher licensure, data collection in the area of state testing            and post release tracking, and related services. An action plan has            been developed to address these areas of need.                                   Special            Services Expand to Ensure Quality and Meet Student Needs            In the fall of 2002, an Exceptional Children's Program Compliance Specialist            position was developed through a federal grant in order to ensure comprehensive            records compliance. This position also provided in-service training            to teachers on topics related to provision of services to students with            disabilities. Curriculum choices for students also expanded in 2002-03.            A specialized course of study for students with moderate disabilities            was implemented in 2002-03 at two youth development centers. This is            a standard course of study developed to meet the needs of youth with            moderate disabilities. Courses include practical life skills in the            areas of language, math, science, social studies, and occupational development.            This year, Special Education and Title I Reading teachers continued            to utilize the Corrective Reading program to teach students to read.            Most students made gains of more than one grade level equivalent in            a six-month period of time. Students and teachers agree that the program            is excellent and students have proudly expressed their learning achievements.                                               Teachers            Recognized Through New Newsletter and ""Teacher of the Year""            Awards             Educational            Services continues to focus on recognizing teachers' efforts and their            need for up-to-date information. This included the production of a monthly            newsletter for teachers, ""Teacher Talk,"" and a process for            selecting a Teacher of the Year. ""Teacher Talk"" is produced            monthly in print form for all teachers and is posted monthly on the            DJJDP website. The process for selecting the Teacher of the Year guarantees            anonymity, and selection criteria are specific to improving outcomes            for children and working as a team member in the school. One award was            made for the Teacher of the Year in Youth Development Centers, and another            for the Teacher of the Year in Detention Centers.                                   On-Going            Professional-Development Opportunities for Teachers Increase            Ongoing teacher training took place during 2002-03, including training            in the use of technology, updates in teaching health, and methods for            teaching non-readers how to read. A five-day staff development event            was conducted for all teachers and substitute teachers at four locations            in the spring of 2003. The event included training in meeting the needs            of students with specific disabling conditions, engaging students in            learning, preparing students to be successful in their communities,            planning for school improvement, and positive techniques for managing            student behavior. Nearly 200 education-related staff participated in            this training event.                                    Assessment            Center Policies and Procedures Developed to Address Educational Needs             At            the beginning of school year 2002, education policies and procedures            for two assessment centers were developed, teachers and staff were trained,            and special classes were planned for students enrolled in the assessment            process. Beginning in the fall of 2002, all students were assessed in            terms of their achievement, their vocational aptitudes and interests,            and their need for special education programs. Planning for the educational            placement of students at the receiving YDC has allowed students to enter            the correct classes immediately upon arrival at a YDC. Court counselors            successfully joined with Educational Services staff to assist in transferring            public schools records to the Assessment Center. In addition, a contractual            teacher was hired to assist with educational assessment of students            and new contractual Speech/Language Pathologist was brought on board            to conduct hearing and speech/language screenings for newly committed            students.                                    Project            Connect Places Emphasis on Transition Planning for Students from Day            1              Project            Connect began in 2001-02 as a way to renew the focus on education transition            services for all students at YDCs. The vision of transition services            is based on the key concepts that: (1) transition planning starts on            day one of confinement; and (2) regardless of who is assigned the specific            task of transition coordination, transition planning must be seen as            part of everyone's job. This project is being piloted at Stonewall Jackson            YDC and is funded primarily through federal Title I funds. Other funds            being leveraged for the project include the Governor's Crime Commission            ""Partnerships for Successful Re-Entry"" grant and a three-year            grant focusing on Triad-area students funded by the U.S. Departments            of Justice, Labor, and Health and Human Services. Specific 2002-2003            initiatives include the hiring of Transition Development Specialists            at Stonewall Jackson YDC and Swannanoa Valley YDC, the creation of a            Career Resource Center at Stonewall Jackson YDC, and the start of a            student portfolio system, focusing on education and employment documentation            needed for successful student re-entry to the community.                                    Grants            Provide Funding for Teaching Student Behavior Change             The            Governor's Crime Commission provided funding for intensive weeklong            training for selected teachers and clinical staff in ""Reasoning            and ReActing,"" a 60-hour program aimed at teaching students how            to think and react differently in order to be more successful. A grant            from the Department of Public Instruction enabled two previously trained            teachers to attend the training in order to mentor newly trained staff.            A second grant from the Department of Public Instruction provided funding            for materials and incentives related to the program.                                    Threat          Assessment Seminars Kick-Off School Year          ""Rumors          should never go unaddressed in a school and neither should threats,""          said Secretary George Sweat in remarks he provided at a threat assessment          seminar taught by the U.S. Secret Service and cosponsored by the Department          of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention - Center for the Prevention          of School Violence and the Attorney General's Office.          The seminar          attended by Secretary Sweat took place in his hometown of Winston-Salem;          a second seminar occurred in Greenville. Presenting information from a          study of school shootings which occurred from 1974 to 2000, a representative          from the Secret Service emphasized that no predictive ""profile""          exists of school shooters and that school and law enforcement officials          must be aware of warning signs of potential violence.          Secretary          Sweat emphasized that school and law enforcement officials need to work          together when warning signs present themselves. ""Most incidents of          violence are stopped by school officials, not law enforcement, but both          groups must work together and know their roles"" according to Sweat's          citation of the Secret Service research. ""Much like our work with          youth in the community, collaboration is the key ingredient to success.""                   Thanks are          extended to Dr. Donald Martin, superintendent of the Winston-Salem / Forsyth          County School System and Carl Worthington, chief court counselor district          3A in Greenville, for assisting with the planning of the seminars.                             No Bones          About It: Therapeutic Program at Stonewall Jackson YDC has Animal Advocates          Barking Praise          Youth at          Stonewall Jackson YDC are learning responsibility, teamwork and empathy          skills not only from the staff, but also from their four-legged friends.          The pet therapy program, started in 1992, places a puppy from a shelter,          humane society, or other rescue organizations with a Stonewall student.          During the course of the program, students learn all about animal care,          including training, grooming and first aid. The program, which was recently          spotlighted in the national Dog and Kennel Magazine, has received accolades          from animal advocates, who favor the program.          ""This          program has proven that animals make a difference in boys with certain          behavioral problems. Working together they improve each other's lives,""          stated Rita Davis, Executive Editor of  Dog          and Kennel Magazine  during her June column.          ""The          kids enjoy the program very much. They get to watch puppies grow and learn          how to take care of them,"" said Missy Overton, coordinator of the          pet therapy program at Stonewall.         Potential          participants are screened carefully before being placed in the program.          Students are recommended for the program by a social worker, and then          must be approved by Overton, the director, and their treatment team. Much          of the time, students that are placed in the program have a history of          animal abuse. ""I feel that most of the time, those with colorful          histories have gained a new positive outlook on animal treatment from          the program,"" said Overton. Only from continued responsible behavior          and careful treatment of the dogs are they allowed to remain in the program.         A typical          day in the program begins with the boys bringing all the dogs out of their          individual kennels, and into a large area where they play together. The          students then clean and disinfect the kennels and the dogs' food bowls.          Then they give each dog food, water, and help administer any necessary          medications.          ""The          boys are responsible for the upkeep of the kennels and all the areas as          well as being responsible for the welfare of each dog. This is a huge          responsibility because we have 9 or more dogs and puppies on any given          day,"" said Overton.         On each day,          after the cleaning and feeding, there is a different activity related          to animal care. On Thursday afternoons, a dog trainer comes to work with          the boys and the dogs on basic obedience training. The boys also work          one day each week on grooming and bathing each dog, right down to cleaning          out their ears. Over the course of the program, the boys learn about first          aid, canine diseases and preventative measures, animal cruelty laws, proper          care for different animals, and how to choose the right type of animal          for them.          The pet therapy          program also gives each participant a chance to experience the unconditional          love that comes from human-animal bonding. After completing the program,          each student is given the opportunity to adopt the dog they worked with,          with written parental consent. The program also helps improve their social          skills, and acquire the job skills needed to work in a kennel, pet store          or other animal care positions.         ""One          of our students recently was released and is now residing in a group home          with a dog that he adopted from our program. This student began working          with the yellow lab pup when she was very young. They built a bond together          and now live happily together at a group home,"" Overton reflects.         The pet therapy          program at Stonewall is a not-for-profit endeavor that survives on donations.

With support from the community,          they built a 50-foot high climbing wall and rappelling tower at their          Adventure Center in Marble, NC. Since construction finished, many programs          have brought students to climb the wall, including Clay County's Pathways          program, Graham County SOS, Clay and Cherokee County Department of Social          Services, and other JCPC-funded intervention programs.         Pacesetter          Adventure Leader Jeremiah Smith has named the new wall ""The Great          Wall of Opportunity."" He explains that once you reach the summit,          you are then granted the opportunity to rappel down the other side. ""It          takes two adventure leaders for students to challenge the wall. One instructor          is on the ground overseeing those belaying climbers. Another instructor          must first climb the tower, hook up safety lines, help students transition          into rappelling setup, and then safety belay the student as they rappel.          It requires teamwork, training, and a high emphasis on safety for all          instructors and participants,"" he said.         Climbing          and rappelling have proven to be a great addition to the many activities          that have been steadily made available at the 50-acre Adventure Center          over the years. Three years ago, a seven-element Team Development Course          designed by Alpine Towers International was opened, and was funded in          part by DJJDP. In 2001, Pacesetters added a 50-foot high Alpine Tower          II and Giant Swing to the Center, and just last year, a junior golf instructional          facility was opened.         The Pacesetters          are grateful to several organizations for their contribution to the construction          of the Great Wall. The Tennessee Valley Authority's donated two 60-foot          high telephone poles for the tower; Murphy Electric Power Board's line          crew hauled the poles to the Center and erected them; and, a majority          of the funding came inadvertently from the Levi Strauss Foundation. Before          Levi Strauss closed the jean factory in Murphy, Western Carolina Pacesetters          was often a recipient of Levi Strauss Foundation grants. In 1997, the          Foundation awarded Pacesetters $25,000 to purchase a 15 passenger van          that was named Levi, the Adventure Van. In 2002, Pacesetters sold the          van and invested the funds in the Great Wall.         Tom Trawick,          Pacesetters Chairman, recently stated, ""This is a great addition          and really helps to strengthen our programming at the Adventure Center.          We are very close to having an office on site at the Center with a handicap          accessible bathroom thanks to Cherokee County and DJJDP. We would not          be where we are today without the support of our regional consultant June          Fowler and the staff at the Western Regional Office. This fall we anticipate          opening our campground along the Valley River for use by student groups.          More and more schools, intervention programs, and youth groups in our          county services are using this regional resource. I feel we are moving          onward with our mission.""                             On          the Road with Leigh                   Each month,          I normally go on the road to share with you some of the success stories          in your communities as well as introduce to some of the faces behind DJJDP.          This month, however, I have given the driver's seat to someone else in          order to share with you a new perspective about DJJDP. Jean Ritchey, a          20-year-old UNC-Charlotte junior, participated in the State's Model Co-Op          program this summer. She was assigned to the DJJDP Communications Office          here in Raleigh. For the two and half months she was with us, Jean went          on the road with me a lot, and for some events, she shadowed direct care          staff. In between her road travels, her summer was dedicated to promoting          the work of our local judicial districts and the juvenile crime prevention          councils in those districts. We thank her for the dedication and the energy          she brought to work with her every day. Her future leadership will certainly          be an asset to our State. Next month, I'll be back on the road. My destination          is Richmond County.

Reflections          from Our Summer Intern           By: Jean Ritchey, UNC-Charlotte junior                      We all face          opportunities and choices in our lives, and it is up to us to grasp onto          them and choose how they will shape our future. This past summer, through          a friend that works in central office, I learned of an internship opportunity          in the Communications Department at DJJDP. Being a Communications major          at The University of North Carolina at Charlotte specializing in public          advocacy, with a minor in political science, and career ambitions to work          for the state government, it is easy to see why I jumped at this opportunity.          By the end of the summer, I had found that my experiences at DJJDP impacted          not only my ambitions, but also my career path, my insight on juvenile          justice, and my minor.         On my first          day, I couldn't even say the acronym ""NC DJJDP"" without stumbling,          and I hardly knew anything about juvenile justice, except that I had once          enjoyed participating in Teen Court. While I have some history doing communications          work from my previous summer internship at a public relations firm in          Cary, I was unaccustomed to the volume of clients and collaborating partners          that DJJDP both serves and works with. I realized I would have to get          to know the system and the staff quickly. Leigh Hines, the Communications          Director, explained to me that as the summer progressed, so would my affiliation          with DJJDP. However, she could not have known the extent to which my experiences          and the people I came into contact with would forever change my outlook          on the juvenile justice system or those involved on all levels.         My big project          for the summer was to write news releases for each of the 39 judicial          court districts highlighting the 2.6% drop in statewide juvenile delinquency          rate, and discussing the prevention efforts of the individual counties          and their JCPCs. Writing each release involved interviewing each and every          Chief Court Counselor, keeping contact with Area Administrators and gaining          their support, developing a spreadsheet of the current contact information          of every media outlet in North Carolina, and helping establish media liaisons          all over the state. These tasks were much-needed would take nearly the          entire summer to complete. Needless to say I was feeling overwhelmed at          first.          As the summer          progressed, just as Leigh had said, I found my place at DJJDP. Aside from          the news releases, Leigh gave me the opportunity to visit various YDCs          and detention centers; I attended a JCPC meeting, as well as spent the          day with Wake County juvenile court counselor Karmen Turlington. Through          talking with the kids on many different occasions, I really felt as if          I was connecting with them. I realized that I could make a difference          in their lives. So, I recently changed my minor to psychology and have          decided pursue a career as a juvenile court counselor out of college.          In fact, I was able to get enrolled in an adolescent psychology class          this semester at UNC-Charlotte.          The one thing          I immediately tell anyone who asks about my experience this summer as          an intern with DJJDP is this: With all the people I talked to, one thing          kept striking me over and over again - everyone I met that was working          in the system was there for all the right reasons. Each of them cared          deeply for the individual kids that make up the juvenile population of          North Carolina, and genuinely strived to improve the juvenile justice          system. No matter how frustrating it got, whose parent you have to deal          with, or what obstacles they encountered, they all seem to stick it out          because they care deeply about our kids. After it was all over, I realized          that I was very proud to be a part of such an deeply committed organization.          My personal thanks go out to all the Chief Court Counselors who had to          deal with me all summer, Secretary Sweat for leading this department,          Larry Dix, who was so supportive in my efforts, all DJJDP staff for their          day in-day out efforts, and especially Leigh Hines for allowing me to          experience many different areas in the Department and encouraging me to          find my own place at DJJDP. I had a fabulous summer, and I hope to be          back in 2005, after I graduate.                              DJJDP          Develops Website to Track the SECC Campaign         DJJDP is          making it easier for you to track the department's progress in the State          Employees Combined Campaign through a  special          campaign website .

The CCC program is designed to develop the social, moral,          and intellectual skills of adolescents. Endrusick Enteprises, LLC, of          Oxford, NC also donated $200 in gift certificates to be used to reward          students that have completed reading the curriculum books in the CCC program.          DJJDP would like to thank the members of the Pilot Club of Raleigh, Inc.,          and Dianne Lawton, the general manager of Books-A-Million for providing          a twenty-percent discount (over $150.00) on the purchase of seventy-six          novels.                    DJJDP          Honors Volunteer of the Year for Stonewall Jackson Youth Development Center         DJJDP has          announced the Stonewall Jackson Youth Development Center (YDC)'s Volunteer          of the Year and recognized the many ongoing volunteer efforts at the facility          in Concord, NC.          ""Each          volunteer demonstrates great sacrifice and dedication every day by the          many ways in which they enrich the lives of youth and staff at Stonewall          Jackson Youth Development Center. Our volunteers help equip youth with          the ability to lead, to make good decisions, and ask questions when they          are tempted to do the wrong thing,"" says Assistant Secretary Larry          Dix, who oversees DJJDP's faith-based initiatives.         Reverend          James Kent, director of the Father's Heart Prison Ministry, was named          Stonewall Jackson's Volunteer of the Year for his tremendous efforts guiding          the young men housed there towards making positive life changes, at a          volunteer appreciation banquet in July. In the past year, Rev. Kent spent          time each week mentoring the youth at the YDC. He dedicated every Thursday          evening to providing spiritual guidance to the youth who resided in Kirk          South, a cottage on campus. Each month, he led Sunday evening worship,          and organized a daylong campus-wide program of spiritual emphasis.         Currently,          Stonewall Jackson has over 15 organizations that donate their time and          talent to mentoring and guiding the young men there. These organizations          include: Bright Light Baptist, Church of God, Covenant Prison Ministries,          Epworth United Methodist Church, Fishers of Men, First Christian Church,          First Missionary Baptist Church, Harrisburg United Methodist Church, Miami          Baptist Church, Mount Calvary Lutheran Church, New Foundation Ministries,          Oasis of Love, The Father's Heart Prison Ministries, Return Prison Ministries,          University City United Methodist Church, and University Park Baptist Church.         ""Our          volunteers bring a piece of the community to the youth in our Youth Development          Centers. They help show troubled youth them what a community is all about          - service,"" said Dix.         Also, at          the appreciation banquet, Stonewall Jackson honored YDC Chaplain Benjamin          Whitlock was also honored with a plaque for his dedication in service          to the youth.                   DJJDP          Education Services Director Appointed to National Board         Superintendent          Jane D. Young was appointed this summer to the National Juvenile Detention          Association's Confinement Education Advisory Board. She attended a three-day          meeting in Kalamazoo, Michigan in August to develop a strategic plan centered          on the goals of a quality confinement education program that is fully          integrated into the juvenile justice program. In addition, she joined          noted juvenile justice experts from across the country in developing an          agenda for a proposed three-day ""Confinement Leadership Academy,""          advising the Michigan State University's Center for Research and Professional          Development staff on priority topics for such an academy. DJJDP congratulates          Dr. Young on her appointment!                   Boys and          Girls Club Give Youth a Safe Place to Go During the Summer and After School                    School's          back in session! Programs like the  Boys          and Girls Programs of America  provide students structured activities          after-school, and safe places to stay during the day during summer vacation.          News Express visited the  Wake          County's Boys and Girls Club , which is funded through the local JCPC,          during the height of summer to see first hand how programs like these          are helping our state's youth.          ""If          I weren't coming here, I'd probably be out on the streets getting into          trouble.""          April Anthony,          Vice President of Resource Development, hears this sentiment over and          over from young members of the Boys and Girls Club.  ""To          have a child tell you that if they weren't here they'd be on the street          breaks your heart. To provide kids with an accessible place to come, play          and learn is very rewarding, as well an important service to the community,""          she said.         Boys and          Girls Clubs seek to improve the self-esteem of the kids that come to them          every day. They provide young people with one-on-one relationships with          professionals, and offer a wide variety of programs to help develop life          skills. Some of the programs they offer include: educational discipline,          career development, computer labs, arts and crafts, drug and alcohol awareness          classes, HIV/AIDS prevention programs, mentoring, health care programs,          gang prevention programs, leadership development, photography, and athletics/fitness          programs.          ""We          are providing these kids with the opportunity to rise above the circumstances          they are in and to excel emotionally, socially, and academically,""          states April Anthony, Vice President of Resource Development for Boys          and Girls Clubs.          The Boys          and Girls Club has been around for many years and has been providing positive          programs for disadvantaged youth across country since 1967. Currently,          there are 5 centers across the triangle area, specifically set up in disadvantaged          target areas. The clubs are set up in those areas so that children are          able to walk down the street to a safe haven when they are not in school.                   Boys and          Girls Club relies on donations from the local communities in order to          keep their doors open. The annual cost to parents or guardians to send          their child to the Boys and Girls Club is only $7.50, where as it costs          the Club over $500 a year per child. DJJDP recognizes the invaluable programs          that the Boys and Girls Club provides for youth in North Carolina. Local          area Boys and Girls Clubs are sponsored in part by DJJDP and the local          Juvenile Crime Prevention Councils (JCPCs).          ""The          Boys and Girls Club is a positive and safe place for kids. Our vision          is for every child in the Capital Area to have access to our facilities,""          said Anthony."
GX023-83-11574235	"Women in State Legislatures                Leland Y. Yee, Ph.D.  Assistant Speaker pro Tempore  California State Assembly        The women who met for tea on the fateful day which led to the first conference on women's rights - in Seneca Falls, New York - and the countless millions of others who, for the past 155 years, planned, organized, lectured, wrote, marched, organized petition campaigns, lobbied, canvassed voters, staged parades, ran for office, argued court cases, and broke new ground in every field imaginable - irrevocably changed the world of today's woman.  Today's woman is the living legacy of equal rights achieved non-violently and against all odds by those who were powerless.  There is, however, much left to be done.      This year, we pay homage to the early efforts of pioneers in women's rights by celebrating the 155th anniversary of the Seneca Falls Convention.  Each March, during ""Women's History Month,"" we acknowledge the accomplishments and contributions of those who helped improve the status of women in our society.       Unfortunately, many of us remember when women were thought of only as mothers, sisters and wives -- and it was not all that long ago.  Over the last 30-plus years, however, during the rise of a monumental women's movement, women finally began to gain well-deserved recognition for their many contributions to society.  Today, women are the doctors who save our lives and the educators who teach our children.  They are attorneys, pilots, engineers, and soldiers.  They are the police who enforce the laws, and they are the legislators who make them.      Today, 73 women serve in the U.S. Congress.  A record 14 women, including former first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, serve in the U.S. Senate.  In the House of Representatives, there are currently 59 women, which is also an all-time high.  The number of women in statewide elective executive posts is 79, including a record six state governors.     Twenty-three women have served as governors of states.  Additionally, a woman is the current Governor of Puerto Rico.  Arizona is the first state to have a woman succeed another woman as governor.  Of the 23 women governors, 16 were first elected in their own right, three replaced their husbands, and four became governor by constitutional succession, one of whom subsequently won a full term.     In ever-increasing numbers, women are also joining state legislatures.  Following the 2002 General Elections, the states with the highest proportion of women legislators are as follows:         Washington  36.7 percent    Colorado  34.0 percent   Maryland  33.0 percent   Oregon  31.1 percent   Vermont  31.1 percent   California  30.0 percent   New Mexico 29.5 percent   Connecticut 29.4 percent   Delaware  29.0 percent   Nevada  28.6 percent      These gains are truly remarkable in light of the fact that in 1969 women held only 301 seats nationwide, which was a mere four percent of the country's total seats.  Today, out of 7,382 state legislative seats in America, 1,645, or 22.3 percent, are held by women.  Since 1971, the number of women serving in state legislatures has increased more than four-fold.     Women also hold several top legislative leadership positions.  Today, the minority leader of the House of Representatives is Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from  San Francisco.  She is the first woman ever to lead a congressional political party!  At the state level, two women serve as presidents of state senates and five women serve as speakers of state houses.   In the California Legislature, there are 27 women in the Assembly (22 Democrats and five Republicans) and 11 women (all Democrats) in the State Senate.  Women chair 13 of the 30 Assembly standing committees, as well as a number of select and sub-committees.  In the Senate, women chair nine committees.   However, despite the striking gains women have made in Congress and state legislatures throughout the last 30 years, not to mention the record number of women governors and additional women members of the California Legislature, the representation of women in Congress increased only by one after the 2002 elections, and, the total number of women elected officials has actually seen a small decrease.  In statewide elected executive positions there has been a decrease from 89 to 79, and for the first time in over 25 years, California has no woman serving in a statewide elective office.  It is important that we do not let this small decrease keep us from continuing to see women serve as policymakers throughout the nation, as we show our daughters they can grow up to be whatever they choose to be.         # # #            Assemblymember.Yee@assembly.ca.gov"

She                received her Master's of Public Health at the University of Texas.                             The First Lady has had an impressive career in public health. She                worked as a Public Health Consultant at the World Bank, working                on food and nutrition issues and on AIDS assistance for Africa.                She also worked as a Migrant Program Assistant/Outreach worker on                the East Coast Migrant Health Project.               She has also served on many boards as an advocate for children,                especially with organizations devoted to preventing child abuse.                She continues to be active in a wide variety of charity and volunteer                activities. The First Lady received the 2003 Commissioner’s                Award from the Administration on Children Youth and Families in                recognition of her leadership, dedication and accomplishments in                the prevention of child abuse and neglect in Virginia.

He noted that copies of the materials sent in response to questions raised at the March 4 hearing before the House Higher Education subcommittee was included in the board packet.  Overall he felt that the hearing focused more on the way state government works rather than on State Library programs.  He also reported that Carol Roddy, Diane Fink, Bill Morris and he met with Representative Shawn Webster to follow up on the discussion of rotary accounts at the hearing.     Mr. Lucas then reported that the Ohio Library Council legislative day and rally was scheduled for Wednesday, April 2 and public testimony on libraries was planned for April 5 with testimony from Deborah O'Connor, Director of the Geauga County Public Library.    Ms. Baines asked if a salary freeze was a part of the budget.  Mr. Lucas responded that the OSCEA union contract included a two-year salary freeze along with a freeze on step and longevity pay increases.    Public Terminals Acceptable Use Policy    Mr. Jim Buchman presented the draft Public Terminals Acceptable Use Policy noting that the Attorney General's office had recommended the addition of bullet two under guidelines for use in the policy.  The policy recommended is as follows:    The State Library of Ohio   Public Terminals Acceptable Use Policy  Presented to the State Library Board on March 27, 2003      Introduction    Integral to the Mission of the State Library of Ohio is the provision of  information to meet  the needs of Ohio's state government and citizens.  The State Library endeavors to develop  collections, resources, and services to fulfill this mission.     As a state agency, the State Library of Ohio has a management responsibility as cited in   Ohio Department of Administrative Services (DAS) Directive 01-25 to establish an  appropriate policy to administer use of  the Internet and online services supported by  the agency.  It is within this context that the State Library of Ohio offers access to the  Internet and other on-line services.      Filters    The State Library of Ohio uses a filter software application to screen all public computers having Internet access.  Filters are not foolproof: sometimes filtered sites may slip through; other times filters may block unintended sites.  In the latter situation, the filters  can be overridden by library staff to permit access for research purposes.  The State Library of Ohio expressly abrogates responsibility for the effectiveness of its filtering software application.       Guidelines For Use      State Library public terminals will be used for educational, informational, and recreational purposes only;  use for unauthorized, illegal or unethical purposes is prohibited.      Access to or display of obscene language and sexually explicit graphics as defined in section 2901.01 and 2907.31 of the Ohio Revised Code is not permitted.    U.S. copyright law (Title 17, U.S. Code) prohibits the unauthorized reproduction or distribution of copyrighted materials, except as permitted by the principles of ""fair use.""  Users may not copy or distribute electronic materials without the explicit permission of the copyright holder.      Software or other computer programs may NOT be downloaded from the Internet; only citations and information resources may be downloaded to diskette on State Library public terminals.      Users are prohibited from misrepresenting themselves as another user; attempting to modify or gain access to files, passwords, or data belonging to others; seeking unauthorized access to any computer system, or damaging or altering software components of any network or database.    Minor children  must be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian when accessing the Internet from State Library public terminals.    The State Library is not responsible for Internet connections that are temporarily unavailable due to technical difficulties.    Users may not modify or change State Library terminal settings, or reboot public terminals.      Users playing games may be asked to give up their terminal to someone needing to do research when the library is busy.     Failure to abide by these policies may result in suspension of State Library services and privileges.          Mr. Miller suggested that the Revised Code sections referred to in the policy should be made easily available with the policy.  Mr. Stich asked what will be done with the policy after its adoption.  Mr. Buchman stated that it will be posted at the public terminals.    Dr. Paulson moved (M-11-03) adoption of the revised State Library of Ohio Public Terminals Acceptable Use Policy.    Mr. Stich seconded the motion.  The motion passed with all members voting ""yes"".    New Business    State Subsidy Reductions    Mr. Lucas presented the state General Revenue Fund reductions for consideration.  Mr. Stich asked if the Board had any choice in adopting the reductions.  Mr. Lucas replied that they did not.     Mr. Stich moved (M-12-03) that a reduction in State Fiscal Year 2003 General Revenue Funds be implemented, as directed, by the State of Ohio Office of Budget and Management, through the following adjustments to the Regional Library Systems SFY03 General Revenue Funds within ALI 350-502:      Regional Library System   State GRF FY 2003 add'l reduction    CAMLS           $  7,020     GCLC           $  3,341   MOLO           $  3,049     NOLA           $  6,245     Norweld                $  3,787   OVAL           $  6,558     SOLO           $  7,260    Totals    $37,260    and that a reduction in State Fiscal Year 2003 General Revenue Funds be implemented, as directed by the State of Ohio Office of Budget and Management, through the following adjustments to the Cleveland Public Library and the Public Library of Cincinnati and Hamilton County SFY03 General Revenue Funds within ALI 350-501 and ALI 503 for the operations of the Regional Libraries for the Bind and Physically Handicapped:      RLBPH   State GRF FY 2003 add'l reduction    Cleveland Public Library         $23,726     Public Library of Cincinnati and Hamilton County       $15,774      Ms. Hastings seconded the motion.  The motion passed with all members voting ""yes"".    Retirement Resolutions    Mr. Lucas then presented the following resolutions to Angie Morris and Doris Henderhan to thank them for their many years of service to the State Library of Ohio.

GX136-80-0961957	"June 5, 1998    Spratt To Help York County Family Build Habitat Home    WASHINGTON — U.S. Rep. John Spratt (D-SC) will help build a Habitat for Humanity home with a local low-income family and other volunteers in York County on Saturday, June 6. Spratt is participating in ""The Houses that Congress Built,"" a national public-private effort to build decent, affordable homes for low-income families in every congressional district across the United States during National Homeownership Week (June 6-13, 1998).    The home under construction is located in Fort Mill, S.C., at 526 Joe Louis Street. Spratt will be at the site from 9:00 am until 12:00 Noon tomorrow.  Working in conjunction with Habitat for Humanity of York County, Spratt will work side-by-side with a low-income family and other volunteers as they begin construction and raising the walls of a new home. Members of Congress, on a bipartisan basis, are embarking on this project with the help and support of both Habitat for Humanity and the National Partners in Homeownership, a public-private partnership working to increase homeownership opportunities in the United States.    ""This is the beginning of a new and unique partnership that will result in a new home for a low-income family in our community,"" Spratt said. ""Everyone in America should have a decent home in which to live. With the active support of people like Dr. Art Florack, David and Donna Sabolia, and area project supporters and volunteers, we can make the dream of home ownership a reality for a deserving local family.""         # # #"
GX265-52-13603656	"FEBRUARY 2004  EmployeeUPDATE A month publication for employees of the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services  Our Mission: To serve the people of North Carolina by enabling individuals, families and communities to be healthy and secure, and to achieve social and economic well-being.  Changes ahead for Caswell, O'Berry and Cherry  Down east facilities realignment announced Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Carmen Hooker Odom has announced a restructuring of three down east psychiatric and mental retardation facilities. The Goldsboro-based O'Berry Center and Cherry Hospital have entered into an alliance to improve administrative and clinical services by combining these services. Cherry Hospital will continue in its function as a psychiatric facility. In addition, the O'Berry Center will now serve as eastern North Carolina's center for people with developmental disabilities who have been dually diagnosed with mental health illnesses. The Caswell Center in Kinston will serve as the primary residential center for eastern North Carolinians with a single diagnosis of severe developmental disabilities. Under the new organization alliance, O'Berry Center and Cherry Hospital will consolidate administrative support, budget and human resource functions at both facilities immediately. All other services will be consolidated in July 2004. Neither facility will close. ""We are absolutely committed to ensuring that current O'Berry patients continue to receive the best possible care, said Secretary Hooker Odom. ""We have always provided a high-quality of care, and we will continue to do so. But, we will work with families to find more appropriate community care when possible."" Planning for the alliance will be led by a committee, which will include employee and family representation. ""We want the employees and the families of those we serve at these facilities to help plan for the future,"" said Hooker Odom. The alliance will result in a reduced number of positions, but it is expected that these reductions can be achieved through normal attrition. No immediate reduction in force is expected, and it is hoped that kind of action will never become necessary. Both facilities routinely have a couple of dozen vacancies every month. With the alliance in place, each vacancy will be studied to see if it should be filled, realigned to deal with the new management structure, or abolished. The department will also work with other state facilities in the area to facilitate employment of DHHS employees at those sites. Money saved in this process will be used to provide community services for people with mental health issues. Administrative support, budget and human resource functions at both facilities will be consolidated immediately. All other services will be consolidated in July 2004.

At the end of January we announced an exciting new plan for our eastern North Carolina mental health facilities. O'Berry Center and Cherry Hospital will enter in an alliance to improve administrative services. Administrative support, budget, and human resource functions will be consolidated immediately. Professional services will be consolidated in July 2004. We have two facilities with similar staff, providing similar services to different populations. Combining the skills and strengths of both facilities will improve services while maintaining the integrity of the unique aspects of both programs. As we move forward with mental health reform, this alliance will also help us to fill a crucial service gap for people who are both developmentally disabled and also suffer from other severe forms of mental illness. Currently, there is no state facility aimed at people with this kind of dual diagnosis. Allying the developmental disabilities facility with the psychiatric hospital will allow the state to create a place for people who need this kind of residential care. This is exactly the kind of service the state should be providing. This facility will serve as a model both for North Carolina and the nation. The new allied facilities will accept people who have a dual diagnosis of developmental disabilities and mental illness, and Cherry Hospital will continue to serve people who need acute psychiatric care O'Berry will not accept any new patients who have a single diagnosis of developmental disabilities, but current patients will stay in the facility until their guardians and family concur with placement in the community or in another residential facility. Caswell Center, which is located in Kinston, will become the primary residential center for eastern North Carolinians with a single diagnosis of severe developmental disabilities. This is a great opportunity for all three facilities. This is exactly what mental health reform is all about  changing our focus to meet the different needs of the 21st century. Sincerely,  Carmen Hooker Odom  2   DHHS EmployeeUPDATE FEBRUARY 2004  Jalil Isa Salud y Saludos!  In fact, I remember having my mother tell me when I was young, ""don't stand in front of the refrigerator"" after walking inside all sweaty from a day of playing under the hot Miami sun. And I can sure envision her yelling at me, telling me I'm nuts for going out in the icy weather we've had lately without the proper layers of clothing. Or for going out in the recent batch of snow we had and doing a snow angel with only a golf shirt on (I have pictures to prove it!). In my case, I may be nuts...but it's for more reasons than just going out in these environs without enough warm clothes. I, for one, love this weather. We can speculate on the reasons why correlations may be drawn between the weather and health. But science has, so far, proven climate not to directly cause a cold. Nor has science definitively proven herbal medicines to fight off the cold. Latinos, by and large, have been influenced by native or indigenous beliefs surrounding health, as well as African and Spanish culture. It is this hodgepodge of different backgrounds which has evolved into what many now view as the realities about their own bodies. And you might be surprised at some of the notions people have about the role the world  and universe, for that matter  have on their well-being. For instance, I remember my mother telling me that a cousin had a disfigurement as a result of that cousin's mother going outside during an eclipse while she was pregnant with her. Many Latinas believe that that exposure of a pregnant woman to an eclipse will cause her infant to have a cleft lip or palate. It may sound ludicrous, but the indigenous populations have long believed the earth and heavens play a big role in one's well-being. These views have influenced nonindigenous Hispanics. Then there are the children I remember seeing with a cone of paper stuck in their ear  burning the paper is thought to suck out bad air and relieve earaches. When I was young, my grandmother gave me a charm to put on a neck chain. It looked like a black pebble. This charm  which in some cases could also be a small eye worn on the chain  was supposed to ward off mal de ojo. This is a condition where you become ill as a result of excessive compliments or envious looks from others.  Myths are part of Hispanic culture I have found myself talking a lot to Hispanic media about the flu lately. With the press coverage that has swept the country regarding this latest flu outbreak, there is little doubt the disease has been on the minds of many parents. As I use various media outlets to try to spread the message about the need for everyone to take basic precautions to lower their risk of getting sick, I also find myself dispelling myths. What myths you may ask? Actually, I have been overlooking many commonly held beliefs that are as much a part of the Latino culture as rice and beans may be. There are a number of beliefs sewn into the Hispanic culture that play a huge role in their overall health. Of course, the very existence of myths surrounding health is in no way isolated to any one culture. We've all heard our parents remind us ""not to leave the house without a jacket...or we're liable to catch a cold."" This, too, is a very common phrase you'll hear in Latino households  well, unless you're farther south or in the hotter climate zones of Latin America. In those places, you may instead hear ""don't forget your umbrella...or you may catch a cold."" In fact, those of us who work in health may know that colds are actually caused by viruses, which means we can't actually `catch' it from cold water (unless perhaps you drink water that someone has sneezed on...ok, I'm thinking way too much about this). But like this example there are many others. Sudden change of weather or temperature, walking with bare feet, being improperly dressed for the weather and getting wet are all associated with potential illness in many countries.  See Myth, page 6 3   DHHS EmployeeUPDATE FEBRUARY 2004  Center named in honor of Iverson Riddle For 40 years, Dr. Iverson Riddle served as the guiding force behind Western Carolina Center. Those efforts have been recognized with the renaming late last year of the Morganton facility as the ""J. Iverson Riddle Developmental Center."" The center opened in 1963 and is one of five state residential facilities for people with mental retardation and related disabilities. Riddle, a native of Morganton, has been at the helm of the center since before it opened. He said that after nearly a half century of working for the state, he now finds himself ""re-invigorated, and with renewed hope that in these trying and even critical times, ways can be found that exemplify quality and will meet the needs of persons with severe challenges and their families. To this end I pledge myself and this newly named Developmental Center."" During four decades under Riddle's leadership the center compiled an impressive list of ""firsts,"" for a residential mental retardation center, including: The nation's first Residential Advocacy Program, which is now both a federal and state requirement for such facilities; The first Human Rights Commitment in the Southeast; The first state-funded early intervention program; The first residential fine arts program for people with mental retardation (residents of the center have displayed artwork at major galleries across the country); The first group home east of the Mississippi; The first Volunteer Services Program; The first institutional Covenant Center for research and development of religious and ministry services for people with severe, multiple handicaps; The first pet therapy program; and, The first equestrian program for people with multiple handicaps.  In naming the center in December, DHHS Secretary Carmen Hooker Odom recognized Riddle's lifetime Iverson Riddle commitment to the center, its residents and their families. ""Your capabilities are respected on a national level,"" she said at a ceremony in December. ""The programs and research at Western Carolina Center have made vast contributions to the treatment of developmental disabilities. ""The first time I visited the center, I was struck by what an incredible vision Iverson had in making the center a reality,"" she added. ""By any measure, the J. Iverson Riddle Developmental Center is a showcase  providing a supportive environment for people with mental retardation. You can see it in the faces of the residents. You can see it in the effort put forth by a staff absolutely dedicated to this vision. One man's vision has equaled happier lives for the people who have lived here and their families."" Riddle said the name change came as a surprise and that he was ""stunned, humbled, overwhelmed, speechless for the first time ever, and deeply appreciative.""  4   DHHS EmployeeUPDATE FEBRUARY 2004  Some DHHS employees can expect a little extra in spring paychecks. Nearly 900 Department of Health and Human Services employees can expect a pay raise in the coming months. Pay increases will be given to about 400 employees in lower paid positions such as food service assistants, housekeepers, cooks and general utility workers at mental health institutions, and resident life attendants at DHHS schools. Employees in good standing earning less than $18,312 annualized salary, are eligible for this increase. Supervisors will notify employees who will receive raises in the next few weeks. Qualified employees can expect the increase to show up in their paychecks starting this spring. Raises ranging up to 10 percent will also be given to about 500 direct care nurses working in state mental retardation centers, the Special Care Center and Alcohol and Drug Abuse Treatment Centers who did not receive increases from range revisions in December 2001, when they were first eligible. These raises were the department's number one priority request from the Salary Adjustment Fund. Contributed by Eliza Drury, a senior at N.C. State University majoring in communications.  Board Certified Teachers  DHHS teachers receive National Board Certification Eleven DHHS teachers achieved certification during the 2003 certification cycle as Nationally Board Certified Teachers by the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (NBPTS). ""We have an outstanding group of teachers working in our programs,"" said Cyndie Bennett, superintendent of the Office of Education Services. ""This certification will help to enhance our children's educations throughout our schools."" The teachers certified this year teach in programs across the state include: Jeffrey T. Federman, Wright School in Durham; Theresa A. Barrett, Patricia A. Babin, and Jacquelyn Y. Simms, Western Early Intervention Program for Children who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing in Morganton; Linda M. Stanley and Lisa M. Smith, Caswell Center in Kinston; Regina D. Byrd and Leah E. Brackett, Iverson Riddle Center in Morganton; Elizabeth R. Lawson, Spring Hill School in Butner ; Karen Fulp, Governor Morehead Preschool in Raleigh, and Millie R. King, N.C. School for the Deaf in Morganton. Teachers in all DHHS educational programs are eligible to participate if they hold a continuing North Carolina teaching license, have been employed by the state for at least 3 years and are in a state-paid position. The 11 newly certified teachers bring the total across DHHS to 19. Currently, there are 6,646 National Board Certified teachers in North Carolina, more than any other state. There are more than 32,000 National Board Certified teachers in the United States.

Ling developed teaching strategies and techniques to assist children with all degrees of hearing loss to develop spoken language. He was the author of numerous publications and trained professionals. Ling was an advocate for children and families and worked tirelessly throughout his career to ensure that children with hearing loss reached their listening and speaking potential. her career in 1979 with Lee County Schools where she first worked with deaf and hard of hearing children.

Treatment may consist of giving the child herbal tea (usually mint) and one teaspoon of olive or resin oil, massaging the stomach and back, and then pulling the skin along the spine three times in three different areas. I remember my father asking his grandmother once to do this for my step-brother. Sure enough, the way my father recounts the story my brother miraculously became better after a massage from the proper hands. Latinos also have a long tradition of seeking the services of folk healers. These curanderos will use non-traditional medicines to relieve many maladies. Yerberos (herbalists) and sobadores (masseuses) or santigadores (persons who do massage in the name of a saint) are also occasionally employed. I know much of this might not make sense and may even sound a bit ludicrous. But it is these beliefs that create one of the many fabrics of a culture. Just as we would expect others to respect our firmly held beliefs, the same courtesy should be extended when it comes to others' cultural viewpoints. Equally important, insight into these beliefs are an important part of the overall recipe used by modern day practitioners of medicine to help treat Hispanics in our community.  6   DHHS EmployeeUPDATE FEBRUARY 2004  Fuquay named director of Medical Assistance Gary Fuquay was appointed director of the Division of Medical Assistance in January.

Construction of the home which began in July 2000, is scheduled to be completed next month.  The volunteer crews and Habitat construction officials generally try to complete construction of the homes in 12 consecutive Saturday work periods.  So far, hundreds of local volunteers have worked together to build the house.    Baird said that he wasn't surprised by the strong community participation in building this home for an underprivileged family of Cowlitz County.  ""It is truly a testament to the community of Longview and Cowlitz County as a whole, that families are willing to set aside time from their own lives and homes, to come together on this project.  I am just proud that I can be a part of the overall effort and bring some recognition to the Habitat for Humanity program and the good work they have done in the Pacific Northwest,"" said Baird.     Nationally recognized, Habitat for Humanity was founded in 1976 as a nonprofit, ecumenical housing ministry dedicated to eliminating substandard housing and homelessness.  In September of this year they will celebrate the construction of their 100,000th home worldwide. Using volunteer labor and tax-deductible donations of money and materials, Habitat partners with future homeowners to build homes.  Houses are sold to families for no profit, and are financed through affordable, no-interest mortgages.  Monthly mortgage payments are then used to support the construction of more houses through the organization's revolving Fund for Humanity. Former President Jimmy Carter has often worked alongside Habitat volunteers in constructing new houses.    ""It's a wonderful experience besides the fact that you're doing something for someone less fortunate who needs a home,"" adds Baird. "" I can tell you that just the fact that people have a home of their own does something for their self-esteem and their sense of independence. They've worked to build their own home, they have been part of that success and they have watched their neighbors work with them to make their dream come true. That's an important part of growing strong communities.""     In February of 1999, 20 citizens of Cowlitz County gathered to start planning for a new Habitat affiliate.   A year later, the interest and participation had grown to about 250 volunteers who officially became recognized as members of the Habitat for Humanity Cowlitz County affiliate.
