They are the corporation tax and the personal income tax. It is the duty of the California state franchise tax board to look after these two taxes. One has to understand a bit about these two taxes too. In order to run, the government requires funds and part of these funds are acquired in the form of taxation. At the end of every 12 months period, the government collects certain taxes. One of these is the income tax. When an individual earns money from his business or through investments, these are his profits and the amount of tax depends on the profit one makes.

Opened in October 1955 as a  motor inn  owned and operated by  Jack Wrather  under an agreement with  Walt Disney , the hotel underwent several expansions and renovations over the years before being acquired by  The Walt Disney Company  in 1988. The hotel was downsized to its present capacity in 1999 as part of the Disneyland Resort expansion.

Walt Disney  wanted to build a hotel for Disneyland visitors to stay overnight, since Disneyland was quite a drive from the established population centers of  Southern California  at the time. However, Disney's financial resources were significantly depleted by the construction of the park, so he negotiated a deal with  Jack Wrather  and his business partner Maria Helen Alvarez under which Wrather-Alvarez Productions would own and operate a hotel called the Disneyland Hotel across the street from Disneyland.  [ 1 ]  Wrather was a  Texas   oil   millionaire  turned  film producer  who already owned hotels in  Las Vegas  and  Palm Springs , and co-owned  television stations  in  Tulsa  and  San Diego  with Alvarez. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   The Wrather years 1955-1984           Disneyland Monorail  train at the Disneyland Hotel station in August, 1963       The original Disneyland Hotel was designed by the firm of  Pereira  &  Luckman  and opened on October 5, 1955, nearly 3 months after Disneyland. Various  strikes  caused the opening to be postponed from the August date advertised in pre-opening promotional materials, and the hotel only had limited capacity when it initially opened. The hotel originally consisted of just over 100 rooms in 5 two-story guest room complexes (later known as the South Garden Rooms and even later as the Oriental Gardens) with shopping, dining and recreational facilities added in early 1956. It also had a doctor and dentist on site as well as a barber and beauty shop. On August 25, 1956, the hotel celebrated its ""official"" grand opening with many Hollywood stars and celebrities attending the festivities.  [ 2 ] It was quickly expanded in 1956 with 3 more North Garden guest room structures, one more North Garden structure in 1958 and lastly, two more North garden structures in 1960. The hotel now boasted over 300 guest rooms and suites. It was one of the first hotels in the region to offer accommodations for four persons per room. Guests traveled between the hotel and  Disneyland Park  via a tram between the hotel and the park main entrance.   When the Wrather-Alvarez partnership ended acrimoniously in 1958, Wrather bought Alvarez' share of Wrather-Alvarez Hotels, making him sole owner of the Disneyland Hotel.   Over the years, the hotel was expanded to include three guest room towers: Sierra (1962; expanded 1966), Marina (1970), and  Bonita  (1978).  [ 3 ]  The  Disneyland Monorail  was extended from its original 1959 configuration and a station opened at the hotel in 1961 (pictured). Recreational areas, attractions, and a convention center (1972) were also added over the years. The hotel also featured a  Richfield   service station  for several years as part of Richfield's sponsorship of several Disneyland attractions, including the  Autopia .     [ edit ]   Disney takes over   When  Michael Eisner  became Chairman & CEO of Walt Disney Productions in 1984, he desperately wanted to get out of Disney's agreement with the Wrather Corporation and bring the Disneyland Hotel under the Walt Disney Company's umbrella. However, Wrather refused to sell, just as he had refused to sell to Walt Disney many years before. Wrather died in 1984, two months after Eisner took over at Disney, and five years later, in 1989, Disney bought the entire Wrather company. As a result, Disney owned other Wrather assets including the  RMS Queen Mary ,  The Lone Ranger  and the TV series  Lassie . Though Disney kept the hotel, it has since sold the other assets that came with the purchase.     [ edit ]   Resort expansion 1999-2001   In 1999, a significant portion of the hotel was demolished to make way for Downtown Disney and parking areas for the newly expanding Disneyland Resort. Most buildings east of the Sierra Tower and north of the Marina Tower were demolished, including the original hotel buildings from 1955. The only buildings remaining in these areas are the convention center and parking garage. Recreational facilities were built in the quad between the three towers, previously site of the Water Wonderland, to replace those that were previously located east of the Sierra Tower. Streets previously used to access the hotel by car were regraded and/or outright eliminated, and a new street was built to access the hotel. Tram service from the hotel was also discontinued, leaving the Monorail as the only vehicular mode of transportation from park to hotel.   The loss of hotel rooms was offset with the opening of  Disney's Grand Californian Hotel  in 2001, but many of the restaurants and amenities that existed prior to 1999 were never replaced.          Disneyland Hotel towers from Downtown Disney. Dreams Tower is at left; Magic Tower at right. The area in foreground was previously the site of the Plaza Building.         [ edit ]   The hotel today   Today none of the original hotel buildings from 1955 remain standing. Very little of the hotel other than parking areas and service facilities sit outside of the perimeter created by the three remaining guest room towers. Original signs and other artifacts from several of the stores and restaurants demolished with the Plaza are on display in the hotel's employee cafeteria.   ESPN Zone ,  Rainforest Caf , and  AMC Theatres  - all  Downtown Disney  venues - now occupy much of the former hotel space east of the Sierra Tower.  Mickey Mouse  theming is employed in many interior furnishings and details. In 2007 the Marina, Sierra, and Bonita Towers were renamed Magic, Dreams, and Wonder, respectively. Other buildings in the sprawling hotel complex house restaurants, stores, offices, recreational facilities and convention and banquet facilities. The complex also features gazebo and garden areas that are used for  Disney's Fairy Tale Weddings & Honeymoons .   A new  Downtown Disney   Monorail Station  was built on the same site as the old Disneyland Hotel station, [ 2 ]  and still takes guests to Tomorrowland inside  Disneyland Park  along the same beamway that existed prior to the 1999-2001 expansion. An exclusive entrance to  Disney's California Adventure  for guests staying at  Disneyland Resort  hotels is a short walk away. The property is estimated to start another renovation before summer of 2008 and be finished in 2010.

The Enchanting Anaheim Disneyland Hotel   In the slide show above, you're viewing  pictures of the Disneyland Hotel's pool and guest rooms.  On this page, you'll discover details for deciding whether or not you'd like to stay at the Disneyland Hotel on your upcoming visit to the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California! Disneyland Hotel's history    Looking at the three tall towers which comprise the Anaheim Disneyland Hotel of today,  it's hard to believe that the Disneyland Hotel began its ""life"" as a small, flat, motel-looking type structure.   My, how times have changed...and for the better! The Disneyland Hotel today is a lush oasis of waterfalls, plants, blooming flower gardens, and topiary sculptures of mascot Mickey Mouse and his friend Goofy.   The 3 tall towers of today's Disneyland Hotel now hold over 900 guest rooms and suites, and the grounds now boast a number of eating establishments, from the quick-bite to the classy. On this page, we'll talk about the interesting possibilities that await you if you stay at the Disney Hotel in Anaheim, California.   Amenities at Anaheim's Disneyland Hotel     First of all, we'll talk about the amenities of the Disneyland Hotel grounds and public areas. The hotel grounds are green and lovely, and a beautiful garden that's fun simply to stroll about and admire. For those who have more in mind than simply strolling, however, you'll find plenty of activities awaiting you. Two swimming pools  await you at the Disneyland Hotel of Anaheim. One is the famous ""Never Land Pool,"" decorated with a Peter Pan theme...complete with Captain Hook's pirate ship! Also for those seeking physical activity, there's a sandy ""beach"" area where you can play volleyball...or, for a more serious workout, you can use the state-of-the-art  exercise center  at the Disneyland Hotel. Love to shop?   At the Disneyland Hotel, you'll enjoy browsing through  2 cute gift shops  near the registration desk of the hotel lobby.  You'll find all the merchandise you want to buy for gifts---and souvenirs that you'll want for yourself and your family.  Merchandise includes Disneyland and Disney Character-themed clothing for all ages, plush animals, postcards, mugs, jewelry, etc. You'll know you're at Disneyland Park before you even head towards your hotel room! A free-standing gift shop awaits you in the midst of the hotel's garden-like grounds, as well.      Amenities of the guest rooms at the Disneyland Hotel--- Each guest room is comfortably spacious.  You'll find thick bed covers, dual-layer drapes (room-darkening layer, with sheers underneath) and matching carpeting---all with Disney character themes woven right into the specially, made-for-this-hotel fabrics. All rooms have room service available, plus refrigerators, voice mail, irons/boards, hair dryers and safes right in each room.  Standard rooms come with either one king or two queen-sized beds; suites up to 3 Bedrooms in size are available.  There is a special ""Concierge Level"" for guests who'd like even more plush surroundings and extra pampering.    Restaurants at the Anaheim Disneyland Hotel     What's the fun-most restaurant at the Anaheim Disneyland Hotel? Hands down, it's got to be ""Goofy's Kitchen.""   At Goofy's Kitchen, you and your children can enjoy one of the famous Disney Character Meals.  Chef Goofy is sure to be there, along with other costumed characters, such as The Mad Hatter or Mickey's dog, Pluto. Meals served at the Goofy's Kitchen Restaurant are all-you-can-eat buffet style.  The particular selections of food rotate daily so that hotel guests won't bore of the menu.  However, there are certain dishes that you'll be sure to find. For breakfast at Goofy's Kitchen,  you'll always find a selection of egg dishes---scrambled eggs and made-before-your-eyes omelet combos being 2 of the most popular.  Then, there will always be a rotation of types of pancakes, waffles, French toast and cereals, plus a smorgasbord of muffins, sweet rolls and croissants.  You'll find plenty of fresh fruit, both whole and sliced, to give you that ""healthy feeling,"" as well. At Lunch and Dinner, you'll find a wide array of dishes--- chicken, beef and fish selections, Mexican dishes, pastas/lasagnes, and that kid-favorite, pizza.  There will be all types of veggies and potatoes to accompany the meal, along with a salad bar, fruit bar, and a top-your-own-baked-potato bar.   The dessert area has still another full array of choices, ranging from hot deserts, such as cobblers, bread pudding and dessert crepes, to cold treats, such as the soft-serve yogurt.  Of course, there will be a selection of cakes, cookies and brownies, as well.  Naturally, a selection of hot and cold beverages come with the buffet meal at Goofy's Kitchen, as well. Would you like more information about enjoying meals with the Disney characters while you're at the resort?   Use the following link to visit the  Disneyland Character Dining page of this website,  in the ""Disneyland Dining"" section.     Simply want to grab some fast food?  Try ""Croc's Bits 'n Bites,""  where such quick-serve favorites such as chicken strips, BBQ sandwiches, burgers and fries are sold. On the other hand,  what's the most ELEGANT restaurant at the Anaheim Disneyland Hotel?  It's Granville's Steak House.   You can find quite a large selection of steaks and beef (eg. prime rib) here, as well as chicken, fish and lobster(!)  Granville's Steak House is also your most expensive dining choice on the Disneyland Hotel property...with entrees running to $35, not including appetizers, drinks or dessert.  You will, however, be rewarded with excellent food and a fine, upscale ambiance.  Notably, kid's meals are reasonably priced at $6--7 (with the children's prime rib plate several dollars more.)  In other words, as far as the kids are concerned, you'll pay no more for them to dine with you than you would at any casual restaurant in town! Breakfast is also served at Granville's Steak House.  You'll find all the ""standards"" here...egg dishes, cereals, pancakes (including  ""Mickey"" pancake for kids!) and French toast. Still another fine dining restaurant at the Disneyland Hotel in Anaheim is Hook's Pointe.   Mesquite grilled entrees are their specialty.  Beef, pork, chicken, fish and shell fish dishes, as well as pasta entrees, are offered here.  As at Granville's Steak House, the Kid's Meals are reasonably priced, around $6, with several selections offered. For further information about dining options at the Disneyland Hotel,  please view both the  Disneyland Hotel Restaurants  and the  Disneyland Character Dining  pages of this website.    Anaheim Disneyland Hotel Address, Directions, and Room Rates     The Anaheim Disneyland Hotel Address is--- 1150 Magic Way Anaheim, CA  92802 The Anaheim Disneyland Hotel phone number--- Phone number of the Disneyland Hotel Operator:  (714) 778-6600 Disneyland Hotel Reservations Telephone Line:  (714) 956-6425 Disneyland Restaurant reservations phone number:  (714) 781- DINE (3463) Map of the Disneyland Hotel area in Anaheim, California--- The Disneyland Hotel in Anaheim is located adjacent to Disneyland Park and Downtown Disney Anaheim.  Although the address for the Disneyland Hotel is actually on Magic Way, the street you'll need to find is Disneyland Drive...which connects with the major Anaheim streets of Katella (on the south) and Ball Road (on the north.) Also, note that you'll find Disneyland Drive called ""West Street"" on older maps.  This segment of West Street was re-named Disneyland Drive in 2001. Don't worry about getting lost...once you've made it onto Disneyland Drive, your eyes will guide you straight to the Disneyland Hotel---the hotel's tall towers stand right out!    You may use the following link to see a    map of the Anaheim Disneyland Hotel area.    To see more Anaheim maps, and to get more detailed driving instructions to the Disneyland Hotel, you can visit  the ""Disneyland Maps"" page of this website. Have you made the decision to stay at the Disneyland Hotel for your accommodations while in Anaheim?   If so, then you'll certainly want to check out the Disneyland Hotel's official web pages if you're seriously interested in making plans to stay at this fine hotel.  The Disney folks have quite a lovely presentation for you at the Disneyland.com site.  To find the Disneyland Hotel pages on this website, you'll want to skip past the main page of the site, which has all sorts of general information...from theme park activities to the resort's ""latest news.""  To skip directly to the Disneyland Hotel info, you may use the following link to see the   Disneyland Hotel section     of the Disneyland.com website. While you're at the hotel's official site, you may check the list of Disneyland Hotel's room rates.  As you'll quickly notice, room rates at the Disneyland Hotel vary widely.  Having a beautiful view of the Never Land Pool and courtyard greenery is going to cost quite a bit more than having a view of the parking lots (tactfully called a ""city view"" on the site!)  You'll also notice that room rates vary a great deal depending on whether or not your trip will be during the school year...or if it will be during the summer vacation time or a major holiday period. You'll also be able to discover rates for Disneyland Hotel packages which include theme park tickets in the deal, as well.

At the base of the tower is the lobby, restaurants, a gift shop, recreational facilities, over 30,000 square feet (3,000 m) for meeting space, and a 7,250-square-foot (670 m) ballroom.   The pool was recently renovated to include a waterslide themed to the  California Screamin'  roller coaster, known as  California Streamin' .

Disney  purchased the property in December 1995 and changed its name to Disneyland Pacific Hotel. As part of the 1998-2001 expansion of the Disneyland Resort, the hotel was re-branded as Disney's Paradise Pier Hotel to complement the themed land the hotel tower overlooks in the adjacent Disney's California Adventure Park. The lobby and convention/banquet facilities have undergone several renovations since the re-branding, most notably in 2004 and 2005.   Hotel guests at one time had an exclusive entrance to Disney's California Adventure Park, located between the Corn Dog Castle and Souvenir 66 in the Paradise Pier section of the park, but it was closed due to low use in 2004. The area is now the site of the expansion of  Disney's Grand Californian Hotel & Spa . Guests may still access the park through the turnstiles located in Disney's Grand Californian Hotel, which are officially exclusive to guests of all Disneyland Resort hotels.     [ edit ]   13th floor   The hotel is one of the few tall buildings in the Western Hemisphere to have a 13th floor. Due to the common superstition of the number 13, most buildings in America skip that number  the floor after 12 is 14, then 15 and so on. This is a result of the original owners being from Japan, where 13 is not considered bad luck. Disney has not since changed this.

The name ""Disneyland Resort"" was coined as a term to use for ALL the attractions in Disney's Anaheim cluster ...and here's what they are--- 1.)  Disneyland Theme Park,  the magical amusement park which ""started it all!"" 2.)  Disney's California Adventure theme park,  a 2nd theme park which was added to the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California in 2001. Rides and attractions celebrate the state of California's terrain and industries...and so THAT'S why it's called ""California Adventure."" 3.)  Downtown Disney District,  a family hot spot that's lined with stores, restaurants and entertainment options. Admission & parking are free...plus the Downtown Disney District stays open later than either of the two theme parks. What's NOT to like? 4.)  The Disneyland Hotel,  Disneyland Anaheim's original hotel. What started out as a one-story motel-like structure several decades ago has evolved into a popular hotel complex consisting of 3 separate high-rise buildings---which nearly always stay full year-round! 5.)  Disney's Grand Californian Hotel,  a new luxurious hotel which was added to the Disneyland Resort in 2001. Guests enjoy a Western lodge-like atmosphere, are pampered with amenities, and even have their own private entrance into the California Adventure theme park! 6.)  Paradise Pier Hotel,  the 3rd and final Disneyland Resort hotel, was purchased from another company rather than built by Disney. Thus, prices are lower; many guests prefer ""real"" Disney magic. Nevertheless, you'd never know that the attractive Paradise Pier Hotel wasn't Disney-built, because it's cute decor and stunning views of the California Adventure theme park make this a wonderful place to stay.

The End of an Era    These 1999 photographs document the last days of the original Disneyland Hotel dating back to October 5th, 1955 when the Hotel first opened for business. I would like to credit Intercot West for these amazing shots that detail certainly a sad time for purists and history buffs of the original Disneyland Hotel. I'll say it again, I think it would have been no trouble at all for Disney to have left one original building standing as an historical site in remembrance of the beginnings of this wonderful facility. Especially considering there is only a grass field where these structures once stood. They could have decorated using 50's furniture and motif. They could have placed pictures on the walls depicting milestones from the Hotel's history. They could have used scale models showing the growth of the Disneyland Hotel. I know of many folks who would have loved to have seen this. I did hear that the original structures were in pretty bad shape though. Some retrofitting and they would have been fine. Now I hear they are talking about bringing down the Towers and building a brand-new Disneyland Hotel. The oldest building on the grounds now dates back to 1962 and what was the Sierra Tower.                         4-19-1999         THE LAST DAY OF ACTIVITY IN THE ORIGINAL FIVE STRUCTURES OF THE DISNEYLAND HOTEL. THE BUILDINGS CLOSED THE NEXT DAY AND DEMOLITION PLANS WERE TAKING SHAPE. SOON THESE BUILDINGS WOULD BE FENCED OFF FROM THE PUBLIC AND NEARLY 44 YEARS OF HAPPY MEMORIES OF WONDERFUL STAYS AT THE ORIGINAL DISNEYLAND HOTEL WOULD BE JUST THAT.....MEMORIES.                         5-9-1999         THE ORIGINAL STRUCTURES ARE STILL IN PLACE BUT THE END IS VERY NEAR. NO ACTIVITY IN ANY OF THE BUILDINGS ALTHOUGH THEIR LIGHTS STILL WORK.                         6-13-1999         THE ORIGINAL STRUCTURES ARE NOW FENCED OFF WITH THEIR LUSH LANDSCAPING REMOVED.....AWAITING DEMOLITION. SOON, A MILLION MEMORIES WILL DISAPPEAR AND A VITAL PIECE OF ANAHEIM HISTORY WILL BE GONE. COULDN'T THEY HAVE LEFT ONE BUILDING UP FOR HISTORICAL SAKE?                         6-30-1999         The buildings have just been demolished with one last piece standing.                         7-14-1999         The buildings have been demolished and only one small piece remains. Wonder why they left this piece up?                         8-19-1999         The last remaining piece has been removed.                         9-8-1999         Now paved over and made into a parking lot. A little under 44 years later and no more original structures remaining from the Original Disneyland Hotel.                         1967 Overhead Shot         A 1967 aerial shot with the disneyland Hotel in the foreground. The new Tower annex had just been opened for about a year when this picture was taken. The Hotel at this time had just over 600 rooms.                         Official Grand Opening, Disneyland Hotel August 25th, 1956    Although the Disneyland Hotel opened for business on October 5th, 1955, the ""official"" grand opening took place in late August of 1956. This was after the Hotel's shops and restaurants were opened and three additional graden structures were added to the grounds. The Hotel now had over 200 rooms, a full slate of shops and restaurants, an Olympic-Size swimming pool and tram service to and from Disneyland Park. The Hotel was near or at capacity nearly every night and was regularly turning away guests due to lack of rooms. This grand opening was a star studded affair and featured some of Hollywood's biggest stars. Walt Disney also attended the festivities himself. Pictures of Helen Alvarez on the grounds are extremely hard to find. She did not regularly show up at the Hotel and in fact, began to feud with the Wrather's almost from the day the Disneyland Hotel opened for business. The partnership (after many litigations) dissolved in early 1958. Souvenirs that have Wrather-Alvarez Hotels stamped on them are certainly the rarest and most valuable of collectible items from the Hotel's past.

The slides have turned to a reddish hue with age. Blog and website reader Dan Cunningham responded by sharpening up the pictures (see below). First let me state, the pictures I posted were scanned in very low resolution so Dan had very little to work with to begin with. He actually stated he only spent a few minutes with the low res images. I think they clearly show how the slide looked when new. You can contact Dan Cunningham at  dcunn74@gmail.com  Illustration & Design 516.817.2970. Thanks Dan for taking the time to do this and send them out to me. I may try and scan these at really high resolution to see what can be done.

You can see what time does to these slides as they all have a red tone to them. I have many more and some in better condition than these. What would help to restore these to normal colors? Photoshop? Any takers to do this out there?

These range from the beginning of the original Disneyland Hotel in the 50's to the demolition in 1999. I had many people ask if the Monorail Station at the Hotel was just revamped and painted for its present location in Downtown Disney. These shots prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that the original station was completely demolished and removed. It is in its exact location but was completely rebuilt in 1999/2000. As soon as I can remember who provided me with these pictures (of the demolition), I will credit them. Right now, I just don't remember. Hope you enjoy this assortment of items.                         Demolition         1999 Demolition of the original Disneyland Hotel                         Sad Shots         No doubt whatsoever.

There were now 234 rooms and suites available at the Disneyland Hotel. As Disneyland grew (Monorail, Matterhorn, Submarines in 1959) so too did the Disneyland Hotel. Although I do not have the exact date of this addition, I do know the structure was built some time between November 1958 and June of 1959. I have a dated photograph showing the building open for business on July 4th, 1959. My guess would be construction started near the first couple of months of the year and was completed by June.                         1959 Overhead         From 1959, showing four North Garden Structures.

The resort is owned and operated by  The Walt Disney Company  through its  Parks and Resorts  division and is home to two theme parks, three hotels and a shopping, dining and entertainment area.   Known simply as  Disneyland  at the time it opened in 1955, the property originally consisted of the theme park built by Walt Disney, its 100-acre (0.40 km 2 ) parking lot, as well as a hotel owned and operated by Disney's business partner  Jack Wrather . Amid a drastic expansion project in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the name  Disneyland Resort  was coined to refer to the entire Disney complex, while  Disneyland Park  was coined to refer to the original theme park.

[ edit ]   History and development     [ edit ]   Concept and construction       Main article:  Disneyland Park (Anaheim) History       Walt Disney's  early concepts for an  amusement park  called for a park called ""Mickey Mouse Park"" located adjacent to the  Walt Disney Studios  in  Burbank  (presently the site of the West Coast headquarters of  ABC ). However, as new ideas emerged, Walt and his brother  Roy  quickly realized that the Burbank location would be too small for the project. The brothers hired a consultant from  Stanford Research Institute  to provide them with information on locations and economic feasibility. The consultant recommended a remote location near  Anaheim , adjacent to the then-under-construction  Santa Ana Freeway . Covered by  Orange County's  namesake orange groves at the time, the consultant correctly predicted that the location would become the population center of Southern California.   Since the location was remote in the 1950s, Walt Disney wanted to build a hotel so that Disneyland guests traveling long distances could stay overnight. However, the park had already depleted Disney's financial resources, so a deal was negotiated with  Hollywood  producer  Jack Wrather  in which Wrather would build and operate a hotel called the  Disneyland Hotel  across the street from Disneyland.     [ edit ]   1955-1998: One park   Though its opening day was disastrous and would later be dubbed ""Black Sunday"", Disneyland became a huge success in its first year of operation. The hotel, which opened 3 months after the park, enjoyed similar success. Walt Disney originally envisioned building more facilities for Disneyland visitors to stay in Anaheim, but since all his financial resources were drained,  entrepreneurs  established their own hotels and other  hospitality industry  businesses in the area surrounding the park and hotel, eager to capitalize on Disneyland's success. To Disney's dismay, the city of Anaheim, eager for the tax revenue generated by more hotels in the city, was lax in restricting their construction, and the area surrounding Disneyland became the atmosphere of colorful lights and flashy neon signs that Disney had wanted to avoid (and which years earlier had caused the city of Burbank to deny Disney's initial request to build his project in Burbank).  [ 1 ]  The city also constructed the  Anaheim Convention Center  across the street from Disneyland's parking lot. Residences were also constructed in the area as part of they city of Anaheim's growth in the late 20th century.   Eventually, Disneyland was ""boxed in"" by these businesses, a factor which would later lead Disney to acquire a significantly larger parcel of land for the construction of  Walt Disney World [ 2 ] . In later years, the Disney company gradually acquired the land west of the park, most notably the Disneyland Hotel in 1989 following Jack Wrather's death in 1984, the Pan Pacific Hotel (now  Disney's Paradise Pier Hotel ) in 1995, and several properties north of the Disneyland Hotel in the mid to late 1990s.     [ edit ]   1990s: Planning an expansion   After Walt's and Roy's deaths in 1966 and 1971, respectively, the Disney company would go on to achieve great success with the multi-park, multi-hotel resort complex business model of  Walt Disney World  in  Florida , which opened in 1971, while continuing to achieve success with the one park, one hotel business model at Disneyland. In the 1990s, however, the sights were set on turning Walt's original park into a multi-park, multi-hotel resort destination as well. (It is well known that  Michael Eisner , Disney's chairman at the time, had heard that most visitors were spending as much as a week at Walt Disney World but only a day at Disneyland. [ citation needed ] ) Publicly known ideas for expansion in California that were never realized included:     In 1991, Disney attempted to garner public support for a project called  Port Disney , to be built in nearby  Long Beach . The proposed project would have been located adjacent to the  RMS Queen Mary , which Disney acquired as a consequence of purchasing the Jack Wrather corporation in 1989 (Disney purchased Wrather in order to acquire the  Disneyland Hotel ), and would have featured a theme park, five hotels, a marina, a shopping and entertainment district, and a cruise ship port. The idea was eventually scrapped due to cost concerns, and parts of the concept would later be incorporated into  Tokyo DisneySea .   Also in 1991, Disney announced plans to build  WestCOT , a theme park similar to  Epcot  in  Florida , on the site of the original Disneyland parking lot. WestCOT would be scrapped in 1995 amid similar cost concerns as well as environmental concerns.   In 1997, Disney was given the opportunity to purchase  Knott's Berry Farm , a competing theme park in nearby  Buena Park , as part of the Knott family's sale of its theme park and specialty food business. Had the sale been completed, Knott's would have been converted into  Disney's America , a project originally proposed for construction in  Haymarket, Virginia  in 1993 but scrapped the next year due to protests from the general public. The Knott family, however, refused to sell to Disney out of fear that Disney would eliminate much of what  Walter Knott  had built, and opted to sell the theme park to  Cedar Fair  instead. Ironically, Cedar Fair eliminated more than what Disney had planned.       See also:  List of never built Disney attractions     The cancellation of the WestCOT project ultimately led to the idea for a California-based theme park to be built on the same site proposed for WestCOT, which would ultimately become  Disney's California Adventure .     [ edit ]   1998-2001: Park becomes resort   Construction began in 1998 and the majority of the Disney property outside of the original park was a construction site until 2001; the interior of Disneyland Park remained largely untouched during this time. Temporary surface parking lots were set up across West Street with tram service to the main entrance to offset the loss of the 100-acre (0.40 km 2 ) parking lot. Parking lots were also set up on smaller parcels of land Disney had acquired east and southeast of the park, primarily used for employee parking as well as guest overflow parking.   Several Disneyland landmarks were demolished during this time, most notably the  marquee  on Harbor Boulevard, whose three versions had stood at the entrance to the Disneyland parking lot since 1958; the last was installed in 1989. Also demolished were all of the Disneyland Hotel's original buildings from 1955, as well as most of the hotel facilities outside of the three guest room towers. The remaining Disneyland Hotel facilities were extensively renovated to replace some of the amenities that were demolished.   Aside from Disney's California Adventure, new construction on the former parking lot included Disney's Grand Californian Hotel and Downtown Disney. A section of the southeast corner of the original parking lot remains in use as a parking area and is a future growth space for California Adventure; since the park's opening, it has had 3 small expansions into this growth space, and a much larger  expansion  slated to begin construction in summer 2008.   Across West Street from Disneyland Park and the construction site of Disney's California Adventure, the six-story Mickey & Friends Parking Structure was built on newly acquired land north of the Disneyland Hotel as the replacement main parking area for the theme parks. The Disneyland Hotel was downsized to accommodate the construction of Downtown Disney and surface parking lots. The Disneyland Pacific Hotel was renovated and re-themed to the area of Disney's California Adventure the hotel tower overlooks, and re-named Disney's Paradise Pier Hotel. Streets were regraded, renamed, re-routed, or outright eliminated, and the traffic pattern to access Disneyland and the Disneyland Hotel by vehicle, widely known among locals and frequent visitors for over 40 years, was altered. Most notably, West Street was  regraded , re-routed near its intersection with Ball Road, and renamed Disneyland Drive between Katella Avenue and Interstate 5.   The construction on the Disney property was accompanied by the city of Anaheim's renovation of the area surrounding Disneyland, now dubbed the  Anaheim Resort . The flashy, colorful neon signs that lined Harbor Boulevardwhich Walt Disney himself had opposed many years earlierwere taken down and replaced with shorter, conforming signs. Freeway onramps and offramps were reconfigured as part of a larger expansion project on  Interstate 5  between  State Route 91  and the  Orange Crush Interchange .     [ edit ]   2001-present: Disneyland Resort   Most construction was completed by early 2001, and Disney's California Adventure held ""preview"" openings in January 2001.  Word of mouth  reviews from those entitled to attend the previews (mostly Disney employees, annual pass holders, and  American Express  card holders) were  largely negative . The park opened to the public amid much fanfare on  February 8 ,  2001 ; however, the negative reviews impacted attendance, and the company's initial attendance projections for the park were never met.   Disney spent much of California Adventure's early years attempting to boost attendance at the park. In the short-term, Disney brought the venerable  Main Street Electrical Parade  to the park, quickly added  Who Wants To Be A Millionaire - Play It! , and offered discounted admission and other promotions aimed at boosting attendance.   In addition to the short-term fixes, long-term projects to address the park's early criticisms have included the permanent addition of  a bug's land  to add attractions geared towards children, and  The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror  as another  E ticket . Some of the park's oft-criticized early attractions were replaced within the first year of operation, most notably  Superstar Limo ,  Disney's Steps in Time , and  Disney's Eureka! - A California Parade .   After Disney's California Adventure's opening, new attractions began appearing at Disneyland Park as well, most notably  The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh  and  Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters , both  carbon copies  of similarly named attractions at the  Magic Kingdom . Other major projects at Walt Disney's original park included a substantial renovation of the nearly 30-year-old (at the time)  Space Mountain , the return of the venerable  Submarine Voyage  as the  Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage , and the introduction of new trains to the  Disneyland Monorail System .   The Resort celebrated the 50th anniversary of Disneyland Park from 2005-2006 in an 18-month celebration known as the  Happiest Homecoming on Earth . This was part of the larger  Happiest Celebration on Earth  promotion at all Disney theme parks. The  Year of a Million Dreams  promotion was the successor to the Happiest Celebration on Earth, and ran from 2006 to the end of 2008. Disney's current promotion, What Will You Celebrate?, began January 1, 2009, and offers free admission to visitors on their birthday.     [ edit ]   Present expansion   In 2007, Disney announced a  US$ 1.1 billion  expansion project  for Disney's California Adventure, including construction of a new land based on the Disney- Pixar  film  Cars , as well as substantially retheming and adding new attractions to existing areas. The project began construction in 2008, and will be completed in phases from 2010-2012.  Disney's Grand Californian Hotel  is currently undergoing an expansion to add  Disney Vacation Club  suites, while the  Disneyland Hotel  is slated for an extensive renovation beginning in the summer of 2008.   There has been widespread speculation since the construction of Disney's California Adventure started that Disney would build a third park in Anaheim, most likely a  water park . Rumored sites for the park have varied from the current Pinocchio oversized vehicle parking area to, more recently, a  strawberry  farm located southeast of the resort property that Disney purchased in 2004. However, Disney CEO  Robert Iger  stated in 2007 that the company's focus is to fix its second park before moving on to a third park.     [ edit ]   Expansion spreads across the world   The expansion of Disneyland into the Disneyland Resort later had a similar effect on its sister properties in  Japan  and  France , both of which also were single parks. In 2001,  Tokyo Disneyland  became  Tokyo Disney Resort  with the addition of  Tokyo DisneySea . The following year,  Walt Disney Studios Paris  was added to  Disneyland Park Paris , and the entire property came to be known as  Disneyland Resort Paris .     [ edit ]   Location   The  Disneyland Resort  is located several miles south of downtown Anaheim, near the border of neighboring  Garden Grove .   The resort is generally bounded by Harbor Boulevard to the east, Katella Avenue to the south, Walnut Street to the west and Ball Road to the north.  Interstate 5  borders the resort at an angle on the northeastern corner. Not all land bordered by these streets is part of the Disneyland Resort, particularly near the intersection of Harbor Boulevard and Katella Avenue, and along Ball Road between Disneyland Drive and Walnut Street. Disneyland Drive cuts through the resort on a north-south route and provides access to the Mickey & Friends Parking Structure, Downtown Disney, and the three hotels. Magic Way connects Walnut Street to Disneyland Drive just south of the Mickey & Friends Parking Structure and provides access to the parking structure, Disneyland Hotel, and Downtown Disney.   Special offramps from Interstate 5 combined with a reversible flyover over the intersection of Ball Road and Disneyland Drive permit easy access into and out of the Mickey & Friends parking garage during peak morning and evening traffic times. The official address of the resort is 1313 South Harbor Boulevard.     [ edit ]   Properties   The Disneyland Resort's main properties include:     Disneyland Park , the original theme park built by Walt Disney, which opened on  July 17 ,  1955 .   Disney's California Adventure , a theme park that celebrates the history and culture of the Golden State, which opened on  February 8 ,  2001 .   Disneyland Hotel , the original hotel built by  Jack Wrather  which opened in October 1955 and was acquired by Disney in 1988.   Disney's Grand Californian Hotel & Spa , based on the craftsman style of architecture of the early 1900s.   Disney's Paradise Pier Hotel , a hotel themed after the section of Disney's California Adventure it overlooks.   Downtown Disney , an outdoor retail, dining and entertainment district located between the entrance promenade of the Disneyland Resort theme parks and the Disneyland Hotel.     Major administration and service properties (other than those integrated into park/hotel facilities) include:     Team Disney Anaheim , the administration building for the Resort that also houses its employment office.   Disneyland Resort Center, an ancillary administration building primarily serving the Hotels of the Disneyland Resort and  Disney's Fairy Tale Weddings & Honeymoons .   Mickey & Friends Parking Structure, the primary parking area for guests of Disneyland Park and Disney's California Adventure.       [ edit ]   Operations     [ edit ]   Transportation   Unlike the  Walt Disney World Resort , all properties at the Disneyland Resort are located within walking distance from each other; therefore, there is very little vehicular transportation between properties.   The  Disneyland Monorail System  transports guests between the Tomorrowland station, inside Disneyland Park, and the Downtown Disney station (formerly known as the Disneyland Hotel station). Admission to Disneyland Park must be purchased to ride the Monorail.   Parking lot trams provide free transportation from  esplanades  located to the west and east of the theme parks' main entrance to the Mickey & Friends Parking Structure, and to the Timon lot with access to the Katella crosswalk Anaheim Convention Center , respectively.   Shuttles to off-site hotels and overflow parking areas pick up and drop off at the esplanade east of the theme parks' main entrance, as well as the esplanade near Downtown Disney and the Disneyland Hotel. Taxis can also be found in these areas.   Public transportation is available from the  Orange County Transportation Authority  (OCTA) and  Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority  (Metro) adjacent the east end of the property, along Harbor Boulevard. OCTA also provides service along the north and south ends of the property, along Ball Road and Katella Avenue, respectively.     [ edit ]   Emergency services     See also:  Incidents at Disney parks     The Disneyland Resort maintains a  private security  staff charged with protecting the company's assets and interests, including controlling access to restricted areas, detaining  shoplifters , enforcing park/resort rules, and imposing and enforcing  trespass  warnings. Most of the time Security officers working in guest areas serve as  de facto  information posts, and also handle guest issues such as lost children and personal property damage. Law enforcement outside the authority of Disneyland Resort Security is the jurisdiction of the Anaheim Police Department (APD), which maintains a regular 24-hour presence at the Resort.   The resort maintains its own private  fire department , called the Disneyland Resort Fire Department (DLFD). DLFD has several  fire trucks  stationed throughout the resort property and has the capability to put out minor structural fires; however, its primary purpose is fire prevention and investigation. Most of the department's operations are behind the scenes; the Main Street Fire House and other  firefighter -themed attractions at the Resort are for show only and are not actually associated with DLFD. The resort also maintains a staff of  nurses  24 hours a day to operate  first aid  stations situated in each park and hotel, as well as to act as first responders to emergency situations that occur away from the first aid stations.   Fire and rescue services beyond the capability of the DLFD and/or the nursing staff are handled by the Anaheim Fire Department (AFD), which has a station just east of the Resort property. AFD also maintains a constant  paramedic  presence at the Resort.

Since many  rides prohibit flash photography, it's worth a shot to see if you can pull  something out of the darkness with your digital Camera.        Whether sitting in a  a darkened ride, or gliding along in the air outside, the imagineering and  artistic director folks at Disneyland lend quite a hand to the set decorations  and ride decor, making the photo opportunities some of the finest for theme park  videography.        While you can easily  capture fantastic photos by just following the signs around Disneyland theme  park, most digital cameras and cell phones have a video function to enjoy. The  quality on these cameras such as ours are average to low. But they are fun  reminders when capturing sights and sounds.       A few of the fun  videos we posted from a recent Disneyland vacation include It's a     It's a Small World video  is a journey around the globe with a simple  song sung around the world in many languages. Little dolls and characters sing  the sing, skate, dance and represent the world's peoples unified in a message of  how small the world is.          Tea Cups video  celebrates the Mad Hatter's Tea Party with a song, A  Merry Un-birthday. Guests hop into teacup shaped ride buckets and spin their  rides faster by turning a wheel inside the ride.  The song plays and  colorful lanterns dangle overhead.          Mary Poppins dances with the Disneyland Band  on Main Street in this  Jolly Holiday performance featuring Disney cast members and world class  musicians.  Entertainers from around the globe have not only visited the  Magic Kingdom but have also performed there.          Astro Obitor  is the latest rendition of Astro Jet, a Disneyland theme  park ride in Tomorrowland. The ride contains a number of rocket ships attached  to the central base. The rockets  move in a cirucular motion out from the  base and spin upwards and down, as well as around.        When you feel  like flying in a pink elephant (sounds like a cocktail drink), maybe you should  think about heading over to Disneyland you'll be taken on a ride. That's the  home of  Dumbo, the Flying  Elephant.                                                                                                                      California Beaches        |              Beach Cities        |          Alphabetical List        |                 Hotel Search        |              Beach P hotos          |                     California E vents        |              Contact Us        |         Site Map        |             Privacy        |        BeachCalifornia.com     content and photos Copyright |  Beach     Travel Planning Resources:           California Shopping        |            California D ining      |       California     Casinos  |                 California Vacations      |            California Coast Vacations      |            California Kids Vacations      |            California Beach Hotels      |            California Beach Vacations      |            California Theme Parks      |            Disneyland Vacations      |                 Surfing Vacation  |            Southern California Vacation       |            California Weekend Getaway      |            California Spa Vacation      |           California Hotels  |  Orange     County California Hotels  |            California Family Vacations      |            California Resorts      |            California Beach Resorts                                                   
clueweb09-en0004-25-26323	          AGH Atari 2600 Review: PHOENIX    by Atari               Phoenix  is one of the very best coin-op  translations that Atari did for the 2600.  The graphics aren't  shabby at all, the sound effects are all there, and the  animations of the wings and swooping of enemy birds is fantastic.     For those not familiar with Phoenix, you're faced with  squadrons of birds who fly down at your land-based cannon,  dipping and soaring while dropping flurries of bombs.  As you  slide horizontally across the screen, you can either shoot down  the winged beasts or protect yourself with a force field.   After four waves of giant birds have been destroyed, you  then get to hammer away at the mother ship by relentlessly  firing at its protective shield and placing a carefully aimed  shot through a revolving window beyond.  Unlike in the arcade  original, however, the mother ship does not send out flocks  of attackers.   Compared to other 2600 games of the genre ( Galaxian ,   Demon Attack ,  Threshold , etc.), Phoenix  is the best of the bunch.  It offers a variety of different waves  and enemies and adds an extra element of strategy with the option  of using your shield.  It also provides the perfect amount of  challenge to keep folks coming back for more.  Cartridges such as  Phoenix and  Ms. Pac-Man  proves that 2600 coin-op ports  need not cause arcade buffs to shudder.  Too bad it followed on the  heels of a slew of piss-poor efforts from Atari (Pac-Man comes  immediately to mind) that it scared away many potential  buyers -- for good.

See  media help .        The dedication to all Disney magic kingdom-style parks begins with the phrase ""To all who come to this happy place, welcome ..."" with the exception of Magic Kingdom Park in Florida. The dedication there begins ""Walt Disney World is a tribute to the philosophy and life of Walter Elias Disney ...""     [ edit ]   History     [ edit ]   Concept and construction           Sleeping Beauty Castle       The concept for Disneyland began one Sunday, when Walt Disney was visiting  Griffith Park  with his daughters Diane and Sharon. While watching his daughters ride the Griffith Park Merry-Go-Round he came up with the idea of a place where adults and their children could go and have fun together. His dream would lie dormant for many years. [ 3 ]  Walt Disney's father helped build the grounds of the  1893 World's Fair  in  Chicago . This perhaps gave Disney the creative spark whence Disneyland originated. The fairgrounds for the World's Fair were a cheaply constructed set of individual ""Country"" areas from around the world and areas representing various time periods of man, it also included many ""rides"" including the first Ferris wheel, sky ride, a passenger train that circled the perimeter, Wild West Show, etc. Although the 1893 World's Fair was meant only to last a summer in Chicago,in Southern California the weather was accommodating to a ""Fair Grounds"" of stucco buildings that would otherwise disintegrate in the rain, snow and ice of other climates. One can see the resemblance of a ""Land"" filled with ""rides"" and a fair grounds with differently themed areas to the Disneyland created 60 years later in the 1950s as the population of America for the first time shifted West into desert climes. See  [2] .   While many people had written letters to  Walt Disney  about visiting the  Disney Studio  Walt realized that a functional movie studio had little to offer to the visiting fans. He then began to foster ideas of building a site near his  Burbank  studios for tourists to visit. His ideas then evolved to a small play park with a boat ride and other themed areas. Walt's initial concept, his ""Mickey Mouse Park"", started with an 8 acres (0.012 sq mi; 0.032 km 2 ) plot across Riverside Drive.   Walt started to visit other parks for inspiration and ideas, including  Tivoli Gardens ,  Greenfield Village ,  Playland  and  Children's Fairyland . He started his designers working on concepts, but these would grow into a project much larger than could be contained in 8 acres (32,000 m 2 ).   Walt hired a consultant, Harrison Price from  Stanford Research Institute , to gauge the area's potential growth. With the report from Price, Disney acquired 160 acres (0.250 sq mi; 0.647 km 2 ) of orange groves and walnut trees in Anaheim, southeast of  Los Angeles  in neighboring  Orange County . [ 4 ]   Difficulties in obtaining funding prompted Disney to investigate new methods of fund raising. He decided to use television to get the ideas into people's homes, and so he created a show named  Disneyland  which was broadcast on the then fledgling  ABC  television network. In return, the network agreed to help finance the new park. For the first five years of its operation, Disneyland was owned by  Disneyland, Inc. , which was jointly owned by  Walt Disney Productions  and  ABC . In 1960 Walt Disney Productions purchased ABC's share. In addition, many of the shops on Main Street, U.S.A. were owned and operated by other companies who rented space from Disney.   Construction began on  July 18 ,  1954  and would cost  USD$ 17 million to complete and was opened exactly one year later.  U.S. Route 101  (later  Interstate 5 ) was under construction at the same time just to the north of the site; in preparation for the traffic which Disneyland was expected to bring, two more lanes were added to the freeway even before the park was finished [ citation needed ] .

Disneyland Park was opened to the public on Monday,  July 18 ,  1955 . However, a special ""International Press Preview"" event was held on Sunday,  July 17 ,  1955  which was only open to invited guests and the media . The Special Sunday events, including the dedication were televised nationwide and anchored by three of Walt Disney's friends from Hollywood:  Art Linkletter ,  Bob Cummings , and  Ronald Reagan . ABC broadcast the event live on its network; at the time, it was one of the largest and most complex live broadcasts ever.   The event did not go smoothly. The park was overcrowded as the by-invitation-only affair was plagued with counterfeit tickets. All major roads nearby were empty. The temperature was an unusually high 101 F (38 C), and a plumbers' strike left many of the park's drinking fountains dry. Disney was given a choice of having working fountains or running toilets and he chose the latter. This, however, generated negative publicity since  Pepsi  sponsored the park's opening; enraged guests believed the inoperable fountains was a cynical way to sell more soda. The asphalt that had been poured just that morning was so soft that ladies' high-heeled shoes sank in. Vendors ran out of food. A gas leak in Fantasyland caused Adventureland, Frontierland, and Fantasyland to close for the afternoon. Parents were throwing their children over the shoulders of crowds to get them onto rides such as the  King Arthur Carrousel .   The park got such bad press for the event day that Walt Disney invited members of the press back for a private ""second day"" to experience the true Disneyland, after which Walt held a party in the  Disneyland Hotel  for them. Walt and his 1955 executives forever referred to the day as ""Black Sunday"". On  July 17  every year, cast members wear pin badges stating how many years it has been since  July 17 ,  1955 . For example, in 2004 they wore the slogan "" The magic began 49 years ago today ."" But for the first twelve to fifteen years, Disney did officially state that opening day was on  July 18 , including in the park's own publications. Disneyland referred to July 17th, 1955 as ""Dedication Day"" in one of its July, 1967 press releases.   On Monday,  July 18  crowds started to gather in line as early as 2 a.m., and the first person to buy a ticket and enter the park was David MacPherson with admission ticket number 2, as  Roy O. Disney  arranged to pre-purchase ticket number 1. Walt Disney had an official photo taken with two children instead, Christine Vess Watkins (age 5 in 1955) and Michael Schwartner (age 7 in 1955), and the photo of the two carries a caption along the lines of ""Walt Disney with the first two guests of Disneyland."" Vess Watkins and Schwartner both received lifetime passes to Disneyland that day, and MacPherson was awarded one shortly thereafter, which was later expanded to every single Disney-owned park in the world.   In September 1959, Soviet Premier  Nikita Khrushchev  spent 13 days in the United States. He had two requests: To visit Disneyland and to meet  John Wayne , Hollywood's  top box-office draw . Security concerns prevented Khruschev's Disneyland visit; he responded by publicly wondering whether  missiles  were hidden there. Walt Disney was reportedly upset, having been denied showing Khrushchev his submarine fleet, which was among the largest in the world at the time.     [ edit ]   1990s transition: Park becomes Resort          Disney's California Adventure       In the late 1990s, work began to expand on the one-park, one-hotel property. Disneyland Park, the Disneyland Hotel and the site of the original parking lot as well as acquired surrounding properties were earmarked to become part of a greater vacation resort development. The new components of this resort were to be another theme park,  Disney's California Adventure Park ; a shopping, dining and entertainment complex,  Downtown Disney ; a remodeled  Disneyland Hotel ; Disney's Grand Californian Hotel; and the acquisition of the Pan Pacific Hotel (later to be remodeled and renamed  Disney's Paradise Pier Hotel ). Because the existing parking lot (south of Disneyland) was built upon by these projects, the six-level 10,250 space ""Mickey and Friends"" parking structure was constructed in the northwest corner of the property, the largest parking structure in the United States.          Downtown Disney       The park's management team of the mid-1990s was a source of controversy among Disneyland fans and employees. In an effort to boost profits, various changes began by then-executives  Cynthia Harriss  and  Paul Pressler . While their actions provided a short-term increase in shareholder returns, they drew widespread criticism from employees and guests alike for the lack of foresight. With the retail background of Harriss and Pressler, Disneyland's focus gradually shifted from attractions to merchandising. Outside consultants  McKinsey & Co  were also brought in to help streamline operations, which resulted in many changes and cutbacks. After nearly a decade of deferred maintenance, Walt Disney's original theme park was showing visible signs of neglect. Fans of the park decried the perceived decline in customer value and park quality and rallied for the dismissal of the management team. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Disneyland in the 21st Century   Matt Ouimet , formerly the president of the  Disney Cruise Line , was promoted to assume leadership of the Disneyland Resort in late 2003. Shortly afterward, he selected  Greg Emmer  as Senior Vice President of Operations. Emmer is a long-time Disney cast member who had worked at Disneyland in his youth prior to moving to Florida and holding multiple executive leadership positions at the  Walt Disney World  Resort. Ouimet quickly set about reversing certain trends, especially with regards to cosmetic maintenance and a return to the original  infrastructure  maintenance schedule, in hopes of restoring the safety record of the past. Much like Walt Disney himself, Ouimet and Emmer could often be seen walking the park during business hours with members of their respective staff. They wore cast member name badges, stood in line for attractions and welcomed comments from guests.   In July 2006, Matt Ouimet announced that he would be leaving The Walt Disney Company to become president of  Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide . Soon after this announcement,  Ed Grier , executive managing director of Walt Disney Attractions Japan, was named president of the Disneyland Resort. Greg Emmer retired from his job on  February 8 ,  2008 .     [ edit ]   50th anniversary       Main article:  Happiest Homecoming on Earth       The Happiest Homecoming on Earth was the eighteen-month-long celebration (held through 2005 and 2006) of the fiftieth anniversary of the Disneyland theme park, which opened on  July 17 ,  1955 . The Happiest Celebration on Earth commemorated fifty years of Disney theme parks, and celebrated Disneyland's milestone throughout Disney parks all over the globe. In 2004, the park undertook a number of major renovation projects in preparation for its fiftieth anniversary celebration. Many classic attractions were restored, notably  Space Mountain ,  Jungle Cruise , and  Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room . The 50th Anniversary celebration ended on  September 30 ,  2006 .     [ edit ]   Park layout          August, 1963 view from NW to SE. Anaheim's newly completed Melodyland Theater (""theater-in-the-round"") at the top. The ""Santa Ana Freeway"" (I-5) upper left corner. Harbor Blvd. forms the eastern boundary of Disneyland Park.       The park is divided into realms, which radiate like the four cardinal points of the compass from Central Plaza, and well-concealed backstage areas. On entering a realm, a guest is completely immersed in the environment and is unable to see or hear any other realm. The idea behind this was to develop theatrical ""stages"" with seamless passages from one land to the next. [ 5 ]  The public areas occupy approximately 85 acres (0.133 sq mi; 0.344 km 2 ). When the park initially opened, it consisted of five themed areas:     Main Street, U.S.A. , an early 20th century  Midwest  town   Adventureland , featuring  jungle -themed adventures   Frontierland , illustrating western  frontier   Fantasyland , bringing  fantasy  into a reality   Tomorrowland , looking into the future.     Since the initial opening, additional areas have been added:     In 1957,  Holidayland , a 9 acres (0.014 sq mi; 0.036 km 2 ) recreation area including a  circus  and  baseball diamond , which was closed in late 1961.   In 1966,  New Orleans Square , based on 19th century  New Orleans   In 1972, ""Bear Country"", themed to the mountain forests of the  South . It was later renamed  Critter Country  and themed around  Splash Mountain 's  Song of the South  elements.   In 1993,  Mickey's Toontown , themed around the  Toontown  seen in the film  Who Framed Roger Rabbit     An elevated  berm  supports a  narrow gauge railroad  which circumnavigates the park. Disney's California Adventure Park was added in what used to be a Disneyland parking lot.     [ edit ]   Lands of Disneyland       Main articles:  List of current Disneyland attractions  and  List of past Disneyland attractions         [ edit ]   Main Street, U.S.A.          Main Street USA.       Main Street, U.S.A.  is patterned after a typical midwest town of the early 20th century. Walt Disney derived inspiration from his boyhood town of  Marceline, Missouri  and worked closely with designers and architects to develop the Main Street appeal. It is the first area guests see when they enter the park, and is how guests reach Central Plaza. At the center of The Magic Kingdom and immediately North of Central Plaza stands  Sleeping Beauty Castle , which provides entrance to Fantasyland by way of a drawbridge across a moat. Adventureland, Frontierland, and Tomorrowland are arrayed on both sides of the castle.          For those of us who remember the carefree time it recreates, Main Street will bring back happy memories. For younger visitors, it is an adventure in turning back the calendar to the days of grandfather's youth.                  Walt E. Disney         Main Street, U.S.A. is reminiscent of the Victorian period of Americana with the train station, town square, movie theatre, city hall, firehouse complete with a steam-powered pump engine, emporium, shops, arcades, double-decker bus, horse-drawn streetcar, jitneys and other bits of memorabilia. At the far end of Main Street, U.S.A. is  Sleeping Beauty Castle , and the Hub, which is a portal to all the themed lands.   The design of Main Street, U.S.A. utilizes a process to give the appearance of height called  forced perspective , frequently used in movies. Buildings down Main Street are built at 3/4 scale on the first level, then 5/8 on the second story, and 1/2 scale on the third.     [ edit ]   Adventureland          Adventureland provides a 1950s view of adventure, capitalizing on the post-war Tiki craze.       Adventureland  is designed to be an exotic tropical place in a far-off region of the world. ""To create a land that would make this dream reality"", said Walt Disney, ""we pictured ourselves far from civilization, in the remote  jungles  of Asia and Africa."" Attractions include opening day's  Jungle Cruise , the ""Temple of the Forbidden Eye"" in  Indiana Jones Adventure , and  Tarzan's Treehouse , which is a conversion of the earlier  Swiss Family Robinson Tree House  from the Walt Disney film,  Swiss Family Robinson .  Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room  which is located at the entrance to Adventureland is the first feature attraction to employ  Audio-Animatronics , a computer synchronization of sound and robotics.     [ edit ]   New Orleans Square          The Haunted Mansion is patterned after a Southern plantation home.         Main article:   New Orleans Square     New Orleans Square is a themed land based on 19th century  New Orleans . It was opened to the public on  July 24 ,  1966 . Despite its age, it is still very popular with Disneyland guests, being home to two of the park's most popular attractions:  Pirates of the Caribbean  and  Haunted Mansion . Hidden in the walkway near the Blue Bayou Restaurant, there is a doorway with the number 33 beside it. This is the entrance to a private members-only club inside Disneyland, that members pay high amounts of money to get into.  Club 33  is the only place in Disneyland proper to have alcoholic beverages.     [ edit ]   Frontierland   Frontierland  recreates the setting of pioneer days along the  American frontier . According to Walt Disney, ""All of us have cause to be proud of our country's history, shaped by the pioneering spirit of our forefathers. Our adventures are designed to give you the feeling of having lived, even for a short while, during our country's pioneer days."" Frontierland is home to the  Pinewood Indians  band of animatronics Native Americans, who live on the banks of the  Rivers of America . Entertainment and attractions include  Fantasmic! ,  Big Thunder Mountain Railroad ,  Mark Twain Riverboat , Frontierland Shootin' Exposition and  Sailing Ship Columbia . May 2007 featured the opening of ""Pirate's Lair at Tom Sawyer Island"". Frontierland is also home to the  Golden Horseshoe Saloon , a show palace straight out of the Old West. Currently the comedic troupe "" Billy Hill and the Hillbillies "" entertain guests on a daily basis.     [ edit ]   Critter Country          Splash Mountain is a combination log flume and dark ride attraction at three Walt Disney Parks, based on the 1946 Disney film Song of the South.       Critter Country  opened in 1972 as ""Bear Country"", and was renamed in 1988. Formerly the area was home to Indian Village where actual indigenous tribespeople demonstrated their dances and other customs. Today, the main draw of the area is  Splash Mountain , a log-flume journey inspired by the Uncle Remus stories of Joel Chandler Harris and the animated segments of Disney's Academy Award-winning 1946 film,  Song of the South . In 2003, a  dark ride  called  The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh  replaced the  Country Bear Jamboree , which closed in 2001. The Country Bear Jamboree presented shows featuring singing bear characters that were visualized through electronically-controlled and mechanically-animated puppets, known as Audio-Animatronics.     [ edit ]   Fantasyland                 Fantasyland  is the area of Disneyland which Walt Disney said, ""What youngster has not dreamed of flying with  Peter Pan  over moonlit  London , or tumbling into Alice's nonsensical  Wonderland . In Fantasyland, these classic stories of everyone's youth have become realities for youngsters - of all ages - to participate in."" Fantasyland was originally styled in a medieval European fairground fashion, but its 1983 refurbishment turned it into a  Bavarian  village. Attractions include several  dark rides , the  King Arthur Carrousel , and various children's rides.     [ edit ]   Mickey's Toontown          Mickey's Toontown.       Mickey's Toontown  opened in 1993 and was partly inspired by the fictional Los Angeles suburb of Toontown in The Walt Disney Studios' 1988 release  Who Framed Roger Rabbit . Mickey's Toontown is a 1930s cartoon come-to-life and is home to Disney's most popular cartoon characters. Toontown features two main attractions:  Gadget's Go Coaster  and  Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin . The ""city"" is also home to cartoon character's houses such as the house of  Mickey Mouse  and  Minnie Mouse .     [ edit ]   Tomorrowland       Main article:  Tomorrowland              Tomorrowland after its 1998 refurbishment       During the 1955 inauguration Walt Disney dedicated Tomorrowland with these words: ""Tomorrow can be a wonderful age. Our scientists today are opening the doors of the  Space Age  to achievements that will benefit our children and generations to come. The Tomorrowland attractions have been designed to give you an opportunity to participate in adventures that are a living blueprint of our future.""   Disneyland producer  Ward Kimball  had  Rocket scientists   Wernher von Braun , Willy Ley, and Heinz Haber served as technical consultants during the original design of Tomorrowland. [ 6 ]  Initial attractions included  Rocket to the Moon , Astro-Jets and  Autopia ; later, the first incarnation of the  Submarine Voyage  was added. The area underwent a major transformation in 1967 to become  New Tomorrowland , and then again in 1998 when its focus was changed to present a ""retro-future"" theme reminiscent of the illustrations of  Jules Verne .   Current attractions include  Space Mountain ,  Innoventions ,  Star Tours ,  Honey, I Shrunk the Audience ,  Autopia , the  Disneyland Monorail  Tomorrowland Station, Astro Orbitor and  Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters .  Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage  opened on  June 11 ,  2007 , resurrecting the original Submarine Voyage which closed in 1998.     [ edit ]   Theatrical analogy   Disneyland staff use  theatrical  terminology. This is to emphasize that a visit to the park is intended to be similar to witnessing a performance. For example, visitors are referred to as  Guests  and park employees as  Cast Members .  On Stage  refers to any area of the Resort that is open to Guests.  Backstage  refers to any area of the Resort that is closed to Guests. A crowd is referred to as an ""audience.""  Costume  is the attire that Cast Members who perform the day-to-day operations of the park must wear. Terms such as  uniform  are not used.  Show  is the Resort's presentation to its Guests, such as the color and faades of buildings, placement of rides/attractions, costumes to match the themed lands. Each Cast Member's job is called his ""Role."" When working in their roles, Cast Members must follow a ""Script."" This is not a traditional play script, but more of a strict code of conduct and approved, themed phrase-ology that Cast Members may use when at work. Park employees were often reminded that ""no"" and ""I don't know"" are not a part of a Cast Member's script. When signing credit card receipts for souvenirs or food, Guests are asked for their  autograph . ""Stage Managers"" are responsible for overseeing the operation of the different areas of the park. Cast Members who are in charge of a specific team are called ""Leads,"" as in a film or theater ""Lead Role."" In the earlier years of the park, the offices where administrative work took place were referred to as ""Production Offices."" ""Production Schedulers"" build employee work schedules to meet the necessary workload, while ""Stage Schedulers"" handle day-to-day changes in that work schedule (such as a change in park hours, necessitating a change in everybody's shifts).     [ edit ]   Backstage   Backstage areas include closed areas of attraction, store, and restaurant buildings, as well as outdoor service areas located behind such buildings. Although some areas of the park, particularly New Orleans Square, have underground operations and storage areas, there is no park-wide network of subterranean tunnels, such as Walt Disney World's  utilidors .   There are several points of entry from outside the park to the backstage areas: Ball Gate (from Ball Road), T.D.A. Gate (adjacent to the Team Disney Anaheim building), Harbor Pointe (from Harbor Boulevard), and Winston Gate (from Disneyland Drive).   Berm Road encircles the park from Firehouse Gate (behind the Main Street Fire Station) to Egghouse Gate (adjacent to the Disneyland Opera House). The road is so called because it generally follows outside the path of Disneyland's  berm . A stretch of the road, wedged between Tomorrowland and Harbor Boulevard, is called Schumacher Road. It has two narrow lanes and runs underneath the Monorail track. There are also two railroad bridges that cross Berm Road: one behind City Hall and the other behind Tomorrowland.   Major buildings backstage include the  Frank Gehry -designed  Team Disney Anaheim , where most of the division's administration currently works, as well as the Old Administration Building, behind Tomorrowland. The Old Administration Building additionally houses the Grand Canyon and Primeval World dioramas visible on the Disneyland Railroad.   The northwest corner of the park is home to most of the park's maintenance facilities, including:     Company vehicle services, including Parking Lot trams and Main Street Vehicles   Scrap yard, where the Resort's garbage and recyclables are sorted for collection   Circle D Corral, where the Resort's horses and other animals are stabled   Parade float storage and maintenance   Distribution center for all Resort merchandise   Ride vehicle service areas   Paint shop   Sign shop     Backstage also refers to parts of show buildings that are normally not seen by guests. Backstage areas are generally off-limits to park guests. This prevents guests from seeing the industrial areas that violate the ""magic"" of on-stage and keeps them safe from the potentially dangerous machinery. Cast members can also find some solace while they work or rest, as backstage offers alternate routes between the park's various areas.   Many attractions are housed in large, soundstage-like buildings, some of which are partially or completely disguised by external theming. Generally, these buildings are painted a dull green color in areas not seen by guests; ostensibly, this choice has been made to help disguise the buildings among the foliage and make them less visually obtrusive. Most of them have off-white flat roofs that support HVAC units and footpaths for cast members. Inside are the rides, as well as hidden walkways, service areas, control rooms, and other behind-the-scenes operations. Photography is forbidden in these areas, both inside and outside, although some photos have found their way to a variety of web sites. Guests who attempt to explore backstage are warned and often escorted from the property.   The boundary between on and off-stage is demarcated at every access point. Everything within guest view when a door or gateway is open is also considered on stage. It is from this point, that characters start playing their part. That way, when the door is open, guests will not accidentally see a person out of character backstage.   Various amenities exist for Cast Members backstage when they are on breaks, or before and after their scheduled shifts. A number of cafeterias, now run by Sodexho, offer discounted meals throughout the day. These include Inn Between (behind the Plaza Inn), Eat Ticket (near the Team Disney Anaheim building behind Mickey's Toontown), and Westside Diner (located in a lower level beneath New Orleans Square).  Partners Federal Credit Union , the credit union for employees of The Walt Disney Company in Orange County, provides nearly 20 ATMs backstage for cast member use and maintains an express branch at the Team Disney Anaheim building.     [ edit ]   Transportation   Walt Disney had a longtime interest in transportation, and trains in particular. He even built a miniature  live steam   backyard railroad , the "" Carolwood Pacific Railroad "", on the grounds of his  Holmby Hills  estate. Throughout all the iterations of Disneyland during the seventeen or so years when Mr. Disney was conceiving it, one element remained constant: a train encircling the park. [ 7 ]  The primary designer for the park transportation vehicles was  Bob Gurr  who gave himself the title of ""Director of Special Vehicle Design"" in 1954.     [ edit ]   Disneyland Railroad          Disneyland Railroad engine #2.           Main article:  Disneyland Railroad       Encircling Disneyland and providing a grand circle tour is the Disneyland Railroad (DRR), a short-line railway consisting of five oil-fired and steam-powered locomotives, in addition to three passenger trains and one passenger-carrying freight train. Originally known as the Disneyland and Santa Fe Railroad, the DRR was presented by the  Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway  until 1974. From 1955 to 1974, the Santa Fe Rail Pass was able to be used in lieu of a Disneyland ""D"" coupon. With a three-foot gauge, the most common  narrow gauge  measurement used in North America, the track runs in a continuous loop around The Magic Kingdom through each of its realms. Each turn-of-the-19th-Century train departs Main Street Station on an excursion that includes scheduled station stops at: Frontierland Station; Toontown Depot, the gateway to Fantasyland; and, Tomorrowland Station. The Grand Circle Tour then concludes with a visit to the "" Grand Canyon / Primeval World "" dioramas before returning passengers to Main Street, U.S.A.     [ edit ]   Disneyland Monorail System          The original red Mark I ALWEG Monorail train, with one car added, and then designated Mark II. Both trains were created especially for Disneyland. The other train was identical, but blue color. Seen at the Disneyland Hotel station, in August, 1963           Main article:  Disneyland Monorail System       One of Disneyland's signature attractions is its  monorail  service, which opened in Tomorrowland in 1959 as the first daily-operating monorail train system in the  Western Hemisphere . The monorail guideway has remained almost exactly the same since 1961, aside from small alterations while Indiana Jones Adventure was being built. Five generations of monorail trains have been used in the park, since their lightweight construction means they wear out quickly. The most recent operating generation, the Mark VII, was installed in 2008. The monorail shuttles visitors between two stations, one inside the park in Tomorrowland and one in Downtown Disney. It follows a 2.5 mile (4 km) long route designed to show the park from above. Currently, the Mark VII is running with the colors Red and Blue with one more color to be added in the coming months.          Monorail Blue travels over the former Submarine Voyage ride which is now the Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage in Tomorrowland.       The monorail was originally built with one station in Tomorrowland. Its track was extended and a second station opened at the  Disneyland Hotel  in 1961. With the creation of Downtown Disney in 2001, the new destination is Downtown Disney, instead of the Disneyland Hotel. The physical location of the monorail station did not change, however the original station building was demolished as part of the hotel downsizing, and the new station is now separated from the hotel by several Downtown Disney buildings, including  ESPN Zone  and the  Rainforest Caf .     [ edit ]   Main Street vehicles          Main Street at Disneyland as seen from a Horseless Carriage.       All vehicles that are found on Main Street were designed to accurately reflect turn-of-the-century vehicles, including a  double-decker bus , a horse-drawn  streetcar , a fire engine, and an automobile. They are available for one-way rides along Main Street, U.S.A. The horseless carriages are modeled after cars built in 1903. They are two-cylinder, four-horsepower (3 kW) engines with manual transmission and steering. Walt Disney used to drive the fire engine around the park before it opened, on most mornings. It has also been used to host celebrity guests and used in the parades.     [ edit ]   Disneyland Helipad          A Los Angeles Airways Sikorsky S-61 lands with the Matterhorn visible in the background       From the late 1950s to 1968  Los Angeles Airways  provided regularly scheduled helicopter passenger service between Disneyland and  Los Angeles International Airport  (LAX) and other cities in the area. The helicopters initially operated from Anaheim/Disneyland Heliport, located behind Tomorrowland. Service later moved, in 1960, to a new heliport north of the Disneyland Hotel. [ 8 ]  Arriving guests were transported to the Disneyland Hotel via tram. The service ended after a fatal crash in  Paramount, California, on May 22, 1968  killed 23 (the worst helicopter accident in aviation history at that time) and another in  Compton, California on August 14, 1968  killed 21. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Live entertainment   In addition to the attractions, Disneyland provides live entertainment throughout the park.     [ edit ]   Characters   Disney characters, who greet visitors, interact with children, and pose for photos, can be found throughout the park. Some characters have specific areas where they are scheduled to appear, but can be found wandering as well. One reason  Mickey's Toontown  was created was so that there would be a place for Mickey Mouse to always be available to guests in his own house.   Periodically through recent decades (and most recently during the summers of 2005 and 2006), Mickey Mouse has climbed the  Matterhorn  attraction several times a day with the support of his friends Minnie,  Goofy , and some Disneyland guests. Other mountain climbers could also be seen on the Matterhorn from time to time. As of Spring 2007, Mickey and his ""toon"" friends no longer climb the Matterhorn but the climbing program continues.     [ edit ]   Daily ceremonies   Every evening at dusk since the September 11th 2001 attacks, there is a military-style flag ceremony to lower the  American Flag  for the day, performed by a regiment of the Disneyland Security Personnel. The ceremony usually begins at 4:30pm.     [ edit ]   The Disneyland Band   The Disneyland Band, which has been part of the park since its opening, plays the role of the Town Band on Main Street, U.S.A. It also breaks out into smaller groups like the Main Street Strawhatters, the Hook and Ladder Co., and the Pearly Band in  Fantasyland .     [ edit ]   Fantasmic!   Fantasmic!  is a popular multimedia nighttime show hosted by  Mickey Mouse  which debuted in 1992. The presentation is made at the Laffite's Tavern end of Pirate's Lair at Tom Sawyer Island and uses the Rivers of America as part of the stage. It uses Frontierland and New Orleans Square as the spectator arena.   It consists of synchronized lighting and special effects, with floating barges, the Mark Twain Riverboat, the Sailing Ship Columbia, fountains, lasers, fireworks, thirty-foot-tall ""water screens"" upon which animated scenes are projected, and an automated forty-five foot fire-breathing dragon.     [ edit ]   Fireworks          Disneyland Fireworks from Sleeping Beauty Castle       Elaborate fireworks shows synchronized with Disney songs and often an appearance by the  Peter Pan  character  Tinker Bell . Recent presentations have become more elaborate, featuring new pyrotechnics, launch techniques and story lines. In 2004, Disneyland introduced a new air launch pyrotechnics system, reducing ground level smoke and noise and decreasing negative environmental impacts. At the time the technology debuted, Disney announced it would donate the patents to a non-profit organization for use throughout the industry.

Dreams Come True     During the Holiday Season, there is a special fireworks presentation called  Believe... In Holiday Magic  which has been running since 2000, except for a short hiatus in 2005 during the park's 50th Celebration.     [ edit ]   The Golden Horseshoe Revue   The Golden Horseshoe Saloon offers a live stage show with a frontier or  old-west  feel. The Golden Horseshoe Revue is an old-west Vaudeville type of show starring Slue Foot (or Sluefoot) Sue and Pecos Bill. It ran until the mid-1980s, when it was replaced by a similar show starring Lily Langtree (or Miss Lily) and Sam the Bartender. Most recently,  Billy Hill and the Hillbillies  have played their  guitars  and  banjos  in a bluegrass-and-comedy show.   Additionally, in front of the Golden Horsehose Saloon, The Laughing Stock Co. enacts small humorous skits with an old-west theme.     [ edit ]   Parades   Disneyland has always had parades that have marched down Main Street. There are several daytime and nighttime parades that celebrate Disney films or seasonal holidays with characters, music, and large floats. One of the most popular parades was the  Main Street Electrical Parade  (now at Disney's California Adventure as Disney's Electrical Parade).   Debuting in May 5, 2005 as part of the Disneyland's 50th Anniversary, and running through November 7, 2008,  Walt Disney's Parade of Dreams  was presented, celebrating several of the classic Disney stories including  The Lion King ,  The Little Mermaid ,  Alice in Wonderland , and  Pinocchio . During the Christmas season, Disneyland presents ""A Christmas Fantasy"" Parade which celebrates the joy & wonder of the Christmas season.   In 2009,  Walt Disney's Parade of Dreams  will be replaced by Celebrate! - A Street Party which will premiere on March 27th, 2009.     Current Parades :    A Christmas Fantasy Parade  (3rd week of November - 1st week of January)   Celebrate! - A Street Party (Beginning March 27, 2009)           [ edit ]   Tomorrowland Terrace   The  Tomorrowland Terrace  is a stage in Tomorrowland. It is a two-story stage where the lower stage rises from below with dramatic effect. It was popular in the 1960s with music performers of the day. Over the years, it was eventually replaced with Club Buzz, a  Buzz Lightyear  themed stage and show featuring the space character from the  Toy Story  movies. In 2006, it was restored to the Tomorrowland Terrace with the same style and design as the original. It is now home to the  Jedi Training Academy  interactive stage show where children are chosen as  Jedi   padawan  and taught how to use a  Lightsaber . Each child then has the opportunity to face  Star Wars  antagonists  Darth Vader  or  Darth Maul . Recently, local bands have returned to play in the evenings, just as Tomorrowland Terrace hosted in the 1960s.     [ edit ]   Other performers   Various other unscheduled street performers play and sing throughout the park, sometimes only seasonally, including:     The All-American College Band performs around the park. The band is composed of talented college students who audition for the chance to perform in Disneyland;   Alice in Wonderland  characters staging a wacky game of ""Musical Chairs"" either at ""Coke Corner"" or the porch of the Plaza Inn daily;   The Bootstrappers, a band of pirates that performs songs based on  Pirates of the Caribbean , along with other sea-shanties;   The  Dapper Dans barbershop quartet  often sings on Main Street;   The  Firehouse Five Plus Two , originally a band composed of  Imagineers , can be found on Main Street;   The Main Street Piano Players play at Corner Cafe, also known as ""Coke Corner"" on Main Street;   Merlin  appears in Fantasyland several times a day to help a lucky child pull  the sword from an anvil and stone ;   The Trash Can Trio, a  STOMP  like group that performs using trashcans in Tomorrowland; and   Various bands in New Orleans Square, often with a  jazz  influence.     Also, during the Holidays, many other smaller entertainment offerings are added, such as the Main Street Carolers who perform throughout the day.     [ edit ]   Tickets   From Disneyland's opening day until 1982, the price of the attractions was in addition to the price of park admission. [ 11 ]  Park-goers paid a small admission fee to get into the park, but admission to most of the rides and attractions required purchase a book of tickets that consisted of several coupons, initially labeled ""A"" through ""C"". The coupons were also sold individually. ""A"" coupons allowed admission to the smaller rides and attractions such as the vehicles on Main Street, whereas ""C"" coupons were used for the most common attractions like the Peter Pan ride, or the Tea Cups. As more thrilling rides were introduced, such as the Monorail or the Matterhorn bobsled, ""D"" and then eventually ""E"" coupons were introduced. Coupons could be combined to equal the equivalent of another ticket (e.g. two ""A"" tickets equal one ""B"" ticket). From the thrill ride experience at Disneyland, the colloquial expression ""an  E ticket  ride"" is used to describe any exceptionally thrilling experience.          Disneyland ticket book circa 19751977. The tickets are actually printed as ""coupons"".       Later Disneyland featured a ""Keys to the Kingdom"" booklet of tickets, which consisted of 10 unvalued coupons sold for a single flat rate. These coupons could be used for any attraction regardless of its regular value. Obviously it would behoove the buyer to use these for the most thrilling attractions or rides.   In 1982 Disney dropped the idea for individual ride tickets to a single admission price with unlimited access to all attractions, "" except shooting galleries "" . [ 12 ]  While this idea was not original to Disney, its business advantages were obvious: in addition to guaranteeing that everyone paid a large sum even if they stayed for only a few hours and rode only a few rides, the park no longer had to print tickets or ticket books, staff ticket booths, or provide staff to collect tickets or monitor attractions for people sneaking on without tickets.   Later Disney introduced other entry options such as multi-day passes, Annual Passes which allow unlimited entry to the Park for an annual fee and Southern California residents' discounts.

[ 13 ]     [ edit ]   Accidents, injuries and deaths       Main article:  Incidents at Disney parks#Disneyland Resort       Since the park's opening in July 1955, there have been numerous accidents, injuries, and deaths at the park. As of December 2006, 13 guests and 1 Cast Member have died inside the park, while over 100 guests have been injured.     [ edit ]   Trivia   In 1957, actor  Don DeFore  and his brother Verne were the only sole proprietors ever permitted by  Walt Disney  and Disneyland to operate an independent business and restaurant inside Disneyland. From 1957-1962, they operated Don DeFore's Silver Banjo Barbecue Restaurant in Frontierland. [ 14 ]   [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Closures   Disneyland Park has had three unscheduled closures since it opened in 1955     In 1963 due to  President Kennedy's assassination .   In 1970 due to a demonstration by  Yippies  in August. The stated reason for the attack was because  Bank of America  -- a sponsor of Disneyland -- was allegedly financing the  Vietnam War , which the Yippies opposed. [ 16 ]  The park had attempted to run as usual but the demonstrators accosted guests and raised the South Vietnam flag at Tom Sawyer's Island, forcing Disneyland to close in the afternoon, offering refunds and free passes to guests.   Following the terrorist attacks of  September 11, 2001 , both of the resort's parks did not open for the day.     Additionally, Disneyland has had numerous planned closures included:     In the early years, the park was often scheduled to be closed on Mondays and Tuesdays during the off-season. [ 17 ]  This was in conjunction with nearby  Knott's Berry Farm , which closed on Wednesdays and Thursdays to keep costs down for both parks, while offering Orange County visitors a place to go 7 days a week.   On  May 4 ,  2005  for the 50th Anniversary Celebration media event. [ 18 ]   Due to various special events, the park has closed unusually early to accommodate them, such as, special press events, tour groups, VIP groups, private parties, etc. It is common for a corporation to rent the entire park for the evening. The corporation's guests would be issued special passes, which were good for admission to all rides and attractions. In the late afternoon, park employees would announce that the park was closing, then clear the park of everyone without the special corporate passes.       [ edit ]   Management   Past presidents include  Jack Lindquist  (19901993),  Paul Pressler  (19942002),  Cynthia Harriss  (20022003), and  Matt Ouimet  (20032006). The current president since July 2006 is  Ed Grier .

""Euro Disney"" redirects here. For the company that owns and operates Disneyland Resort Paris, see  Euro Disney S.C.A. .   Disneyland Resort Paris  is a  holiday  and  recreation   resort  in  Marne-la-Valle , a  new town  in the eastern suburbs of  Paris ,  France . The complex is located 32 kilometers (20 mi) from the  centre of Paris  and lies for the most part on the territory of the  commune  of  Chessy .   Disneyland Resort Paris features two  theme parks , an  entertainment  district and seven  Disney -owned  hotels . Operating since April 12, 1992, it was the second  Disney resort  to open outside the  United States  (following  Tokyo Disney Resort ), and the first to be owned and operated by Disney. With 15.3 million visitors in the fiscal year of 2008, it is one of  Europe 's leading tourist destinations.   Disneyland Resort Paris is owned and operated by French company  Euro Disney S.C.A. , a  public company  of which 39.78% of its  stock  is held by The Walt Disney Company, 10% by the Saudi  Prince Alwaleed  and 50.22% by other  shareholders . The resort is run by  chairman  and  CEO  Philippe Gas.   The complex was a subject of  controversy  during the periods of negotiation and construction, when a number of prominent French figures voiced their opposition and  protests  were held by French  labour unions  and others. A further setback followed the opening of the resort as park attendance, hotel occupancy and revenues fell below projections. Partly as a result of this, the complex was renamed from  Euro Disney Resort  to  Disneyland Paris  in 1995. In July of that year, the company saw its first quarterly profit.   A second theme park,  Walt Disney Studios Park , was opened to the public on March 16, 2002.

Upon the leadership of  E. Cardon Walker ,  Tokyo Disneyland  opened in 1983 in  Japan  with instant success, forming a catalyst for international expansion.   In late 1984 the heads of Disney's theme park division, Dick Nunis and Jim Cora, presented a list of approximately 1,200 possible European locations for the park. [ 1 ]   By March 1985, the number of possible locations for the park had been reduced to four; two in France and two in  Spain . [ 2 ]  Both of these nations saw the potential  economic  advantages of a Disney theme park and competed by offering financing deals to Disney. [ 3 ]   Both Spanish sites were located near the  Mediterranean Sea  and offered a  subtropical  climate similar to Disney's parks in  California  and  Florida . Disney had also shown interest in a site near  Toulon  in southern France, not far from  Marseille . The pleasing landscape of that region, as well as its  climate , made the location a top competitor for what would be called Euro Disneyland. However, thick layers of  bedrock  were discovered beneath the site, which would render construction too difficult. Finally, a site in the rural town of  Marne-la-Valle  was chosen because of its proximity to  Paris  and its central location in  Western Europe . This location was estimated to be no more than a four-hour drive for 68 million people and no more than a two-hour flight for a further 300 million.          In December 1990,  Espace Euro Disney  enabled the public to preview the complex.       Michael Eisner , Disney's  CEO  at the time, signed the first letter of agreement with the  French government  for the 20-square-kilometer (4,940-acre) site in December 1985, and the first financial contracts were drawn up during the following spring. Construction began in August 1988, and in December 1990, an information centre named ""Espace Euro Disney"" was opened to show the public what was being constructed. Plans for a theme park next to Euro Disneyland based on the entertainment industry,  Disney-MGM Studios Europe , quickly went into development, scheduled to open in 1996 with a construction budget of US$2.3 billion. [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Hotels, recreation and restaurants   In order to control a maximum of the  hotel  business, it was decided that 5,000 Disney-owned hotel rooms would be built within the complex. In March 1988, Disney and a council of  architects  ( Frank Gehry ,  Michael Graves ,  Robert A.M. Stern ,  Stanley Tigerman  and  Robert Venturi ) decided on an exclusively American theme in which each hotel would depict a region of the  United States . At the time of the opening in April 1992, seven hotels collectively housing 5,800 [ 5 ]  rooms had been built. By the year 2017, Euro Disney, under the terms specified in its contract with the  French government , will be required to finish constructing a total of 18,200 hotel rooms at varying distances from the resort. [ 6 ]   An entertainment, shopping and dining complex based on Walt Disney World's  Downtown Disney  was designed by Frank Gehry. With its towers of  oxidised  silver and bronze-coloured  stainless steel  under a canopy of lights, it opened as  Festival Disney . [ 7 ]          Euro Disney Resort's initial  cast members  pose.       For a projected daily attendance of 55,000, Euro Disney planned to serve an estimated 14,000 people per hour inside the Euro Disneyland park. In order to accomplish this, 29  restaurants  were built inside the park (with a further 11 restaurants built at the Euro Disney resort hotels and 5 at Festival Disney).  Menus  and prices were varied with an American flavour predominant and Disney's precedent of not serving  alcoholic beverages  was continued in the park. 2,100  patio  seats (30% of park seating) were installed to satisfy Europeans expected preference of eating outdoors in good weather. In  test kitchens  at Walt Disney World,  recipes  were adapted for European tastes. Walter Meyer, executive  chef  for menu development at Euro Disney and executive chef of food projects development at Walt Disney World noted, A few things we did need to change, but most of the time people kept telling us, Do your own thing. Do whats American. [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Recruitment   Unlike Disney's  American   theme parks , Euro Disney aimed for permanent employees (an estimated requirement of 12,000 for the theme park itself), as opposed to seasonal and temporary  part-time  employees. Casting centres were set up in Paris,  London ,  Amsterdam , and  Frankfurt  in an effort to reflect the multinational aspect of Euro Disneys visitors. However, it was understood by the French government and Disney that a concentrated effort would be made to tap into the local French labour market [ 1 ] . Disney sought workers with sufficient communication skills, spoke two European languages (French and one other), and were socially outgoing. Following precedent, Euro Disney set up its own  Disney University  to train workers. 24,000 people had applied by November 1991. [ 1 ]     [ edit ]   Controversies          a horror made of cardboard, plastic and appalling colours, a construction of hardened chewing gum and idiotic folklore taken straight out of comic books written for obese Americans. [ 9 ]                The prospect of a Disney park in France was a subject of  debate  and  controversy . Critics, who included prominent French  intellectuals , denounced what they considered to be the  cultural imperialism , or neoprovincialism of Euro Disney and felt it would encourage in France an unhealthy American type of  consumerism . For others, Euro Disney became a symbol of America within France. On June 28, 1992 a group of French  farmers   blockaded  Euro Disney in protest of farm policies the United States supported at the time. A journalist in the French newspaper  Le Figaro  wrote, I wish with all my heart that the rebels would set fire to [Euro] Disneyland."" [ 10 ]   Ariane Mnouchkine , a Parisian  stage director , named the concept a cultural  Chernobyl ; [ 11 ]  a phrase which would be echoed in the  media  and grow synonymous with Euro Disney's initial years.   In response, French  philosopher   Michel Serres  noted, It is not America that is invading us. It is we who adore it, who adopt its fashions and above all, its words. Euro Disney S.C.A.'s then-chairman Robert Fitzpatrick responded, ""We didnt come in and say O.K., were going to put a  beret  and a  baguette  on  Mickey Mouse . We are who we are."" [ 1 ]   Topics of controversy further included Disney's American managers requiring English to be spoken at all meetings and Disney's appearance code for members of staff, which listed regulations and limitations for the use of  make up ,  facial hair ,  tattoos ,  jewellery  and more. French  labour unions  mounted protests against the appearance code, which they saw as an attack on individual liberty. Others criticised Disney as being insensitive to French culture, individualism, and privacy, because restrictions on individual or collective liberties were illegal under  French law , unless it could be demonstrated that the restrictions are requisite to the job and do not exceed what is necessary. Disney countered by saying that a ruling that barred them from imposing such an employment standard could threaten the image and long-term success of the park. For us, the appearance code has a great effect from a product identification standpoint, said Thor Degelmann, Euro Disneys personnel director and a native Californian. Without it we couldnt be presenting the Disney product that people would be expecting. [ 12 ]     [ edit ]   Opening day           Michael Eisner  announces,  Et maintenant je dclare Euro Disneyland officiellement ouvert (And now I declare Euro Disneyland officially open).       On April 12, 1992,  Euro Disney Resort  and its theme park,  Euro Disneyland , officially opened. Visitors were warned of chaos on the roads and a government survey indicated that half a million people carried by 90,000 cars might attempt to enter the complex. French radio warned traffic to avoid the area. By midday, the parking lot was approximately half full, suggesting an attendance level below 25,000. Speculative explanations ranged from people heeding the advice to stay away to the one-day strike that cut the direct  RER  railway connection to Euro Disney from the centre of Paris. [ 10 ]     [ edit ]   Financial, attendance and employment problems   In May 1992, entertainment magazine  The Hollywood Reporter  reported that about 25% of Euro Disney's workforce  approximately 3,000 men and women  had resigned their jobs because of unacceptable working conditions. It also reported that the park's attendance was far behind expectations. Euro Disney S.C.A. responded in an interview with  The Wall Street Journal , in which Robert Fitzpatrick claimed only 1,000 people had left their jobs.   In response to the financial situation, Fitzpatrick ordered that the Disney-MGM Studios Europe project would be put on hiatus until a further decision could be made. Prices at the hotels were reduced.   Despite these efforts, in May 1992 daily park attendance was around 25,000 (some reports give a figure of 30,000) instead of the predicted 60,000. The Euro Disney Company stock price spiralled downwards and on July 23, 1992, Euro Disney announced an expected net loss in its first year of operation of approximately 300 million  French francs . During Euro Disney's first winter, hotel occupancy was such that it was decided to close the  Newport Bay Club  hotel during the season. Initial hopes were that each visitor would spend around US$33 per day, but near the end of 1992, analysts reckoned spending to be around 12% lower. [ 13 ]   Efforts to improve attendance included serving alcoholic beverages with meals inside the Euro Disneyland park, in response to a presumed European demand, which began June 12, 1993. [ 14 ]   In January 1994, Sanford Litvack, an  attorney  from  New York City  and former Assistant Attorney General during the  Jimmy Carter  presidency, was assigned to be Disney's lead  negotiator  regarding Euro Disney's future. On February 28, Litvack made an offer (without the consent of Eisner or  Frank Wells ) to split the debts between Euro Disney's creditors and Disney. After the banks showed interest, Litvack informed Eisner and Wells. On March 14, the day before the annual  shareholders  meeting, the banks capitulated to Disney's demands. The  creditor  banks bought US$500 million worth of Euro Disney shares, forgave 18 months of  interest  and deferred interest payments for three years. Disney invested US$750 million into Euro Disney and granted a five-year suspension of royalty payments. In June that same year,  Saudi Arabian  Prince Al-Waleed Bin Talal Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud cut a deal whereby the Walt Disney Company bought 51% of a new US$1.1 billion share issue, the rest being offered to existing shareholders at below-market rates, with the Prince buying any that were not taken up by existing shareholders (up to a 24.5% holding).   In 2002, Euro Disney S.C.A. and the Walt Disney Company announced another annual profit for Disneyland Resort Paris. However, it has incurred a net loss in the three years following, and the park is approximately US$2 billion in debt as of 2007. In 2005, the Walt Disney Company agreed to write-off all debt to the Walt Disney Company made by Euro Disney S.C.A.     [ edit ]   1995 turnaround          The year 1995 marked the opening of  Space Mountain - De la Terre  la Lune  and an increase in attendance.       On May 31, 1995, a new attraction opened at the theme park.  Space Mountain - De la Terre  la Lune  had been planned since the inception of Euro Disneyland, but was reserved for a revival of public interest. With a redesign of the attraction (which had premiered at Walt Disney World's  Magic Kingdom  in 1975) including a ' cannon '  launch  system and an on-ride  soundtrack , the US$100 million attraction was dedicated in a ceremony attended by  celebrities  such as  Elton John ,  Claudia Schiffer  and  Buzz Aldrin .   On July 25, 1995, Euro Disney S.C.A. reported its first ever quarterly profit of US$35.3 million. On November 15, the results for the  fiscal year  ending September 30 were released; in one year the theme park's attendance had climbed from 8.8 million to 10.7 million  an increase of 21%. Hotel occupancy had also climbed from 60 to 68.5%. After debt payments, Disneyland Paris ended the year with a net profit of US$22.8 million.     [ edit ]   Name changes   Disneyland Resort Paris and its assets have been subject to a number of name changes, initially an effort to overcome the negative publicity that followed the inception of Euro Disney.   Michael Eisner noted,          As Americans, the word Euro is believed to mean glamorous or exciting. For Europeans it turned out to be a term they associated with business, currency, and commerce. Renaming the park Disneyland Paris was a way of identifying it with one of the most romantic and exciting cities in the world.

[ edit ]   The complex   Disneyland Resort Paris encompasses 4,800 acres (19 km 2 ) [ 16 ]  and contains theme parks, resort hotels, a golf course and a railway station.     [ edit ]   Theme parks          On April 12 2007, Disneyland Resort Paris celebrated its 15th anniversary.       Main articles:  Disneyland Park (Paris)  and  Walt Disney Studios Park   The  Disneyland Park  is based on a  formula  pioneered by  Disneyland  in  California  and further employed at the  Magic Kingdom  in  Florida  and  Tokyo Disneyland  in  Japan . Occupying 566,560 m (140  acres ), it is the largest Disney park based on the original in California.   On March 16, 2002, the  Walt Disney Studios Park  opened its doors to the public. At 270,000 square metres, it is a continuation on an earlier, never realised concept; the Disney-MGM Studios Europe.   The April 2007 issue of trade magazine  Park World  reported the following  attendance estimates  for 2006 compiled by Economic Research Associates in partnership with TEA (formerly the  Themed Entertainment Association ):     Disneyland Park, 10.6 million visits (No. 5 worldwide);   Walt Disney Studios, 2.2 million visits.       [ edit ]   Other recreation          An aerial view of Disney Village (centre),  Lake Disney  (right) and a fragment of Disneyland Park (top left)       Main articles:  Disney Village  and  Golf Disneyland   The  Disney Village  entertainment district contains a variety of restaurants, bars, shops, Buffalo Bill's Wild West Dinner Show, and other venues and stays open after the parks close.   Golf Disneyland  features 9-hole and 18-hole courses.     [ edit ]   Hotels          Disney's Sequoia Lodge.       The complex features seven Disneyland Resort Paris hotels. The  Disneyland Hotel  is located over the entrance of the Disneyland Park and is marketed as the most prestigious hotel on property. A body of water known as  Lake Disney  is surrounded by  Disney's Hotel New York ,  Disney's Newport Bay Club  and  Disney's Sequoia Lodge .  Disney's Hotel Cheyenne  and  Disney's Hotel Santa Fe  are located near Lake Disney,  Disney's Davy Crockett Ranch  is located in a woodland area outside the resort perimeter.   Disneyland Resort Paris includes six Associated Hotels which are not managed by Euro Disney S.C.A. but provide free shuttle buses to the parks:  Marriott 's Village d'lle-de-France,  Radisson  SAS Hotel, a  Holiday Inn  Hotel, Vienna International Dream Castle Hotel,  MyTravel 's Explorers Hotel and a Kyriad Hotel.     [ edit ]   Transport   A  railway station ,  Marne-la-Valle - Chessy , with connection to the suburban  RER  network and the  TGV  high-speed rail network is located between the theme parks and Disney Village.  Thalys  no longer operates from Marne-la-Valle train station, but there are daily services from  London  on the  Eurostar . On June 10, 2007, a new TGV line,  LGV Est , began service between Paris and Strasbourg.   Free shuttle buses provide transport to all Disney hotels (except Disney's Davy Crockett Ranch) and Associated Hotels.     [ edit ]   References       ^  a   b   c   d   Lainsbury, Andrew (2000).

Six Flags President and Chief Executive Officer Mark Shapiro said the deal could involve more than a theme park, including the possibility of a first-ever Six Flags branded hotel and spa resort, in the newly-developing Qatar Entertainment City, a mixed-use project near Lusail, Qatar.    Shapiro and representatives of the Qatari company Oryx Holdings and other officials signed deals this morning to create the anchor plans for a fully-integrated, family entertainment destination that will include hotels, a mall, restaurants, attractions and a waterfront location.    Six Flags will provide concept development and planning services to Oryx for the creation of a 500,000 square foot Six Flags-branded park that could be a small theme park, a water park or a hybrid. The concept still is under development. The park should open in 2012. Six Flags will not own the property or put up any capital money, but could wind up managing and operating the park.    This is the second Middle Eastern project that New York-based Six Flags has announced this year, following a Dubai theme park. Orlando-based Universal Parks & Resorts and Busch Entertainment Corp. also are building parks in Dubai.    ""It's very exciting for us,"" Sharpiro said in an interview with the  Orlando Sentinel . ""International expansion is a big part of our overall company strategy. But also it signals the reemergence of our brand. We've spent three years fixing up the company, turning it around, and we're not just finding traction but finding a great deal of interest overseas from cities and companies looking to develop different regions into tourist destinations.""

Earlier this month, top executives from Walt Disney World, Universal Orlando and SeaWorld Orlando met with the county official who oversees hotel-tax collections to find out how much money could be freed up to boost advertising efforts.    The delegation -- which included Disney World President Meg Crofton and Universal Orlando President Bill Davis -- did not formally ask for more cash, which would need County Commission approval.    But the possibilities that the industry has discussed range from squeezing an extra $1 million or so from the Orange County Convention Center's budget to dipping into the county's $130 million hotel-tax reserve.

Universal Parks & Resorts called the planned new ride, to be developed in partnership with Hasbro Inc. and DreamWorks Pictures, ""a mega-attraction."" It would fuse 3D-high definition media, special effects and robotics with a ride system that will ""transform perceptions of theme park experiences,"" according to a Universal news statement.    The rides are scheduled to make their debuts first at Universal Studios Singapore and then at Universal Studios Hollywood, both prior to summer, 2011. Joe Curley, spokesman for Universal Parks & Resorts, said there are no immediate plans for a Transformers ride in Orlando, where the company is currently developing a new music-themed roller coaster and a whole area themed for the popular Harry Potter books and movies.

The major theme parks regulate their own ride-safety programs, but they report basic details of serious ride injuries, usually defined as requiring at least 24 hours in a hospital, to the Florida Bureau of Fair Rides Inspection.    In the latest quarterly reports, obtained by the Orlando Sentinel, Walt Disney World listed eight ride incidents and Universal Orlando two during July, August and September. SeaWorld Orlando, Busch Gardens Tampa Bay and Wet 'n Wild reported no incidents.    More  here .

Chances are they'll be on their way to theme parks somewhere.    Jacksonville-based Sally Corp. announced today that it signed a deal with Scholastic Media to design and market Goosebumps rides based on the worldwide funny-scary books franchise. At right is one concept provided to Sally by Scholastic.    Goosebumps is a global brand, with more than 350 million books sold in 32 languages, worldwide retail sales, a popular TV show now airing on Cartoon Network, a best-selling home video series and a highly trafficked website. The brand also is debuting a full range of consumer products this fall including a multi-platform interactive video game, new DVDs, audio books and costumes.    Sally Corp. is a designer and manufacturer of dark ride adventuresinteractive, non-interactive, black light and 3-D. The company initially made its name with animatronic characters; creating realistic, fantasy and cartoon characters for clients worldwide.    Sally Corp. CEO John Wood said the company would design rides on two different scales, to appeal to both large and small parks.    The Goosebumps concept is absolutely a natural for dark rides, Wood stated in a news release. Incorporating black-light and 3-D elements into the rides will add tremendous excitement and fun to the ride experience.""

Rounding out the top five were Phantom Fright Nights at Kennywood in Pittsburgh; Universal Studios-Hollywoods Halloween Horror Nights; and Howl-O-Scream at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay.    The same survey also named ""The 13th Gate"" in Baton Rouge, La., as the nations top haunted house. None of the top 13 haunted houses in the survey are in Florida.

InBev announced this morning that its shareholders voted to approve the acquisition of all the shares of St. Louis-based Anheuser-Busch Companies, Inc. for $70 per share, at the companys extraordinary general meeting.  InBev reported that shareholders voted overwhelmingly in favor of the combination.      Shareholders also approved the name change of InBev to Anheuser-Busch InBev and the appointment of Anheuser-Busch president August A. Busch IV as a director of the company, both effective upon closing of the transaction.      Finally, the shareholders also authorized the InBev board to proceed with the capital increase required to finance $9.8 billion of the estimated $52 billion transaction.    That's the action that leaves the future of Busch Entertainment Corp. and its theme parks, including SeaWorld, Aquatica, Discovery Cove and Busch Gardens-Tampa Bay, in question. InBev has said, without specifics, that to raise capital it may divest its non-core businesses -- widely assumed to include the theme parks. Busch Entertainment just moved its headquarters to Orlando, from St. Louis, this summer.    The InBev purchase of Anheuser-Busch remains subject to approval by Anheuser-Busch shareholders and regulatory clearance in a number of jurisdictions.  InBev stated that it continues to expect that it will complete the transaction by the end of 2008.

""We had a tough inaugural season, what with the economy and everything,"" said company spokesman Jim Olecki.    Hard Rock Park,  which opened with a reported $400 million price tag last March, filed for voluntary chapter 11 bankruptcy. Olecki said the company hopes to be able to restructure its debts and reopen in the spring.    Hard Rock Park Holding Co.'s roots run so deep in Orlando the park has been called Orlando's eighth theme park. The name is licensed by Orlando-based Hard Rock Cafe International. Its three principal founders all are from Orlando, with backgrounds with Orlando theme parks. And many of the designers, architects, engineers and vendors are Orlando-based. Above at left, one of the park's big rides, Maximum RPM! is shown under construction last year.     But what the company faced was trying to launch a regional theme park in bad and worsening economic conditions. Its situation might be a bit of a harbinger for what the economy can do to the tourism economy.    ""It was just poor timing,"" Olecki said. ""You have volatility in the financial markets. The fuel cost. All of that impacted the tourism market tremendously not only Myrtle Beach but nationally; tourists are scaling back their vacation plans. On top of that, the frozen credit markets that we're hearing so much about severely limited our ability to line up loans and our other planned finances.""

The SeaWorld fund announced Monday it is providing $5,000 to the Instituto ORCA in Brazil's Esprito Santo state after a massive stranding of Magellanic penguins along the coast there, and another $5,000 in emergency funding to The International Bird Rescue Rehabilitation Center to help save an unusually high number -- hundreds -- of brown pelicans with hook, tackle and line injuries.       Above at left, volunteers in Brazils Espirito Santo State continue their work in rehabilitating more than 140 rescued Magellanic penguins. Numerous birds were found with oiled feathers, while others were starving and dehydrated. Some scientists believe that warming ocean waters are moving the birds food sources elsewhere. In North America, the pelicans, migrating north from Mexico through Southern California, are becoming entangled in fishing gear as they feed on sardines and anchovies near the same piers and wharfs as local anglers in Santa Cruz, Calif.   Above at right, a photo shows two such orphaned gorillas that will be cared for at the center that the Disney conservation fund is supporting with a $50,000 donation plus in-kind services. Disney announced Monday that construction should begin later this month of the first center in eastern Africa designed to rescue, rehabilitate and reintroduce orphaned gorillas back into the wild. The gorilla center, initiated by The Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International  will also include a conservation education and public information program. The new center is projected to hold up to 30 eastern lowland (Grauers) and mountain gorillas and will be located on 370 acres of land within a 1,235-acre forested area near the Tayna Nature Reserve, seen at left.    The Disney fund will provide money for initial operating expenses for the facility. In addition, experts from Disneys Animal Programs will provide materials and in-kind services to assist with development and construction of the center, help relocate the current orphaned gorillas and provide educational opportunities for students and the community.

Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio, and Schlitterbahn Water Park in New Braunfels, Texas, both repeated as overall-champions, as Best Amusement Park and Best Water Park. SeaWorld Orlando also was a repeat winner overall-champ, as Best Marine Life Park.    That was the only award SeaWorld Orlando garnered in the 2008 Golden Tickets, the 11th annual.

Here are the details:        Where are the panels located?        The Walt Disney Company has installed two sets or arrays of solar panels atop of Sound Stage 2 and a major walk-way at The Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, CA.        How do the solar panels work?         This solar technology installed at The Walt Disney Studios operates in real time, meaning that the panels do not store energy. The sunlight (energy) is received and converted into electricity immediately. The electricity coming out of the solar power system is connected to a system that distributes power to various buildings and outlets.        Why is renewable energy important to Disney?        Disney sees great value in using renewable energy and other environmentally-friendly technology, such as solar power, to reduce humansdependence on fossil fuels and other limited resources. Investments such as these will eventually reduce the costs of renewable energy technologies, ensuring that more people can afford them.        Will Disney install more solar panels in the future?        The Walt Disney Company considers these installations to be pilot initiatives that will help us learn more about the process of solar installation, how well the system operates over the long-term, reliability of the system, and if the electronics are meeting expectations. The time needed for making this evaluation is at least two years, which will allow us to see how well system functions and to assess any impacts on the system sustained over time. After that, Disney will assess the benefit of future projects with special attention given to the financial feasibility of such systems.

For Discovery Communications Inc., that means closing stores. Discovery, best known for its more than 100 television networks including Discovery Channel and Animal Planet, announced last month it will close its 103 mall-based and standalone stores and lay off 1,000 employees, 25% of its work force. y eliminating our owned and operated brick-and-mortar storefronts, which are cost-intensive and complicated businesses, Discovery can focus its efforts on high-growth, e-commerce and licensing operations,says David Zaslav, who took over as president and CEO of Discovery in January. Consumers will still be able to buy Discovery productsncluding DVDs of its hit TV series Planet Earth and such specialty items as telescopes and a radio-controlled hammerhead shark for swimming pool funn retail stores. Discovery Communications will continue to sell Animal Planet-related items at 550 Toys Us stores and has a deal with Hudson Group to operate seven Discovery Channel Airport Stores in U.S. airports. But the company will put its focus on selling merchandise via the Internet, television and catalog. The primary web site, DiscoveryStore.com, gets 12 million unique visitors a year, and e-commerce sales are up 144% this year over last, the company says.       Guide to Retail Web Site Design & Usability     Discovery says it posted record e-commerce growth and sales last year, but does not disclose those results. Internet Retailer estimates that Discovery Communications had $45.8 million in Internet sales in 2006, placing it No. 186 in the Internet Retailer Top 500 Guide, a 34% increase over $34.2 million in 2005. Discovery decision does not mean many other retailers will close their stores, says analyst Patti Freeman Evans of JupiterResearch. t just means they have never quite gotten the return from their physical stores they had hoped,she says. She notes that other media companies have launched store chains and then backed off.

Stalling )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search              Carl Stalling       Birth name   Carl W. Stalling       Born   November 10, 1891 ( 1891-11-10 )       Origin   Lexington ,  Missouri       Died   November 29, 1972 (aged 81)       Genre(s)   Film score ,  Soundtrack       Occupation(s)   Composer ,  Arranger       Instrument(s)   Piano ,  Theater organ       Years active   1928 - 1958       Label(s)   Warner Bros.       Carl W. Stalling  (November 10, 1891  November 29, 1972) was a noted American  composer  and  arranger  of music for animated  cartoons . He is most closely associated with the  Looney Tunes  shorts produced by  Warner Bros. , where he worked, averaging one complete score each week, for twenty-two years.   Stalling was born and grew up in  Lexington, Missouri . He started playing piano at six. By the age of 12, he was the principal piano accompanist in his hometown's  silent movie  house. By the time he was in his early twenties, he was conducting his own orchestra and improvising on the organ at the legendary Isis Movie Theatre in  Kansas City . During that time, he met and befriended a young  Walt Disney  who was producing animated comedy shorts in  Kansas City . Stalling composed several early cartoon scores for  Walt Disney , including  Plane Crazy  and  Gallopin' Gaucho  in 1928, (but not  Steamboat Willie , Disney's first released sound short). Early discussions with Disney about whether the animation or the musical score should come first led to Disney creating the "" Silly Symphonies "" series of cartoons. These cartoons allowed Stalling to create a score which Disney handed to his animators. While there, Stalling pioneered the use of ""bar sheets"" which allowed the musical rhythms to be sketched out simultaneously with the  storyboards  for the animation. He left Disney after only two years, at the same time as animator  Ub Iwerks . Finding few outlets in New York, Stalling rejoined Iwerks at his own studio in California, while freelancing for Disney and others. In 1936, when Iwerks was hired by  Leon Schlesinger , who was under contract to produce animated shorts for Warner Bros., Stalling went with him to become a full-time cartoon music composer, with full access to the expansive Warner Bros. catalog and musicians. He remained with Warner Bros. until his retirement in 1958. His last cartoon was  To Itch His Own , a cartoon directed by  Chuck Jones  which featured the world's strongest flea, the Mighty Angelo.   Stalling was consistently an innovator. He was the first music director to extensively use the  metronome  to time film scores. He was one of three composers, along with  Max Steiner  and  Scott Bradley , credited with the invention of the  click track . His stock-in-trade was the ""musical pun"", where he used references to popular songs, or even classical pieces, to add a dimension of humor to the action on the screen. Working with legendary directors  Tex Avery ,  Bob Clampett ,  Friz Freleng ,  Robert McKimson , and  Chuck Jones , he developed the ""Looney Tunes"" style of very rapid and tightly coordinated musical cues, punctuated with both instrumental and recorded  sound effects , and occasionally reaching into full blown musical fantasies such as  The Rabbit of Seville  and  A Corny Concerto .   Stalling was a master at quickly changing musical styles based on the action in the cartoon. His  arrangements  were very complicated and technically demanding. The music itself served both as a background for the  cartoon , and provided musical sound effects. The titles of the music often described the action, sometimes forming jokes for those familiar with the tunes. Some examples are listed below:     A beautiful woman sashaying into a room would be accompanied by "" You Must Have Been a Beautiful Baby "".   A drunken character would stagger to "" How Dry I Am ,"" "" Little Brown Jug ,"" or a slow-tempo "" Shuffle Off to Buffalo "".   Any scene in which food was prominently featured called for the  Joseph Meyer  composition, ""A Cup of Coffee, A Sandwich, And You""   A football team would scrimmage to "" Freddie the Freshman "".   An  establishing shot  of a home, such as Elmer's cabin in  Rabbit Seasoning , would be accompanied by "" There's No Place Like Home "".   An establishing shot of a character waking up would be accompanied by  Edvard Grieg 's "" Morning Mood "".   Sudden wealth or good fortune demanded  Harry Warren 's ""We're in the Money"" (Warners' Gold Diggers' Song) or  Harry M. Woods ' ""I'm Looking Over a Four-Leaf Clover"".   The vaguest reference to ""going West"" or exiting called forth a breakneck rendition of  Buddy DeSylva 's "" California, Here I Come "".   Any scene depicting complex mechanical processes would have  Raymond Scott 's "" Powerhouse "" playing.     Stalling made extensive use of the many works of Raymond Scott, whose music was licensed by Warner Bros. in the early 1940s.   Jones and the other Looney Tunes directors sometimes complained about Stalling's proclivity for  musical quotation  and punning. His contemporaries, especially Scott Bradley, were considered more ""serious"", writing more original melodies and utilizing more high-brow compositional methods. In an interview, Jones complained: ""He was a brilliant musician. But the quickest way for him to write a musical score [...] was to simply look up some music that had the proper name. If there was a lady dressed in red, he'd always play ""The Lady in Red."" If somebody went into a cave, he'd play ""Fingal's Cave."" If we were doing anything about eating, he'd do 'A Cup of Coffee, A Sandwich, and You.' I had a bee one time, and my God if he didn't go and find a piece of music written in 1906 or something called ""I'm a Busy Little Bumble Bee."" (Adamson, quoted in Goldmark, p. 22)   Nevertheless, Stalling is remembered today for setting music to cartoons that have remained wildly popular to this day, and are often remembered  for  their musicality. His scores are heard constantly, both in re-runs of classic cartoons, and recycled in new  Looney Tunes  compilations and features such as  Looney Tunes: Back in Action .   Noted film critic  Leonard Maltin , on one of the special segments of the DVD series  Looney Tunes Golden Collection , pointed out that listening to the soundtracks of the Warner cartoons was an important part of his musical education; and the use of the full Warner Bros. Orchestra resulted in a richness of sound that is often lacking in more modern cartoons. It is undeniable that Stalling subtly introduced the  babyboom  generation to classical music and much of the  Great American Songbook .   After Carl Stalling retired, he was replaced by  Milt Franklyn , who had assisted Stalling as arranger since the late 1930s. Carl Stalling died on November 29, 1972, at the age of 81.

""Euro Disney"" redirects here. For the company that owns and operates Disneyland Resort Paris, see  Euro Disney S.C.A. .   Disneyland Resort Paris  is a  holiday  and  recreation   resort  in  Marne-la-Valle , a  new town  in the eastern suburbs of  Paris ,  France . The complex is located 32 kilometers (20 mi) from the  centre of Paris  and lies for the most part on the territory of the  commune  of  Chessy .   Disneyland Resort Paris features two  theme parks , an  entertainment  district and seven  Disney -owned  hotels . Operating since April 12, 1992, it was the second  Disney resort  to open outside the  United States  (following  Tokyo Disney Resort ), and the first to be owned and operated by Disney. With 15.3 million visitors in the fiscal year of 2008, it is one of  Europe 's leading tourist destinations.   Disneyland Resort Paris is owned and operated by French company  Euro Disney S.C.A. , a  public company  of which 39.78% of its  stock  is held by The Walt Disney Company, 10% by the Saudi  Prince Alwaleed  and 50.22% by other  shareholders . The resort is run by  chairman  and  CEO  Philippe Gas.   The complex was a subject of  controversy  during the periods of negotiation and construction, when a number of prominent French figures voiced their opposition and  protests  were held by French  labour unions  and others. A further setback followed the opening of the resort as park attendance, hotel occupancy and revenues fell below projections. Partly as a result of this, the complex was renamed from  Euro Disney Resort  to  Disneyland Paris  in 1995. In July of that year, the company saw its first quarterly profit.   A second theme park,  Walt Disney Studios Park , was opened to the public on March 16, 2002.

Upon the leadership of  E. Cardon Walker ,  Tokyo Disneyland  opened in 1983 in  Japan  with instant success, forming a catalyst for international expansion.   In late 1984 the heads of Disney's theme park division, Dick Nunis and Jim Cora, presented a list of approximately 1,200 possible European locations for the park. [ 1 ]   By March 1985, the number of possible locations for the park had been reduced to four; two in France and two in  Spain . [ 2 ]  Both of these nations saw the potential  economic  advantages of a Disney theme park and competed by offering financing deals to Disney. [ 3 ]   Both Spanish sites were located near the  Mediterranean Sea  and offered a  subtropical  climate similar to Disney's parks in  California  and  Florida . Disney had also shown interest in a site near  Toulon  in southern France, not far from  Marseille . The pleasing landscape of that region, as well as its  climate , made the location a top competitor for what would be called Euro Disneyland. However, thick layers of  bedrock  were discovered beneath the site, which would render construction too difficult. Finally, a site in the rural town of  Marne-la-Valle  was chosen because of its proximity to  Paris  and its central location in  Western Europe . This location was estimated to be no more than a four-hour drive for 68 million people and no more than a two-hour flight for a further 300 million.          In December 1990,  Espace Euro Disney  enabled the public to preview the complex.       Michael Eisner , Disney's  CEO  at the time, signed the first letter of agreement with the  French government  for the 20-square-kilometer (4,940-acre) site in December 1985, and the first financial contracts were drawn up during the following spring. Construction began in August 1988, and in December 1990, an information centre named ""Espace Euro Disney"" was opened to show the public what was being constructed. Plans for a theme park next to Euro Disneyland based on the entertainment industry,  Disney-MGM Studios Europe , quickly went into development, scheduled to open in 1996 with a construction budget of US$2.3 billion. [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Hotels, recreation and restaurants   In order to control a maximum of the  hotel  business, it was decided that 5,000 Disney-owned hotel rooms would be built within the complex. In March 1988, Disney and a council of  architects  ( Frank Gehry ,  Michael Graves ,  Robert A.M. Stern ,  Stanley Tigerman  and  Robert Venturi ) decided on an exclusively American theme in which each hotel would depict a region of the  United States . At the time of the opening in April 1992, seven hotels collectively housing 5,800 [ 5 ]  rooms had been built. By the year 2017, Euro Disney, under the terms specified in its contract with the  French government , will be required to finish constructing a total of 18,200 hotel rooms at varying distances from the resort. [ 6 ]   An entertainment, shopping and dining complex based on Walt Disney World's  Downtown Disney  was designed by Frank Gehry. With its towers of  oxidised  silver and bronze-coloured  stainless steel  under a canopy of lights, it opened as  Festival Disney . [ 7 ]          Euro Disney Resort's initial  cast members  pose.       For a projected daily attendance of 55,000, Euro Disney planned to serve an estimated 14,000 people per hour inside the Euro Disneyland park. In order to accomplish this, 29  restaurants  were built inside the park (with a further 11 restaurants built at the Euro Disney resort hotels and 5 at Festival Disney).  Menus  and prices were varied with an American flavour predominant and Disney's precedent of not serving  alcoholic beverages  was continued in the park. 2,100  patio  seats (30% of park seating) were installed to satisfy Europeans expected preference of eating outdoors in good weather. In  test kitchens  at Walt Disney World,  recipes  were adapted for European tastes. Walter Meyer, executive  chef  for menu development at Euro Disney and executive chef of food projects development at Walt Disney World noted, A few things we did need to change, but most of the time people kept telling us, Do your own thing. Do whats American. [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Recruitment   Unlike Disney's  American   theme parks , Euro Disney aimed for permanent employees (an estimated requirement of 12,000 for the theme park itself), as opposed to seasonal and temporary  part-time  employees. Casting centres were set up in Paris,  London ,  Amsterdam , and  Frankfurt  in an effort to reflect the multinational aspect of Euro Disneys visitors. However, it was understood by the French government and Disney that a concentrated effort would be made to tap into the local French labour market [ 1 ] . Disney sought workers with sufficient communication skills, spoke two European languages (French and one other), and were socially outgoing. Following precedent, Euro Disney set up its own  Disney University  to train workers. 24,000 people had applied by November 1991. [ 1 ]     [ edit ]   Controversies          a horror made of cardboard, plastic and appalling colours, a construction of hardened chewing gum and idiotic folklore taken straight out of comic books written for obese Americans. [ 9 ]                The prospect of a Disney park in France was a subject of  debate  and  controversy . Critics, who included prominent French  intellectuals , denounced what they considered to be the  cultural imperialism , or neoprovincialism of Euro Disney and felt it would encourage in France an unhealthy American type of  consumerism . For others, Euro Disney became a symbol of America within France. On June 28, 1992 a group of French  farmers   blockaded  Euro Disney in protest of farm policies the United States supported at the time. A journalist in the French newspaper  Le Figaro  wrote, I wish with all my heart that the rebels would set fire to [Euro] Disneyland."" [ 10 ]   Ariane Mnouchkine , a Parisian  stage director , named the concept a cultural  Chernobyl ; [ 11 ]  a phrase which would be echoed in the  media  and grow synonymous with Euro Disney's initial years.   In response, French  philosopher   Michel Serres  noted, It is not America that is invading us. It is we who adore it, who adopt its fashions and above all, its words. Euro Disney S.C.A.'s then-chairman Robert Fitzpatrick responded, ""We didnt come in and say O.K., were going to put a  beret  and a  baguette  on  Mickey Mouse . We are who we are."" [ 1 ]   Topics of controversy further included Disney's American managers requiring English to be spoken at all meetings and Disney's appearance code for members of staff, which listed regulations and limitations for the use of  make up ,  facial hair ,  tattoos ,  jewellery  and more. French  labour unions  mounted protests against the appearance code, which they saw as an attack on individual liberty. Others criticised Disney as being insensitive to French culture, individualism, and privacy, because restrictions on individual or collective liberties were illegal under  French law , unless it could be demonstrated that the restrictions are requisite to the job and do not exceed what is necessary. Disney countered by saying that a ruling that barred them from imposing such an employment standard could threaten the image and long-term success of the park. For us, the appearance code has a great effect from a product identification standpoint, said Thor Degelmann, Euro Disneys personnel director and a native Californian. Without it we couldnt be presenting the Disney product that people would be expecting. [ 12 ]     [ edit ]   Opening day           Michael Eisner  announces,  Et maintenant je dclare Euro Disneyland officiellement ouvert (And now I declare Euro Disneyland officially open).       On April 12, 1992,  Euro Disney Resort  and its theme park,  Euro Disneyland , officially opened. Visitors were warned of chaos on the roads and a government survey indicated that half a million people carried by 90,000 cars might attempt to enter the complex. French radio warned traffic to avoid the area. By midday, the parking lot was approximately half full, suggesting an attendance level below 25,000. Speculative explanations ranged from people heeding the advice to stay away to the one-day strike that cut the direct  RER  railway connection to Euro Disney from the centre of Paris. [ 10 ]     [ edit ]   Financial, attendance and employment problems   In May 1992, entertainment magazine  The Hollywood Reporter  reported that about 25% of Euro Disney's workforce  approximately 3,000 men and women  had resigned their jobs because of unacceptable working conditions. It also reported that the park's attendance was far behind expectations. Euro Disney S.C.A. responded in an interview with  The Wall Street Journal , in which Robert Fitzpatrick claimed only 1,000 people had left their jobs.   In response to the financial situation, Fitzpatrick ordered that the Disney-MGM Studios Europe project would be put on hiatus until a further decision could be made. Prices at the hotels were reduced.   Despite these efforts, in May 1992 daily park attendance was around 25,000 (some reports give a figure of 30,000) instead of the predicted 60,000. The Euro Disney Company stock price spiralled downwards and on July 23, 1992, Euro Disney announced an expected net loss in its first year of operation of approximately 300 million  French francs . During Euro Disney's first winter, hotel occupancy was such that it was decided to close the  Newport Bay Club  hotel during the season. Initial hopes were that each visitor would spend around US$33 per day, but near the end of 1992, analysts reckoned spending to be around 12% lower. [ 13 ]   Efforts to improve attendance included serving alcoholic beverages with meals inside the Euro Disneyland park, in response to a presumed European demand, which began June 12, 1993. [ 14 ]   In January 1994, Sanford Litvack, an  attorney  from  New York City  and former Assistant Attorney General during the  Jimmy Carter  presidency, was assigned to be Disney's lead  negotiator  regarding Euro Disney's future. On February 28, Litvack made an offer (without the consent of Eisner or  Frank Wells ) to split the debts between Euro Disney's creditors and Disney. After the banks showed interest, Litvack informed Eisner and Wells. On March 14, the day before the annual  shareholders  meeting, the banks capitulated to Disney's demands. The  creditor  banks bought US$500 million worth of Euro Disney shares, forgave 18 months of  interest  and deferred interest payments for three years. Disney invested US$750 million into Euro Disney and granted a five-year suspension of royalty payments. In June that same year,  Saudi Arabian  Prince Al-Waleed Bin Talal Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud cut a deal whereby the Walt Disney Company bought 51% of a new US$1.1 billion share issue, the rest being offered to existing shareholders at below-market rates, with the Prince buying any that were not taken up by existing shareholders (up to a 24.5% holding).   In 2002, Euro Disney S.C.A. and the Walt Disney Company announced another annual profit for Disneyland Resort Paris. However, it has incurred a net loss in the three years following, and the park is approximately US$2 billion in debt as of 2007. In 2005, the Walt Disney Company agreed to write-off all debt to the Walt Disney Company made by Euro Disney S.C.A.     [ edit ]   1995 turnaround          The year 1995 marked the opening of  Space Mountain - De la Terre  la Lune  and an increase in attendance.       On May 31, 1995, a new attraction opened at the theme park.  Space Mountain - De la Terre  la Lune  had been planned since the inception of Euro Disneyland, but was reserved for a revival of public interest. With a redesign of the attraction (which had premiered at Walt Disney World's  Magic Kingdom  in 1975) including a ' cannon '  launch  system and an on-ride  soundtrack , the US$100 million attraction was dedicated in a ceremony attended by  celebrities  such as  Elton John ,  Claudia Schiffer  and  Buzz Aldrin .   On July 25, 1995, Euro Disney S.C.A. reported its first ever quarterly profit of US$35.3 million. On November 15, the results for the  fiscal year  ending September 30 were released; in one year the theme park's attendance had climbed from 8.8 million to 10.7 million  an increase of 21%. Hotel occupancy had also climbed from 60 to 68.5%. After debt payments, Disneyland Paris ended the year with a net profit of US$22.8 million.     [ edit ]   Name changes   Disneyland Resort Paris and its assets have been subject to a number of name changes, initially an effort to overcome the negative publicity that followed the inception of Euro Disney.   Michael Eisner noted,          As Americans, the word Euro is believed to mean glamorous or exciting. For Europeans it turned out to be a term they associated with business, currency, and commerce. Renaming the park Disneyland Paris was a way of identifying it with one of the most romantic and exciting cities in the world.

[ edit ]   Theme parks          On April 12 2007, Disneyland Resort Paris celebrated its 15th anniversary.           Main articles:  Disneyland Park (Paris)  and  Walt Disney Studios Park       The  Disneyland Park  is based on a  formula  pioneered by  Disneyland  in  California  and further employed at the  Magic Kingdom  in  Florida  and  Tokyo Disneyland  in  Japan . Occupying 566,560 m (140  acres ), it is the largest Disney park based on the original in California.   On March 16, 2002, the  Walt Disney Studios Park  opened its doors to the public. At 270,000 square metres, it is a continuation on an earlier, never realised concept; the Disney-MGM Studios Europe.   The April 2007 issue of trade magazine  Park World  reported the following  attendance estimates  for 2006 compiled by Economic Research Associates in partnership with TEA (formerly the  Themed Entertainment Association ):     Disneyland Park, 10.6 million visits (No. 5 worldwide);   Walt Disney Studios, 2.2 million visits.

Golf Disneyland  features 9-hole and 18-hole courses.     [ edit ]   Hotels          Disney's Sequoia Lodge.       The complex features seven Disneyland Resort Paris hotels. The  Disneyland Hotel  is located over the entrance of the Disneyland Park and is marketed as the most prestigious hotel on property. A body of water known as  Lake Disney  is surrounded by  Disney's Hotel New York ,  Disney's Newport Bay Club  and  Disney's Sequoia Lodge .  Disney's Hotel Cheyenne  and  Disney's Hotel Santa Fe  are located near Lake Disney,  Disney's Davy Crockett Ranch  is located in a woodland area outside the resort perimeter.   Disneyland Resort Paris includes six Associated Hotels which are not managed by Euro Disney S.C.A. but provide free shuttle buses to the parks:  Marriott 's Village d'lle-de-France,  Radisson  SAS Hotel, a  Holiday Inn  Hotel, Vienna International Dream Castle Hotel,  MyTravel 's Explorers Hotel and a Kyriad Hotel.     [ edit ]   Transport   A  railway station ,  Marne-la-Valle - Chessy , with connection to the suburban  RER  network and the  TGV  high-speed rail network is located between the theme parks and Disney Village.  Thalys  no longer operates from Marne-la-Valle train station, but there are daily services from  London  on the  Eurostar . On June 10, 2007, a new TGV line,  LGV Est , began service between Paris and Strasbourg.   Free shuttle buses provide transport to all Disney hotels (except Disney's Davy Crockett Ranch) and Associated Hotels.     [ edit ]   References       ^  a   b   c   d   Lainsbury, Andrew (2000).

clueweb09-enwp01-85-18413	"                     Walt Disney Imagineering          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search            Walt Disney Imagineering  was formed by entertainment mogul  Walt Disney  on  December 16 ,  1952  as  WED Enterprises  (WED: Walter Elias Disney) to develop plans for a theme park and to manage Disney's personal assets. It was an independent, private company, owned by Walt Disney himself, but on  February 3 ,  1965 , was merged into  Walt Disney Productions . It is known as  Walt Disney Imagineering  ( WDI ),  Disney Imagineering , or simply  Imagineering  and occasionally does business as  Theme Park Productions, Inc [ 1 ] .           Contents       1   History   2   Employees   3   Theme park projects     3.1   Current theme park projects   3.2   Completed theme park projects       4   Non-theme park projects   5   Corporate     5.1   Corporate locations   5.2   Corporate structure       6   Books   7   Notes   8   Related pages   9   External links               [ edit ]   History   Ever since the founding of WED Enterprises, when Walt Disney's favorites at the Walt Disney Studios were handpicked to design an immersive themed experience now known as Disneyland, the company has been shrouded in mystery and its secrets are proudly guarded by Disney executives as senior as former CEO  Michael Eisner , who had regular meetings with the Imagineers up until a few years before his departure.   In recent years, many of the research and development division have been laid off, until the point where a few hundred Imagineers were employed by Disney, to perform tasks at the theme parks. Much more recently, as Disney has publicly acknowledged the failures of Disney's California Adventure and the Walt Disney Studios Paris, and new management has been brought in throughout the company's different divisions, Imagineering has once again begun recruiting. The theme parks now have a new attraction either being developed or having just opened at each of the eleven parks around the world.   In April 2006,  John Lasseter , the new Principal Creative Adviser, a position created through the acquisition of Pixar by Disney, has made his feelings known about getting back to basics with Imagineering, such as focusing on the story-telling and not the technology so much. In a move which surprised many, he even made it known he would like Walt Disney Imagineering to return to the WED Enterprises name, partly in homage to Walt Disney and partly to regain the spirit that many feel left Walt Disney Imagineering in the late 1990s. He also said at the Walt Disney Company shareholders meeting in March that he felt that developing attractions based on movies to open in time with the movie's opening was a crucial step in moving Imagineering forward.   WED Enterprises applied for a trademark for the term in 1967, claiming first use in 1962.   The company was formed separately from  Walt Disney Productions  to keep the affairs separate. Although, when WED was required to design and build sets for  Walt Disney 's live-action television shows, WED and the Walt Disney Studios got closer together. In 1952 when WED were asked to design and build Disneyland, Walt and his brother  Roy O. Disney  formed  Disneyland, Inc.  to build, design, and manage Disneyland and produce the  Disneyland  television show. Disneyland, Inc was absorbed into WED Enterprises and WED Enterprises became a division of Walt Disney Studios - itself a division of Walt Disney Productions, now named  The Walt Disney Company .   Walt Disney Imagineering is now the  research and development  arm of  Walt Disney Parks and Resorts , no longer a division of Walt Disney Productions. Imagineering also includes  Walt Disney Creative Entertainment , the company which utilizes Imagineering techniques among others to create shows, fireworks displays and parades at the Disney theme parks which are significant enough not to be developed by the entertainment studios at that theme park.     [ edit ]   Employees   An  Imagineer  (officially known as a Walt Disney Imagineer), is an employee of Walt Disney Imagineering, or any other employee of The Walt Disney Company given that title. Nearly all Imagineers work at the headquarters in Glendale, California, developing ideas and attractions for Disney parks. During the construction of a major project, Imagineers sometimes are deployed to work on-site for six months to a year.   Imagineers may include artists, writers, architects, landscape architects, engineers, model builders, construction managers, technicians and designers. Past Imagineers include  Alan Kay ,  Bran Ferren ,  Robert Swirsky ,  Lee Adams  and  Danny Hillis .

The very first  Disney Store  opened in Glendale, California, near Imagineering headquarters, and was designed and constructed by a group of architectural Imagineers.   Environmental and graphic design for The  Disney Cruise Line  and DCL's  Castaway Cay   Imagineering have co-operated with  Walt Disney Consumer Products  on four more occasions for Disney Stores. Firstly, WDI developed the Walt Disney Gallery at the Main Place Mall in  Santa Ana, California  (open for a short time in the 1990s, next to the still-operating Disney Store), and then a  Roman  themed Disney Store at  The Forum Shops at Caesars  in  Las Vegas, Nevada . Two more themed Disney stores were opened in  San Francisco, California , and  New York City, New York  - the latter having been developed into a  World of Disney .   After the purchase of the Disney Stores by  The Children's Place  in  2004 , Disney developed a more exclusive chain of flagship Disney stores, called  World of Disney  (see above). Located in Lake Buena Vista, Florida (at the Walt Disney World Resort), Anaheim, California (at the Disneyland Resort) and New York City. Each have been designed by Walt Disney Imagineering. A fourth incarnation of the ""World of Disney"" brand is due to arrive in  Disney Village  at  Disneyland Resort Paris  in 2008/2009.   Former Senior Vice President of Imagineering  John Hench  designed the ""Tower of Nations"" for the opening and closing ceremony of the  1960 Winter Olympics , where Walt Disney was Pageantry Committee Chairman.   Imagineering designed galleries and exhibitions for the  Autry Museum of Western Heritage  in  Los Angeles, California .   Imagineering developed the Encounter Restaurant, a science fiction themed redesign of the restaurant suspended at the top of the 135-foot parabolic arches of the Theme Building at the  Los Angeles International Airport .   Imagineering manufactured flight attendant uniforms for  Northwest Airlines  from  Claude Montana  designs in 1989 due in part to the fact that Northwest's then-CEO Al Checchi was also a member of The Walt Disney Company's board. The WDI-made uniforms only lasted until 1992.   When Disney purchased  ABC , the Imagineers remodeled the ABC  Times Square Studios  in  New York City .   Imagineering designed exhibits for the  Port Discovery  children's museum at the  Inner Harbor  in  Baltimore ,  Maryland .   When Disney purchased the  California Angels , they renamed the team to Anaheim Angels, and Walt Disney Imagineering and  HOK Sport  renovated the then-30-year-old  Anaheim -owned  Anaheim Stadium , adding modern amenities.       [ edit ]   Corporate     [ edit ]   Corporate locations   Since the 1960s, Imagineering's headquarters have been in  Glendale, California , a short distance from Disney's corporate headquarters in  Burbank .
