The code is the ""language of civilization""--man has grown to understand that language has built libraries with information, but has only just begun to translate the text.  Nirenberg warns that the texts available contain precise instructions for construction of microscopic machines that are more advanced than the chemical and industrial technology of man, and therefore require a great deal more work before the meaning of it all will be revealed.

He is best known, however, as a discoverer that deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) serves as genetic material. The Oswald T. Avery Collection is a part of the  Joshua Lederberg Papers , which are at the National Library of Medicine and available digitally. The collection was assembled by Nobel laureate Dr. Lederberg because of the strong connection between Dr. Avery's work and his own. The work of Avery and his lab, observes Dr. Lederberg, was ""the historical platform of modern DNA research"" and ""betokened the molecular revolution in genetics and biomedical science generally.""  Documents in the Oswald T. Avery Collection range from 1910 to 1990s, the majority dating from the 1940s and from the 1960s to the present day. The collection contains laboratory notes, research reports, published articles and books, correspondence, unpublished manuscripts, speeches, photographic prints, and audiovisual materials.    As part of its  Profiles in Science  project,  the National Library of Medicine is digitizing and making available  over the World Wide Web a selection of the Oswald T. Avery Papers,  for use by educators and researchers.  This Web site provides access to the  portions of the Oswald T. Avery Papers that are now publicly available. Individuals interested in conducting research in the Oswald T. Avery Papers are invited to  contact  the National Library of Medicine.    This online Exhibit is designed to introduce you to the various phases of Dr. Avery's scientific career and professional life.  It is divided into sections that focus on Avery's life and major scientific contributions.  We suggest that new visitors begin with this exhibit, which includes a small selection of documents and visuals, organized within these sections.  Each section begins with a ""Background Narrative,"" which leads to ""Documents"" and ""Visuals.""      Visitors may access additional materials through  Search  on the navigation bar.  They may also view the materials alphabetically or chronologically by choosing  Browse  on the navigation bar. Documents and visuals in these lists are arranged by format and then either alphabetically by title or chronologically.
