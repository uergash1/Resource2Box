Absence from school is not permissible without reasonable explanation and cause. Attendance rate is the ratio of the number of actual student attendance days to the number of student attendance days which would occur if every student were present every school day. Suspension is the temporary exclusion of a student from school for disciplinary reasons for one full school day or longer. ""In-school suspensions"" are not included in this measure. For this table, a student who has been suspended is counted once, regardless of the number of times he or she was suspended. School policies concerning suspension of students may vary from school to school and will affect the suspension rates shown. The suspension rate is the ratio of students suspended to the fall enrollment.  Are many students excluded from school for one or more days for disciplinary reasons?

All schools in this group are elementary level schools in urban or suburban school districts with high student needs in relation to district resources. The schools in this group are in the middle range of student needs for elementary level schools in these districts.  1  Staff reported here serve only students in this building. Other district-employed staff who serve in more than one building may also provide service to these students.  01-01-00-01-0014 Montessori Magnet School  March 28, 2000  7   School Accountability Measures The Regents expect schools to meet or exceed 90 percent on each benchmark shown here. Regulations require school districts to develop and implement local assistance plans (LAP) to bring every public school up to these levels. These plans must include activities to improve the performance of all students, including students with disabilities. LAP for district public schools are available for public review at the district office. Only general education students continuously enrolled from October until the date of State testing at this school are included in these measures. Students with disabilities are not included1. Also, schools with fewer than 20 students in a category may combine results for the last three years to reduce the impact of small-population variability. Local school officials have this information.

Some schools with high mobility grade 11 populations may not have their LAP status correctly identified in this report. These numbers are, however, indicative of performance in all schools. # A pound sign appears when fewer than five students were in the basis group for a comparison.

Public schools must make it possible for eight-grade         students to take high school courses in Regents mathematics and in at         least one of the following areas: English, social studies, second         language, art, music, occupational education subjects, Regents science         courses. ( Section 100.4 of the Regulations of the Commissioner of         Education .)                       >>>  The school         district staff decides whether a student has demonstrated readiness to         begin high school courses in the eighth grade.           >>>  If the         student passes the course, he or she will receive high school credit.                     Credit Through         Examination.  If a student has acquired the knowledge outside regular         courses, he or she may receive up to 61/2 credits toward graduation         without taking the courses. ( Section 100.5 of the Regulations of the         Commissioner of Education .) The student has this right if:                     >>>          The school         staff determines that he or she will benefit academically.           >>>  He or she         achieves a score of at least 85 percent on a State examination or an         examination approved by the State.           >>>  He or she         meets other requirements the school has, such as lab requirements, a         special project, or an oral examination.

DESCRIPTION  OF  SCORES  For a detailed discussion on how the following scores are derived, see Chapter 10, Scaling.  RAW SCORE The raw score is the number of items answered correctly on a subject-area test. By itself the raw score has limited utility; it can be interpreted only in reference to the total number of items on a subject-area test, and raw scores should not be compared across tests or administrations. The raw score is provided for all English and Spanish-version TAAS tests, end-of-course tests, RPTE, and SDAA.  TAAS AND END-OF-COURSE SCALE SCORE The scale score is a statistic that provides a comparison of scores with the minimum expectations/passing standard and allows for comparison across years within a subject and grade. The scale score ranges from approximately 400 to 2400, with a minimum expectations/passing score of 1500. The score of 1500 does not represent the same amount of achievement at each grade or subject tested, although it does account for differences in the difficulty of the test form used for each administration. Thus, the scale score can be used to determine whether a student has met minimum expectations/passed, but it cannot be used to examine student progress across grades. The TAAS and end-of-course scale score is provided for TAAS writing, science, social studies, and Spanish-version tests and for all end-of-course tests.  TEXAS LEARNING INDEX The Texas Learning Index (TLI) is a statistic that allows for comparison both across years and across grades within a subject area for TAAS reading and mathematics tests at Grades 3  8 and exit level. The TLI ranges from 0 to the maximum score possible on a subject area test and is preceded by a digit representing the grade level (for example, 3-65 for Grade 3, X-83 for exit level). The minimum expectations score of 70 represents the same amount of achievement at each grade tested and at each administration. Thus, the TLI score can be used to assess learning progress within a subject-area across grades. For example, if a student scored a TLI of 3-65 at Grade 3 in reading, the student did not meet minimum expectations. If the same student achieved a TLI of 4-72 at Grade 4 in reading, the student showed more than one year's typical learning progress for one year's instruction and also met minimum expectations. The TLI is not currently used for reporting results of the end-of-course tests, the TAAS writing, science, or social studies tests, or the Spanish-version TAAS tests. In the box on the next page are three explanatory examples of the TLI.  37   E  XAMPLES  : Student A Grade 3 TLI = 3-34 (i.e., Grade 3 score of 34) Grade 4 TLI = 4-41 (i.e., Grade 4 score of 41)  In the example, Student A's score was below the performance necessary to be in line with passing the exit level test at both Grades 3 and 4, since the TLI is below 70 at both grades. However, the student made more than typical progress between Grade 3 and Grade 4, with typical progress being a TLI difference of zero between grades. Schools, teachers, and students can see that this student is making progress but that much work is still needed. Student B Grade 5 TLI = 5-80 (i.e., Grade 5 score of 80) Grade 6 TLI = 6-80 (i.e., Grade 6 score of 80) Student B surpassed the standard of 70 needed to be in line for success on the exit level examination and demonstrated one year's typical learning progress (that is, a TLI difference of zero). Student C Grade 7 TLI = 7-60 (i.e., Grade 7 score of 60) Grade 8 TLI = 8-70 (i.e., Grade 8 score of 70) Student C has shown more improvement than is usual during one year, with a TLI gain of 10 points and is now more likely to pass the exit level examination. However, a TLI of 70 at Grade 8 is no guarantee that the student will pass the exit level test. Only if current learning progress continues can the student be expected to pass the exit level test. In other words, if Student C continues to achieve at the same rate while studying new content, he or she is likely to receive a similar TLI in this subject area on future TAAS administrations.  RPTE SCALE SCORE The RPTE scale score is a statistic that can be used for evaluating a student's annual growth and pinpointing how high or low a student performs within an RPTE proficiency level. This score accounts for differences in the difficulty of the test forms used for each administration. See Chapter 4 for more information about RPTE.  SDAA SCALE SCORE (MATHEMATICS AND READING TESTS ONLY) SDAA scale scores provide a numeric value that can be used to evaluate a student's annual growth and to pinpoint how high or low the student performs within an achievement level. Scale scores for mathematics must not be compared with scale scores for reading. Knowing how well a student performed within an achievement level may be helpful when establishing the student's performance expectations for future assessments. The SDAA scale score is a ""growth,"" or vertical scale, score, meaning the SDAA tests are linked across instructional grade levels to create a single underlying scale. With a true vertical scale, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the scale score and estimated student proficiency; that is, two students with the same vertical scale score are estimated to be of the same proficiency on the underlying construct even if one took the third-grade test and the other took the fourth-grade test.  38   APPROPRIATE SCORE USES Test results have several uses for individual students and for comparing the performance of groups.  INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS The TLI and scale score indicate whether a student has passed/met minimum expectations (achieving a TLI of 70 or above or a scale score of 1500 or above) and how far the student's achievement is above or below the passing standard. All students failing to meet minimum expectations on one or more TAAS tests must be offered accelerated instruction. In addition, students who fail one or more parts of TAAS are provided with TAAS study guides at no additional charge. If the student has been administered the TAAS reading or mathematics tests for at least two years, the TLI scores can be used to gauge a student's relative achievement gains or losses over the years. In this way, students can see whether their performance is improving over time. (The TLI is not provided for Spanishversion TAAS tests.) Test results can also be used to compare the performance of an individual student with the performance of a similar demographic or program group or to an entire campus or district. For example, the scores for a Hispanic student in a gifted and talented program could be compared with the average scores of Hispanic students, gifted and talented students, all the students on a campus, or any combination of these aggregations. Other scores provide information about academic areas of relative strength or weakness. The objective mastery status can provide student information to help identify areas in which a student may be having difficulty, as indicated by this particular test. Once an area of possible weakness has been identified, supplementary data should be gathered to further define the student's instructional planning needs. Finally, individual student test scores may also be used in conjunction with other performance indicators to assist in making placement decisions. However, all decisions regarding placement and educational planning for a student should incorporate as much test performance data as possible about the student.  GROUPS OF STUDENTS Test results can be used to evaluate the performance of a group over time. Average scale scores, TLIs, and the percent passing/meeting minimum expectations can be contrasted across administrations within the same grade and subject area to give insight into whether student performance is improving across years. For example, the average scale score for special education students taking the Grade 4 TAAS writing test can be compared for spring 2000, spring 2001, and spring 2002. Test scores can also be used to compare the performance of different demographic or program groups to one another. All TAAS and end-of-course scores can be analyzed within the same subject and grade of any single administration to determine which demographic or program group had, for example, the highest average performance, the lowest percent passing/meeting minimum expectations, or the highest percent mastery of the ""Word Meaning"" objective. Furthermore, TAAS scores such across grades for TAAS reading compared with the average TLIs of students meeting minimum as the TLI and the percent meeting minimum expectations can be analyzed and mathematics. For example, the average TLI in reading at Grade 4 can be in reading at Grades 5 and 6 from the same test administration. The percent expectations on TAAS reading or mathematics can also be compared  39   between Grades 3  8 and exit level. However, no comparisons of the TAAS writing test should be made between grades because the TAAS writing scores are not aligned across grades. Since nine years of TLI scores in reading and mathematics are now available, groups that tested in the spring of 1994 can be compared with groups that tested in spring 1995, spring 1996 , spring 1997, spring 1998, spring 1999, spring 2000, spring 2001, and spring 2002 in the same subject area. Tables depicting average statewide TLI gains/losses at adjacent grades, comparing the spring 2001 and spring 2002 TAAS administrations in reading and mathematics, can be found in Chapter 10. Comparisons over the nine-year period can be found in Student Performance Results 2001 2002. Other scores can be used to help evaluate academic areas of relative strength or weakness. The objective mastery status can provide survey information to help identify areas where further diagnosis is warranted for a group of students. Test results for groups of students may also be used when evaluating instruction or programs requiring average-score or year-to-year comparisons. Because the TAAS and end-of-course tests are designed to measure content areas within the required state curriculum, considering test results by subject area and by objective may be helpful when evaluating curriculum and instruction. Generalizations from test results may be made to the specific content domain represented by the objective or set of objectives being measured on the exam. However, because the tests are measuring a finite set of skills with a limited set of items, generalizations should be made only about student achievement as measured on a particular test. All instruction and program evaluations should include as much information as possible to provide a more complete picture of performance. In addition, all test scores can be compared with regional and statewide performance within the same subject area and grade for any administration.  RPTE SCORES The RPTE assessments are not designed to measure mastery of content with a pass or fail score. This is one of the main differences between the RPTE and the TAAS reading assessments. Learning to read and fully understand academic content in a second language takes time. RPTE results provide a measure of progress, indicating annually where each LEP student is on a continuum of English language development designed for second-language learners. This continuum is divided into three proficiency levels: beginning, intermediate, and advanced. The progress of students along this continuum is the basis for the RPTE reporting system and the key to helping districts monitor whether their LEP students are making steady annual growth as they learn to read in English. RPTE test results include two major kinds of scores: a proficiency rating and a scale score. These scores are used to indicate the current reading levels of students as well as their annual growth. The proficiency ratings indicate whether a student demonstrates a beginning, intermediate, or advanced level of proficiency on the test. Students who achieve a rating of advanced are not required to take the RPTE in subsequent years. They have demonstrated the highest level of reading proficiency measured on this assessment instrument. The RPTE scale score provides a numeric value that can be used to evaluate annual growth and pinpoint how high or low a student performs within a proficiency level. To assist schools in examining a student's annual growth, two years of proficiency ratings and scale scores are included in the test results of students who participated in two consecutive administrations.  SDAA RESULTS SDAA is designed to measure the academic progress of students who receive special education services for whom TAAS is inappropriate. It provides information about students' performance in the TEKS curriculum  40   and on the effectiveness of instructional programs. There is not a predetermined passing standard for SDAA and results cannot be used to compare one student with another. This is one of the main differences between the SDAA and the TAAS assessments. Although ARD committees may use testing information in conjunction with other information to make decisions regarding a student's dismissal from special education services, SDAA results should not be used in isolation. The first year a student takes SDAA in reading and/or mathematics is called a baseline year. The baseline test provides data about a student's academic performance in order to set expectations for growth in the future. Baseline results provide a starting point from which growth is measured. This growth is measured over two consecutive administrations of SDAA. The SDAA writing test is administered only to qualified special education students enrolled in Grades 4 and 8. Therefore, results cannot provide a yearly measure of growth. Instead, SDAA writing test results can assist ARD committees in evaluating student performance and developing IEP goals and objectives for future writing instruction. Beginning in the 20022003 academic year, SDAA writing tests will be administered in Grades 4 and 7.  CAUTIONS  FOR  SCORE USE  SCALE RANGES AND MAXIMUM SCORES A TLI of 70, which is the passing standard for all English TAAS reading and mathematics tests, represents the same level of achievement across all grades. However, the maximum and minimum scores on the TLI may be different for each grade and subject, depending on the overall difficulty of the items on the test. For example, if a test contains items that are more difficult, a student may demonstrate a higher level of achievement by answering more of the items correctly. Likewise, minimum and maximum scale scores may fluctuate as a function of test difficulty.  USING SCORES AT THE EXTREME ENDS OF THE DISTRIBUTION On the TAAS, end-of-course, and RPTE examinations, as with any test, student scores at the minimum or maximum ends of the score range must be viewed cautiously. For instance, if the maximum TLI for a subject is 7-94 and a student achieves this score, it cannot be determined whether the student's true achievement is a TLI of 7-94 or whether the student would have achieved a higher TLI if that score were possible. In other words, there is no way to know whether, if the test had had 10 more items on it, the student would have answered those items correctly and achieved a higher TLI. Because the minimum and maximum scores may not be the same between administrations, caution should be taken when comparing students who score at the extreme ends of the distribution. Analysis of scores of students at the extreme ends of the distribution should also be undertaken cautiously because of a testing phenomenon known as regression toward the mean. Students who scored high on the test may achieve a lower score the next time they test because of regression toward the mean. This regression effect is related to the standard error of measurement and is observable in all testing programs. For example, if a student who scored 38 out of 40 on a test were to take the same test again, there would be 38 opportunities for him or her to incorrectly answer an item he or she answered correctly the first time, while there would be only two opportunities to correctly answer items that were missed the first time. If an item is answered differently, it is more likely to decrease the student's score than to increase it. The converse of this is also true for students with very low scores; the next time they test, they are more likely to achieve a higher score, and this higher score may be a result of regression toward the mean rather than an actual gain in achievement. It is more difficult for students with very high or very low scores to maintain their score than it is for students in the middle of the distribution.  41   INTERPRETING TLI SCORES In addition to the cautions listed above, specific issues regarding the interpretation of TLI scores should be kept in mind. The TLI is not a percent of items correct. It is a standard score. Its primary functions are to describe how far above or below the passing standard the student is and to indicate whether the student is making learning progress over time. It is also important to note that this learning progress, as measured by the TLI, is a reference only to achievement--not to an amount of time. For instance, a TLI gain of 6 points between Grades 3 and 4 does not indicate that the student has learned an additional 6 months worth of material. Similarly, a TLI loss of 10 points does not mean a student is one year behind. The units of the TLI scale describe only student achievement and are not designed to reference an amount of time. Although the TLI ranges are approximately 0 to 100, another misinterpretation would be to add value labels to ranges of TLI scores (for example, 90 and above as a grade of A, 80 to 89 a B, 70 to 79 a C, and so on). This is not a valid interpretation of the TLI and overlooks the skills, items, and content that students must learn in order to score in those TLI ranges. Finally, for a subject area the average TLI for a group is computed by summing each student's TLI and by dividing this sum by the number of students tested. Although a TLI of 70 is required to meet minimum expectations for each grade and each subject, an average TLI above 70 does not necessarily indicate that most students in the group passed the test. A majority of students could achieve a TLI just below 70, and a small number of students could achieve very high TLI scores, resulting in a low percent of students passing the test but an average TLI score well above 70. Only when the percent meeting minimum expectations is above 50% can one conclude that most students passed the test.  USING OBJECTIVE-LEVEL INFORMATION Objective-level information provided with the TAAS, end-of-course, RPTE, and SDAA exams can be useful as a preliminary survey to help identify skill areas in which further diagnosis is warranted. As with all tests given at a single point in time, the data gleaned from this snapshot should be used in conjunction with other evaluations of performance to provide an in-depth portrait of student achievement. Once an area of possible weakness has been identified, supplementary data should be gathered to further define students ' instructional planning needs. Furthermore, since the TAAS, end-of-course, and RPTE exams are equated only at the total subject-area test level, year-to-year comparisons of objective-level performance should be made cautiously. Every effort is made to approximate the overall difficulty of the objectives from year to year in the test construction process, but some fluctuations in the difficulty of the objectives do occur at every administration. Observing trends in objective-level performance over time, identifying patterns of performance in clusters of objectives testing similar skills, and comparing campus or district objective-level performance to that of the region or state are appropriate uses of group objective-level information.  PROGRAM EVALUATION Standardized tests are used for evaluation and accountability in Texas as well as in other states. Test scores can be used as a valuable tool for evaluating programs, but any achievement test can give only one part of the picture. The TAAS, end-of-course, RPTE, and SDAA exams are not all-encompassing assessments that can measure every factor that contributes to the success or failure of a program. Although more-accurate evaluation decisions can be made by considering all the data the tests provide, test results can be most helpful if considered as one component of an evaluation system.  42   REPORTS Two types of reports are provided for the various testing programs: standard and optional reports. Standard reports are provided automatically to districts. Optional reports, which present student performance data in somewhat different formats and, in some instances, greater detail, may be purchased for a nominal fee. Reports that are titled ""confidential"" contain student-level results. All other reports present test results in an aggregate format.

GX243-28-2094154	"Characteristics of MSAP Districts  II. Characteristics of MSAP Districts In this chapter, we present a general description of the 57 school districts that received MSAP grants in 1998.1 Our intent is to provide information about the context in which the MSAP-supported schools and programs operate and the factors that may affect their ability to meet their desegregation objectives. We describe the types of desegregation plan, the demographic and enrollment characteristics of the MSAP districts, the trends in enrollment by race-ethnicity, the distribution of students in schools with high minority enrollments, and the school choices available to students in these districts. Our descriptions of the demographic and enrollment characteristics generally refer to the 199798 school year, as this represents a baseline for evaluation of the MSAP projects. The trends are examined for the period from 199394 to 1997 98.  Type of Desegregation Plan MSAP funds are intended to assist districts operating under either a required desegregation plan (i.e., one required by a court, state agency, or the Office for Civil Rights in the U.S. Department of Education [ED]), or a voluntary plan approved by ED. At the beginning of the grant cycle, 31 districts (54 percent) of the 57 districts with 1998 MSAP grants were operating their projects as part of voluntary desegregation plans, while the remaining 26 districts (46 percent) were operating under required desegregation plans.2  Demographic and Enrollment Characteristics of Districts Most 1998 MSAP grants were awarded to urban districts that serve large student populations consisting of a high proportion of minority students and students from lower-income families (i.e., students who qualify for free or reduced-price lunch meals). These characteristics are detailed below.  Type of Community Almost all of the MSAP districts are located in metropolitan areas.3 Two thirds (67 percent) of the districts primarily serve central city students in large metropolitan areas. By comparison, less than 5 percent of districts nationally are located in central cities.4 Nearly one third (32 percent) of the districts mainly serve suburban students; that is, students in metropolitan areas that are primarily outside of the central city. Only one of the 57 districts lies outside of a large metropolitan area.5 By comparison, over 1 2  3  4  5  One of the projects is a collaborative effort of five districts acting as a single district. See Table A-II-1 in Appendix II. The U.S. Census Bureau concept of a metropolitan area is a core area containing a large population nucleus and adjacent communities that have a high degree of economic and social integration with the core. Metropolitan areas identified by the U.S. Census Bureau must contain either one city with 50,000 or more inhabitants or an urbanized area of 50,000 and a total metropolitan population of at least 100,000 inhabitants. Metropolitan areas are subdivided into ""inside central city"" and ""outside central city."" The largest city in a metropolitan area is designated as a ""central city."" Additional cities in a metropolitan area may also qualify as a central city if they meet the Bureau's requirements for population size and commuting patterns. (Source: www.census.gov/population/www/estimates/aboutmetro.html). Data from the 1997-98 Common Core of Data (CCD) show that 4.5 percent of U.S. school districts are located in a central city of a metropolitan area, 42.1 percent are located in metropolitan areas outside of the central city (i.e., suburban), and 53.4 percent of districts are located outside of a metropolitan area. See Table A-II-2 in Appendix II.  American Institutes for Research  II-1   Characteristics of MSAP Districts  half of school districts nationally are located outside of metropolitan areas. In short, MSAP districts are more likely to be in metropolitan areas and particularly in central cities, as compared with school districts nationally.  District Enrollment MSAP districts tend to be quite large compared to U.S. school districts in general. In the 199798 school year, nearly two thirds of the districts (63 percent) had between 10,000 and 50,000 students, compared with one in 20 (5 percent) districts nationally. Another 19 percent of MSAP districts enrolled over 50,000 students, compared with less than 1 percent (0.5 percent) of all U.S. school districts. Only 10 of the 57 districts (18 percent) had fewer than 10,000 public school students.6 In contrast, over 9 in 10 (94.5 percent) public school districts in the U.S. serve fewer than 10,000 students.7 As Figure II-1 shows, a higher proportion of districts with voluntary desegregation plans had enrollments of fewer than 10,000 students than districts with required plans did (26 percent in voluntary plan districts vs. 8 percent in required plan districts). The percentages were reversed for the largest districts. Nearly a third (31 percent) of districts with required desegregation plans enrolled over 50,000 students, compared to 10 percent of districts with voluntary desegregation plans.  6  7  See Table A-II-3 in Appendix II.

Over half (60 percent) of all students in MSAP districts qualify for free or reduced price lunches.8 In comparison, about one third (33 to 38 percent) of students nationally are estimated to be eligible for free and reduced price lunches.9 On average, over half (54 percent) of the students within an MSAP district qualify for free or reduced price lunches.10, 11  8  9  10 11  The percent is based on data for 51 of the 57 MSAP districts from NCES's 1998-99 Common Core of Data (CCD) for data on Eligibility for Free and Reduced Lunch. Data on free and reduced price lunch were not available in the CCD for 6 districts. Although not available for all districts, the 1998-99 revisions to the NCES collection of data on Free and Reduced Price Lunch provide more accurate data than for previous years. An estimated 33.2 percent of students nationally are eligible for Free or Reduced Price Lunch based on data from the 1993-94 Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS). (See http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2000/digest99/d99t379.html). The estimate from the 1998-99 CCD for districts on which free and reduced price lunch information is available (82 percent of districts) is that 38 percent of students are eligible for free or reduced price lunch. See Table A-II-4 in Appendix II. Note that the mean percentages reported in Figure I-4 of Chapter I summarize student eligibility for MSAPsupported schools and non-MSAP-supported schools of comparable grade levels within districts. The mean percentage reported here refers to student eligibility across all grade levels within districts.  American Institutes for Research  II-3   Characteristics of MSAP Districts  Race and Ethnic Group Levels of Enrollment On average, minority students represent nearly two-thirds (62 percent) of students in MSAP districts for the 199798 school year.12 Blacks represent the largest minority group, with about one third (35 percent) of all students in MSAP districts. Hispanics are the next largest group, averaging about one fifth (21 percent) of students. Asian and Pacific Islanders represent one twentieth (5 percent) of students in MSAP districts, and American Indian or Alaskan Natives on average constitute less than 1 percent of all students in the MSAP districts.13 Districts with voluntary desegregation plans have a slightly higher average percentage of minority students (about 65 percent) than districts with required desegregation plans (59 percent).14 The difference is mainly due to a larger proportion of Asian and Pacific Islanders in the voluntary plan districts (7 percent versus 3 percent). The average percentage of blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians is similar for voluntary and required desegregation plan districts.15 These averages, however, do not convey the racial and ethnic variability in the student composition of MSAP districts. Figure II-2 summarizes the racial-ethnic groups that represent a majority of the students in MSAP districts. White students represent the majority of students in one third (33 percent) of the districts; black students represent the majority in about one fifth (21 percent) of the districts; and Hispanic students represent the majority in 11 percent of the districts. In over one third (35 percent) of MSAP districts, no single racial-ethnic group constitutes a majority of the students.16 Figure II-2 Percentage of Districts by Racial-Ethnic Group Representing a Majority of Students Enrolled in District Schools: 199798  No single raceethnic majority 35%  White 33%  Hispanic 11%  Black 21%  Source: NCES 199798 Common Core of Data  12 13 14 15 16  See See See See The  Table A-II-5 in Table A-II-6 in Table A-II-5 in Table A-II-6 in overall pattern  Appendix II.

II-4  American Institutes for Research   Characteristics of MSAP Districts  Trends in District Enrollment by Race and Ethnicity During the 1990s, prior to the start of the current MSAP grants, the representation of minority students in MSAP districts increased, with the largest increase occurring among Hispanics. The average percentage of minority students in MSAP districts increased from 58 percent in 199394 to 62 percent in 199798. Districts with voluntary and required desegregation plans experienced a similar increase of 4 percentage points in the proportion of minority student enrollment.17 Figure II-3 compares the average percent enrollment of students for each racial-ethnic group in 199394 and 199798. While the proportion of white students declined by 4 percentage points (from 42 percent to 38 percent), the largest gains occurred among Hispanic students, whose average representation increased by 2 percentage points (19 percent to 21 percent). Enrollments of black students in MSAP districts on average increased by one percent between 199394 and 199798. The representation of Asian and American Indian students stayed about the same in the MSAP districts.18 The increase in enrollment among Hispanic students between 199394 and 199798 also is seen in an increase in the number of MSAP districts in which Hispanics represent a majority of the students. During this four-year period, Hispanics became the student majority in two MSAP districts. One of those districts previously had a white majority, and the other had had no racial or ethnic group in the majority.

We also examine the changes in those distributions that occurred between 199394 and 199798. We use three different thresholds for defining ""high minority schools"": schools with a minority enrollment of at least 50 percent; schools with a minority enrollment of at least 75 percent; and schools with a minority enrollment of at least 90 percent. The first of these thresholds (50 percent) reflects the legal definition of minority group isolation. The two remaining thresholds reflect a higher level of segregation.20 In 199798, an average of three-quarters (74 percent) of minority students in MSAP districts attended schools with at least 50 percent minority enrollment; two fifths (42 percent) attended schools with at least 75 percent minority enrollment; and about one fifth (21 percent) attended schools with 90  20  Desegregation researchers use alternative thresholds of isolation as a means of describing variation in levels of segregation (e.g., Orfield et al., 1997; Orfield and Yun, 1999). In this report, we use three alternative thresholds to provide a more complete description of segregation in the MSAP districts.

The average proportion of minority students who attend schools in which at least half of the students are minority is 9 percent greater in districts with voluntary desegregation plans than in districts with required desegregation plans (78 vs. 69 percent). Similar but smaller differences between districts with voluntary and required desegregation plans can be seen for other definitions of high minority schools.

The increase in the proportion of minority students in schools with from 50 percent or more to 90 percent or more enrollment ranged from 7 percent to 2 percent. The inverse relationship between degree of change and the three levels of ""high minority schools"" may be due to a ceiling effect operating at the highest level. In any event, MSAP districts experienced an increase in the concentration of minority students enrolled in high minority schools.

In both years, the average percentage is lowest for white students. Nevertheless, the average proportion of students attending schools with 50 percent or more minority enrollment increased for all racial-ethnic groups, including whites.25 The average proportion of students attending schools with 75 percent or more minority students, and 90 percent or more minority students also increased for every racial-ethnic group.26  24 25 26  See Table A-II-11 in Appendix II.

The proportion of minority students attending minority-isolated schools is somewhat greater in districts with voluntary plans than in districts with required desegregation plans. During the four-year period prior to the start of the 1998 MSAP grants, the average percentage of minority students who attend high minority schools in MSAP districts increased. The average proportion of students who are enrolled in high minority schools in MSAP districts increased for all minority groups and for whites at different thresholds for identifying high minority schools.  School Choices within MSAP Districts The school choices available to students within a district are an important part of the context within which MSAP-supported schools and programs operate. In some districts, the demand for access to federally funded magnet programs may be greater than MSAP projects can handle, and districts may try to manage this demand by using waiting lists. In other districts, the federally sponsored magnet programs may face competition from other educational programs, making recruitment of students more difficult. We examine two questions that reflect on the district context of school choice:     To what extent do MSAP projects maintain waiting lists and how are they used? To what extent do other schools compete with MSAP-supported schools and programs for students?  American Institutes for Research  II-9   Characteristics of MSAP Districts  Waiting Lists Nearly two-thirds (63 percent) of MSAP Project Directors report that waiting lists are maintained for one or more of their MSAP programs, either by the district or the school. More than three quarters (77 percent) of districts with required desegregation plans and more than one half (52 percent) of districts with voluntary desegregation plans maintain waiting lists.27 Almost all of the projects that maintain waiting lists use them into the school year, permitting students on the list to be admitted after the start of the school year if space becomes available. In only a few districts is the list kept beyond a year, and students must reapply if they are still eligible for entry in a subsequent year.  Educational Alternatives to MSAP Programs Federally funded magnet programs may be one of several options available to students. More than half (54 percent) of the MSAP Project Directors report a great deal of competition for students from one or more educational programs.28 Strong competition for students is more likely to be reported in districts with required desegregation plans than in those with voluntary plans (67 percent vs. 41 percent, respectively), as shown in Figure II-7. The figure also indicates that the largest factor in this difference is that over one third (37 percent) of districts with required desegregation plans report competition from non-MSAP magnets (that is, magnets funded by the district), as compared with less than one tenth (7 percent) of districts with voluntary plans. MSAP districts with required desegregation plans have a median of six non-MSAP magnets in the district; districts with voluntary plans have a median of two.29 Other public schools present a great deal of competition for students in about one fifth of districts with either voluntary or required desegregation plans (21 and 22 percent, respectively), and religious schools provide a great deal of competition in a similar proportion of districts.30 Private non-sectarian schools are seen as a major source of competition by almost one quarter (24 percent) of districts with voluntary desegregation plans, compared with about one tenth (11 percent) of districts with required plans. Neither charter nor home schools are seen as major sources of competition for students in districts with either required or voluntary desegregation plans. In fact, when asked whether various forms of schooling provided no competition, some competition, or a lot of competition for students, approximately 70 percent of MSAP Project Directors reported that there was no competition from charter schools in their district.  27  28 29 30  See Table A-II-15 in Appendix II. See Table A-II-16 in Appendix II. See Table A-II-17 in Appendix II. Although the data are not shown in Figure II-7, MSAP Project Directors in 27 percent of the voluntary districts and 23 percent of the required districts report a great deal of competition from at least one of the two types of private educational institutions: religious and nonsectarian.

MSAP districts tend to be large, with over three-quarters having enrollments of 10,000 or more students. Minority students represent an average of nearly two-thirds (62 percent) of students in MSAP districts. Black students represent the largest minority group, with an average of about one third of all students in MSAP districts. Minority students outnumber white students in two thirds (66 percent) of MSAP districts, with black students constituting a majority in 21 percent of MSAP districts and Hispanic students representing a majority in 11 percent of MSAP districts. The average percentage of minority students in MSAP districts increased by four percent between 1993-94 and the start of the MSAP grant period in 1998. The proportion of Hispanic students in MSAP districts increased more than that of any other racial-ethnic group.  American Institutes for Research  Private  Charter  Home  Other  of  schools  II-11   Characteristics of MSAP Districts       The average proportion of minority students attending minority-isolated schools in MSAP districts is four to five times greater than the average for school districts nationwide. The average proportions of both minority and non-minority students attending high minority schools increased between 1993-94 and the start of the 1998 MSAP programs. Over half of the MSAP Project Directors report that their programs face a great deal of competition for students from other educational programs. Districts with required desegregation plans are more likely to report strong competition for students than districts with voluntary desegregation plans. The largest factor in this difference is that competition comes more frequently from other magnet schools (not funded by MSAP) in districts with required desegregation plans.  What We Hope to Learn  District characteristics and trends in the enrollment and distribution of students represent the context within which federally funded magnet schools and programs operate. As the data become available to assess the success of projects in meeting their program goals, we hope to learn more about the types of district characteristics, and the trends in enrollment and distribution of students, that are associated with the success MSAP projects have in meeting those goals.

This information may be used in a variety of ways, some of which are outlined below.  Reporting results to parents of individual students. The test reports contain information about the student's scores in relation to the passing standards and areas in which the student may need additional instruction. In addition, test results from multiple administrations can give insight into whether the student is making progress over time. This information can help parents more fully understand their child's academic achievement. Reporting results to the local school board, school professionals, and the community. Although individual students' scores are confidential by law, reports of group (aggregated) scores are considered public record. However, if the specific group (e.g., limited English proficient students) contains fewer than five students, scores are not included in reports in order to protect student confidentiality. Evaluating student scores for placement decisions. State law requires that additional instruction be made available for students exhibiting difficulty with skills assessed on the TAAS tests. Student test results may also be used in conjunction with other performance indicators to assist in making placement decisions. All placement decisions should incorporate as much data as possible about a student. Evaluating programs, resources, and staffing patterns. Campus and district test in evaluating a particular program, resource, or staffing pattern. For example, a results to evaluate its improvement in an at-risk program or to assess the need to staff on a particular group of students. All evaluations of programs, resources, should incorporate as much data as possible about a campus or district. results may be used campus may use its focus resources and and staffing patterns          Evaluating district and campus curriculum and instruction. Because the TAAS tests are designed to measure a sampling of the state-mandated curriculum for a content area, considering performance results by subject area and by objective may be helpful when evaluating curriculum and instruction. Generalizations from test results may be made to the specific content domain represented by the objective or set of objectives being measured on the exam. However, because the tests are measuring a finite set of skills with a limited set of item types, generalizations should be made only to student achievement as measured on a particular test. All evaluations of campus or district instructional quality should incorporate as much data as possible about the campus or district.  Test Scores Texas Assessment of Academic Skills (TAAS) The following gives a brief description of the scores provided on the TAAS tests. For more-detailed technical information about test scores, refer to the Texas Student Assessment Program Technical Digest.  Raw score. The raw score is the number of items answered correctly on a subject area test. By itself, the raw score has limited utility; it can be interpreted only in reference to the total number of items on a subject area test, and raw scores should not be compared across administrations. The raw score is provided for all TAAS tests. TAAS scale score. The scale score is a statistic that provides a comparison of scores with the minimum expectations standard. The scale score ranges from approximately 400 to 2400, with a minimum expectations score of 1500. The score of 1500 accommodates for differences in the difficulty of the test form used for each administration. Thus, the scale score can be used to determine whether a student met minimum expectations, but it cannot be used to evaluate student progress across grades. The scale score is provided for TAAS writing tests. Texas Learning Index. The Texas Learning Index (TLI) is a statistic that allows for comparison both across years and across grades within a subject area for TAAS reading and mathematics tests at exit 107       level. The TLI ranges from 0 to the maximum score possible on a subject area test and is preceded by a digit representing the grade level (e.g., X-83 for exit level). The minimum expectations score of 70 represents the same amount of achievement at each administration. Thus, the TLI score can be used to assess learning progress within a subject area across administrations.  Test Standards The following gives a brief description of the standards used on the TAAS tests. For more detailed technical information on test standards, refer to the Texas Student Assessment Program Technical Digest.  Minimum expectations. In 1990, the State Board of Education adopted a TAAS writing, reading, and mathematics minimum expectations standard equivalent to approximately 70% of the items correct on each subject area test. On the TAAS writing test, the board also required that students obtain at least a 2 on the written composition in order to meet minimum expectations. Performance relative to the minimum expectations/passing standard is provided for TAAS reading, mathematics, and writing tests. Since TAAS had a one-year phase-in of the 70% passing standard, exit level students who were first eligible to test during the 19901991 school year and who did not meet the minimum requirements or take all sections of the test continue to be evaluated with a standard equivalent to the 19901991 standard of approximately 60% of the items correct. At exit level, test results for a student for whom the performance status is unknown are displayed on summary reports as not meeting minimum expectations. This may be caused by a mismatch between the student identification information coded on the student's answer document and the information contained in the history file (a computer record of the results from TAAS exit level tests for all students for whom answer documents were submitted in previous test administrations).  Objective mastery. Objective mastery refers to the number of items that must be answered correctly to demonstrate competency in the skills targeted by the objective as defined and assessed on the particular instrument. These data can be useful as a preliminary survey to help identify skill areas in which further diagnosis is warranted. In TAAS writing, a score of 3 or 4 on the written composition is needed to master Objectives 14. Performance relative to the objective mastery standards is provided for TAAS reading, mathematics, and writing tests. Mastered all objectives. ""Mastered all objectives"" appears on a report when a student achieves mastery on all the objectives on a subject area test. This standard represents a higher level of achievement than the minimum expectations standard and can be useful in surveying which students have a broad understanding of a particular subject area as it is assessed on the test. In TAAS writing, students must also obtain either a 3 or 4 on the written composition to master all objectives. Performance relative to the mastered-all-objectives standard is provided for TAAS reading, mathematics, and writing tests. Academic Recognition. Academic Recognition is used to identify a high level of achievement on a TAAS test and is awarded to students who correctly answer 95% or more of the items on a particular subject area test. To achieve Academic Recognition on the TAAS writing test, a student must correctly answer 95% or more of the multiple-choice items and receive a 4 on the written composition. Exit level students are eligible to receive Academic Recognition only if they are testing for the first time in a subject area. For students achieving Academic Recognition, the words ""Academic Recognition"" will be printed on the students' reports and labels. Performance relative to the Academic Recognition standard is provided for TAAS reading, mathematics, and writing tests. ""All Tests Taken"" refers to the performance of students on the three subject area tests. Meeting minimum expectations on all tests taken or mastering all objectives on all tests taken does not necessarily mean the student passed or mastered every subject tested. For instance, if a student taking TAAS passes the reading and mathematics tests but is absent for writing, the student has met    Texas Assessment of Academic Skills (TAAS)    108   minimum expectations on all tests taken because the student passed both of the subject area tests the student took.  Appropriate Score Uses TAAS test results have several uses for individual students and for comparing the performance of groups. A more detailed explanation of appropriate score uses can be found in the Texas Student Assessment Program Technical Digest. INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS The TLI and TAAS scale score indicate whether a student has met minimum expectations (achieving a TLI of 70 or above or a scale score of 1500 or above) and how far the student's achievement is above or below the passing standard. All enrolled students failing to meet minimum expectations on one or more TAAS tests must be offered accelerated instruction. In addition, students who fail one or more parts of TAAS are provided with TAAS Study Guides at no additional charge. Test results can also be used to compare the performance of an individual student to the performance of a similar demographic or program group or to an entire campus or district. For example, the scores for a Hispanic student in a gifted and talented program could be compared to the average scores of Hispanic students, gifted and talented students, all the students on a campus, or a combination of these aggregations. Other scores provide information about academic areas of relative strength or weakness. The objective mastery status can provide survey information to help identify areas in which a student may be having difficulty, as indicated on a particular test. Once an area of possible weakness has been identified, supplementary data should be gathered to further define the student's instructional planning needs. GROUPS OF STUDENTS Test results can be used to evaluate the performance of a group over time. Average scale scores, TLIs, and the percent of students meeting minimum expectations can be analyzed across administrations within the same subject area to give insight as to whether student performance is improving across years. For example, the average scale score for students who receive special education services taking the TAAS writing test can be compared for spring 2000, spring 2001, and spring 2002. Test scores can also be used to compare the performance of different demographic or program groups to each other. All TAAS scores can be analyzed within the same subject area of any single administration to determine which demographic or program group had the highest average TLI (if applicable), the lowest percent meeting minimum expectations, the highest percent mastery of the ""Word Meaning"" objective on TAAS reading, etc. Other scores can be used to help evaluate academic areas of relative strength or weakness. The objective mastery status can provide survey information to help identify areas in which further diagnosis is warranted for a group of students. Test results for groups of students may also be used when evaluating instruction or programs requiring average score or year-to-year comparisons. Because the TAAS tests are designed to measure the statemandated curriculum for a content area, considering test results by subject area and by objective may be helpful when evaluating curriculum and instruction. Generalizations from test results may be made to the specific content domain represented by the objective or set of objectives being measured on the exam. However, because the tests are measuring a finite set of skills with a limited set of item types, generalizations should be made only to student achievement as measured on a particular test. All instruction and program evaluations should include as much information as possible to provide a more complete picture of performance.  Texas Assessment of Academic Skills (TAAS)  109   In addition, all test scores can be compared to regional and statewide performance within the same subject area for any administration.  Cautions for Score Use Several cautions must be kept in mind when analyzing TAAS test results. More-detailed technical information describing cautions for score use is provided in the Texas Student Assessment Program Technical Digest. USING SCORES AT EXTREME ENDS OF THE DISTRIBUTION On the TAAS examinations, as with any test, student scores at the minimum and maximum ends of the score range must be viewed cautiously. For instance, if the maximum TLI for a TAAS subject is X-92 and a student achieves this score, it cannot be determined if the student's true achievement is a TLI of X-92 or if the student would have achieved a higher TLI if that score were possible. In other words, there is no way to know whether, if the test had 10 more items on it, the student would have answered those items correctly and achieved a higher TLI. INTERPRETING TLI SCORES In addition to the cautions already listed, specific issues regarding the interpretation of TLI scores should be kept in mind. More-detailed information about the development and uses of the TLI can be found in the Texas Student Assessment Program Technical Digest. The TLI is not a percentage of items correct. It is a standard score. Its primary functions are to describe how far above or below the passing standard the student is and to indicate whether the student is making progress over time. Similarly, although the TLI ranges are approximately 0 to 100, it would be a misinterpretation to add value labels to ranges of TLI scores (e.g., 90 and above as a grade of ""A,"" 80 to 89 a ""B,"" 70 to 79 a ""C,"" and so on). This is not a valid interpretation of the TLI and overlooks the skills, items, and content that students must learn in order to score in those TLI ranges. USING OBJECTIVE-LEVEL INFORMATION Objective-level information provided with the TAAS exams can be useful as a preliminary survey to help identify skill areas in which further diagnosis is warranted. As with all tests given at a single point in time, the data gleaned from this snapshot should be used in conjunction with other evaluations of performance to provide an in-depth portrait of student achievement. Once an area of possible weakness has been identified, supplementary data should be gathered to further define students' instructional planning needs. Texas Assessment of Academic Skills (TAAS) Furthermore, since the TAAS exams are equated only at the total subject area test level, year-to-year comparisons of objective-level performance should be made cautiously. Every effort is made to approximate the overall difficulty of the objectives from year to year in the test construction process, but some fluctuations in the difficulty of the objectives do occur at every administration. Observing trends in objective-level performance over time, identifying patterns of performance in clusters of objectives testing similar skills, and comparing campus or district objective-level performance to that of the region or state are appropriate uses of group objective-level information.  110   PROGRAM EVALUATION Standardized tests are used for evaluation and accountability in Texas as well as in other states. Test scores can be used as a valuable tool for evaluating programs, but any achievement test can give only one part of the picture. The TAAS exams are not all-encompassing assessments that can measure every factor that contributes to the success or failure of a program. Although more-accurate evaluation decisions can be made by considering all of the data the tests provide, test results can be most helpful if considered as one component of an evaluation system. THE 70% STANDARD AND 70% OF THE ITEMS CORRECT The passing standards for the TAAS tests are related to two factors: (1) the difficulty of the items on the tests, and (2) the number of the items students have to answer correctly to pass. The standard of 70% of the items correct is set on the original form of the particular subject area test. When different test items are used in another test administration, the difficulty of the items, and, thus, the overall difficulty of the test, may fluctuate. To compensate for slight changes in test difficulty, the percent of items needed to pass the test is adjusted. For instance, suppose a test contains fairly easy items when a standard is set at 70%. A subsequent test is administered with slightly more difficult items. If the standard of 70% of the items on the test were used exclusively, the students taking the second test would be held to a higher standard than the students taking the first test. The percent of items required to pass would be the same, but the difficulty of the items would not be. In order to set the standard on the second test to an achievement level equivalent to that of the first test, the tests are equated, and the percent of items required to pass is adjusted. In this case, the percent of items required to pass the second test would be less than 70%, since the items were more difficult.  Report Formats Two types of reports are provided for the TAAS tests: standard and optional reports. Standard reports are provided automatically to districts. In order to receive optional reports, which present student performance data in additional formats and, in some instances, in greater detail, a district must have completed the Optional Reports Order Form and returned it with the scorable materials. Districts are required to pay a nominal fee for most optional reports requested. Reports that include ""confidential"" in the title contain student-level results. All other reports present test results in an aggregated format. More information about the confidentiality of students' test results is contained in the Appendix. Please note that the sample reports included in this guide are for illustration only.

Test results are shown for each subject area tested for that grade or course. Information from this report is useful when reporting test results to students and to parents. A. Identification information Identification information shown at the top of the report indicates the student's name, identification number (as used for PEIMS), local identification number, date of birth, class group, district number and name, campus number and name, the dates of reporting and testing, and grade. B. Objectives listed by subject area Objectives are listed in abbreviated form on the left side of the page. The complete wording of each objective for each test is found in the Appendix. For more information about the content of each test, refer to the Educator's Guide to TEKS-Based Assessment for that subject area. C. Written composition rating TAAS writing objectives 14 are measured by the written composition. This section indicates the rating (from 0 to 4) and analytic scoring information, if any, assigned to the student's written composition. Additional information on the scoring process is included in the Texas Student Assessment Program Technical Digest. Detailed rubric and score point information can be found in the scoring guides. D. Objective mastery and total objectives mastered This column states ""YES"" or ""NO,"" indicating whether the student achieved mastery for the objective, except in the case of the written composition, where the column is marked ""YES"" only if the student achieved a 3 or a 4 on the essay. If the student did not achieve a 3 or a 4, the column for that objective is left blank. The bottom line within each subject area shows the total number of objectives mastered for that subject area, except in the case of the TAAS writing test, where the bottom line shows only the total number of multiple-choice objectives mastered. The standards for objective mastery are listed at the bottom of the report. E. Items correct/tested and total items This column shows the number of items answered correctly followed by the total number of items tested for each objective. The bottom line within each subject area shows the total number of items answered correctly (the raw score) followed by the total number of items tested for each subject area.

In writing, a score of 4 on the written composition is also required. The student was absent during the test. The student was exempted from the test by an admission, review, and dismissal (ARD) committee. (Applies to exit level writing, mathematics, and reading) The student's answer document was coded ""OTHER"" for reasons such as illness during testing or test administration irregularities. The student was eligible for an oral administration, and the test questions and answer choices were read to the student.  NOT TESTED ABSENT NOT TESTED EXEMPTARD  NOT SCORED  ORAL ADMINISTRATION: ITEMS WERE READ TO THE STUDENT (mathematics)  ""NOT SCORED"" may indicate that the student did not test because of a one-time LEP postponement or a foreign exchange student waiver. ""NOT SCORED"" may also indicate that the student passed the subject area during a previous test administration. The cumulative label to be placed on the student's permanent record will indicate previous performance in the subject area(s), if any. If ""RETESTED"" appears, it indicates the student has previously attempted the subject area. If ""??? UNKNOWN -- PENDING PEIMS ID UPDATE"" appears, the minimum expectations standard is unknown, and it is unknown whether the student passed the test. This may be caused by a mismatch between the student identification information coded on the student's answer document and the information contained in the history file (a computer record of the results from TAAS exit level tests for all students for whom answer documents were submitted in previous test administrations). G. Performance standards Specific requirements for objective mastery are found at the bottom of the report. Performance requirements for meeting minimum expectations are shown at the right side of the report. In order for the appropriate minimum expectations standard to be applied (i.e., the standard in effect when the student first tested), the PEIMS identification number, student name, and date of birth must be correct. This standard is more fully described in the Program Overview section for TAAS in this guide. H. Texas Learning Index/Scale score The TLI or scale score corresponding to the student's subject area raw score is shown on the right side of the report. The TLI score ranges from 0 to the maximum score possible on a subject area test. This standard is more fully described in the Program Overview section for TAAS in this guide. Texas Assessment of Academic Skills (TAAS) I. TLI graph The graph of the TLI score shows how far the student's score is above or below the minimum expectations standard (X-70). Document number and print number The boxed number found in the lower left corner is a number assigned to the student's answer document by the contractor. Please refer to this number if questions arise about the scoring of the document. The boxed number in the bottom right corner of the answer document is a print series number used in sequencing the reports as they are printed.
