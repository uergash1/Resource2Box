Three figures with white faces and vibrantly elongated ocher bodies stride across this round stone's surface.       Documentations of South African Khoisan religious and trance practices recorded in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries have been used to interpret not only more recent rock art but also rock paintings and engravings thousands of years old. Southern African rock paintings and engravings often combine geometric forms with images of humans and animals, in what some scholars have argued represents hallucinatory trance imagery. Although the Coldstream Stone itself does not contain references to animals or geometric patterns, some scholars have interpreted it in terms of Khoisan trance practices because of the nasal hemorrhaging of some of the figures.

Its imagery documents a verdant Sahara teeming with life that stands in stark contrast to the arid desert the region has since become. Tassili paintings and engravings, like those of other rock art areas in the Sahara, are commonly divided into at least four chronological periods based on style and content. These are: an archaic tradition depicting wild animals whose antiquity is unknown but certainly goes back well before 4500  B.C. ; a so-called bovidian tradition, which corresponds to the arrival of cattle in North Africa between 4500 and 4000  B.C. ; a ""horse"" tradition, which corresponds to the appearance of horses in the North African archaeological record from about 2000  B.C.  onward; and a ""camel"" tradition, which emerges around the time of Christ when these animals first appear in North Africa. Engravings of animals such as the extinct giant buffalo are among the earliest works, followed later by paintings in which color is used to depict humans and animals with striking naturalism. In the last period, chariots, shields, and camels appear in the rock paintings. Although close to the Iberian Peninsula, it is currently believed that the rock art of Algeria and Tassili developed independently of that in Europe.     While these traditions are successive, it does appear that earlier ones continued on for varying lengths of time after the appearance of later ones. Two important qualifiers need to be made. First, many scholars have recently questioned a pan-Saharan chronology and there is a move away from grandiose chronological schemes to concentrating more on understanding regional chronological variability. Second, the Sahara, given its vast size and various political complications, is still an inadequately researched area in terms of rock art and very few dates exist. As more work is done and techniques for dating advance, it is likely that this four-period dating scheme will be modified in particular regions and that more will be learned about the origins and demise of Saharan rock art.

The word  Afghanistan  is used to refer to that territory, even though, and especially because, it has been known by many other names throughout history.   Afghanistan's history, internal political development, foreign relations, and very existence as an independent state have largely been determined by its geographic location at the crossroads of  Central ,  West , and  South Asia . Over the centuries, waves of migrating peoples passed through the region--described by historian  Arnold Toynbee  as a ""roundabout of the ancient world""--leaving behind a mosaic of ethnic and linguistic groups. In modern times, as well as in antiquity, vast armies of the world passed through this region of Asia, temporarily establishing local control and often dominating.   Invariably, most of Afghanistan's history was spent as part of the larger events that took place upon the  Iranian plateau  as a whole. The  Aryan peoples  who arrived in Afghanistan left their languages, ( Pashto ,  Persian , etc.) and culture as a legacy.   It is perhaps not surprising that it is the Middle Eastern influence (Iranic past and Arab invasions) that has defined modern Afghanistan, while its Greek, Central Asian nomadic, and Zoroastrian/Pagan/Buddhist past have long since vanished. Although it was the scene of great empires and flourishing trade for over two millennia, the area's heterogeneous groups, with  Turkic  groups predominant in the extreme northwest and showing some connection to the mixed  Hazaras  of the central regions, were not bound into a single political entity until the reign of  Ahmed Shah Durrani , who in 1747 founded the monarchy that ruled the country until 1973. In the nineteenth century, Afghanistan lay between the expanding might of the  Russian  and  British  empires. In 1900,  Abdur Rahman Khan  (the ""Iron Amir""), after twenty years of rule, looked at the events of the past century and wondered how his country, which stood ""like a goat between these lions (Britain and Tsarist Russia) or a grain of wheat between two strong millstones of the grinding mill, [could] stand in the midway of the stones without being ground to dust?""   Islam  played perhaps the key role in the formation of Afghanistan's society. Despite the early thirteenth century  Mongol  invasion of what is today Afghanistan--which has been described as resembling ""more some brute cataclysm of the blind forces of nature than a phenomenon of human history,"" even a warrior as formidable as  Genghis Khan  did not uproot Islamic civilization; within two generations, his heirs had become  Muslims . Later, native Afghan empire builders such as the  Ghorids , would continue to make Afghanistan a major medieval power as well as a center of learning that produced  Ferdowsi , and  Al-Biruni  among countless other academics and literary iconic figures.

Further information might be found on the  talk page .  (November 2007)       Excavation of prehistoric sites by Louis Dupree, the  University of Pennsylvania , the  Smithsonian Institution  and others suggests that early humans were living in what is now  Afghanistan  at least 50,000 years ago, and that farming communities in Afghanistan were among the earliest in the world. [ 2 ] [ 3 ]   It is not clear who the early inhabitants of Afghanistan were, though it is likely they were connected through culture and trade to neighboring civilizations like  Jiroft  and  Tappeh Sialk  and the  Indus Valley Civilization . Urban civilization may have begun as early as 3000 BCE, and the early city of  Mundigak  (near  Kandahar ) may have been a colony of the nearby  Indus Valley Civilization .     [ edit ]   Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex   The  Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex  became prominent in the region between 2200 and 1700 BCE (approximately). The city of  Balkh  ( Bactra ) was founded about this time (ca. 2000-1500 BCE). It's possible that the  BMAC  may have been an  Indo-European  culture, perhaps the Proto- Indo-Aryans , who began their migration into India towards the end of this period.   The centuries following the end of the BMAC and the Aryan invasions are not well known due to a lack of source information.     [ edit ]   Indus Valley Civilization   The  Indus Valley Civilization  possibly became prominent in the southern and eastern parts of the region at the same time.     [ edit ]   Ancient Afghanistan, Pre-Islamic period (before 651)             Please help  improve this article or section  by expanding it.  Further information might be found on the  talk page .  (November 2007)           Main article:  Pre-Islamic period of Afghanistan              Ancient Afghanistan was often ruled by various Persian dynasties, such as the  Achaemenid Empire  (559330 BCE)               Alexander the Great  fighting the Persian king  Darius  ( Pompeii  mosaic, from a 4th century BCE original Greek painting, now lost).       After several centuries of darkness, history returns to find kingdoms formed in  Arachosia ,  Bactria ,  Aria , and  Gandhara . Parts of the region were controlled by the  Medean Empire  until it was overthrown in 550 BCE by their  Achaemenid  vassals. This Achaemenid  Persian Empire  soon conquered the rest of Afghanistan and ruled for over 200 years. During the 320s BCE, Afghanistan and the rest of the Persian Empire was conquered by  Alexander the Great  and became part of his empire, which empire fragmented after his death in 323 BCE as his generals fought for supremacy. A general named  Seleucus  carved out the largest  Hellenistic  kingdom, the  Seleucid Empire , which included most of Iran and Afghanistan. In 305 BCE the Seleucids gave Arachosia and Gandhara to the  Mauryan Empire  of India in return for a treaty of alliance and 500 Indian war elephants.   Bactria and Aria remained in Seleucid hands until 250 BCE, when the Bactrian Satrap  Diodotus  rebelled and established the  Greco-Bactrian Kingdom . A campaign by Seleucid King Antiochus III led to the restoration of many of the eastern provinces in the late 200s BCE.     [ edit ]   Mauryan rule to Indo-Greco-Bactrian Kingdoms          'The  Dipavamisa  and the  Mahavamsa  speak of two Maurya princes  Ashoka  and Susima , also called Sumana as being entrusted durying the reign of their father  Bindusara  with the administration of Avantirattha and  Utaparttha  respectively. [ 4 ]                 Utharpatha included Kashmir , Punjab and Afghanistan having its capital at  Taxila  in Rawalpindi district. [ 4 ]          The Mauryan Dynasty was overthrown in 185 BCE by a general named  Pusyamitra Sunga , who founded the  Sunga Dynasty . This led to war with the  Greco-Bactrian  allies of the Mauryans, led by King  Demetrius I , who quickly overran Afghanistan and the Indus region, then marched towards the Sunga capital. Suddenly a civil war broke out amongst the Greeks when a general named  Eucratides  overthrew Demetrius' brother  Antimachus I , forcing Demetrius to abandon his Indian campaign and defend his throne, but he was defeated and restricted to his newly-conquered territories in India, which became known as the  Indo-Greek Kingdom .   Greco-Bactria continued until ca. 130 BC, when Eucratides' son, King Heliocles I, was defeated and driven out of Bactria by the Yuezhi tribes. It is thought that his dynasty continued to rule in  Kabul  and  Alexandria of the Caucasus  until 70 BCE when  King Hermaeus  was defeated by the Yuezhi.   One of Demetrius' successors,  Menander I , brought the Indo-Greek Kingdom to its height between 165-130 BC, expanding the kingdom in India to even larger proportions than Demetrius. After Menander's death, the Indo-Greeks steadily declined and the last Indo-Greek king was defeated in ca. 10 AD.

Driven from the Tarim Basin by the Xiongnu in the early 100s BC, the Yuezhi pushed a  Scythian  tribe called the  Indo-Scythians  or Sakas, south into the Greco-Bactrian lands. In 140 BC they defeated the last Greco-Bactrian King, Heliocles I. Soon afterwards, the Indo-Scythians captured Arachosia from the Indo-Greeks (Arachosia was then renamed  Sistan ). Unable to invade India from the north, the Indo-Scythians took a more southerly route, through  Gedrosia  to Sindh, then moving north along the Indus river.   The Indo-Scythians were defeated by the  Parthian Empire  and driven from Sistan into India by 20 AD, where they founded the  Western Satraps  Kingdom that survived until about 405 AD. In the meantime, Parthia's hold on the region was tenuous, and soon broke away to become the short-lived Kingdom of the  Indo-Parthians .     In Bactria, the  Yuezhi  were united in the mid 1st century CE to become the  Kushan Empire .     [ edit ]   Northern region   Northern parts of Greco-Bactria were conquered by the  Tocharian  or  Yuezhi  tribes in the 140s BC, while the  Indo-Scythians  or  Sakas  conquered Arachosia (which became known as Sakastan and later  Sistan . The Indo-Scythians fled to India after they were defeated by the  Parthians  and  Indo-Parthians  in the early 1st century AD.   Invasions by the  Kushans ,  Sassanid  Persians,  Hephthalites  or  White Huns , and  Gktrks  followed in succeeding centuries.     [ edit ]   Kushans  and  Buddhism   During the  Kushan  rule, Afghanistan became the center of  Buddhist  culture and learning.          The Kushan empire reached its zenith in the reign of Kanishk the Great (AD78-144) who was responsible for the preservation development and propagation of the Buddhist religion and arts in the far east .

Further information might be found on the  talk page .  (November 2007)       By 642  CE , Arabs had conquered  Persia  and invaded Afghanistan from the west, introducing Islam. Afghanistan at the time had local rulers called the  Kushano-Hephthalites  or  Shahi , which were under the influence of the empire of  Tang China , which had extended its influence all the way to  Kabul . The Khorasani Persian-Arabs controlled the western and northern areas until they were conquered by the  Ghaznavid Empire  in 998.   The Arab forces did not conquer all of Afghanistan. The southern and eastern parts of Afghanistan remained independent, first as part of the  Kushano-Hephthalite  Kingdoms (from 565 to 870 AD), then as part of the Hindu  Shahi  Kingdom of  Gandhara , which lasted until it was conquered by the Muslim  Ghaznavid Empire  in 1021 AD.   Mahmud of Ghazni  (998-1030) consolidated the conquests of his predecessors and turned Ghazna ( Ghazni ) into a great cultural center as well as a base for frequent forays into India. The Ghaznavid dynasty was defeated in 1148 by the  Ghurids  ( Ghor ), but Ghaznavid Khans continued to live in Ghazni as the ' Nasher ' until the early 20th century, but they did not regain their once vast power until about 500 years later when the  Ghilzai   Pashtuns 's defeated the  Safavid  Persians in Kandahar. Various princes and  Seljuk  rulers attempted to rule parts of the country until the  Shah   Muhammad II  of the  Khwarezmid Empire  conquered all of Persia in 1205. By 1219, the empire had fallen to the  Mongols .

The country became a part of  Mongol Empire . Ghazni was main base for the Mongol campaigns of India.  Neguderis  settled there under the rule of  Chagatai Khans  while most of Afghanistan was a part of  Ilkhanate . De-facto of  Chagatai Khanate   Tamerlane , incorporated what is today Afghanistan into his own vast Asian empire.  Babur , a descendant of Timur and the founder of  Moghul Empire  at the beginning of the 16th century, made Kabul the capital.

(November 2007)       Afghanistan was divided from the 16th to the early 18th centuries. In the North were the  Uzbeks , the west was under  Safavid  Persia's rule and the east was ruled by the  Mughals  and local  Pashtun  rule. In 1706, the Afghans (Pashstuns), led by  Mirwais Khan Hotak  decided to rise against the Persian Safavids. The Persians were expelled. In 1721  Mir Mahmud Hotaki , son of Mirwais led the Afghans in invading Persia. The Persians were defeated in  the Battle of Gulnabad . The Afghans captured  Isfahan  ( Iran ) in 1722. Mir Mahmud became the Persian Shah. He began a reign of terror against his Persian subjects and was eventually murdered by his own troops. They selected  Ashraf Khan  as the new Afghan leader. He was able to secure peace with the  Ottomans  in 1727. However, in the next year,  Nadir Shah  of Persia launched a national revolt against the Afghan occupiers. He defeated the Afghans in the 1729 Battle of Damghan. Ashraf was killed the next year trying to flee back to Afghanistan. In 1739, Nadir Shah conquered Kandahar, and occupied Ghazni, Kabul and Lahore. After his death in 1747, the  Durrani  Pashtuns became the principal Afghan rulers.  [ 10 ]     [ edit ]   Hotaki dynasty (1709-1736)       Main article:  Hotaki dynasty                 The excessive length of this article or section may adversely affect readability.   Please  discuss  this issue on the talk page, split the content into subarticles, and keep this page in a  summary style .       A picture of life in the old city of  Kandahar  under  Timurids ,  Safavids  and the Moghuls has begun to emerge since the British Institute began its excavations in 1974. Bronze ewers, imported glazed ceramics and ornate glass from Persia and imported porcelains from China speak of widespread trade. Locally made glazed wares in the Persian style speak of a cultural orientation toward the west.   On the whole, the indigenous  Pashtun  tribes living in the Kandahar area were more attached to the Persians and, indeed, on those occasions when the Moghuls received the city by means other than conquest, it was disaffected Persian governors who instigated the transfer, not the tribes. The tribes were not above pitting foreigner against foreigner in order to further their attempts to better one another. However, siding sometimes with the Persians, sometimes with the Moghuls, but never with each other, they perpetuated tribal disunity and prolonged foreign domination.   The principal contenders in these tribal disputes came from the two most important Pashtun groups in the Kandahar area, the  Ghilzai  and the  Abdali  (later  Durrani ), between whom there was long-standing enmity. As a matter of fact, because of these quarrels, many of the turbulent Abdali had been forcibly transferred to  Herat  by the irritated Persians by the end of the 16th century. This left the Ghilzai paramount in Kandahar, but the dispute more hotly contested, the hatred more deeply entrenched, and revenge more fervently sought.   The Persians were adept at manipulating such machinations and their rule at Kandahar was tolerant until the court at Isfahan began to sink in decadence. Mirroring this, the Persian governors of Kandahar became more and more rapacious and, in response, the tribes became more and more restless. Mounting tribal disturbances finally caught the concern of the court and they sent  Gurgin Khan , a Georgian known for his uncompromising severity toward revolt, to Kandahar in 1704. Kandahar's mayor at this time was  Mirwais Khan Hotak , the astute and influential leader of the Ghilzai.   Gurgin, advocate of law by force, burnt, plundered, murdered and imprisoned, but the tribes would not be subdued; revolts were crushed only to break out anew and Mirwais, credited with master-minding the rebellions, was sent to  Isfahan  tagged as a highly dangerous prisoner. Imagine Gurgin's surprise and dismay when Mirwais returned to Kandahar shortly thereafter clothed in lustrous robes of honor, symbols of respect and trust. The Shah of Persia thus declared the influence of Mirwais, not Gurgin, at the Persian court. Mirwais had extricated himself from a very nasty situation but, more importantly, he had observed the depths of decay at Isfahan, much as  Babur  had observed it at Herat, and correctly determined that the Safavid Empire was on the brink of collapse.   Mirwais formulated plans for disposing of the hated Gurgin; only the difficult task of waiting for the right moment remained.   The moment came in April, 1709. Because details of the assassination are varied, this discussion recounts the version popular among Kandarians today who say that Mirwais invited Gurgin to a picnic at his country estate at Kohkran on the outskirts of Kandahar city. Here the guests were fed all manner of rich dishes and plied with strong wines until ""everyone was plunged in debauch."" This was the moment. Mirwais struck, killing Gurgin, and his followers killed the Georgian's escort. The rebels then marched to take possession of the citadel.   Isfahan was astounded and sent emissaries to complain. The emissaries were imprisoned. Isfahan sent armies to take the city. The armies were defeated. The Persian court then sat in stunned idleness while Mirwais extended his authority throughout the Kandahar region.   If they were to remain free, the tribes must be united and to this formidable task the venerable statesman devoted the rest of his life. But not many years were left for Mirwais. He died in 1715. An imposing blue domed mausoleum at Kohkaran Bagh, next to the orchard where Gurgin was assassinated, is a fitting monument to Afghanistan's first great nationalist.   The qualities which enabled Mirwais to lead the tribes toward a meaningful unity were not, unfortunately, inherited by his ambitious 18 year old son, Mahmood, whose visions only encompassed conquest and power. Killing his uncle, elected successor to Mirwais, Mahmood gathered his followers and marched across Persia and seized the Safavid throne (1722). Mahmood met an early death in 1725 and was succeeded by his cousin, Ashraf, who ruled until 1730 when a new soldier-of-fortune, the Turkman Nadir Quli Beg, ended Ghilzai rule. [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   Durrani Empire (1747-1818)       Main article:  Durrani Empire       Ahmed Shah Durrani , the founder of the  Durrani Empire  and the modern state of Afghanistan, established his rule in 1747 at  Kandahar . Ahmad Shah, a  Pashtun  from the  Abdali  clan, was elected King in a  loya jirga  after the assassination of Nadir Shah Afshari in the same year. Throughout his reign, Ahmad Shah consolidated chieftains, petty principalities, and fragmented provinces into one country. His rule extended from  Mashad  in the west to  Kashmir  and  Delhi  in the east, and from the Amu Darya (Oxus) River in the north to the Arabian Sea in the south. With the exception of a 9-month period in 1929, all of Afghanistan's rulers until the 1978 Marxist coup were from  Durrani 's Pashtun tribal confederation, and all were members of that tribe's  Mohammedzai  clan after 1818.

Collision between the expanding  British  and  Russian Empires  significantly influenced Afghanistan during the 19th century in what was termed "" The Great Game ."" British concern over Russian advances in  Central Asia  and growing influence in Persia culminated in two Anglo-Afghan wars and ""The Siege of Herat"" 1837-1838, in which Persians trying to retake Afghanistan and throw out the British and Russians sent armies into the country waging wars with the British mostly around and in the city of  Herat . The  first  (1839-1842) resulted in the destruction of a British army; it is remembered as an example of the ferocity of Afghan resistance to foreign rule. The  second Anglo-Afghan war  (1878-1880) was sparked by Amir  Shir Ali 's refusal to accept a British mission in Kabul. This conflict brought  Amir Abdur Rahman  to the Afghan throne. During his reign (1880-1901), the British and Russians officially established the boundaries of what would become modern Afghanistan. The British retained effective control over  Kabul 's foreign affairs.   Afghanistan remained neutral during  World War I , despite  German  encouragement of anti-British feelings and Afghan rebellion along the borders of  British India . The Afghan king's policy of neutrality was not universally popular within the country, however.   Habibullah , Abdur Rahman's son and successor, was assassinated in 1919, possibly by family members opposed to British influence. His third son,  Amanullah , regained control of Afghanistan's foreign policy after launching the  Third Anglo-Afghan war  with an attack on India in the same year. During the ensuing conflict, the war-weary British relinquished their control over Afghan foreign affairs by signing the  Treaty of Rawalpindi  in August 1919. In commemoration of this event, Afghans celebrate  August 19  as their  Independence Day .     [ edit ]   Reforms of Amanullah Khan and civil war (1919-1929)          By 1921,  banditry  was dramatically curtailed in Afghanistan by harsh punishment, such as being imprisoned in suspended cages and left to die.           Main article:  Reforms of Amanullah Khan and civil war       King  Amanullah  (1919-1929) moved to end his country's traditional isolation in the years following the Third Anglo-Afghan war. He established diplomatic relations with most major countries and, following a 1927 tour of  Europe  and  Turkey  (during which he noted the modernization and secularization advanced by  Atatrk ), introduced several reforms intended to modernize Afghanistan. A key force behind these reforms was  Mahmud Tarzi ,  Amanullah Khan 's Foreign Minister and father-in-law - and an ardent supporter of the education of women. He fought for Article 68 of Afghanistan's first constitution (declared through a  Loya Jirga ), which made elementary education compulsory. [ 19 ]  Some of the reforms that were actually put in place, such as the abolition of the traditional  Muslim   veil  for women and the opening of a number of co-educational schools, quickly alienated many tribal and religious leaders. Faced with overwhelming armed opposition, Amanullah was forced to abdicate in January 1929 after  Kabul  fell to forces led by  Habibullah Kalakani .     [ edit ]   Reigns of Nadir Shah and Zahir Shah (1929-1973)       Main article:  Reigns of Nadir Shah and Zahir Shah       Prince  Mohammed Nadir Khan , a cousin of Amanullah's, in turn defeated and killed Habibullah Kalakani in October of the same year, and with considerable Pashtun tribal support he was declared King Nadir Shah. He began consolidating power and regenerating the country. He abandoned the reforms of  Amanullah Khan  in favour of a more gradual approach to modernisation. In 1933, however, he was assassinated in a revenge killing by a  Kabul  student.   Mohammad Zahir Shah , Nadir Khan's 19-year-old son, succeeded to the throne and reigned from 1933 to 1973. Until 1946 Zahir Shah ruled with the assistance of his uncle  Sardar Mohammad Hashim Khan , who held the post of Prime Minister and continued the policies of Nadir Shah. In 1946, another of Zahir Shah's uncles,  Sardar Shah Mahmud Khan , became Prime Minister and began an experiment allowing greater political freedom, but reversed the policy when it went further than he expected. In 1953, he was replaced as Prime Minister by  Mohammed Daoud Khan , the king's cousin and brother-in-law. Daoud sought a closer relationship with the  Soviet Union  and a more distant one towards  Pakistan . However, disputes with Pakistan led to an economic crisis and he was asked to resign in 1963. From 1963 until 1973, Zahir Shah took a more active role.   In 1964, King Zahir Shah promulgated a liberal constitution providing for a bicameral legislature to which the king appointed one-third of the deputies. The people elected another third, and the remainder were selected indirectly by provincial assemblies. Although Zahir's ""experiment in democracy"" produced few lasting reforms, it permitted the growth of unofficial extremist parties on both the left and the right. These included the communist  People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan  (PDPA), which had close ideological ties to the  Soviet Union . In 1967, the PDPA split into two major rival factions: the  Khalq  (Masses) faction headed by  Nur Muhammad Taraki  and  Hafizullah Amin  and supported by elements within the military, and the  Parcham  (Banner) faction led by  Babrak Karmal . The split reflected ethnic, class, and ideological divisions within Afghan society. However, most of the following presidents and heads of state were Ghilzai (Taraki, Amin, Najib, Mullah Omar), once again trying to wrest power from the Durrani.     [ edit ]   Daoud's Republic of Afghanistan (1973-1978)       Main article:  Daoud's Republic of Afghanistan       Amid charges of corruption and malfeasance against the royal family and poor economic conditions created by the severe 1971-72 drought, former Prime Minister  Mohammad Sardar Daoud Khan  seized power in a military coup on July 17, 1973 while Zahir Shah was receiving treatment for eye problems and therapy for lumbago in  Italy . [ 20 ]  Daoud abolished the monarchy, abrogated the 1964 constitution, and declared Afghanistan a republic with himself as its first President and Prime Minister. His attempts to carry out badly needed economic and social reforms met with little success, and the new constitution promulgated in February 1977 failed to quell chronic political instability.   As disillusionment set in, in 1978 a prominent member of the  People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan  (PDPA), Mir Akbar Khyber (or ""Kaibar""), was killed by the government. The leaders of PDPA apparently feared that Daoud was planning to exterminate them all, especially since most of them were arrested by the government shortly after.  Hafizullah Amin  and a number of military wing officers of the PDPA's  Khalq  faction (more independent of Moscow than the  Parcham  faction) managed to remain at large and organized an uprising.     [ edit ]   Democratic Republic of Afghanistan (1978-1979)   On  27 April  1978 the PDPA, led by  Nur Mohammad Taraki ,  Babrak Karmal  and Amin overthrew the regime of Mohammad Daoud, who was killed along with his family. The uprising was known as the  Great Saur Revolution  ('Saur' corresponds to parts of 'April' and May). On  1 May , Taraki became  President  ,  Prime Minister  and  General Secretary  of the PDPA. The country was then renamed the  Democratic Republic of Afghanistan  (DRA), and the PDPA regime lasted, in some form or another, until April 1992.   Once in power, the PDPA implemented a liberal and socialist agenda. It moved to replace religious and traditional laws with secular and Marxist ones. Men were obliged to cut their beards, women couldn't wear a  burqa , and mosques were placed off limits. It carried out an ambitious  land reform , waiving farmers' debts countrywide and banning  usury .   The government also made a number of decrees on  womens rights , banning forced marriages, giving state recognition of womens right to vote, and introducing women to political life. A prominent example was Anahita Ratebzad, who was a major Marxist leader and a member of the Revolutionary Council. Ratebzad wrote the famous  New Kabul Times  editorial ( May 28 ,  1978 ) which declared: Privileges which women, by right, must have are equal education, job security, health services, and free time to rear a healthy generation for building the future of the country .... Educating and enlightening women is now the subject of close government attention.   The PDPA invited the  Soviet Union  to assist in modernizing its economic infrastructure (predominantly its exploration and mining of rare minerals and natural gas). The  USSR  also sent contractors to build roads, hospitals and schools and to drill water wells; they also trained and equipped the Afghan army. Upon the PDPA's ascension to power, and the establishment of the DRA, the Soviet Union promised monetary aid amounting to at least $1.262 billion.          Soviet troops withdrawing from Afghanistan in 1988.       The majority of people in the cities including Kabul either welcomed or were ambivalent to these policies. However, the  secular  nature of the government made it unpopular with conservative Afghans in the villages and the countryside, who favoured traditionalist 'Islamic' restrictions on women's rights and in daily life. Many groups - partly led by members of the traditional establishment who lost their privileges in the land reform - were formed in an attempt to reverse dependence on the Soviet Union, some resorting to violence and sabotage of the country's industry and infrastructure. The government responded with heavy-handed military reprisals and arrested, exiled and executed many  Mujahideen  ""holy Muslim warriors"". The Mujahideen belonged to various different factions, but all shared, to varying degrees, a similarly conservative 'Islamic' ideology.   The U.S. saw the situation as a prime opportunity to weaken the  Soviet Union . As part of a  Cold War  strategy, in 1979 the  United States government  (under President  Jimmy Carter  and National Security Advisor  Zbigniew Brzezinski ) began to covertly fund and train anti-government  Mujahideen  forces through the Pakistani secret service known as  Inter Services Intelligence  (ISI), with the intention of provoking Soviet intervention, (according to Brzezinski).   In March 1979 Hafizullah Amin took over as prime minister, retaining the position of  field marshal  and becoming vice-president of the Supreme Defence Council. Taraki remained President and in control of the Army. On  14 September , Amin overthrew Taraki, who died or was killed.     [ edit ]   Soviet intervention (1979-1992)       Main articles:  Democratic Republic of Afghanistan  and  Soviet war in Afghanistan                 The  neutrality  of this section is  disputed .   Please see the discussion on the  talk page .  (December 2007)   Please do not remove this message until the  dispute is resolved.       In 1979, with the Afghan army unable to cope with the large number of violent incidents, the Soviet Union sent troops to crush the uprising, install a pro-Moscow government, and support the new government. On  December 25 ,  1979 , the Soviet army entered  Kabul . This was the starting point of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and the  Soviet war in Afghanistan , which ended only in 1989 with a full withdrawal of Soviet troops under the  Geneva Accords  reached in 1988 between Afghanistan and Pakistan.   For over nine years, the Soviet Army conducted military operations against the Afghan mujahideen rebels. The  American   CIA ,  Pakistan , and  Saudi Arabia  assisted in the financing of the resistance because of their anti-communist stance.   Among the foreign participants in the war was  Osama bin Laden , whose  Maktab al-Khidamat  (MAK)  (Office of Order)  organization trained a small number of mujahideen and provided some arms and funds to fight the Soviets. Bin Laden played only a limited part in this conflict and, in 1988, he broke away from the MAK with some of its more militant members to form  Al-Qaida , in order to expand the anti-Soviet resistance effort into a worldwide Islamic fundamentalist movement.   The Soviet Union withdrew its troops in February 1989, but continued to aid the government, led by  Mohammed Najibullah . Massive amounts of aid from the CIA and Saudi Arabia to the mujahideen also continued.     [ edit ]   1990s       Main article:  History of Afghanistan since 1992       After the  collapse of the Soviet Union , the Najibullah government was overthrown on  April 18 ,  1992  when  Abdul Rashid Dostum  mutinied, and allied himself with  Ahmed Shah Massoud , to take control of  Kabul  and declare the Islamic State of Afghanistan. When the victorious mujahideen entered  Kabul  to assume control over the city and the central government, internecine fighting began between the various militias, which had coexisted only uneasily during the Soviet occupation. With the demise of their common enemy, the militias' ethnic, clan, religious, and personality differences surfaced, and civil war continued.   An interim  Islamic Jihad Council  was put in place, first led by  Sibghatullah Mojadeddi  for two months, then by  Burhanuddin Rabbani . Fighting among rival factions intensified. In reaction to the anarchy and  warlordism  prevalent in the country, and the lack of  Pashtun  representation in the Kabul government, the  Taliban , a movement of religious scholars and former mujahideen, emerged from the southern province of  Kandahar . These  Taliban  took control of approximately 95% of the country by the end of 2000, limiting the opposition mostly to a small corner in the northeast. The opposition formed the  Afghan Northern Alliance , which continued to receive  diplomatic recognition  in the  United Nations  as the government of  Afghanistan .     [ edit ]   2000s          President  George W. Bush  and President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan appear together in 2006 at a joint news conference.       In response to the Taliban support of Al Qaida, the terrorist group that perpetrated the  September 11, 2001 attacks  and the Taliban's refusal to assist the U.S. in prosecuting Al Qaida, the  United States  and its coalition allies launched an  invasion of Afghanistan  to oust the Taliban government. Sponsored by the UN, Afghan factions met in  Bonn ,  Germany  and chose a 30 member interim authority led by  Hamid Karzai , a Pashtun from Kandahar. After governing for 6 months, former  King Zahir Shah  convened a  Loya Jirga , which elected Karzai as president and gave him authority to govern for two more years. Then, on October 9, 2004, Karzai was elected as president of Afghanistan in the country's first ever presidential election.

It was founded in 1709 by  Mirwais Khan Hotak , the chief of the  Ghilzai  Pashtuns [ 1 ]  of  Kandahar . Mirwais and his followers rose against the Persian Safavids, starting in the city of Kandahar in 1709. He began his rule by killing  George XI  ( Gurgn Khn ), the  Georgian  governor of Kandahar and the direct representative the Persian kings. Next, Mirwais ordered the deaths of the remaining Persian government officials in the region. The Ghilzai Afghans then defeated the Persian army that was dispatched from  Isfahan  (capital of the Safavid Empire).   Mirwais Khan Hotak died peacefully in 1715 from natural cause and was succeeded by his son  Mir Mahmud Hotaki , who later led his army to invade Persia. In 1722, Mir Mahmud sacked the city of Isfahan and declared himself  Shah of Persia  (meaning  King of Persia ). However, the great majority still rejected the Ghilzai regime as usurping. For the next 7 years the Hotaki became the de facto rulers of eastern Persia and the  Peshawar  Valley.   The Hotaki dynasty was a troubled and violent one as internecine conflict made it difficult to establish permanent control. The dynasty lived under great turmoil due to bloody succession feuds that made their hold on power tenuous, and after the massacre of thousands of civilians in Isfahan  including more than three thousand religious scholars, nobles, and members of the Safavid family  the Hotaki dynasty was eventually removed from power in Persia. [ 2 ] [ 3 ]  In October 1729, they were defeated by  Nader Shah , head of the  Afsharids , in the  Battle of Damghan  and pushed back to what is now Afghanistan. Nadershah marched his army through Kandahar in 1738 and eliminated the Hotaki dynasty.

It has joined Prague's Old Town and Mala Strana (Lesser Quarter) since its completion in 1402. But Charles Bridge was not the first stone structure to span the river there; it replaced the Judith Bridge, which stood in roughly the same spot and was destroyed by floods in 1342.      The foundation stone was laid with the assistance of Charles IV himself at  5:31 am  on  July 9 1357  (apparently so these odd numbers would have a palindromic sequence of ascending and descending digits). The structure was originally known as Stone or Prague Bridge, and received its present appellation around 1870, a change instigated by the poet Karel Havlicek Borovsky. Charles Bridge is 9.4 to 9.5 metres wide; it has a span of 515 metres and is supported by 16 arches. It has served transport, trade and cultural functions, but was also the scene of jousting contests, the Hussite Wars and revolutionary battles. Executions even took place there. Today Charles Bridge and Prague Castle are the two most visited sites in Prague.

His wife had urged him to build the bridge and it was given her name, Judith. It was around 514 metres long, seven metres wide at its broadest and had 27 low arches. In 1253 administration of the bridge was taken over by the Knights of the Cross. Two thirds of the structure was destroyed by a flood in February 1342, necessitating the building of a replacement - Charles Bridge.               Charles Bridge : the Statue Gallery        There are 30, predominantly Baroque, statues and groups of statues on Charles Bridge. Most of them were created at the turn of the 17th and 18th centuries. Today the statues are gradually being replaced by copies for reasons of preservation.              Charles Bridge Museum          The Charles Bridge Museum was opened in June 2007. It is located at Krizovnicke namesti, at the foot of the bridge itself. The Knights of the Cross, who have a long history of association with Charles Bridge, provided a former monastery hospital as a venue for the museum. In conjunction with the 650th anniversary, it features a permanent exhibition which presents the historical and cultural context of the foundation, development and present of this unique structure.

The successful invasion, aided by King  Henry II of England , marked the beginning of eight centuries of English dominance in Ireland.       Territorial  changes   Ireland was a patch-work of rival kingdoms prior to the invasion, although gradually moving towards being a genuine proto-state under a high-king. After 1169 power was nominally centralized at  Dublin , but this would not be consolidated until the  16th century .

The  Norman invasion of Ireland  was a Norman military expedition to  Ireland  that took place on  1 May   1169  at the behest of  Dermot MacMurrough  ( Irish :  Diarmait Mac Murchada ), the King of  Leinster . It was partially consolidated by  Henry II  on  18 October   1171  and led to the eventual entry of the  Lordship of Ireland  into the  Angevin Empire . Immediate consequences were the end of the  Irish High Kingship .           Contents       1   Invasion of 1169   2   Arrival of Henry II in 1171   3   Subsequent assaults   4   List of Norman captains   5   Notes   6   See also               [ edit ]   Invasion of 1169   After losing the protection of  Tyrone  Chief,  Muirchertach MacLochlainn ,  High King of Ireland , who died in 1166, MacMorrough was forcibly exiled by a confederation of Irish forces under the new High King, Rory O'Connor.   MacMurrough fled first to  Bristol  and then to  Normandy . He sought and obtained permission from  Henry II of England  to use the latter's subjects to regain his kingdom. By 1167 MacMurrough had obtained the services of  Maurice Fitz Gerald  and later persuaded  Rhys ap Gruffydd  Prince of  Deheubarth  to release Fitz Gerald's half-brother  Robert Fitz-Stephen  from captivity to take part in the expedition. Most importantly he obtained the support of the  Earl of Pembroke   Richard de Clare , known as Strongbow.   The first Norman knight to land in Ireland was Richard fitz Godbert de Roche in 1167, but it was not until 1169 that the main body of Norman,  Welsh  and  Flemish  forces landed in  Wexford . Within a short time Leinster was regained,  Waterford  and  Dublin  were under Diarmait's control. Strongbow married Diarmait's daughter,  Aoife , and was named as heir to the Kingdom of Leinster. This latter development caused consternation to Henry II, who feared the establishment of a rival Norman state in Ireland. Accordingly, he resolved to visit Leinster to establish his authority.     [ edit ]   Arrival of Henry II in 1171   Pope  Adrian IV , the first English  pope , in one of his earliest acts, had already issued a  Papal Bull  in 1155, giving Henry authority to invade Ireland as a means of curbing ecclesiastical corruption and abuses. Little contemporary use, however, was made of the Bull  Laudabiliter  since its text enforced papal suzerainty not only over the island of Ireland but of all islands off of the European coast, including England, in virtue of the Constantinian donation. The relevant text reads:   ""There is indeed no doubt, as thy Highness doth also acknowledge, that Ireland and all other islands which Christ the Sun of Righteousness has illumined, and which have received the doctrines of the Christian faith, belong to the jurisdiction of St. Peter and of the holy Roman Church"".   References to  Laudabiliter  become more frequent in the later Tudor period when the researches of the  Renaissance humanist  scholars cast doubt on the historicity of the  Donation of Constantine .   Henry landed with a large fleet at  Waterford  in  1171 , becoming the first  King of England  to set foot on Irish soil. Both  Waterford  and  Dublin  were proclaimed Royal Cities. In November Henry accepted the submission of the Irish kings in Dublin. Adrian's successor,  Pope Alexander III  ratified the grant of Ireland to Henry in 1172, and it was approved by all the Irish bishops at the synod of  Cashel . Henry awarded his Irish territories to his younger son, John, with the title  Dominus Hiberniae  (""Lord of Ireland""). When John unexpectedly succeeded his brother as  king , the ""Kingdom of Ireland"" fell directly under the English Crown.   Henry was happily acknowledged by most of the Irish Kings, who saw in him a chance to curb the expansion of both Leinster and the  Hiberno-Normans . This led to the ratification of the  Treaty of Windsor  in 1175 between Henry and Ruaidhr. However, with both Diarmuid and Strongbow dead (in 1171 and 1176 respectively), Henry back in England and Ruaidhr unable to curb his nominal vassals, within two years it was not worth the vellum it was inscribed upon.  John de Courcy  invaded and gained much of east Ulster in  1177 , Raymond le Gros had already captured  Limerick  and much of north Munster, while the other Norman families such as Prendergast, fitz Stephen, fitz Gerald, fitz Henry and le Poer were actively carving out virtual kingdoms for themselves.     [ edit ]   Subsequent assaults   While the main Norman invasion concentrated on Leinster, with submissions made to Henry by the other provincial kings, the situation on the ground outside Leinster remained unchanged.

A baron of  Hugh de Lacy , the MacCostellos (Mac Oisdealbhaigh) were one of the first  Norman  families in Connacht, settling in Mayo in what became the Barony of Costello, which originally included part of neighboring County Roscommon (their sixteenth-century seat was near Ballaghadereen, now in Roscommon). They were the first of the Norman invaders to adopt a Gaelic name, which marks their descent from Oisdealbh, son of the famous Gilbert de Nangle (Latin: de Angulo), who was one of the first  Cambro-Norman  invaders. His family, the de Angulos, obtained vast estates in Meath, where they were Barons of Navan. The family thence spread into Leinster and Connacht, where the leading family adopted the Gaelic patronymic Mac Oisdealbhaigh, as we have seen. Those in Leinster, and those in Connacht that did not adopt this form, became Nangles (de Nogla); while those in Cork became Nagles. The Waldrons (Mac Bhaildrin) are a branch of the MacCostellos in Mayo.

Prince of Brazil  ( Portuguese :  Prncipe do Brasil ) was a title used in the  Kingdom of Portugal , for the heir of the royal  House of Braganza .   The title was created by  King   John IV of Portugal  on  27 October   1645  in favor of his eldest son and heir  Infante Teodsio , soon after Portugal had got rid of its  Spanish  rulers. During the  1645  1822 , ""Prince of Brazil"" was always conferred on the  heir apparent  of the throne, who also received the title of  Duke of Braganza . Also, in 1750 when the hitherto  Prince of Brazil  ascended as Joseph I, he granted the title  Princess of Brazil  (but not the Dukedom of Braganza) to his eldest daughter, the future  Maria I of Portugal , as the king believed he would remain without sons (his wife and he produced no further issue after 1746). In 1760, when Maria married her uncle,  Infante Pedro , he also took the  style   Prince of Brazil  as her  consort , until she became  queen regnant  and he became known as King  Pedro III . The eldest son and heir of the  Prince of Brazil  was styled  Prince of Beira  and Duke of Barcelos.   When  Brazil  was elevated to the  status  of a  kingdom  within the  Portuguese empire , the title was changed to  Prince Royal of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves . When Brazil proclaimed its independence in  1822 , the title was reused by the Imperial House of Brazil as a  dynastic  style for all of  Emperor Pedro I 's children.   Brazil's independence prompted Portugal to change the heir apparent's title once again, this time to  Prince Royal of Portugal .

After the Mongols sacked his capital of  Vladimir , Yuri fled across the  Volga  northward, to  Yaroslavl , where he hastily mustered an army. He and his brothers then turned back toward Vladimir in hopes of relieving the city before the Mongols took it, but they were too late. Yuri sent out a force of 3,000 men under Dorozh to scout out where the Mongols were; whereupon Dorozh returned saying that Yuri and his force was already surrounded. As he tried to muster his forces, he was attacked by the Mongol force under  Burundai  and fled but was overtaken on the Sit River and died there along with his nephew, Prince Vsevolod of Yaroslavl. [ 1 ]  The battle marked the end of unified resistance to the Mongols and inaugurated two centuries of the Mongol domination of Rus.

(October 2008)       Henri Grasso  (1864  1944) was the son of  Willem Grasso , founder of Grassos Royal Machine Factories Ltd. Henri was born to step in his fathers shoes. At the age of 19, he follows a refrigeration course in Mittweida, Germany with the latest developments in that field. At the age of 30, he takes over the business from his father. Under Henri Grassos lead, the company grew fast. In 1896, he moves the factory of butter/margarine machines from 's-Hertogenbosch to much larger premises at Vught, The Netherlands. In 1927, he celebrates his 50 years anniversary as manager. At this time, 260 employees are employed at the Grasso factory with a turnover of more than 0,5 million Euro. Only a few years before he was the manager, there were 18 people working for Grasso. Due to the economic crisis, the amount of employees falls back to 50 people. In 1944, Henri Grasso died at the age of 80. In the same year, the factory is almost completely destroyed during World War II so that business comes to a standstill. After the war, the Grasso factory is soon rebuilt.

His father was involved in the  Caribbean   slave trade , and died suddenly when Raffles was fourteen, leaving his family in debt. Raffles then started working as a  clerk  in London for the  British East India Company , the trading company that shaped many of Britain's overseas conquests. In 1805 he was sent to what is now  Penang  in the country of  Malaysia , then called the Prince of Wales Island, starting his long association with  Southeast Asia . He started with a post under the Honourable  Philip Dundas , the Governor of Penang.   As he was gazetted assistant secretary to the new Governor of Penang in 1805, he married Olivia Mariamne Devenish, a widow who was formerly married to Jacob Cassivelaun Fancourt, an assistant surgeon in Madras who had died in 1800. It was also at this time that he made acquaintance with  Thomas Otho Travers , who would accompany him for the next twenty years.     [ edit ]   Java   His knowledge of the  Malay language  as well as his wit and ability, gained him favour with  Lord Minto ,  governor of India , and he was sent to  Malacca . Then, in 1811, after the invasion and annexation of the  Kingdom of Holland  by France during Napoleon's war, Raffles had no choice but to leave the country. He mounted a military expedition against the Dutch and French in  Java ,  Indonesia . The war was swiftly conducted by  Admiral Robert Stopford , General Wetherhall, and Colonel Gillespie, who led a well-organized army against an army of mostly French conscripts with little proper leadership. The previous Dutch governor,  Herman Willem Daendels , had built a well-defended fortification at  Meester Cornelis  (now  Jatinegara ), and at the time, the governor,  Jan Willem Janssens  (who, coincidentally, surrendered to the British at the  Cape Colony ), mounted a brave but ultimately futile defense at the fortress. The British, led by Colonel Gillespie, stormed the fort and captured it within three hours. Janssens attempted to escape inland but was captured. The British invasion of Java took a total of forty-five days, during which Raffles was appointed the Lieutenant-Governor by Lord Minto before hostilities formally ceased. He took his residence at  Buitenzorg  and despite having a small subset of Britons as his senior staff, he kept many of the Dutch civil servants in the governmental structure. He also negotiated peace and mounted some small military expeditions against local princes to subjugate them to British rule, as well as a takeover of  Bangka Island  to set up a permanent British presence in the area in the case of the return of Java to Dutch rule after the end of the  War of the Sixth Coalition  in Europe.   During his governorship, Raffles introduced partial  self-government , stopped the slave trade, became an early opponent of the  Opium trade  by placing strict limitations upon its importation, much to the dismay of Calcutta, led an expedition to rediscover and restore  Borobudur  and other ancient monuments, and replaced the Dutch forced agriculture system with a  land tenure  system of land management, probably influenced by the earlier writings of Dirk van Hogendorp (1761-1822). He also changed the Dutch colonies to the British system of driving on the left, [ citation needed ] which is why Indonesia drives on the left today.   Under the harsh conditions of the island, Olivia died on 26 November 1814, an event that devastated Raffles. In 1815, he left again for England after the island of Java was returned to control of the Netherlands following the  Napoleonic Wars , under the terms of the  Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814 , but not before he was officially replaced by  John Fendall  on account of the poor financial performance of the colony during his administration, as deemed by the successors of Lord Minto in Calcutta. He sailed to England in early 1816 to clear his name, and en route, visited  Napoleon , who was in exile at  St. Helena , but found him unpleasant and unimpressive.     [ edit ]   Interlude in England          Raffles in 1817       In 1817, Raffles wrote and published a book entitled  History of Java , describing the history of the island from ancient times. In 1817 he was knighted by the prince regent, whose daughter,  Princess Charlotte , was particularly close to him. At the publication of the book, he also stopped using the name ""Thomas"", preferring to use his middle name, ""Stamford"", possibly to avoid confusion amongst his associates with  Sir Thomas Sevestre  or his cousin who bore the same name. On 22 February, he married his second wife, Sophia Hull.   He was appointed as the Governor-General of Bencoolen (now  Bengkulu ) on 15 October 1817, and set sail to take the post with his new wife.     [ edit ]   Bencoolen (Bengkulu) and Malaya   Raffles arrived in Bencoolen ( Bengkulu ) on 19 March 1818. Despite the prestige connected with the title, Bencoolen was a colonial backwater whose only real export was pepper and only the murder of a previous Resident, Thomas Parr, gained it any attention back home in Britain. Raffles found the place wretched, and set about reforms immediately, mostly similar to what he had done in Java - abolishing slavery and limiting cockfighting and such games. To replace the slaves, he used a contingent of  convicts , already sent to him from India. It is at this point when he realized the importance of a British presence that both challenged the Dutch hegemony in the area and could remain consistently profitable, unlike Bencoolen or Batavia. However, the strategic importance of poorly-maintained but well-positioned  British possessions  such as Penang or Bencoolen made it impossible for the British to abandon such unprofitable colonies in such close proximity to the Dutch in Java. The competition in the area, between Raffles and the aggressive Dutch  de jure  Governor, Elout, certainly led at least in part to the later  Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 . Raffles looked into alternatives in the area - namely Bangka, which had been ceded to the Dutch after its conquest by the British during its occupation of Java.   Bintan  was also under consideration. Despite the fact that  Warren Hastings  overlooked the island before settling upon Penang in 1786, the  Riau Archipelago  was an attractive choice just to the south of the  Malay Peninsula , for its proximity to  Malacca . In his correspondences with Calcutta, Raffles also emphasized the need to establish a certain amount of influence with the native chiefs, which had greatly waned since the return of the Dutch. Raffles sent Thomas Travers as an ambassador to the Dutch, to possibly negotiate an expansion of British economic interests. When this failed, and when Raffles' own expeditions into his new dominion found only treacherous terrain and few exportable goods, his desire to establish a better British presence was cemented.   However, the Anglo-Dutch Convention of 1814 was not completely clear, especially on the issue of certain possessions such as  Padang . The Convention of 1814 only returned Dutch territory that was held before 1803, which did not include Padang. Raffles asserted the British claim personally, leading a small expedition to the  Sultanate of Minangkabau . Yet, as Raffles confirmed with the sultan regarding the absolute British influence of the area, he realized that the local rulers had only limited power over the well-cultivated and civilized country, and the treaty was largely symbolic and had little actual force.     [ edit ]   The founding of Singapore          Statue of Sir Stamford Raffles in Singapore, based on the original by  Thomas Woolner       Meanwhile, Major  William Farquhar , the  British Resident  of Malacca, had been attempting to negotiate  commercial treaties  with the local chiefs of the Riau Archipelago, especially with the heads of the  Sultanate of Johore . Due to the death and subsequent turmoil of the sultanate at the time of Farquhar's arrival, Farquhar was compelled to sign the treaty not with the official head of the sultanate, but rather, the Raja Muda (Regent or Crown Prince) of Riau. Noting it as a success and reporting it as such back to Raffles, Raffles sailed to Malacca in late 1818 to personally secure a British presence in the Riau area, especially  Singapura , which was favored by him both through the readings of Malayan histories and by Farquhar's explorations.   Despite  Lord Hastings'  less-than-stellar opinion of Raffles before (which had necessitated his trip to England to clear his name at the end of his tenure as Governor-General of Java), the now well-connected and successful Raffles was able to secure the permission to set up a settlement where in  Malaysian history  the name  Lion City  was applied and was in a strategically advantageous position. However, he was not to provoke the Dutch, and his actions were officially disavowed. Despite the best efforts in London by authorities such as the  Viscount Castlereagh  to quell Dutch fears and the continuing efforts to reach an agreement between the nations that eventually became the  Anglo-Dutch Treaty  of London of 1824, as well as to send instructions to Raffles to undertake far less intrusive actions, the distance between the Far East and Europe had meant that the orders had no chance of reaching Raffles in time for his venture to begin.       [ edit ]   Singapore     [ edit ]   Establishment   After a brief survey of the  Karimun Islands , on 29 January 1819, he established a post at the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula. It was established that there was no Dutch presence on the island of Singapore. Johore also no longer had any control of the area, so contact was made with the local Temenggong, or Raja. The contacts were friendly and Raffles, knowledgeable about the muddled political situation, took advantage to provide a rudimentary treaty between the nominal chiefs of the area that called for the exclusivity of trade and the English protection of the area. Members of Raffles' party surveyed the island and proceeded to request the presence of the sultan, or whoever at the time had supreme nominal power, to sign a formal treaty, while Major Farquhar was ordered to do the same in Rhio. A few days later, the formal treaty signed by a man who claimed to be the ""lawful sovereign of the whole of territories extending from  Lingga  and  Johor  to  Mount Muar "". This man was  Hussein Shah of Johor , who, although having had no previous contact with the British, had certainly heard of the might of the  British navy  and was in no position to argue against the terms. However, Raffles was able to charm the man and to reassure him that the Dutch posed no threat in the area. Hussein Shah had been the crown Prince of Johor, but while he was away in Pahang to get married, his father died and his younger brother was made sultan, supported by some of the court officials and the Dutch. To circumvent the situation of having to negotiate with a sultan influenced by the Dutch, Raffles decided to recognise, on behalf of the British Crown, Hussien Shah as being the rightful ruler of Johor. Farquhar's attempt to establish a more favorable treaty in Rhio was met with greater challenge, as the Dutch were present and made for a rather awkward position. The Dutch were alarmed and sent a small contingent to the island. Despite a covert offer of subterfuge against the Dutch offered by the Raja of Rhio, Farquhar returned and an official protest was sent by the Raja to Java regarding the matter.   Raffles declared the foundation of what was to become modern Singapore on 6 February, securing the transfer of control of the island to the East India Company. Much pomp and ceremony was done, and the official treaty was read aloud in languages representing all nations present, as well as the Malay and Chinese inhabitants. Hussien Shah was paid $5000 a year while the local Temenggong received $3000 a year, both massive sums at the time, equivalent to several hundred thousand dollars now [ citation needed ] . Farquhar was officially named the Resident of Singapore as Raffles was named as ""Agent to the Most Noble the Governor-General with the States of Rhio, Lingin and Johor"". Although ownership of the post was to be exclusively British, explicit orders were given to Farquhar to maintain free passage of ships through the  Strait of Singapore  and a small military presence was established alongside the trading post. After issuing orders to Farquhar and the remaining Europeans, Raffles left the next day, 7 February 1819.     [ edit ]   Achin, and the early conflict/crisis with the Dutch   Raffles also planned to start a British presence in  Achin , at the northern tip of Sumatra. As soon as he left, the Raja of Rhio sent letters to the Dutch, claiming innocence and a British encroachment. The Dutch in Malacca acted at once, and ordered that no Malays could go to Singapore. Raffles' bold claim of Singapore created a curious geographic situation where although Penang was clearly closer distance-wise to Singapore, Raffles, in his capacity as the Governor-General of Bencoolen, was in control. This undoubtedly irked the authorities in Penang to the point where they refused to send any sepoys to Singapore to complete the garrison. Official Dutch complaints came before the end of the month, and Raffles attempted to appease the situation by instructing Farquhar to not interfere with the politics of surrounding islands. Despite numerous threats and serious considerations by the Dutch Governor-General in Java, the Dutch did not take any military action.   The muddled political situation in Johore and Rhio also created a certain uneasiness and instability for the two nations. Tengku Long  was claimed to be a  pretender  to the throne, and since the  succession  laws in the Malay sultanates were not as clear cut as, for example, the  Salic  laws of Europe, the treaties signed between native rulers and the European powers always seemed to be on the verge of being invalidated, especially if a sultan is deposed by one of his siblings or other pretenders.   Nevertheless, amidst the uncertainty and intrigue, Raffles landed in Achin on 14 March 1819, with the begrudging help of Penang. Once again, it seems that multiple people were in power, but none wanted to formally deal with the British. The hostile atmosphere created allowed for Raffles to cancel the only meeting he was able to arrange, with  Panglima Polim , a powerful divisional chief, fearing treachery. As the influential merchant  John Palmer , Raffles, and fellow commissioner John Monckton Coombs of Penang sat offshore, waiting for a response, Calcutta debated whether to reinforce Singapore or not. Evacuation plans were made, but the Dutch never acted and finally Lord Hastings prompted Colonel Bannerman, the Governor of Penang, to send funds to reinforce Singapore.   Raffles finally was able to convince his fellow commissioners to sign a treaty with Jauhar al-Alam Shah, the ruler of Achin, which placed a British resident as well as the exclusivity of trade. By the time Raffles returned to Singapore, on 31 May, much of the immediate crisis that the establishment of the colony had caused in both Penang and Calcutta had passed. By then, the initial five-hundred villagers had grown to become five-thousand merchants, soldiers, and administrators on the island. Raffles was determined to both destroy the Dutch monopoly in the area, and create a gateway to the trade with China and Japan, the latter of which he attempted and failed to reach while governing Java.     [ edit ]   The first year of Singapore   While in Singapore, Raffles established schools and churches in the native languages. He allowed  missionaries  and local businesses to flourish. Certain colonial aspects remained: a European town was quickly built to  segregate  the population, separated by a river; carriage roads were built and cantonments constructed for the soldiers. Otherwise, however, no duties were imposed and confident that Farquhar would follow his instructions well, he sailed for Bencoolen once again on 28 June.     [ edit ]   Bencoolen, once again   Raffles was still the Governor-General of  Bencoolen  and having returned to it after the settling of Singapore, Raffles started more reforms that were, by now, almost trademarks of his reign upon colonies. Forced labor was abolished when he first arrived, and he declared Bencoolen a  free port  as well. Currency was regulated and as he had an excess of out-of-work  civil servants , formed committees to advise him in the running of the colony. However, Bencoolen was not as self-sufficient as Singapore. The area was poor and disease-ridden, and the first reports from the committees reflected very poorly upon the condition of the colony. Unlike the  salutary neglect  Raffles granted upon Singapore, he slowed the European-inspired reforms and emphasized on the cultivation of whatever land that was available. Native authorities were given power in their respective districts and were answerable only to the Governor-General. The slave-debtor system was brought in in exchange instead of the old slavery system that Raffles abolished in Java, Borneo, and initially in Bencoolen. Slave-debtors were registered, and educational reforms started to focus on the children instead of the entire population. Raffles was looking into a long-term plan for a slow reform of Bencoolen.   Unlike many other European colonizers, Raffles did not impose upon the colonized the language, culture, or other aspects of the colonizer. In addition to preserving the  artifacts ,  fauna , and  flora  of his colonies, he also allowed  religious freedom  in his colonies, especially important as the  Malay states  were largely  Muslim . However,  Christian  schools were started by missionaries in all of his colonies.     [ edit ]   Consolidation of the Eastern Isles   The death of Colonel Bannerman of Penang in October 1819 brought upon a new opportunity for Raffles to expand his power to also include the other minor British factories and outposts from Sumatra to  Cochin China . He sailed to Calcutta and as Lord Hastings sought to consolidate all of the small British possessions in the  East Indies . During his sojourn, he had the opportunity to argue for free trade and the protection of the private enterprise. Education and the retention of small British outposts were also discussed.   The Dutch claim on the Sultanate of Johore and hence, Rhio, and the diplomatic exchanges between Baron  Godert van der Capellen  and Calcutta continued throughout this time. The legitimacy of the British treaties were also questioned once again, but finally, as Singapore grew at an exponential rate, the Dutch gave up their claim on the island, allowing the colony to continue as a British possession. However, the pressures put upon Calcutta ensured that no single governor of all British possessions in the Strait or on Sumatra was appointed, and Raffles, whose health was slowly ailing, returned to Bencoolen.     [ edit ]   Administration of Bencoolen, 1820 - 1822   Raffles returned to Bencoolen in ill-health, but as his health improved, he continued on his quest to learn about the island which he now called home. He studied the  Batak   cannibals  of  Tappanooly  and their rituals and laws regarding the consumption of human flesh, writing in detail about the transgressions that warranted such an act as well as their methods. He also noted the rise of the Sikh religion in certain parts of Sumatra.   By early 1820, Tunku Long had firmly established himself as the Sultan of Johore to the British, but the political situation in the area remains a befuddled mess, with the old sultan dying and many new ones attempting to gain either the crown or regency. As Farquhar was involving himself poorly in local politics, Raffles appointed Travers as the Resident of Singapore, replacing Farquhar. Upon his arrival, Travers found the colony a delightful smrgsbord of different races and cultures, numbering over six thousand, and the Singapore trade was slowly overtaking the Java trade.   As in Java, Raffles collected samples of local species of plants and animals, as well as described them in his journals. He also described other local tribes and their customs, especially their  religions  and laws. He brought the island of  Nias  under British rule as well, noting its more civilized state and production of rice.   Yet, the production of food remained somewhat of a problem in Bencoolen. Raffles paid special attention to the agricultural methods of the  Chinese , and wrote an introduction to the only issue of  Proceedings of the Agricultural Society , in order to remedy this. His employer, the  East India Company , however, had no other concerns outside of profit, and even as Raffles lived like a country gentleman and ran his colony as an estate, his expenditures in natural preservation was frowned upon. His removal was discussed in both Calcutta and London, while Castlereagh continued negotiations with the Dutch regarding the ongoing diplomatic conflicts.   Luckily, the Singapore issue had its supporters in the House, so as negotiations went on in Europe, Raffles remained largely idle in Bencoolen. The only major issue, outside of the politics of local sultans, involved the replacement of Farquhar, who decided that he had no intention of leaving his post voluntarily, causing a moment of tension between him and Travers. Raffles' request for Travers to deliver dispatches to India nullified the issue late in the year, and Farquhar remained in charge in Singapore, with its survival still in doubt for many in both India and London, who believed that it would either be handed over to the Dutch or taken violently by the Dutch at the end of Castlereagh's negotiations.   Farquhar, however, stirred up more trouble, conflicting especially with local English merchants over trivial matters of self-importance and overreaction over small infractions of white traders, for some of which he was reprimanded by Calcutta officially.  Public works , commissioned by Raffles but undertaken by Farquhar, was becoming overwhelmingly expensive.   Personal tragedies also started for Raffles. His eldest son, Leopold, died during an  epidemic  on 4 July 1821. The oldest daughter, Charlotte, was also sick with dysentery by the end of the year, but it would be his youngest son, Stamford Marsden, who would perish first with the disease, 3 January 1822, with Charlotte to follow ten days later. For the good part of four month the couple remained devastated. The year would be eventful with the suicide of Castlereagh and the appointment of  Lord Amherst  as the  Governor-General of India , replacing Hastings. As Raffles grew restless and depressed, he decided to visit Singapore, before heading home to England. Accompanying him would be his wife Sophia and only surviving child, Ella.     [ edit ]   Singapore - 1822 - 1823          The  Plan of the Town of Singapore , or more commonly known as the  Jackson Plan       Raffles was pleased at the fact that Singapore had grown exponentially in such short years. The colony was a bustling hub of trade and activity. However, Farquhar's development work was deemed unsatisfactory and Raffles drew up what is now known as the  Jackson Plan , and replanned the city according to recommendations of a committee headed by the colony's engineer, Phillip Jackson.   It was still a segregated plan, giving the best land to the Europeans, yet it was considered remarkably scientific for the time. It was also during the replanning and reconstruction of the town that allowed Farquhar to clash dramatically with Raffles, who now considered Farquhar unfit for the position of Resident. Raffles took direct control with a heavy hand. In 1823, Raffles instituted a code of settlement for the populace, and soon followed with laws regarding the freedom of trade. He also quickly instituted a registration system for all land, regardless of ownership, and the repossession of the land by the government if land remained unregistered. This act greatly asserted the power of the British government as it covered land previously owned by the Sultan as well. A police force and magistrate was then set up, under British principles. In a very short period of time, Raffles had turned a semi-anarchic trading post into a proper city with at least a semblance of order.   Repeated efforts by Raffles for Calcutta to send a replacement for Farquhar remained unanswered. As Raffles started to hint at his impending retirement, he made Johore a British protectorate, causing a protest from van der Capellen. Finally, Calcutta appointed  John Crawfurd , who had followed Raffles for over twenty years, as the Resident of Singapore. Captain  William Gordon MacKenzie  took over Bencoolen from Raffles. It's March 1823, and coincidentally, on the same day he was replaced, he received an official reprimand from London for the takeover of Nias.   With politics against him, Raffles finally turned back to the natural sciences. He gave a speech regarding the opening of a Malay college in Singapore that heavily involved his observations of his years in Southeast Asia and the importance of both the local and the European languages. Raffles personally gave $2000 towards the effort, as the East India Company gave $4000.   In 1823, Raffles drafted the first constitution for Singapore, which followed a fairly moralistic stance, outlawing gaming and slavery. A specific regulation in the constitution called for the multiethnic population of Singapore to remain as is, and there shall be no crimes based on being a race. He then went to work drafting laws, defining on exactly ""what"" constituted a crime. Finally, on 9 July 1823, feeling that his work on establishing Singapore was finished, he boarded a ship for home, but not before a stop in Batavia to visit his old home and adversary, van der Capellen. A final stop in Bencoolen ensued, and finally, a voyage home, interrupted by a harrowing experience when one of the ships caught fire off Rat Island, which claimed many of his drawings and papers.   The  Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824  finally settled the score in the East Indies. The British gained dominance in the north, while the entirety of Sumatra became Dutch. The Malay Peninsula and the  Indian subcontinent  were both free of Dutch interference.   Raffles finally returned to England 22 August 1824, over a year after he left Singapore. His longest tenure in Singapore was only eight months, but he was considered the founder of Singapore nevertheless.     [ edit ]   England and death   Upon arrival in England in poor health, both Sir Stamford and Lady Raffles convalesced in  Cheltenham  until September, after which he entertained distinguished guests in both London and his home. He also made considerations to run for parliament during this time, but this ambition was never realized. He moved to London at the end of November, just in time to have a war of words in front of the Court of Directors of the EIC regarding Singapore with Farquhar, who had also arrived in London. Despite several severe charges put upon Raffles, Farquhar was ultimately unable to discredit him and was denied a chance to be restored to Singapore, but he was given a military promotion instead.   With the Singapore matter settled, Raffles turned to his other great hobby - botany. Raffles was a founder (in 1825) and first president (elected April 1826) of the  Zoological Society of London  and the  London Zoo . Meanwhile, he was not only not granted a  pension , but was called to pay over twenty-two thousand pounds sterling for the losses incurred during his administrations. Raffles replied and clarified his actions, and moved to his country estate, Highwood, but before the issue was resolved, he was already much too ill.   He died in London, England, a day before his forty-fifth birthday, on 5 July 1826, of  apoplexy . His estate amounted around ten thousand pounds sterling, which was paid to the Company to cover his outstanding debt. Because of his  anti-slavery  stance, he was refused burial inside his local parish church (St. Mary's,  Hendon ) by the  vicar , whose family had made its money in the slave trade. A brass tablet was finally placed in 1887 and the actual whereabouts of his body was not known until 1914 when it was found in a vault. When the church was extended in the 1920s his tomb was incorporated into the body of the building.     [ edit ]   Coat of Arms   The Blazon of his Armorial Ensigns reads:     ""Or a double headed Eagle displayed Gules charged on the breast with an Eastern Crown on the first, on a Chief Vert pendent from a chain two oval Medallions in Pale the one bearing Arabic characters and the other a dagger in fess the blade wavy the point towards the dexter in relief Or, the said medallions and chain being a representation of a personal decoration called the Order of the Golden Sword conferred upon by him by the Chief or King of Atcheen in Sumatra as a mark of the high regard of the said King and in testimony of the good understanding which had been happily established between that Prince and the British Government; and for a crest out of an Eastern Crown Or a Gryphon's Head Purpure gorged with a collar gemel Gold.""     The  Coat of Arms  has been adapted into the school arms of  Raffles Institution  and  Raffles Junior College . It can also be found as part of a  stained-glass window  in  St. Andrew's Cathedral, Singapore .

The delta of the Nile River empties into the Mediterranean Sea. The beginning of the Nile is south of Egypt in Lake Victoria.  In ancient Egypt, the flooding of the Nile was predictable enough for the Egyptians to plan their yearly crops around it. They learned partial control of the flood waters of the Nile by means of irrigation.        Suggested Reading Ancient Egypt Egypt - Terms Predynastic Egypt Egypt Resources Ancient Egypt 664-323 B.C.

In:  Ancient Egypt   [ Edit categories ]                                                                 Egypt and the Nile River are called this because of its uses. The main reason it was called this is because it was Egypt's main water supply. During the flood season, the Nile would flood and drop silt (fertile soil) in clumps. Farmers used it to grow crops. When the water flooded and there was too much water, the crops were destroyed. If there wasn't enough water, there would be a famine. The Nile was also used for transport and for leisure.   They depended on the Nile, this is why it is called ""The Gift of the Nile"".                                                                This answer is closed to changes.

He was also heavily involved in the conquest of the Indonesian island of  Java  from Dutch and French military forces during the  Napoleonic Wars . He is one of the more famous  Britons  who contributed to the expansion of the  British Empire .

His father was involved in the  Caribbean   slave trade , and died suddenly when Raffles was fourteen, leaving his family in debt. Raffles then started working as a  clerk  in London for the  British East India Company , the trading company that shaped many of Britain's overseas conquests. In 1805 he was sent to what is now  Penang  in the country of  Malaysia , then called the Prince of Wales Island, starting his long association with  Southeast Asia . He started with a post under the Honourable  Philip Dundas , the Governor of Penang.   As he was gazetted assistant secretary to the new Governor of Penang in 1805, he married Olivia Mariamne Devenish, a widow who was formerly married to Jacob Cassivelaun Fancourt, an assistant surgeon in Madras who had died in 1800. It was also at this time that he made acquaintance with  Thomas Otho Travers , who would accompany him for the next twenty years.     [ edit ]   Java   His knowledge of the  Malay language  as well as his wit and ability, gained him favour with  Lord Minto ,  governor of India , and he was sent to  Malacca . Then, in 1811, after the invasion and annexation of the  Kingdom of Holland  by France during Napoleon's war, Raffles had no choice but to leave the country. He mounted a military expedition against the Dutch and French in  Java ,  Indonesia . The war was swiftly conducted by  Admiral Robert Stopford , General Wetherhall, and Colonel Gillespie, who led a well-organized army against an army of mostly French conscripts with little proper leadership. The previous Dutch governor,  Herman Willem Daendels , had built a well-defended fortification at  Meester Cornelis  (now  Jatinegara ), and at the time, the governor,  Jan Willem Janssens  (who, coincidentally, surrendered to the British at the  Cape Colony ), mounted a brave but ultimately futile defense at the fortress. The British, led by Colonel Gillespie, stormed the fort and captured it within three hours. Janssens attempted to escape inland but was captured. The British invasion of Java took a total of forty-five days, during which Raffles was appointed the Lieutenant-Governor by Lord Minto before hostilities formally ceased. He took his residence at  Buitenzorg  and despite having a small subset of Britons as his senior staff, he kept many of the Dutch civil servants in the governmental structure. He also negotiated peace and mounted some small military expeditions against local princes to subjugate them to British rule, as well as a takeover of  Bangka Island  to set up a permanent British presence in the area in the case of the return of Java to Dutch rule after the end of the  War of the Sixth Coalition  in Europe.   During his governorship, Raffles introduced partial  self-government , stopped the slave trade, became an early opponent of the  Opium trade  by placing strict limitations upon its importation, much to the dismay of Calcutta, led an expedition to rediscover and restore  Borobudur  and other ancient monuments, and replaced the Dutch forced agriculture system with a  land tenure  system of land management, probably influenced by the earlier writings of Dirk van Hogendorp (1761-1822). He also changed the Dutch colonies to the British system of driving on the left, [ citation needed ] which is why Indonesia drives on the left today.   Under the harsh conditions of the island, Olivia died on 26 November 1814, an event that devastated Raffles. In 1815, he left again for England after the island of Java was returned to control of the Netherlands following the  Napoleonic Wars , under the terms of the  Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814 , but not before he was officially replaced by  John Fendall  on account of the poor financial performance of the colony during his administration, as deemed by the successors of Lord Minto in Calcutta. He sailed to England in early 1816 to clear his name, and en route, visited  Napoleon , who was in exile at  St. Helena , but found him unpleasant and unimpressive.     [ edit ]   Interlude in England          Raffles in 1817       In 1817, Raffles wrote and published a book entitled  History of Java , describing the history of the island from ancient times. In 1817 he was knighted by the prince regent, whose daughter,  Princess Charlotte , was particularly close to him. At the publication of the book, he also stopped using the name ""Thomas"", preferring to use his middle name, ""Stamford"", possibly to avoid confusion amongst his associates with  Sir Thomas Sevestre  or his cousin who bore the same name. On 22 February, he married his second wife, Sophia Hull.   He was appointed as the Governor-General of Bencoolen (now  Bengkulu ) on 15 October 1817, and set sail to take the post with his new wife.     [ edit ]   Bencoolen (Bengkulu) and Malaya   Raffles arrived in Bencoolen ( Bengkulu ) on 19 March 1818. Despite the prestige connected with the title, Bencoolen was a colonial backwater whose only real export was pepper and only the murder of a previous Resident, Thomas Parr, gained it any attention back home in Britain. Raffles found the place wretched, and set about reforms immediately, mostly similar to what he had done in Java - abolishing slavery and limiting cockfighting and such games. To replace the slaves, he used a contingent of  convicts , already sent to him from India. It is at this point when he realized the importance of a British presence that both challenged the Dutch hegemony in the area and could remain consistently profitable, unlike Bencoolen or Batavia. However, the strategic importance of poorly-maintained but well-positioned  British possessions  such as Penang or Bencoolen made it impossible for the British to abandon such unprofitable colonies in such close proximity to the Dutch in Java. The competition in the area, between Raffles and the aggressive Dutch  de jure  Governor, Elout, certainly led at least in part to the later  Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 . Raffles looked into alternatives in the area - namely Bangka, which had been ceded to the Dutch after its conquest by the British during its occupation of Java.   Bintan  was also under consideration. Despite the fact that  Warren Hastings  overlooked the island before settling upon Penang in 1786, the  Riau Archipelago  was an attractive choice just to the south of the  Malay Peninsula , for its proximity to  Malacca . In his correspondences with Calcutta, Raffles also emphasized the need to establish a certain amount of influence with the native chiefs, which had greatly waned since the return of the Dutch. Raffles sent Thomas Travers as an ambassador to the Dutch, to possibly negotiate an expansion of British economic interests. When this failed, and when Raffles' own expeditions into his new dominion found only treacherous terrain and few exportable goods, his desire to establish a better British presence was cemented.   However, the Anglo-Dutch Convention of 1814 was not completely clear, especially on the issue of certain possessions such as  Padang . The Convention of 1814 only returned Dutch territory that was held before 1803, which did not include Padang. Raffles asserted the British claim personally, leading a small expedition to the  Sultanate of Minangkabau . Yet, as Raffles confirmed with the sultan regarding the absolute British influence of the area, he realized that the local rulers had only limited power over the well-cultivated and civilized country, and the treaty was largely symbolic and had little actual force.     [ edit ]   The founding of Singapore          Statue of Sir Stamford Raffles in Singapore, based on the original by  Thomas Woolner       Meanwhile, Major  William Farquhar , the  British Resident  of Malacca, had been attempting to negotiate  commercial treaties  with the local chiefs of the Riau Archipelago, especially with the heads of the  Sultanate of Johore . Due to the death and subsequent turmoil of the sultanate at the time of Farquhar's arrival, Farquhar was compelled to sign the treaty not with the official head of the sultanate, but rather, the Raja Muda (Regent or Crown Prince) of Riau. Noting it as a success and reporting it as such back to Raffles, Raffles sailed to Malacca in late 1818 to personally secure a British presence in the Riau area, especially  Singapura , which was favored by him both through the readings of Malayan histories and by Farquhar's explorations.   Despite  Lord Hastings'  less-than-stellar opinion of Raffles before (which had necessitated his trip to England to clear his name at the end of his tenure as Governor-General of Java), the now well-connected and successful Raffles was able to secure the permission to set up a settlement where in  Malaysian history  the name  Lion City  was applied and was in a strategically advantageous position. However, he was not to provoke the Dutch, and his actions were officially disavowed. Despite the best efforts in London by authorities such as the  Viscount Castlereagh  to quell Dutch fears and the continuing efforts to reach an agreement between the nations that eventually became the  Anglo-Dutch Treaty  of London of 1824, as well as to send instructions to Raffles to undertake far less intrusive actions, the distance between the Far East and Europe had meant that the orders had no chance of reaching Raffles in time for his venture to begin.       [ edit ]   Singapore     [ edit ]   Establishment   After a brief survey of the  Karimun Islands , on 29 January 1819, he established a post at the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula. It was established that there was no Dutch presence on the island of Singapore. Johore also no longer had any control of the area, so contact was made with the local Temenggong, or Raja. The contacts were friendly and Raffles, knowledgeable about the muddled political situation, took advantage to provide a rudimentary treaty between the nominal chiefs of the area that called for the exclusivity of trade and the English protection of the area. Members of Raffles' party surveyed the island and proceeded to request the presence of the sultan, or whoever at the time had supreme nominal power, to sign a formal treaty, while Major Farquhar was ordered to do the same in Rhio. A few days later, the formal treaty signed by a man who claimed to be the ""lawful sovereign of the whole of territories extending from  Lingga  and  Johor  to  Mount Muar "". This man was  Hussein Shah of Johor , who, although having had no previous contact with the British, had certainly heard of the might of the  British navy  and was in no position to argue against the terms. However, Raffles was able to charm the man and to reassure him that the Dutch posed no threat in the area. Hussein Shah had been the crown Prince of Johor, but while he was away in Pahang to get married, his father died and his younger brother was made sultan, supported by some of the court officials and the Dutch. To circumvent the situation of having to negotiate with a sultan influenced by the Dutch, Raffles decided to recognise, on behalf of the British Crown, Hussien Shah as being the rightful ruler of Johor. Farquhar's attempt to establish a more favorable treaty in Rhio was met with greater challenge, as the Dutch were present and made for a rather awkward position. The Dutch were alarmed and sent a small contingent to the island. Despite a covert offer of subterfuge against the Dutch offered by the Raja of Rhio, Farquhar returned and an official protest was sent by the Raja to Java regarding the matter.   Raffles declared the foundation of what was to become modern Singapore on 6 February, securing the transfer of control of the island to the East India Company. Much pomp and ceremony was done, and the official treaty was read aloud in languages representing all nations present, as well as the Malay and Chinese inhabitants. Hussien Shah was paid $5000 a year while the local Temenggong received $3000 a year, both massive sums at the time, equivalent to several hundred thousand dollars now [ citation needed ] . Farquhar was officially named the Resident of Singapore as Raffles was named as ""Agent to the Most Noble the Governor-General with the States of Rhio, Lingin and Johor"". Although ownership of the post was to be exclusively British, explicit orders were given to Farquhar to maintain free passage of ships through the  Strait of Singapore  and a small military presence was established alongside the trading post. After issuing orders to Farquhar and the remaining Europeans, Raffles left the next day, 7 February 1819.     [ edit ]   Achin, and the early conflict/crisis with the Dutch   Raffles also planned to start a British presence in  Achin , at the northern tip of Sumatra. As soon as he left, the Raja of Rhio sent letters to the Dutch, claiming innocence and a British encroachment. The Dutch in Malacca acted at once, and ordered that no Malays could go to Singapore. Raffles' bold claim of Singapore created a curious geographic situation where although Penang was clearly closer distance-wise to Singapore, Raffles, in his capacity as the Governor-General of Bencoolen, was in control. This undoubtedly irked the authorities in Penang to the point where they refused to send any sepoys to Singapore to complete the garrison. Official Dutch complaints came before the end of the month, and Raffles attempted to appease the situation by instructing Farquhar to not interfere with the politics of surrounding islands. Despite numerous threats and serious considerations by the Dutch Governor-General in Java, the Dutch did not take any military action.   The muddled political situation in Johore and Rhio also created a certain uneasiness and instability for the two nations. Tengku Long  was claimed to be a  pretender  to the throne, and since the  succession  laws in the Malay sultanates were not as clear cut as, for example, the  Salic  laws of Europe, the treaties signed between native rulers and the European powers always seemed to be on the verge of being invalidated, especially if a sultan is deposed by one of his siblings or other pretenders.   Nevertheless, amidst the uncertainty and intrigue, Raffles landed in Achin on 14 March 1819, with the begrudging help of Penang. Once again, it seems that multiple people were in power, but none wanted to formally deal with the British. The hostile atmosphere created allowed for Raffles to cancel the only meeting he was able to arrange, with  Panglima Polim , a powerful divisional chief, fearing treachery. As the influential merchant  John Palmer , Raffles, and fellow commissioner John Monckton Coombs of Penang sat offshore, waiting for a response, Calcutta debated whether to reinforce Singapore or not. Evacuation plans were made, but the Dutch never acted and finally Lord Hastings prompted Colonel Bannerman, the Governor of Penang, to send funds to reinforce Singapore.   Raffles finally was able to convince his fellow commissioners to sign a treaty with Jauhar al-Alam Shah, the ruler of Achin, which placed a British resident as well as the exclusivity of trade. By the time Raffles returned to Singapore, on 31 May, much of the immediate crisis that the establishment of the colony had caused in both Penang and Calcutta had passed. By then, the initial five-hundred villagers had grown to become five-thousand merchants, soldiers, and administrators on the island. Raffles was determined to both destroy the Dutch monopoly in the area, and create a gateway to the trade with China and Japan, the latter of which he attempted and failed to reach while governing Java.     [ edit ]   The first year of Singapore   While in Singapore, Raffles established schools and churches in the native languages. He allowed  missionaries  and local businesses to flourish. Certain colonial aspects remained: a European town was quickly built to  segregate  the population, separated by a river; carriage roads were built and cantonments constructed for the soldiers. Otherwise, however, no duties were imposed and confident that Farquhar would follow his instructions well, he sailed for Bencoolen once again on 28 June.     [ edit ]   Bencoolen, once again   Raffles was still the Governor-General of  Bencoolen  and having returned to it after the settling of Singapore, Raffles started more reforms that were, by now, almost trademarks of his reign upon colonies. Forced labor was abolished when he first arrived, and he declared Bencoolen a  free port  as well. Currency was regulated and as he had an excess of out-of-work  civil servants , formed committees to advise him in the running of the colony. However, Bencoolen was not as self-sufficient as Singapore. The area was poor and disease-ridden, and the first reports from the committees reflected very poorly upon the condition of the colony. Unlike the  salutary neglect  Raffles granted upon Singapore, he slowed the European-inspired reforms and emphasized on the cultivation of whatever land that was available. Native authorities were given power in their respective districts and were answerable only to the Governor-General. The slave-debtor system was brought in in exchange instead of the old slavery system that Raffles abolished in Java, Borneo, and initially in Bencoolen. Slave-debtors were registered, and educational reforms started to focus on the children instead of the entire population. Raffles was looking into a long-term plan for a slow reform of Bencoolen.   Unlike many other European colonizers, Raffles did not impose upon the colonized the language, culture, or other aspects of the colonizer. In addition to preserving the  artifacts ,  fauna , and  flora  of his colonies, he also allowed  religious freedom  in his colonies, especially important as the  Malay states  were largely  Muslim . However,  Christian  schools were started by missionaries in all of his colonies.     [ edit ]   Consolidation of the Eastern Isles   The death of Colonel Bannerman of Penang in October 1819 brought upon a new opportunity for Raffles to expand his power to also include the other minor British factories and outposts from Sumatra to  Cochin China . He sailed to Calcutta and as Lord Hastings sought to consolidate all of the small British possessions in the  East Indies . During his sojourn, he had the opportunity to argue for free trade and the protection of the private enterprise. Education and the retention of small British outposts were also discussed.   The Dutch claim on the Sultanate of Johore and hence, Rhio, and the diplomatic exchanges between Baron  Godert van der Capellen  and Calcutta continued throughout this time. The legitimacy of the British treaties were also questioned once again, but finally, as Singapore grew at an exponential rate, the Dutch gave up their claim on the island, allowing the colony to continue as a British possession. However, the pressures put upon Calcutta ensured that no single governor of all British possessions in the Strait or on Sumatra was appointed, and Raffles, whose health was slowly ailing, returned to Bencoolen.     [ edit ]   Administration of Bencoolen, 1820 - 1822   Raffles returned to Bencoolen in ill-health, but as his health improved, he continued on his quest to learn about the island which he now called home. He studied the  Batak   cannibals  of  Tappanooly  and their rituals and laws regarding the consumption of human flesh, writing in detail about the transgressions that warranted such an act as well as their methods. He also noted the rise of the Sikh religion in certain parts of Sumatra.   By early 1820, Tunku Long had firmly established himself as the Sultan of Johore to the British, but the political situation in the area remains a befuddled mess, with the old sultan dying and many new ones attempting to gain either the crown or regency. As Farquhar was involving himself poorly in local politics, Raffles appointed Travers as the Resident of Singapore, replacing Farquhar. Upon his arrival, Travers found the colony a delightful smrgsbord of different races and cultures, numbering over six thousand, and the Singapore trade was slowly overtaking the Java trade.   As in Java, Raffles collected samples of local species of plants and animals, as well as described them in his journals. He also described other local tribes and their customs, especially their  religions  and laws. He brought the island of  Nias  under British rule as well, noting its more civilized state and production of rice.   Yet, the production of food remained somewhat of a problem in Bencoolen. Raffles paid special attention to the agricultural methods of the  Chinese , and wrote an introduction to the only issue of  Proceedings of the Agricultural Society , in order to remedy this. His employer, the  East India Company , however, had no other concerns outside of profit, and even as Raffles lived like a country gentleman and ran his colony as an estate, his expenditures in natural preservation was frowned upon. His removal was discussed in both Calcutta and London, while Castlereagh continued negotiations with the Dutch regarding the ongoing diplomatic conflicts.   Luckily, the Singapore issue had its supporters in the House, so as negotiations went on in Europe, Raffles remained largely idle in Bencoolen. The only major issue, outside of the politics of local sultans, involved the replacement of Farquhar, who decided that he had no intention of leaving his post voluntarily, causing a moment of tension between him and Travers. Raffles' request for Travers to deliver dispatches to India nullified the issue late in the year, and Farquhar remained in charge in Singapore, with its survival still in doubt for many in both India and London, who believed that it would either be handed over to the Dutch or taken violently by the Dutch at the end of Castlereagh's negotiations.   Farquhar, however, stirred up more trouble, conflicting especially with local English merchants over trivial matters of self-importance and overreaction over small infractions of white traders, for some of which he was reprimanded by Calcutta officially.  Public works , commissioned by Raffles but undertaken by Farquhar, was becoming overwhelmingly expensive.   Personal tragedies also started for Raffles. His eldest son, Leopold, died during an  epidemic  on 4 July 1821. The oldest daughter, Charlotte, was also sick with dysentery by the end of the year, but it would be his youngest son, Stamford Marsden, who would perish first with the disease, 3 January 1822, with Charlotte to follow ten days later. For the good part of four month the couple remained devastated. The year would be eventful with the suicide of Castlereagh and the appointment of  Lord Amherst  as the  Governor-General of India , replacing Hastings. As Raffles grew restless and depressed, he decided to visit Singapore, before heading home to England. Accompanying him would be his wife Sophia and only surviving child, Ella.     [ edit ]   Singapore - 1822 - 1823          The  Plan of the Town of Singapore , or more commonly known as the  Jackson Plan       Raffles was pleased at the fact that Singapore had grown exponentially in such short years. The colony was a bustling hub of trade and activity. However, Farquhar's development work was deemed unsatisfactory and Raffles drew up what is now known as the  Jackson Plan , and replanned the city according to recommendations of a committee headed by the colony's engineer, Phillip Jackson.   It was still a segregated plan, giving the best land to the Europeans, yet it was considered remarkably scientific for the time. It was also during the replanning and reconstruction of the town that allowed Farquhar to clash dramatically with Raffles, who now considered Farquhar unfit for the position of Resident. Raffles took direct control with a heavy hand. In 1823, Raffles instituted a code of settlement for the populace, and soon followed with laws regarding the freedom of trade. He also quickly instituted a registration system for all land, regardless of ownership, and the repossession of the land by the government if land remained unregistered. This act greatly asserted the power of the British government as it covered land previously owned by the Sultan as well. A police force and magistrate was then set up, under British principles. In a very short period of time, Raffles had turned a semi-anarchic trading post into a proper city with at least a semblance of order.   Repeated efforts by Raffles for Calcutta to send a replacement for Farquhar remained unanswered. As Raffles started to hint at his impending retirement, he made Johore a British protectorate, causing a protest from van der Capellen. Finally, Calcutta appointed  John Crawfurd , who had followed Raffles for over twenty years, as the Resident of Singapore. Captain  William Gordon MacKenzie  took over Bencoolen from Raffles. It's March 1823, and coincidentally, on the same day he was replaced, he received an official reprimand from London for the takeover of Nias.   With politics against him, Raffles finally turned back to the natural sciences. He gave a speech regarding the opening of a Malay college in Singapore that heavily involved his observations of his years in Southeast Asia and the importance of both the local and the European languages. Raffles personally gave $2000 towards the effort, as the East India Company gave $4000.   In 1823, Raffles drafted the first constitution for Singapore, which followed a fairly moralistic stance, outlawing gaming and slavery. A specific regulation in the constitution called for the multiethnic population of Singapore to remain as is, and there shall be no crimes based on being a race. He then went to work drafting laws, defining on exactly ""what"" constituted a crime. Finally, on 9 July 1823, feeling that his work on establishing Singapore was finished, he boarded a ship for home, but not before a stop in Batavia to visit his old home and adversary, van der Capellen. A final stop in Bencoolen ensued, and finally, a voyage home, interrupted by a harrowing experience when one of the ships caught fire off Rat Island, which claimed many of his drawings and papers.   The  Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824  finally settled the score in the East Indies. The British gained dominance in the north, while the entirety of Sumatra became Dutch. The Malay Peninsula and the  Indian subcontinent  were both free of Dutch interference.   Raffles finally returned to England 22 August 1824, over a year after he left Singapore. His longest tenure in Singapore was only eight months, but he was considered the founder of Singapore nevertheless.     [ edit ]   England and death   Upon arrival in England in poor health, both Sir Stamford and Lady Raffles convalesced in  Cheltenham  until September, after which he entertained distinguished guests in both London and his home. He also made considerations to run for parliament during this time, but this ambition was never realized. He moved to London at the end of November, just in time to have a war of words in front of the Court of Directors of the EIC regarding Singapore with Farquhar, who had also arrived in London. Despite several severe charges put upon Raffles, Farquhar was ultimately unable to discredit him and was denied a chance to be restored to Singapore, but he was given a military promotion instead.   With the Singapore matter settled, Raffles turned to his other great hobby - botany. Raffles was a founder (in 1825) and first president (elected April 1826) of the  Zoological Society of London  and the  London Zoo . Meanwhile, he was not only not granted a  pension , but was called to pay over twenty-two thousand pounds sterling for the losses incurred during his administrations. Raffles replied and clarified his actions, and moved to his country estate, Highwood, but before the issue was resolved, he was already much too ill.   He died in London, England, a day before his forty-fifth birthday, on 5 July 1826, of  apoplexy . His estate amounted around ten thousand pounds sterling, which was paid to the Company to cover his outstanding debt. Because of his  anti-slavery  stance, he was refused burial inside his local parish church (St. Mary's,  Hendon ) by the  vicar , whose family had made its money in the slave trade. A brass tablet was finally placed in 1887 and the actual whereabouts of his body was not known until 1914 when it was found in a vault. When the church was extended in the 1920s his tomb was incorporated into the body of the building.     [ edit ]   Coat of Arms   The Blazon of his Armorial Ensigns reads:     ""Or a double headed Eagle displayed Gules charged on the breast with an Eastern Crown on the first, on a Chief Vert pendent from a chain two oval Medallions in Pale the one bearing Arabic characters and the other a dagger in fess the blade wavy the point towards the dexter in relief Or, the said medallions and chain being a representation of a personal decoration called the Order of the Golden Sword conferred upon by him by the Chief or King of Atcheen in Sumatra as a mark of the high regard of the said King and in testimony of the good understanding which had been happily established between that Prince and the British Government; and for a crest out of an Eastern Crown Or a Gryphon's Head Purpure gorged with a collar gemel Gold.""     The  Coat of Arms  has been adapted into the school arms of  Raffles Institution  and  Raffles Junior College . It can also be found as part of a  stained-glass window  in  St. Andrew's Cathedral, Singapore . The motto of the Raffles family is  in cruce triumphans , meaning  triumphing in the cross .

He was also heavily involved in the conquest of the Indonesian island of  Java  from Dutch and French military forces during the  Napoleonic Wars .

His father was involved in the  Caribbean   slave trade , and died suddenly when Raffles was fourteen, leaving his family in debt. Raffles then started working as a  clerk  in London for the  British East India Company , the trading company that shaped many of Britain's overseas conquests. In 1805 he was sent to what is now  Penang  in the country of  Malaysia , then called the Prince of Wales Island, starting his long association with  Southeast Asia . He started with a post under the Honourable  Philip Dundas , the Governor of Penang.   As he was gazetted assistant secretary to the new Governor of Penang in 1805, he married Olivia Mariamne Devenish, a widow who was formerly married to Jacob Cassivelaun Fancourt, an assistant surgeon in Madras who had died in 1800. It was also at this time that he made acquaintance with  Thomas Otho Travers , who would accompany him for the next twenty years.     [ edit ]   Java   His knowledge of the  Malay language  as well as his wit and ability, gained him favour with  Lord Minto ,  governor of India , and he was sent to  Malacca . Then, in 1811, after the invasion and annexation of the  Kingdom of Holland  by France during Napoleon's war, Raffles had no choice but to leave the country. He mounted a military expedition against the Dutch and French in  Java ,  Indonesia . The war was swiftly conducted by  Admiral Robert Stopford , General Wetherhall, and Colonel Gillespie, who led a well-organized army against an army of mostly French conscripts with little proper leadership. The previous Dutch governor,  Herman Willem Daendels , had built a well-defended fortification at  Meester Cornelis  (now  Jatinegara ), and at the time, the governor,  Jan Willem Janssens  (who, coincidentally, surrendered to the British at the  Cape Colony ), mounted a brave but ultimately futile defense at the fortress. The British, led by Colonel Gillespie, stormed the fort and captured it within three hours. Janssens attempted to escape inland but was captured. The British invasion of Java took a total of forty-five days, during which Raffles was appointed the Lieutenant-Governor by Lord Minto before hostilities formally ceased. He took his residence at  Buitenzorg  and despite having a small subset of Britons as his senior staff, he kept many of the Dutch civil servants in the governmental structure. He also negotiated peace and mounted some small military expeditions against local princes to subjugate them to British rule, as well as a takeover of  Bangka Island  to set up a permanent British presence in the area in the case of the return of Java to Dutch rule after the end of the  War of the Sixth Coalition  in Europe.   During his governorship, Raffles introduced partial  self-government , stopped the slave trade, became an early opponent of the  Opium trade  by placing strict limitations upon its importation, much to the dismay of Calcutta, led an expedition to rediscover and restore  Borobudur  and other ancient monuments, and replaced the Dutch forced agriculture system with a  land tenure  system of land management, probably influenced by the earlier writings of Dirk van Hogendorp (1761-1822). He also changed the Dutch colonies to the British system of driving on the left, [ citation needed ] which is why Indonesia drives on the left today.   Under the harsh conditions of the island, Olivia died on 26 November 1814, an event that devastated Raffles. In 1815, he left again for England after the island of Java was returned to control of the Netherlands following the  Napoleonic Wars , under the terms of the  Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814 , but not before he was officially replaced by  John Fendall  on account of the poor financial performance of the colony during his administration, as deemed by the successors of Lord Minto in Calcutta. He sailed to England in early 1816 to clear his name, and en route, visited  Napoleon , who was in exile at  St. Helena , but found him unpleasant and unimpressive.     [ edit ]   Interlude in England          Raffles in 1817       In 1817, Raffles wrote and published a book entitled  History of Java , describing the history of the island from ancient times. In 1817 he was knighted by the prince regent, whose daughter,  Princess Charlotte , was particularly close to him. At the publication of the book, he also stopped using the name ""Thomas"", preferring to use his middle name, ""Stamford"", possibly to avoid confusion amongst his associates with  Sir Thomas Sevestre  or his cousin who bore the same name. On 22 February, he married his second wife, Sophia Hull.   He was appointed as the Governor-General of Bencoolen (now  Bengkulu ) on 15 October 1817, and set sail to take the post with his new wife.     [ edit ]   Bencoolen (Bengkulu) and Malaya   Raffles arrived in Bencoolen ( Bengkulu ) on 19 March 1818. Despite the prestige connected with the title, Bencoolen was a colonial backwater whose only real export was pepper and only the murder of a previous Resident, Thomas Parr, gained it any attention back home in Britain. Raffles found the place wretched, and set about reforms immediately, mostly similar to what he had done in Java - abolishing slavery and limiting cockfighting and such games. To replace the slaves, he used a contingent of  convicts , already sent to him from India. It is at this point when he realized the importance of a British presence that both challenged the Dutch hegemony in the area and could remain consistently profitable, unlike Bencoolen or Batavia. However, the strategic importance of poorly-maintained but well-positioned  British possessions  such as Penang or Bencoolen made it impossible for the British to abandon such unprofitable colonies in such close proximity to the Dutch in Java. The competition in the area, between Raffles and the aggressive Dutch  de jure  Governor, Elout, certainly led at least in part to the later  Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 . Raffles looked into alternatives in the area - namely Bangka, which had been ceded to the Dutch after its conquest by the British during its occupation of Java.   Bintan  was also under consideration. Despite the fact that  Warren Hastings  overlooked the island before settling upon Penang in 1786, the  Riau Archipelago  was an attractive choice just to the south of the  Malay Peninsula , for its proximity to  Malacca . In his correspondences with Calcutta, Raffles also emphasized the need to establish a certain amount of influence with the native chiefs, which had greatly waned since the return of the Dutch. Raffles sent Thomas Travers as an ambassador to the Dutch, to possibly negotiate an expansion of British economic interests. When this failed, and when Raffles' own expeditions into his new dominion found only treacherous terrain and few exportable goods, his desire to establish a better British presence was cemented.   However, the Anglo-Dutch Convention of 1814 was not completely clear, especially on the issue of certain possessions such as  Padang . The Convention of 1814 only returned Dutch territory that was held before 1803, which did not include Padang. Raffles asserted the British claim personally, leading a small expedition to the  Sultanate of Minangkabau . Yet, as Raffles confirmed with the sultan regarding the absolute British influence of the area, he realized that the local rulers had only limited power over the well-cultivated and civilized country, and the treaty was largely symbolic and had little actual force.     [ edit ]   The founding of Singapore          Statue of Sir Stamford Raffles in Singapore, based on the original by  Thomas Woolner       Meanwhile, Major  William Farquhar , the  British Resident  of Malacca, had been attempting to negotiate  commercial treaties  with the local chiefs of the Riau Archipelago, especially with the heads of the  Sultanate of Johore . Due to the death and subsequent turmoil of the sultanate at the time of Farquhar's arrival, Farquhar was compelled to sign the treaty not with the official head of the sultanate, but rather, the Raja Muda (Regent or Crown Prince) of Riau. Noting it as a success and reporting it as such back to Raffles, Raffles sailed to Malacca in late 1818 to personally secure a British presence in the Riau area, especially  Singapura , which was favored by him both through the readings of Malayan histories and by Farquhar's explorations.   Despite  Lord Hastings'  less-than-stellar opinion of Raffles before (which had necessitated his trip to England to clear his name at the end of his tenure as Governor-General of Java), the now well-connected and successful Raffles was able to secure the permission to set up a settlement where in  Malaysian history  the name  Lion City  was applied and was in a strategically advantageous position. However, he was not to provoke the Dutch, and his actions were officially disavowed. Despite the best efforts in London by authorities such as the  Viscount Castlereagh  to quell Dutch fears and the continuing efforts to reach an agreement between the nations that eventually became the  Anglo-Dutch Treaty  of London of 1824, as well as to send instructions to Raffles to undertake far less intrusive actions, the distance between the Far East and Europe had meant that the orders had no chance of reaching Raffles in time for his venture to begin.     [ edit ]   Singapore     [ edit ]   Establishment   After a brief survey of the  Karimun Islands , on 29 January 1819, he established a post at the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula. It was established that there was no Dutch presence on the island of Singapore. Johore also no longer had any control of the area, so contact was made with the local Temenggong, or Raja. The contacts were friendly and Raffles, knowledgeable about the muddled political situation, took advantage to provide a rudimentary treaty between the nominal chiefs of the area that called for the exclusivity of trade and the English protection of the area. Members of Raffles' party surveyed the island and proceeded to request the presence of the sultan, or whoever at the time had supreme nominal power, to sign a formal treaty, while Major Farquhar was ordered to do the same in Rhio. A few days later, the formal treaty signed by a man who claimed to be the ""lawful sovereign of the whole of territories extending from  Lingga  and  Johor  to  Mount Muar "". This man was  Hussein Shah of Johor , who, although having had no previous contact with the British, had certainly heard of the might of the  British navy  and was in no position to argue against the terms. However, Raffles was able to charm the man and to reassure him that the Dutch posed no threat in the area. Hussein Shah had been the crown Prince of Johor, but while he was away in Pahang to get married, his father died and his younger brother was made sultan, supported by some of the court officials and the Dutch. To circumvent the situation of having to negotiate with a sultan influenced by the Dutch, Raffles decided to recognise, on behalf of the British Crown, Hussien Shah as being the rightful ruler of Johor. Farquhar's attempt to establish a more favorable treaty in Rhio was met with greater challenge, as the Dutch were present and made for a rather awkward position. The Dutch were alarmed and sent a small contingent to the island. Despite a covert offer of subterfuge against the Dutch offered by the Raja of Rhio, Farquhar returned and an official protest was sent by the Raja to Java regarding the matter.   Raffles declared the foundation of what was to become modern Singapore on 6 February, securing the transfer of control of the island to the East India Company. Much pomp and ceremony was done, and the official treaty was read aloud in languages representing all nations present, as well as the Malay and Chinese inhabitants. Hussien Shah was paid $5000 a year while the local Temenggong received $3000 a year, both massive sums at the time, equivalent to several hundred thousand dollars now [ citation needed ] . Farquhar was officially named the Resident of Singapore as Raffles was named as ""Agent to the Most Noble the Governor-General with the States of Rhio, Lingin and Johor"". Although ownership of the post was to be exclusively British, explicit orders were given to Farquhar to maintain free passage of ships through the  Strait of Singapore  and a small military presence was established alongside the trading post. After issuing orders to Farquhar and the remaining Europeans, Raffles left the next day, 7 February 1819.     [ edit ]   Achin, and the early conflict/crisis with the Dutch   Raffles also planned to start a British presence in  Achin , at the northern tip of Sumatra. As soon as he left, the Raja of Rhio sent letters to the Dutch, claiming innocence and a British encroachment. The Dutch in Malacca acted at once, and ordered that no Malays could go to Singapore. Raffles' bold claim of Singapore created a curious geographic situation where although Penang was clearly closer distance-wise to Singapore, Raffles, in his capacity as the Governor-General of Bencoolen, was in control. This undoubtedly irked the authorities in Penang to the point where they refused to send any sepoys to Singapore to complete the garrison. Official Dutch complaints came before the end of the month, and Raffles attempted to appease the situation by instructing Farquhar to not interfere with the politics of surrounding islands. Despite numerous threats and serious considerations by the Dutch Governor-General in Java, the Dutch did not take any military action.   The muddled political situation in Johore and Rhio also created a certain uneasiness and instability for the two nations. Tengku Long  was claimed to be a  pretender  to the throne, and since the  succession  laws in the Malay sultanates were not as clear cut as, for example, the  Salic  laws of Europe, the treaties signed between native rulers and the European powers always seemed to be on the verge of being invalidated, especially if a sultan is deposed by one of his siblings or other pretenders.   Nevertheless, amidst the uncertainty and intrigue, Raffles landed in Achin on 14 March 1819, with the begrudging help of Penang. Once again, it seems that multiple people were in power, but none wanted to formally deal with the British. The hostile atmosphere created allowed for Raffles to cancel the only meeting he was able to arrange, with  Panglima Polim , a powerful divisional chief, fearing treachery. As the influential merchant  John Palmer , Raffles, and fellow commissioner John Monckton Coombs of Penang sat offshore, waiting for a response, Calcutta debated whether to reinforce Singapore or not. Evacuation plans were made, but the Dutch never acted and finally Lord Hastings prompted Colonel Bannerman, the Governor of Penang, to send funds to reinforce Singapore.   Raffles finally was able to convince his fellow commissioners to sign a treaty with Jauhar al-Alam Shah, the ruler of Achin, which placed a British resident as well as the exclusivity of trade. By the time Raffles returned to Singapore, on 31 May, much of the immediate crisis that the establishment of the colony had caused in both Penang and Calcutta had passed. By then, the initial five-hundred villagers had grown to become five-thousand merchants, soldiers, and administrators on the island. Raffles was determined to both destroy the Dutch monopoly in the area, and create a gateway to the trade with China and Japan, the latter of which he attempted and failed to reach while governing Java.     [ edit ]   The first year of Singapore   While in Singapore, Raffles established schools and churches in the native languages. He allowed  missionaries  and local businesses to flourish. Certain colonial aspects remained: a European town was quickly built to  segregate  the population, separated by a river; carriage roads were built and cantonments constructed for the soldiers. Otherwise, however, no duties were imposed and confident that Farquhar would follow his instructions well, he sailed for Bencoolen once again on 28 June.     [ edit ]   Bencoolen, once again   Raffles was still the Governor-General of  Bencoolen  and having returned to it after the settling of Singapore, Raffles started more reforms that were, by now, almost trademarks of his reign upon colonies. Forced labor was abolished when he first arrived, and he declared Bencoolen a  free port  as well. Currency was regulated and as he had an excess of out-of-work  civil servants , formed committees to advise him in the running of the colony. However, Bencoolen was not as self-sufficient as Singapore. The area was poor and disease-ridden, and the first reports from the committees reflected very poorly upon the condition of the colony. Unlike the  salutary neglect  Raffles granted upon Singapore, he slowed the European-inspired reforms and emphasized on the cultivation of whatever land that was available. Native authorities were given power in their respective districts and were answerable only to the Governor-General. The slave-debtor system was brought in in exchange instead of the old slavery system that Raffles abolished in Java, Borneo, and initially in Bencoolen. Slave-debtors were registered, and educational reforms started to focus on the children instead of the entire population. Raffles was looking into a long-term plan for a slow reform of Bencoolen.   Unlike many other European colonizers, Raffles did not impose upon the colonized the language, culture, or other aspects of the colonizer. In addition to preserving the  artifacts ,  fauna , and  flora  of his colonies, he also allowed  religious freedom  in his colonies, especially important as the  Malay states  were largely  Muslim . However,  Christian  schools, especially schools for the very young and impressionable, were started by missionaries in all of his colonies.     [ edit ]   Consolidation of the Eastern Isles   The death of Colonel Bannerman of Penang in October 1819 brought upon a new opportunity for Raffles to expand his power to also include the other minor British factories and outposts from Sumatra to  Cochin China . He sailed to Calcutta and as Lord Hastings sought to consolidate all of the small British possessions in the  East Indies . During his sojourn, he had the opportunity to argue for free trade and the protection of the private enterprise. Education and the retention of small British outposts were also discussed.   The Dutch claim on the Sultanate of Johore and hence, Rhio, and the diplomatic exchanges between Baron  Godert van der Capellen  and Calcutta continued throughout this time. The legitimacy of the British treaties were also questioned once again, but finally, as Singapore grew at an exponential rate, the Dutch gave up their claim on the island, allowing the colony to continue as a British possession. However, the pressures put upon Calcutta ensured that no single governor of all British possessions in the Strait or on Sumatra was appointed, and Raffles, whose health was slowly ailing, returned to Bencoolen.     [ edit ]   Administration of Bencoolen, 1820 - 1822   Raffles returned to Bencoolen in ill-health, but as his health improved, he continued on his quest to learn about the island which he now called home. He studied the  Batak   cannibals  of  Tappanooly  and their rituals and laws regarding the consumption of human flesh, writing in detail about the transgressions that warranted such an act as well as their methods. He also noted the rise of the Sikh religion in certain parts of Sumatra.   By early 1820, Tunku Long had firmly established himself as the Sultan of Johore to the British, but the political situation in the area remains a befuddled mess, with the old sultan dying and many new ones attempting to gain either the crown or regency. As Farquhar was involving himself poorly in local politics, Raffles appointed Travers as the Resident of Singapore, replacing Farquhar. Upon his arrival, Travers found the colony a delightful smrgsbord of different races and cultures, numbering over six thousand, and the Singapore trade was slowly overtaking the Java trade.   As in Java, Raffles collected samples of local species of plants and animals, as well as described them in his journals. He also described other local tribes and their customs, especially their  religions  and laws. He brought the island of  Nias  under British rule as well, noting its more civilized state and production of rice.   Yet, the production of food remained somewhat of a problem in Bencoolen. Raffles paid special attention to the agricultural methods of the  Chinese , and wrote an introduction to the only issue of  Proceedings of the Agricultural Society , in order to remedy this. His employer, the  East India Company , however, had no other concerns outside of profit, and even as Raffles lived like a country gentleman and ran his colony as an estate, his expenditures in natural preservation was frowned upon. His removal was discussed in both Calcutta and London, while Castlereagh continued negotiations with the Dutch regarding the ongoing diplomatic conflicts.   Luckily, the Singapore issue had its supporters in the House, so as negotiations went on in Europe, Raffles remained largely idle in Bencoolen. The only major issue, outside of the politics of local sultans, involved the replacement of Farquhar, who decided that he had no intention of leaving his post voluntarily, causing a moment of tension between him and Travers. Raffles' request for Travers to deliver dispatches to India nullified the issue late in the year, and Farquhar remained in charge in Singapore, with its survival still in doubt for many in both India and London, who believed that it would either be handed over to the Dutch or taken violently by the Dutch at the end of Castlereagh's negotiations.   Farquhar, however, stirred up more trouble, conflicting especially with local English merchants over trivial matters of self-importance and overreaction over small infractions of white traders, for some of which he was reprimanded by Calcutta officially.  Public works , commissioned by Raffles but undertaken by Farquhar, was becoming overwhelmingly expensive.   Personal tragedies also started for Raffles. His eldest son, Leopold, died during an  epidemic  on 4 July 1821. The oldest daughter, Charlotte, was also sick with dysentery by the end of the year, but it would be his youngest son, Stamford Marsden, who would perish first with the disease, 3 January 1822, with Charlotte to follow ten days later. For the good part of four month the couple remained devastated. The year would be eventful with the suicide of Castlereagh and the appointment of  Lord Amherst  as the  Governor-General of India , replacing Hastings. As Raffles grew restless and depressed, he decided to visit Singapore, before heading home to England. Accompanying him would be his wife Sophia and only surviving child, Ella.     [ edit ]   Singapore - 1822 - 1823          The  Plan of the Town of Singapore , or more commonly known as the  Jackson Plan       Raffles was pleased at the fact that Singapore had grown exponentially in such short years. The colony was a bustling hub of trade and activity. However, Farquhar's development work was deemed unsatisfactory and Raffles drew up what is now known as the  Jackson Plan , and replanned the city according to recommendations of a committee headed by the colony's engineer, Phillip Jackson.   It was still a segregated plan, giving the best land to the Europeans, yet it was considered remarkably scientific for the time. It was also during the replanning and reconstruction of the town that allowed Farquhar to clash dramatically with Raffles, who now considered Farquhar unfit for the position of Resident. Raffles took direct control with a heavy hand. In 1823, Raffles instituted a code of settlement for the populace, and soon followed with laws regarding the freedom of trade. He also quickly instituted a registration system for all land, regardless of ownership, and the repossession of the land by the government if land remained unregistered. This act greatly asserted the power of the British government as it covered land previously owned by the Sultan as well. A police force and magistrate was then set up, under British principles. In a very short period of time, Raffles had turned a semi-anarchic trading post into a proper city with at least a semblance of order.   Repeated efforts by Raffles for Calcutta to send a replacement for Farquhar remained unanswered. As Raffles started to hint at his impending retirement, he made Johore a British protectorate, causing a protest from van der Capellen. Finally, Calcutta appointed  John Crawfurd , who had followed Raffles for over twenty years, as the Resident of Singapore. Captain  William Gordon MacKenzie  took over Bencoolen from Raffles. It's March 1823, and coincidentally, on the same day he was replaced, he received an official reprimand from London for the takeover of Nias.   With politics against him, Raffles finally turned back to the natural sciences. He gave a speech regarding the opening of a Malay college in Singapore that heavily involved his observations of his years in Southeast Asia and the importance of both the local and the European languages. Raffles personally gave $2000 towards the effort, as the East India Company gave $4000.   In 1823, Raffles drafted the first constitution for Singapore, which followed a fairly moralistic stance, outlawing gaming and slavery. A specific regulation in the constitution called for the multiethnic population of Singapore to remain as is, and there shall be no crimes based on being a race. He then went to work drafting laws, defining on exactly ""what"" constituted a crime. Finally, on 9 July 1823, feeling that his work on establishing Singapore was finished, he boarded a ship for home, but not before a stop in Batavia to visit his old home and adversary, van der Capellen. A final stop in Bencoolen ensued, and finally, a voyage home, interrupted by a harrowing experience when one of the ships caught fire off Rat Island, which claimed many of his drawings and papers.   The  Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824  finally settled the score in the East Indies. The British gained dominance in the north, while the entirety of Sumatra became Dutch. The Malay Peninsula and the  Indian subcontinent  were both free of Dutch interference.   Raffles finally returned to England 22 August 1824, over a year after he left Singapore. His longest tenure in Singapore was only eight months, but he was considered the founder of Singapore nevertheless.     [ edit ]   England and death   Upon arrival in England in poor health, both Sir Stamford and Lady Raffles convalesced in  Cheltenham  until September, after which he entertained distinguished guests in both London and his home. He also made considerations to run for parliament during this time, but this ambition was never realized. He moved to London at the end of November, just in time to have a war of words in front of the Court of Directors of the EIC regarding Singapore with Farquhar, who had also arrived in London. Despite several severe charges put upon Raffles, Farquhar was ultimately unable to discredit him and was denied a chance to be restored to Singapore, but he was given a military promotion instead.   With the Singapore matter settled, Raffles turned to his other great hobby - botany. Raffles was a founder (in 1825) and first president (elected April 1826) of the  Zoological Society of London  and the  London Zoo . Meanwhile, he was not only not granted a  pension , but was called to pay over twenty-two thousand pounds sterling for the losses incurred during his administrations. Raffles replied and clarified his actions, and moved to his country estate, Highwood, but before the issue was resolved, he was already much too ill.   He died in London, England, a day before his forty-fifth birthday, on 5 July 1826, of  apoplexy . His estate amounted around ten thousand pounds sterling, which was paid to the Company to cover his outstanding debt. Because of his  anti-slavery  stance, he was refused burial inside his local parish church (St. Mary's,  Hendon ) by the  vicar , whose family had made its money in the slave trade. A brass tablet was finally placed in 1887 and the actual whereabouts of his body was not known until 1914 when it was found in a vault. When the church was extended in the 1920s his tomb was incorporated into the body of the building.     [ edit ]   Coat of Arms   The Blazon of his Armorial Ensigns reads:     ""Or a double headed Eagle displayed Gules charged on the breast with an Eastern Crown on the first, on a Chief Vert pendent from a chain two oval Medallions in Pale the one bearing Arabic characters and the other a dagger in fess the blade wavy the point towards the dexter in relief Or, the said medallions and chain being a representation of a personal decoration called the Order of the Golden Sword conferred upon by him by the Chief or King of Atcheen in Sumatra as a mark of the high regard of the said King and in testimony of the good understanding which had been happily established between that Prince and the British Government; and for a crest out of an Eastern Crown Or a Gryphon's Head Purpure gorged with a collar gemel Gold.""     The  Coat of Arms  has been adapted into the school arms of  Raffles Institution  and  Raffles Junior College . It can also be found as part of a  stained-glass window  in  St. Andrew's Cathedral, Singapore . The motto of the Raffles family is  in cruce triumphans , meaning  triumphing in the cross .

He was also heavily involved in the conquest of the Indonesian island of  Java  from Dutch and French military forces during the  Napoleonic Wars .

His father was involved in the  Caribbean   slave trade , and died suddenly when Raffles was fourteen, leaving his family in debt. Raffles then started working as a  clerk  in London for the  British East India Company , the trading company that shaped many of Britain's overseas conquests. In 1805 he was sent to what is now  Penang  in the country of  Malaysia , then called the Prince of Wales Island, starting his long association with  Southeast Asia . He started with a post under the Honourable  Philip Dundas , the Governor of Penang.   As he was gazetted assistant secretary to the new Governor of Penang in 1805, he married Olivia Mariamne Devenish, a widow who was formerly married to Jacob Cassivelaun Fancourt, an assistant surgeon in Madras who had died in 1800. It was also at this time that he made acquaintance with  Thomas Otho Travers , who would accompany him for the next twenty years.     [ edit ]   Java   His knowledge of the  Malay language  as well as his wit and ability, gained him favour with  Lord Minto ,  governor of India , and he was sent to  Malacca . Then, in 1811, after the invasion and annexation of the  Kingdom of Holland  by France during Napoleon's war, Raffles had no choice but to leave the country. He mounted a military expedition against the Dutch and French in  Java ,  Indonesia . The war was swiftly conducted by  Admiral Robert Stopford , General Wetherhall, and Colonel Gillespie, who led a well-organized army against an army of mostly French conscripts with little proper leadership. The previous Dutch governor,  Herman Willem Daendels , had built a well-defended fortification at  Meester Cornelis  (now  Jatinegara ), and at the time, the governor,  Jan Willem Janssens  (who, coincidentally, surrendered to the British at the  Cape Colony ), mounted a brave but ultimately futile defense at the fortress. The British, led by Colonel Gillespie, stormed the fort and captured it within three hours. Janssens attempted to escape inland but was captured. The British invasion of Java took a total of forty-five days, during which Raffles was appointed the Lieutenant-Governor by Lord Minto before hostilities formally ceased. He took his residence at  Buitenzorg  and despite having a small subset of Britons as his senior staff, he kept many of the Dutch civil servants in the governmental structure. He also negotiated peace and mounted some small military expeditions against local princes to subjugate them to British rule, as well as a takeover of  Bangka Island  to set up a permanent British presence in the area in the case of the return of Java to Dutch rule after the end of the  War of the Sixth Coalition  in Europe.   During his governorship, Raffles introduced partial  self-government , stopped the slave trade, became an early opponent of the  Opium trade  by placing strict limitations upon its importation, much to the dismay of Calcutta, led an expedition to rediscover and restore  Borobudur  and other ancient monuments, and replaced the Dutch forced agriculture system with a  land tenure  system of land management, probably influenced by the earlier writings of Dirk van Hogendorp (1761-1822). He also changed the Dutch colonies to the British system of driving on the left, [ citation needed ] which is why Indonesia drives on the left today.   Under the harsh conditions of the island, Olivia died on 26 November 1814, an event that devastated Raffles. In 1815, he left again for England after the island of Java was returned to control of the Netherlands following the  Napoleonic Wars , under the terms of the  Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814 , but not before he was officially replaced by  John Fendall  on account of the poor financial performance of the colony during his administration, as deemed by the successors of Lord Minto in Calcutta. He sailed to England in early 1816 to clear his name, and en route, visited  Napoleon , who was in exile at  St. Helena , but found him unpleasant and unimpressive.     [ edit ]   Interlude in England          Raffles in 1817       In 1817, Raffles wrote and published a book entitled  History of Java , describing the history of the island from ancient times. In 1817 he was knighted by the prince regent, whose daughter,  Princess Charlotte , was particularly close to him. At the publication of the book, he also stopped using the name ""Thomas"", preferring to use his middle name, ""Stamford"", possibly to avoid confusion amongst his associates with  Sir Thomas Sevestre  or his cousin who bore the same name. On 22 February, he married his second wife, Sophia Hull.   He was appointed as the Governor-General of Bencoolen (now  Bengkulu ) on 15 October 1817, and set sail to take the post with his new wife.     [ edit ]   Bencoolen (Bengkulu) and Malaya   Raffles arrived in Bencoolen ( Bengkulu ) on 19 March 1818. Despite the prestige connected with the title, Bencoolen was a colonial backwater whose only real export was pepper and only the murder of a previous Resident, Thomas Parr, gained it any attention back home in Britain. Raffles found the place wretched, and set about reforms immediately, mostly similar to what he had done in Java - abolishing slavery and limiting cockfighting and such games. To replace the slaves, he used a contingent of  convicts , already sent to him from India. It is at this point when he realized the importance of a British presence that both challenged the Dutch hegemony in the area and could remain consistently profitable, unlike Bencoolen or Batavia. However, the strategic importance of poorly-maintained but well-positioned  British possessions  such as Penang or Bencoolen made it impossible for the British to abandon such unprofitable colonies in such close proximity to the Dutch in Java. The competition in the area, between Raffles and the aggressive Dutch  de jure  Governor, Elout, certainly led at least in part to the later  Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 . Raffles looked into alternatives in the area - namely Bangka, which had been ceded to the Dutch after its conquest by the British during its occupation of Java.   Bintan  was also under consideration. Despite the fact that  Warren Hastings  overlooked the island before settling upon Penang in 1786, the  Riau Archipelago  was an attractive choice just to the south of the  Malay Peninsula , for its proximity to  Malacca . In his correspondences with Calcutta, Raffles also emphasized the need to establish a certain amount of influence with the native chiefs, which had greatly waned since the return of the Dutch. Raffles sent Thomas Travers as an ambassador to the Dutch, to possibly negotiate an expansion of British economic interests. When this failed, and when Raffles' own expeditions into his new dominion found only treacherous terrain and few exportable goods, his desire to establish a better British presence was cemented.   However, the Anglo-Dutch Convention of 1814 was not completely clear, especially on the issue of certain possessions such as  Padang . The Convention of 1814 only returned Dutch territory that was held before 1803, which did not include Padang. Raffles asserted the British claim personally, leading a small expedition to the  Sultanate of Minangkabau . Yet, as Raffles confirmed with the sultan regarding the absolute British influence of the area, he realized that the local rulers had only limited power over the well-cultivated and civilized country, and the treaty was largely symbolic and had little actual force.     [ edit ]   The founding of Singapore          Statue of Sir Stamford Raffles in Singapore, based on the original by  Thomas Woolner       Meanwhile, Major  William Farquhar , the  British Resident  of Malacca, had been attempting to negotiate  commercial treaties  with the local chiefs of the Riau Archipelago, especially with the heads of the  Sultanate of Johore . Due to the death and subsequent turmoil of the sultanate at the time of Farquhar's arrival, Farquhar was compelled to sign the treaty not with the official head of the sultanate, but rather, the Raja Muda (Regent or Crown Prince) of Riau. Noting it as a success and reporting it as such back to Raffles, Raffles sailed to Malacca in late 1818 to personally secure a British presence in the Riau area, especially  Singapura , which was favored by him both through the readings of Malayan histories and by Farquhar's explorations.   Despite  Lord Hastings'  less-than-stellar opinion of Raffles before (which had necessitated his trip to England to clear his name at the end of his tenure as Governor-General of Java), the now well-connected and successful Raffles was able to secure the permission to set up a settlement where in  Malaysian history  the name  Lion City  was applied and was in a strategically advantageous position. However, he was not to provoke the Dutch, and his actions were officially disavowed. Despite the best efforts in London by authorities such as the  Viscount Castlereagh  to quell Dutch fears and the continuing efforts to reach an agreement between the nations that eventually became the  Anglo-Dutch Treaty  of London of 1824, as well as to send instructions to Raffles to undertake far less intrusive actions, the distance between the Far East and Europe had meant that the orders had no chance of reaching Raffles in time for his venture to begin.       [ edit ]   Singapore     [ edit ]   Establishment   After a brief survey of the  Karimun Islands , on 29 January 1819, he established a post at the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula. It was established that there was no Dutch presence on the island of Singapore. Johore also no longer had any control of the area, so contact was made with the local Temenggong, or Raja. The contacts were friendly and Raffles, knowledgeable about the muddled political situation, took advantage to provide a rudimentary treaty between the nominal chiefs of the area that called for the exclusivity of trade and the English protection of the area. Members of Raffles' party surveyed the island and proceeded to request the presence of the sultan, or whoever at the time had supreme nominal power, to sign a formal treaty, while Major Farquhar was ordered to do the same in Rhio. A few days later, the formal treaty signed by a man who claimed to be the ""lawful sovereign of the whole of territories extending from  Lingga  and  Johor  to  Mount Muar "". This man was  Hussein Shah of Johor , who, although having had no previous contact with the British, had certainly heard of the might of the  British navy  and was in no position to argue against the terms. However, Raffles was able to charm the man and to reassure him that the Dutch posed no threat in the area. Hussein Shah had been the crown Prince of Johor, but while he was away in Pahang to get married, his father died and his younger brother was made sultan, supported by some of the court officials and the Dutch. To circumvent the situation of having to negotiate with a sultan influenced by the Dutch, Raffles decided to recognise, on behalf of the British Crown, Hussien Shah as being the rightful ruler of Johor. Farquhar's attempt to establish a more favorable treaty in Rhio was met with greater challenge, as the Dutch were present and made for a rather awkward position. The Dutch were alarmed and sent a small contingent to the island. Despite a covert offer of subterfuge against the Dutch offered by the Raja of Rhio, Farquhar returned and an official protest was sent by the Raja to Java regarding the matter.   Raffles declared the foundation of what was to become modern Singapore on 6 February, securing the transfer of control of the island to the East India Company. Much pomp and ceremony was done, and the official treaty was read aloud in languages representing all nations present, as well as the Malay and Chinese inhabitants. Hussien Shah was paid $5000 a year while the local Temenggong received $3000 a year, both massive sums at the time, equivalent to several hundred thousand dollars now [ citation needed ] . Farquhar was officially named the Resident of Singapore as Raffles was named as ""Agent to the Most Noble the Governor-General with the States of Rhio, Lingin and Johor"". Although ownership of the post was to be exclusively British, explicit orders were given to Farquhar to maintain free passage of ships through the  Strait of Singapore  and a small military presence was established alongside the trading post. After issuing orders to Farquhar and the remaining Europeans, Raffles left the next day, 7 February 1819.     [ edit ]   Achin, and the early conflict/crisis with the Dutch   Raffles also planned to start a British presence in  Achin , at the northern tip of Sumatra. As soon as he left, the Raja of Rhio sent letters to the Dutch, claiming innocence and a British encroachment. The Dutch in Malacca acted at once, and ordered that no Malays could go to Singapore. Raffles' bold claim of Singapore created a curious geographic situation where although Penang was clearly closer distance-wise to Singapore, Raffles, in his capacity as the Governor-General of Bencoolen, was in control. This undoubtedly irked the authorities in Penang to the point where they refused to send any sepoys to Singapore to complete the garrison. Official Dutch complaints came before the end of the month, and Raffles attempted to appease the situation by instructing Farquhar to not interfere with the politics of surrounding islands. Despite numerous threats and serious considerations by the Dutch Governor-General in Java, the Dutch did not take any military action.   The muddled political situation in Johore and Rhio also created a certain uneasiness and instability for the two nations. Tengku Long  was claimed to be a  pretender  to the throne, and since the  succession  laws in the Malay sultanates were not as clear cut as, for example, the  Salic  laws of Europe, the treaties signed between native rulers and the European powers always seemed to be on the verge of being invalidated, especially if a sultan is deposed by one of his siblings or other pretenders.   Nevertheless, amidst the uncertainty and intrigue, Raffles landed in Achin on 14 March 1819, with the begrudging help of Penang. Once again, it seems that multiple people were in power, but none wanted to formally deal with the British. The hostile atmosphere created allowed for Raffles to cancel the only meeting he was able to arrange, with  Panglima Polim , a powerful divisional chief, fearing treachery. As the influential merchant  John Palmer , Raffles, and fellow commissioner John Monckton Coombs of Penang sat offshore, waiting for a response, Calcutta debated whether to reinforce Singapore or not. Evacuation plans were made, but the Dutch never acted and finally Lord Hastings prompted Colonel Bannerman, the Governor of Penang, to send funds to reinforce Singapore.   Raffles finally was able to convince his fellow commissioners to sign a treaty with Jauhar al-Alam Shah, the ruler of Achin, which placed a British resident as well as the exclusivity of trade. By the time Raffles returned to Singapore, on 31 May, much of the immediate crisis that the establishment of the colony had caused in both Penang and Calcutta had passed. By then, the initial five-hundred villagers had grown to become five-thousand merchants, soldiers, and administrators on the island. Raffles was determined to both destroy the Dutch monopoly in the area, and create a gateway to the trade with China and Japan, the latter of which he attempted and failed to reach while governing Java.     [ edit ]   The first year of Singapore   While in Singapore, Raffles established schools and churches in the native languages. He allowed  missionaries  and local businesses to flourish. Certain colonial aspects remained: a European town was quickly built to  segregate  the population, separated by a river; carriage roads were built and cantonments constructed for the soldiers. Otherwise, however, no duties were imposed and confident that Farquhar would follow his instructions well, he sailed for Bencoolen once again on 28 June.     [ edit ]   Bencoolen, once again   Raffles was still the Governor-General of  Bencoolen  and having returned to it after the settling of Singapore, Raffles started more reforms that were, by now, almost trademarks of his reign upon colonies. Forced labor was abolished when he first arrived, and he declared Bencoolen a  free port  as well. Currency was regulated and as he had an excess of out-of-work  civil servants , formed committees to advise him in the running of the colony. However, Bencoolen was not as self-sufficient as Singapore. The area was poor and disease-ridden, and the first reports from the committees reflected very poorly upon the condition of the colony. Unlike the  salutary neglect  Raffles granted upon Singapore, he slowed the European-inspired reforms and emphasized on the cultivation of whatever land that was available. Native authorities were given power in their respective districts and were answerable only to the Governor-General. The slave-debtor system was brought in in exchange instead of the old slavery system that Raffles abolished in Java, Borneo, and initially in Bencoolen. Slave-debtors were registered, and educational reforms started to focus on the children instead of the entire population. Raffles was looking into a long-term plan for a slow reform of Bencoolen.   Unlike many other European colonizers, Raffles did not impose upon the colonized the language, culture, or other aspects of the colonizer. In addition to preserving the  artifacts ,  fauna , and  flora  of his colonies, he also allowed  religious freedom  in his colonies, especially important as the  Malay states  were largely  Muslim . However,  Christian  schools were started by missionaries in all of his colonies.     [ edit ]   Consolidation of the Eastern Isles   The death of Colonel Bannerman of Penang in October 1819 brought upon a new opportunity for Raffles to expand his power to also include the other minor British factories and outposts from Sumatra to  Cochin China . He sailed to Calcutta and as Lord Hastings sought to consolidate all of the small British possessions in the  East Indies . During his sojourn, he had the opportunity to argue for free trade and the protection of the private enterprise. Education and the retention of small British outposts were also discussed.   The Dutch claim on the Sultanate of Johore and hence, Rhio, and the diplomatic exchanges between Baron  Godert van der Capellen  and Calcutta continued throughout this time. The legitimacy of the British treaties were also questioned once again, but finally, as Singapore grew at an exponential rate, the Dutch gave up their claim on the island, allowing the colony to continue as a British possession. However, the pressures put upon Calcutta ensured that no single governor of all British possessions in the Strait or on Sumatra was appointed, and Raffles, whose health was slowly ailing, returned to Bencoolen.     [ edit ]   Administration of Bencoolen, 1820 - 1822   Raffles returned to Bencoolen in ill-health, but as his health improved, he continued on his quest to learn about the island which he now called home. He studied the  Batak   cannibals  of  Tappanooly  and their rituals and laws regarding the consumption of human flesh, writing in detail about the transgressions that warranted such an act as well as their methods. He also noted the rise of the Sikh religion in certain parts of Sumatra.   By early 1820, Tunku Long had firmly established himself as the Sultan of Johore to the British, but the political situation in the area remains a befuddled mess, with the old sultan dying and many new ones attempting to gain either the crown or regency. As Farquhar was involving himself poorly in local politics, Raffles appointed Travers as the Resident of Singapore, replacing Farquhar. Upon his arrival, Travers found the colony a delightful smrgsbord of different races and cultures, numbering over six thousand, and the Singapore trade was slowly overtaking the Java trade.   As in Java, Raffles collected samples of local species of plants and animals, as well as described them in his journals. He also described other local tribes and their customs, especially their  religions  and laws. He brought the island of  Nias  under British rule as well, noting its more civilized state and production of rice.   Yet, the production of food remained somewhat of a problem in Bencoolen. Raffles paid special attention to the agricultural methods of the  Chinese , and wrote an introduction to the only issue of  Proceedings of the Agricultural Society , in order to remedy this. His employer, the  East India Company , however, had no other concerns outside of profit, and even as Raffles lived like a country gentleman and ran his colony as an estate, his expenditures in natural preservation was frowned upon. His removal was discussed in both Calcutta and London, while Castlereagh continued negotiations with the Dutch regarding the ongoing diplomatic conflicts.   Luckily, the Singapore issue had its supporters in the House, so as negotiations went on in Europe, Raffles remained largely idle in Bencoolen. The only major issue, outside of the politics of local sultans, involved the replacement of Farquhar, who decided that he had no intention of leaving his post voluntarily, causing a moment of tension between him and Travers. Raffles' request for Travers to deliver dispatches to India nullified the issue late in the year, and Farquhar remained in charge in Singapore, with its survival still in doubt for many in both India and London, who believed that it would either be handed over to the Dutch or taken violently by the Dutch at the end of Castlereagh's negotiations.   Farquhar, however, stirred up more trouble, conflicting especially with local English merchants over trivial matters of self-importance and overreaction over small infractions of white traders, for some of which he was reprimanded by Calcutta officially.  Public works , commissioned by Raffles but undertaken by Farquhar, was becoming overwhelmingly expensive.   Personal tragedies also started for Raffles. His eldest son, Leopold, died during an  epidemic  on 4 July 1821. The oldest daughter, Charlotte, was also sick with dysentery by the end of the year, but it would be his youngest son, Stamford Marsden, who would perish first with the disease, 3 January 1822, with Charlotte to follow ten days later. For the good part of four month the couple remained devastated. The year would be eventful with the suicide of Castlereagh and the appointment of  Lord Amherst  as the  Governor-General of India , replacing Hastings. As Raffles grew restless and depressed, he decided to visit Singapore, before heading home to England. Accompanying him would be his wife Sophia and only surviving child, Ella.     [ edit ]   Singapore - 1822 - 1823          The  Plan of the Town of Singapore , or more commonly known as the  Jackson Plan       Raffles was pleased at the fact that Singapore had grown exponentially in such short years. The colony was a bustling hub of trade and activity. However, Farquhar's development work was deemed unsatisfactory and Raffles drew up what is now known as the  Jackson Plan , and replanned the city according to recommendations of a committee headed by the colony's engineer, Phillip Jackson.   It was still a segregated plan, giving the best land to the Europeans, yet it was considered remarkably scientific for the time. It was also during the replanning and reconstruction of the town that allowed Farquhar to clash dramatically with Raffles, who now considered Farquhar unfit for the position of Resident. Raffles took direct control with a heavy hand. In 1823, Raffles instituted a code of settlement for the populace, and soon followed with laws regarding the freedom of trade. He also quickly instituted a registration system for all land, regardless of ownership, and the repossession of the land by the government if land remained unregistered. This act greatly asserted the power of the British government as it covered land previously owned by the Sultan as well. A police force and magistrate was then set up, under British principles. In a very short period of time, Raffles had turned a semi-anarchic trading post into a proper city with at least a semblance of order.   Repeated efforts by Raffles for Calcutta to send a replacement for Farquhar remained unanswered. As Raffles started to hint at his impending retirement, he made Johore a British protectorate, causing a protest from van der Capellen. Finally, Calcutta appointed  John Crawfurd , who had followed Raffles for over twenty years, as the Resident of Singapore. Captain  William Gordon MacKenzie  took over Bencoolen from Raffles. It's March 1823, and coincidentally, on the same day he was replaced, he received an official reprimand from London for the takeover of Nias.   With politics against him, Raffles finally turned back to the natural sciences. He gave a speech regarding the opening of a Malay college in Singapore that heavily involved his observations of his years in Southeast Asia and the importance of both the local and the European languages. Raffles personally gave $2000 towards the effort, as the East India Company gave $4000.   In 1823, Raffles drafted the first constitution for Singapore, which followed a fairly moralistic stance, outlawing gaming and slavery. A specific regulation in the constitution called for the multiethnic population of Singapore to remain as is, and there shall be no crimes based on being a race. He then went to work drafting laws, defining on exactly ""what"" constituted a crime. Finally, on 9 July 1823, feeling that his work on establishing Singapore was finished, he boarded a ship for home, but not before a stop in Batavia to visit his old home and adversary, van der Capellen. A final stop in Bencoolen ensued, and finally, a voyage home, interrupted by a harrowing experience when one of the ships caught fire off Rat Island, which claimed many of his drawings and papers.   The  Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824  finally settled the score in the East Indies. The British gained dominance in the north, while the entirety of Sumatra became Dutch. The Malay Peninsula and the  Indian subcontinent  were both free of Dutch interference.   Raffles finally returned to England 22 August 1824, over a year after he left Singapore. His longest tenure in Singapore was only eight months, but he was considered the founder of Singapore nevertheless.     [ edit ]   England and death   Upon arrival in England in poor health, both Sir Stamford and Lady Raffles convalesced in  Cheltenham  until September, after which he entertained distinguished guests in both London and his home. He also made considerations to run for parliament during this time, but this ambition was never realized. He moved to London at the end of November, just in time to have a war of words in front of the Court of Directors of the EIC regarding Singapore with Farquhar, who had also arrived in London. Despite several severe charges put upon Raffles, Farquhar was ultimately unable to discredit him and was denied a chance to be restored to Singapore, but he was given a military promotion instead.   With the Singapore matter settled, Raffles turned to his other great hobby - botany. Raffles was a founder (in 1825) and first president (elected April 1826) of the  Zoological Society of London  and the  London Zoo . Meanwhile, he was not only not granted a  pension , but was called to pay over twenty-two thousand pounds sterling for the losses incurred during his administrations. Raffles replied and clarified his actions, and moved to his country estate, Highwood, but before the issue was resolved, he was already much too ill.   He died in London, England, a day before his forty-fifth birthday, on 5 July 1826, of  apoplexy . His estate amounted around ten thousand pounds sterling, which was paid to the Company to cover his outstanding debt. Because of his  anti-slavery  stance, he was refused burial inside his local parish church (St. Mary's,  Hendon ) by the  vicar , whose family had made its money in the slave trade. A brass tablet was finally placed in 1887 and the actual whereabouts of his body was not known until 1914 when it was found in a vault. When the church was extended in the 1920s his tomb was incorporated into the body of the building.     [ edit ]   Coat of Arms   The Blazon of his Armorial Ensigns reads:     ""Or a double headed Eagle displayed Gules charged on the breast with an Eastern Crown on the first, on a Chief Vert pendent from a chain two oval Medallions in Pale the one bearing Arabic characters and the other a dagger in fess the blade wavy the point towards the dexter in relief Or, the said medallions and chain being a representation of a personal decoration called the Order of the Golden Sword conferred upon by him by the Chief or King of Atcheen in Sumatra as a mark of the high regard of the said King and in testimony of the good understanding which had been happily established between that Prince and the British Government; and for a crest out of an Eastern Crown Or a Gryphon's Head Purpure gorged with a collar gemel Gold.""     The  Coat of Arms  has been adapted into the school arms of  Raffles Institution  and  Raffles Junior College . It can also be found as part of a  stained-glass window  in  St. Andrew's Cathedral, Singapore . The motto of the Raffles family is  in cruce triumphans , meaning  triumphing in the cross .

Served in the Punjab but left     in 1854 to explore Somaliland.  Discovered Lake Tanganyika with     Burton, and Lake Victoria independently.  Was, with Grant,    the first European to cross equatorial africa.  Died 1864.John Hanning Speke was a man of thirty-six, when his Nile Journal    appeared.  He had entered the army in 1844, and completed ten    years of service in India, serving through the Punjab Campaign.     Already he had conceived the idea of exploring Africa, before his    ten years were up, and on their conclusion he was appointed a    member of the expedition preparing to start under Sir Richard    (then Lieutenant Burton) for the Somali country.  He was wounded    by the Somalis, and returned to England on sick leave; the    Crimean War then breaking out, be served through it, and later,    December 1856, joined another expedition under Burton.  Then it    was that the possibility of the source of the Nile being traced    to one of the inland lakes seems to have struck him.    Burton's illness prevented him accompanying Speke on the latter's     visit to the lake now known as Victoria Nyanza.  During this     expedition Speke reached the most southerly point of the lake,     and gave it its present name.  Speke arrived back in England in     the spring of 1859, Burton being left behind on account of his     illness.  The relations between the two had become strained, and     this was accentuated by Speke's hast to publish the account of     his explorations.  He was given the command of another expedition     which left England in April 1860, in company with Captain James     Augustus Grant, to ascertain still further if the Victoria Nyanza     were indeed the source of the Nile.  He met Sir Samuel Baker, to     whom he gave valuable assistance, and who with his clue     discovered the third lake, Albert Nyanza.    Speke telegraphed early in 1863, that the Nile source was traced.      Returning to England that year he met with an ovation, and     addressed a special meeting of the Geographical Society, and the     same year, 1863, published his ""Journal of the Discovery of the     Nile.""  Opposed in his statements by Burton and M'Queen (The Nile     Basin, 1864""), it was arranged that he and Burton should meet for     a debate, when on the very day fixed, Speke accidentally shot     himself while out partridge-shooting.    Sir R. Murchison, addressing the Royal Geographical Society that     year, speaks of Speke's discovery of the source of the Nile as     solving the ""problem of all ages.""    Only two books were published by Speke--the ""Journal"" of 1863,     which follows, and its sequel--""What Led to the Discovery of the     Source of the Nile,"" which appeared in the year of his death,     1864.

His father was involved in the  Caribbean   slave trade , and died suddenly when Raffles was fourteen, leaving his family in debt. Raffles then started working as a  clerk  in London for the  British East India Company , the trading company that shaped many of Britain's overseas conquests. In 1805 he was sent to what is now  Penang  in the country of  Malaysia , then called the Prince of Wales Island, starting his long association with  Southeast Asia . He started with a post under the Honourable  Philip Dundas , the Governor of Penang.   As he was gazetted assistant secretary to the new Governor of Penang in 1805, he married Olivia Mariamne Devenish, a widow who was formerly married to Jacob Cassivelaun Fancourt, an assistant surgeon in Madras who had died in 1800. It was also at this time that he made acquaintance with  Thomas Otho Travers , who would accompany him for the next twenty years.     [ edit ]   Java   His knowledge of the  Malay language  as well as his wit and ability, gained him favour with  Lord Minto ,  governor of India , and he was sent to  Malacca . Then, in 1811, after the invasion and annexation of the  Kingdom of Holland  by France during Napoleon's war, Raffles had no choice but to leave the country. He mounted a military expedition against the Dutch and French in  Java ,  Indonesia . The war was swiftly conducted by  Admiral Robert Stopford , General Wetherhall, and Colonel Gillespie, who led a well-organized army against an army of mostly French conscripts with little proper leadership. The previous Dutch governor,  Herman Willem Daendels , had built a well-defended fortification at  Meester Cornelis  (now  Jatinegara ), and at the time, the governor,  Jan Willem Janssens  (who, coincidentally, surrendered to the British at the  Cape Colony ), mounted a brave but ultimately futile defense at the fortress. The British, led by Colonel Gillespie, stormed the fort and captured it within three hours. Janssens attempted to escape inland but was captured. The British invasion of Java took a total of forty-five days, during which Raffles was appointed the Lieutenant-Governor by Lord Minto before hostilities formally ceased. He took his residence at  Buitenzorg  and despite having a small subset of Britons as his senior staff, he kept many of the Dutch civil servants in the governmental structure. He also negotiated peace and mounted some small military expeditions against local princes to subjugate them to British rule, as well as a takeover of  Bangka Island  to set up a permanent British presence in the area in the case of the return of Java to Dutch rule after the end of the  War of the Sixth Coalition  in Europe.   During his governorship, Raffles introduced partial  self-government , stopped the slave trade, became an early opponent of the  Opium trade  by placing strict limitations upon its importation, much to the dismay of Calcutta, led an expedition to rediscover and restore  Borobudur  and other ancient monuments, and replaced the Dutch forced agriculture system with a  land tenure  system of land management, probably influenced by the earlier writings of Dirk van Hogendorp (1761-1822). He also changed the Dutch colonies to the British system of driving on the left, [ citation needed ] which is why Indonesia drives on the left today.   Under the harsh conditions of the island, Olivia died on 26 November 1814, an event that devastated Raffles. In 1815, he left again for England after the island of Java was returned to control of the Netherlands following the  Napoleonic Wars , under the terms of the  Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814 , but not before he was officially replaced by  John Fendall  on account of the poor financial performance of the colony during his administration, as deemed by the successors of Lord Minto in Calcutta. He sailed to England in early 1816 to clear his name, and en route, visited  Napoleon , who was in exile at  St. Helena , but found him unpleasant and unimpressive.     [ edit ]   Interlude in England          Raffles in 1817       In 1817, Raffles wrote and published a book entitled  History of Java , describing the history of the island from ancient times. In 1817 he was knighted by the prince regent, whose daughter,  Princess Charlotte , was particularly close to him. At the publication of the book, he also stopped using the name ""Thomas"", preferring to use his middle name, ""Stamford"", possibly to avoid confusion amongst his associates with  Sir Thomas Sevestre  or his cousin who bore the same name. On 22 February, he married his second wife, Sophia Hull.   He was appointed as the Governor-General of Bencoolen (now  Bengkulu ) on 15 October 1817, and set sail to take the post with his new wife.     [ edit ]   Bencoolen (Bengkulu) and Malaya   Raffles arrived in Bencoolen ( Bengkulu ) on 19 March 1818. Despite the prestige connected with the title, Bencoolen was a colonial backwater whose only real export was pepper and only the murder of a previous Resident, Thomas Parr, gained it any attention back home in Britain. Raffles found the place wretched, and set about reforms immediately, mostly similar to what he had done in Java - abolishing slavery and limiting cockfighting and such games. To replace the slaves, he used a contingent of  convicts , already sent to him from India. It is at this point when he realized the importance of a British presence that both challenged the Dutch hegemony in the area and could remain consistently profitable, unlike Bencoolen or Batavia. However, the strategic importance of poorly-maintained but well-positioned  British possessions  such as Penang or Bencoolen made it impossible for the British to abandon such unprofitable colonies in such close proximity to the Dutch in Java. The competition in the area, between Raffles and the aggressive Dutch  de jure  Governor, Elout, certainly led at least in part to the later  Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 . Raffles looked into alternatives in the area - namely Bangka, which had been ceded to the Dutch after its conquest by the British during its occupation of Java.   Bintan  was also under consideration. Despite the fact that  Warren Hastings  overlooked the island before settling upon Penang in 1786, the  Riau Archipelago  was an attractive choice just to the south of the  Malay Peninsula , for its proximity to  Malacca . In his correspondences with Calcutta, Raffles also emphasized the need to establish a certain amount of influence with the native chiefs, which had greatly waned since the return of the Dutch. Raffles sent Thomas Travers as an ambassador to the Dutch, to possibly negotiate an expansion of British economic interests. When this failed, and when Raffles' own expeditions into his new dominion found only treacherous terrain and few exportable goods, his desire to establish a better British presence was cemented.   However, the Anglo-Dutch Convention of 1814 was not completely clear, especially on the issue of certain possessions such as  Padang . The Convention of 1814 only returned Dutch territory that was held before 1803, which did not include Padang. Raffles asserted the British claim personally, leading a small expedition to the  Sultanate of Minangkabau . Yet, as Raffles confirmed with the sultan regarding the absolute British influence of the area, he realized that the local rulers had only limited power over the well-cultivated and civilized country, and the treaty was largely symbolic and had little actual force.     [ edit ]   The founding of Singapore          Statue of Sir Stamford Raffles in Singapore, based on the original by  Thomas Woolner       Meanwhile, Major  William Farquhar , the  British Resident  of Malacca, had been attempting to negotiate  commercial treaties  with the local chiefs of the Riau Archipelago, especially with the heads of the  Sultanate of Johore . Due to the death and subsequent turmoil of the sultanate at the time of Farquhar's arrival, Farquhar was compelled to sign the treaty not with the official head of the sultanate, but rather, the Raja Muda (Regent or Crown Prince) of Riau. Noting it as a success and reporting it as such back to Raffles, Raffles sailed to Malacca in late 1818 to personally secure a British presence in the Riau area, especially  Singapura , which was favored by him both through the readings of Malayan histories and by Farquhar's explorations.   Despite  Lord Hastings'  less-than-stellar opinion of Raffles before (which had necessitated his trip to England to clear his name at the end of his tenure as Governor-General of Java), the now well-connected and successful Raffles was able to secure the permission to set up a settlement where in  Malaysian history  the name  Lion City  was applied and was in a strategically advantageous position. However, he was not to provoke the Dutch, and his actions were officially disavowed. Despite the best efforts in London by authorities such as the  Viscount Castlereagh  to quell Dutch fears and the continuing efforts to reach an agreement between the nations that eventually became the  Anglo-Dutch Treaty  of London of 1824, as well as to send instructions to Raffles to undertake far less intrusive actions, the distance between the Far East and Europe had meant that the orders had no chance of reaching Raffles in time for his venture to begin.     [ edit ]   Singapore     [ edit ]   Establishment   After a brief survey of the  Karimun Islands , on 29 January 1819, he established a post at the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula. It was established that there was no Dutch presence on the island of Singapore. Johore also no longer had any control of the area, so contact was made with the local Temenggong, or Raja. The contacts were friendly and Raffles, knowledgeable about the muddled political situation, took advantage to provide a rudimentary treaty between the nominal chiefs of the area that called for the exclusivity of trade and the English protection of the area. Members of Raffles' party surveyed the island and proceeded to request the presence of the sultan, or whoever at the time had supreme nominal power, to sign a formal treaty, while Major Farquhar was ordered to do the same in Rhio. A few days later, the formal treaty signed by a man who claimed to be the ""lawful sovereign of the whole of territories extending from  Lingga  and  Johor  to  Mount Muar "". This man was  Hussein Shah of Johor , who, although having had no previous contact with the British, had certainly heard of the might of the  British navy  and was in no position to argue against the terms. However, Raffles was able to charm the man and to reassure him that the Dutch posed no threat in the area. Hussein Shah had been the crown Prince of Johor, but while he was away in Pahang to get married, his father died and his younger brother was made sultan, supported by some of the court officials and the Dutch. To circumvent the situation of having to negotiate with a sultan influenced by the Dutch, Raffles decided to recognise, on behalf of the British Crown, Hussien Shah as being the rightful ruler of Johor. Farquhar's attempt to establish a more favorable treaty in Rhio was met with greater challenge, as the Dutch were present and made for a rather awkward position. The Dutch were alarmed and sent a small contingent to the island. Despite a covert offer of subterfuge against the Dutch offered by the Raja of Rhio, Farquhar returned and an official protest was sent by the Raja to Java regarding the matter.   Raffles declared the foundation of what was to become modern Singapore on 6 February, securing the transfer of control of the island to the East India Company. Much pomp and ceremony was done, and the official treaty was read aloud in languages representing all nations present, as well as the Malay and Chinese inhabitants. Hussien Shah was paid $5000 a year while the local Temenggong received $3000 a year, both massive sums at the time, equivalent to several hundred thousand dollars now [ citation needed ] . Farquhar was officially named the Resident of Singapore as Raffles was named as ""Agent to the Most Noble the Governor-General with the States of Rhio, Lingin and Johor"". Although ownership of the post was to be exclusively British, explicit orders were given to Farquhar to maintain free passage of ships through the  Strait of Singapore  and a small military presence was established alongside the trading post. After issuing orders to Farquhar and the remaining Europeans, Raffles left the next day, 7 February 1819.     [ edit ]   Achin, and the early conflict/crisis with the Dutch   Raffles also planned to start a British presence in  Achin , at the northern tip of Sumatra. As soon as he left, the Raja of Rhio sent letters to the Dutch, claiming innocence and a British encroachment. The Dutch in Malacca acted at once, and ordered that no Malays could go to Singapore. Raffles' bold claim of Singapore created a curious geographic situation where although Penang was clearly closer distance-wise to Singapore, Raffles, in his capacity as the Governor-General of Bencoolen, was in control. This undoubtedly irked the authorities in Penang to the point where they refused to send any sepoys to Singapore to complete the garrison. Official Dutch complaints came before the end of the month, and Raffles attempted to appease the situation by instructing Farquhar to not interfere with the politics of surrounding islands. Despite numerous threats and serious considerations by the Dutch Governor-General in Java, the Dutch did not take any military action.   The muddled political situation in Johore and Rhio also created a certain uneasiness and instability for the two nations. Tengku Long  was claimed to be a  pretender  to the throne, and since the  succession  laws in the Malay sultanates were not as clear cut as, for example, the  Salic  laws of Europe, the treaties signed between native rulers and the European powers always seemed to be on the verge of being invalidated, especially if a sultan is deposed by one of his siblings or other pretenders.   Nevertheless, amidst the uncertainty and intrigue, Raffles landed in Achin on 14 March 1819, with the begrudging help of Penang. Once again, it seems that multiple people were in power, but none wanted to formally deal with the British. The hostile atmosphere created allowed for Raffles to cancel the only meeting he was able to arrange, with  Panglima Polim , a powerful divisional chief, fearing treachery. As the influential merchant  John Palmer , Raffles, and fellow commissioner John Monckton Coombs of Penang sat offshore, waiting for a response, Calcutta debated whether to reinforce Singapore or not. Evacuation plans were made, but the Dutch never acted and finally Lord Hastings prompted Colonel Bannerman, the Governor of Penang, to send funds to reinforce Singapore.   Raffles finally was able to convince his fellow commissioners to sign a treaty with Jauhar al-Alam Shah, the ruler of Achin, which placed a British resident as well as the exclusivity of trade. By the time Raffles returned to Singapore, on 31 May, much of the immediate crisis that the establishment of the colony had caused in both Penang and Calcutta had passed. By then, the initial five-hundred villagers had grown to become five-thousand merchants, soldiers, and administrators on the island. Raffles was determined to both destroy the Dutch monopoly in the area, and create a gateway to the trade with China and Japan, the latter of which he attempted and failed to reach while governing Java.     [ edit ]   The first year of Singapore   While in Singapore, Raffles established schools and churches in the native languages. He allowed  missionaries  and local businesses to flourish. Certain colonial aspects remained: a European town was quickly built to  segregate  the population, separated by a river; carriage roads were built and cantonments constructed for the soldiers. Otherwise, however, no duties were imposed and confident that Farquhar would follow his instructions well, he sailed for Bencoolen once again on 28 June.     [ edit ]   Bencoolen, once again   Raffles was still the Governor-General of  Bencoolen  and having returned to it after the settling of Singapore, Raffles started more reforms that were, by now, almost trademarks of his reign upon colonies. Forced labor was abolished when he first arrived, and he declared Bencoolen a  free port  as well. Currency was regulated and as he had an excess of out-of-work  civil servants , formed committees to advise him in the running of the colony. However, Bencoolen was not as self-sufficient as Singapore. The area was poor and disease-ridden, and the first reports from the committees reflected very poorly upon the condition of the colony. Unlike the  salutary neglect  Raffles granted upon Singapore, he slowed the European-inspired reforms and emphasized on the cultivation of whatever land that was available. Native authorities were given power in their respective districts and were answerable only to the Governor-General. The slave-debtor system was brought in in exchange instead of the old slavery system that Raffles abolished in Java, Borneo, and initially in Bencoolen. Slave-debtors were registered, and educational reforms started to focus on the children instead of the entire population. Raffles was looking into a long-term plan for a slow reform of Bencoolen.   Unlike many other European colonizers, Raffles did not impose upon the colonized the language, culture, or other aspects of the colonizer. In addition to preserving the  artifacts ,  fauna , and  flora  of his colonies, he also allowed  religious freedom  in his colonies, especially important as the  Malay states  were largely  Muslim . However,  Christian  schools, especially schools for the very young and impressionable, were started by missionaries in all of his colonies.     [ edit ]   Consolidation of the Eastern Isles   The death of Colonel Bannerman of Penang in October 1819 brought upon a new opportunity for Raffles to expand his power to also include the other minor British factories and outposts from Sumatra to  Cochin China . He sailed to Calcutta and as Lord Hastings sought to consolidate all of the small British possessions in the  East Indies . During his sojourn, he had the opportunity to argue for free trade and the protection of the private enterprise. Education and the retention of small British outposts were also discussed.   The Dutch claim on the Sultanate of Johore and hence, Rhio, and the diplomatic exchanges between Baron  Godert van der Capellen  and Calcutta continued throughout this time. The legitimacy of the British treaties were also questioned once again, but finally, as Singapore grew at an exponential rate, the Dutch gave up their claim on the island, allowing the colony to continue as a British possession. However, the pressures put upon Calcutta ensured that no single governor of all British possessions in the Strait or on Sumatra was appointed, and Raffles, whose health was slowly ailing, returned to Bencoolen.     [ edit ]   Administration of Bencoolen, 1820 - 1822   Raffles returned to Bencoolen in ill-health, but as his health improved, he continued on his quest to learn about the island which he now called home. He studied the  Batak   cannibals  of  Tappanooly  and their rituals and laws regarding the consumption of human flesh, writing in detail about the transgressions that warranted such an act as well as their methods. He also noted the rise of the Sikh religion in certain parts of Sumatra.   By early 1820, Tunku Long had firmly established himself as the Sultan of Johore to the British, but the political situation in the area remains a befuddled mess, with the old sultan dying and many new ones attempting to gain either the crown or regency. As Farquhar was involving himself poorly in local politics, Raffles appointed Travers as the Resident of Singapore, replacing Farquhar. Upon his arrival, Travers found the colony a delightful smrgsbord of different races and cultures, numbering over six thousand, and the Singapore trade was slowly overtaking the Java trade.   As in Java, Raffles collected samples of local species of plants and animals, as well as described them in his journals. He also described other local tribes and their customs, especially their  religions  and laws. He brought the island of  Nias  under British rule as well, noting its more civilized state and production of rice.   Yet, the production of food remained somewhat of a problem in Bencoolen. Raffles paid special attention to the agricultural methods of the  Chinese , and wrote an introduction to the only issue of  Proceedings of the Agricultural Society , in order to remedy this. His employer, the  East India Company , however, had no other concerns outside of profit, and even as Raffles lived like a country gentleman and ran his colony as an estate, his expenditures in natural preservation was frowned upon. His removal was discussed in both Calcutta and London, while Castlereagh continued negotiations with the Dutch regarding the ongoing diplomatic conflicts.   Luckily, the Singapore issue had its supporters in the House, so as negotiations went on in Europe, Raffles remained largely idle in Bencoolen. The only major issue, outside of the politics of local sultans, involved the replacement of Farquhar, who decided that he had no intention of leaving his post voluntarily, causing a moment of tension between him and Travers. Raffles' request for Travers to deliver dispatches to India nullified the issue late in the year, and Farquhar remained in charge in Singapore, with its survival still in doubt for many in both India and London, who believed that it would either be handed over to the Dutch or taken violently by the Dutch at the end of Castlereagh's negotiations.   Farquhar, however, stirred up more trouble, conflicting especially with local English merchants over trivial matters of self-importance and overreaction over small infractions of white traders, for some of which he was reprimanded by Calcutta officially.  Public works , commissioned by Raffles but undertaken by Farquhar, was becoming overwhelmingly expensive.   Personal tragedies also started for Raffles. His eldest son, Leopold, died during an  epidemic  on 4 July 1821. The oldest daughter, Charlotte, was also sick with dysentery by the end of the year, but it would be his youngest son, Stamford Marsden, who would perish first with the disease, 3 January 1822, with Charlotte to follow ten days later. For the good part of four month the couple remained devastated. The year would be eventful with the suicide of Castlereagh and the appointment of  Lord Amherst  as the  Governor-General of India , replacing Hastings. As Raffles grew restless and depressed, he decided to visit Singapore, before heading home to England. Accompanying him would be his wife Sophia and only surviving child, Ella.     [ edit ]   Singapore - 1822 - 1823          The  Plan of the Town of Singapore , or more commonly known as the  Jackson Plan       Raffles was pleased at the fact that Singapore had grown exponentially in such short years. The colony was a bustling hub of trade and activity. However, Farquhar's development work was deemed unsatisfactory and Raffles drew up what is now known as the  Jackson Plan , and replanned the city according to recommendations of a committee headed by the colony's engineer, Phillip Jackson.   It was still a segregated plan, giving the best land to the Europeans, yet it was considered remarkably scientific for the time. It was also during the replanning and reconstruction of the town that allowed Farquhar to clash dramatically with Raffles, who now considered Farquhar unfit for the position of Resident. Raffles took direct control with a heavy hand. In 1823, Raffles instituted a code of settlement for the populace, and soon followed with laws regarding the freedom of trade. He also quickly instituted a registration system for all land, regardless of ownership, and the repossession of the land by the government if land remained unregistered. This act greatly asserted the power of the British government as it covered land previously owned by the Sultan as well. A police force and magistrate was then set up, under British principles. In a very short period of time, Raffles had turned a semi-anarchic trading post into a proper city with at least a semblance of order.   Repeated efforts by Raffles for Calcutta to send a replacement for Farquhar remained unanswered. As Raffles started to hint at his impending retirement, he made Johore a British protectorate, causing a protest from van der Capellen. Finally, Calcutta appointed  John Crawfurd , who had followed Raffles for over twenty years, as the Resident of Singapore. Captain  William Gordon MacKenzie  took over Bencoolen from Raffles. It's March 1823, and coincidentally, on the same day he was replaced, he received an official reprimand from London for the takeover of Nias.   With politics against him, Raffles finally turned back to the natural sciences. He gave a speech regarding the opening of a Malay college in Singapore that heavily involved his observations of his years in Southeast Asia and the importance of both the local and the European languages. Raffles personally gave $2000 towards the effort, as the East India Company gave $4000.   In 1823, Raffles drafted the first constitution for Singapore, which followed a fairly moralistic stance, outlawing gaming and slavery. A specific regulation in the constitution called for the multiethnic population of Singapore to remain as is, and there shall be no crimes based on being a race. He then went to work drafting laws, defining on exactly ""what"" constituted a crime. Finally, on 9 July 1823, feeling that his work on establishing Singapore was finished, he boarded a ship for home, but not before a stop in Batavia to visit his old home and adversary, van der Capellen. A final stop in Bencoolen ensued, and finally, a voyage home, interrupted by a harrowing experience when one of the ships caught fire off Rat Island, which claimed many of his drawings and papers.   The  Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824  finally settled the score in the East Indies. The British gained dominance in the north, while the entirety of Sumatra became Dutch. The Malay Peninsula and the  Indian subcontinent  were both free of Dutch interference.   Raffles finally returned to England 22 August 1824, over a year after he left Singapore. His longest tenure in Singapore was only eight months, but he was considered the founder of Singapore nevertheless.     [ edit ]   England and death   Upon arrival in England in poor health, both Sir Stamford and Lady Raffles convalesced in  Cheltenham  until September, after which he entertained distinguished guests in both London and his home. He also made considerations to run for parliament during this time, but this ambition was never realized. He moved to London at the end of November, just in time to have a war of words in front of the Court of Directors of the EIC regarding Singapore with Farquhar, who had also arrived in London. Despite several severe charges put upon Raffles, Farquhar was ultimately unable to discredit him and was denied a chance to be restored to Singapore, but he was given a military promotion instead.   With the Singapore matter settled, Raffles turned to his other great hobby - botany. Raffles was a founder (in 1825) and first president (elected April 1826) of the  Zoological Society of London  and the  London Zoo . Meanwhile, he was not only not granted a  pension , but was called to pay over twenty-two thousand pounds sterling for the losses incurred during his administrations. Raffles replied and clarified his actions, and moved to his country estate, Highwood, but before the issue was resolved, he was already much too ill.   He died in London, England, a day before his forty-fifth birthday, on 5 July 1826, of  apoplexy . His estate amounted around ten thousand pounds sterling, which was paid to the Company to cover his outstanding debt. Because of his  anti-slavery  stance, he was refused burial inside his local parish church (St. Mary's,  Hendon ) by the  vicar , whose family had made its money in the slave trade. A brass tablet was finally placed in 1887 and the actual whereabouts of his body was not known until 1914 when it was found in a vault. When the church was extended in the 1920s his tomb was incorporated into the body of the building.     [ edit ]   Coat of Arms   The Blazon of his Armorial Ensigns reads:     ""Or a double headed Eagle displayed Gules charged on the breast with an Eastern Crown on the first, on a Chief Vert pendent from a chain two oval Medallions in Pale the one bearing Arabic characters and the other a dagger in fess the blade wavy the point towards the dexter in relief Or, the said medallions and chain being a representation of a personal decoration called the Order of the Golden Sword conferred upon by him by the Chief or King of Atcheen in Sumatra as a mark of the high regard of the said King and in testimony of the good understanding which had been happily established between that Prince and the British Government; and for a crest out of an Eastern Crown Or a Gryphon's Head Purpure gorged with a collar gemel Gold.""     The  Coat of Arms  has been adapted into the school arms of  Raffles Institution  and  Raffles Junior College . It can also be found as part of a  stained-glass window  in  St. Andrew's Cathedral, Singapore . The motto of the Raffles family is  in cruce triumphans , meaning  triumphing in the cross .

He was also heavily involved in the conquest of the Indonesian island of  Java  from Dutch and French military forces during the  Napoleonic Wars . He is one of the more famous  Britons  who contributed to the expansion of the  British Empire .

His father was involved in the  Caribbean   slave trade , and died suddenly when Raffles was fourteen, leaving his family in debt. Raffles then started working as a  clerk  in London for the  British East India Company , the trading company that shaped many of Britain's overseas conquests. In 1805 he was sent to what is now  Penang  in the country of  Malaysia , then called the Prince of Wales Island, starting his long association with  Southeast Asia . He started with a post under the Honourable  Philip Dundas , the Governor of Penang.   As he was gazetted assistant secretary to the new Governor of Penang in 1805, he married Olivia Mariamne Devenish, a widow who was formerly married to Jacob Cassivelaun Fancourt, an assistant surgeon in Madras who had died in 1800. It was also at this time that he made acquaintance with  Thomas Otho Travers , who would accompany him for the next twenty years.     [ edit ]   Java   His knowledge of the  Malay language  as well as his wit and ability, gained him favour with  Lord Minto ,  governor of India , and he was sent to  Malacca . Then, in 1811, after the invasion and annexation of the  Kingdom of Holland  by France during Napoleon's war, Raffles had no choice but to leave the country. He mounted a military expedition against the Dutch and French in  Java ,  Indonesia . The war was swiftly conducted by  Admiral Robert Stopford , General Wetherhall, and Colonel Gillespie, who led a well-organized army against an army of mostly French conscripts with little proper leadership. The previous Dutch governor,  Herman Willem Daendels , had built a well-defended fortification at  Meester Cornelis  (now  Jatinegara ), and at the time, the governor,  Jan Willem Janssens  (who, coincidentally, surrendered to the British at the  Cape Colony ), mounted a brave but ultimately futile defense at the fortress. The British, led by Colonel Gillespie, stormed the fort and captured it within three hours. Janssens attempted to escape inland but was captured. The British invasion of Java took a total of forty-five days, during which Raffles was appointed the Lieutenant-Governor by Lord Minto before hostilities formally ceased. He took his residence at  Buitenzorg  and despite having a small subset of Britons as his senior staff, he kept many of the Dutch civil servants in the governmental structure. He also negotiated peace and mounted some small military expeditions against local princes to subjugate them to British rule, as well as a takeover of  Bangka Island  to set up a permanent British presence in the area in the case of the return of Java to Dutch rule after the end of the  War of the Sixth Coalition  in Europe.   During his governorship, Raffles introduced partial  self-government , stopped the slave trade, became an early opponent of the  Opium trade  by placing strict limitations upon its importation, much to the dismay of Calcutta, led an expedition to rediscover and restore  Borobudur  and other ancient monuments, and replaced the Dutch forced agriculture system with a  land tenure  system of land management, probably influenced by the earlier writings of Dirk van Hogendorp (1761-1822). He also changed the Dutch colonies to the British system of driving on the left, [ citation needed ] which is why Indonesia drives on the left today.   Under the harsh conditions of the island, Olivia died on 26 November 1814, an event that devastated Raffles. In 1815, he left again for England after the island of Java was returned to control of the Netherlands following the  Napoleonic Wars , under the terms of the  Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814 , but not before he was officially replaced by  John Fendall  on account of the poor financial performance of the colony during his administration, as deemed by the successors of Lord Minto in Calcutta. He sailed to England in early 1816 to clear his name, and en route, visited  Napoleon , who was in exile at  St. Helena , but found him unpleasant and unimpressive.     [ edit ]   Interlude in England          Raffles in 1817       In 1817, Raffles wrote and published a book entitled  History of Java , describing the history of the island from ancient times. In 1817 he was knighted by the prince regent, whose daughter,  Princess Charlotte , was particularly close to him. At the publication of the book, he also stopped using the name ""Thomas"", preferring to use his middle name, ""Stamford"", possibly to avoid confusion amongst his associates with  Sir Thomas Sevestre  or his cousin who bore the same name. On 22 February, he married his second wife, Sophia Hull.   He was appointed as the Governor-General of Bencoolen (now  Bengkulu ) on 15 October 1817, and set sail to take the post with his new wife.     [ edit ]   Bencoolen (Bengkulu) and Malaya   Raffles arrived in Bencoolen ( Bengkulu ) on 19 March 1818. Despite the prestige connected with the title, Bencoolen was a colonial backwater whose only real export was pepper and only the murder of a previous Resident, Thomas Parr, gained it any attention back home in Britain. Raffles found the place wretched, and set about reforms immediately, mostly similar to what he had done in Java - abolishing slavery and limiting cockfighting and such games. To replace the slaves, he used a contingent of  convicts , already sent to him from India. It is at this point when he realized the importance of a British presence that both challenged the Dutch hegemony in the area and could remain consistently profitable, unlike Bencoolen or Batavia. However, the strategic importance of poorly-maintained but well-positioned  British possessions  such as Penang or Bencoolen made it impossible for the British to abandon such unprofitable colonies in such close proximity to the Dutch in Java. The competition in the area, between Raffles and the aggressive Dutch  de jure  Governor, Elout, certainly led at least in part to the later  Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 . Raffles looked into alternatives in the area - namely Bangka, which had been ceded to the Dutch after its conquest by the British during its occupation of Java.   Bintan  was also under consideration. Despite the fact that  Warren Hastings  overlooked the island before settling upon Penang in 1786, the  Riau Archipelago  was an attractive choice just to the south of the  Malay Peninsula , for its proximity to  Malacca . In his correspondences with Calcutta, Raffles also emphasized the need to establish a certain amount of influence with the native chiefs, which had greatly waned since the return of the Dutch. Raffles sent Thomas Travers as an ambassador to the Dutch, to possibly negotiate an expansion of British economic interests. When this failed, and when Raffles' own expeditions into his new dominion found only treacherous terrain and few exportable goods, his desire to establish a better British presence was cemented.   However, the Anglo-Dutch Convention of 1814 was not completely clear, especially on the issue of certain possessions such as  Padang . The Convention of 1814 only returned Dutch territory that was held before 1803, which did not include Padang. Raffles asserted the British claim personally, leading a small expedition to the  Sultanate of Minangkabau . Yet, as Raffles confirmed with the sultan regarding the absolute British influence of the area, he realized that the local rulers had only limited power over the well-cultivated and civilized country, and the treaty was largely symbolic and had little actual force.     [ edit ]   The founding of Singapore          Statue of Sir Stamford Raffles in Singapore, based on the original by  Thomas Woolner       Meanwhile, Major  William Farquhar , the  British Resident  of Malacca, had been attempting to negotiate  commercial treaties  with the local chiefs of the Riau Archipelago, especially with the heads of the  Sultanate of Johore . Due to the death and subsequent turmoil of the sultanate at the time of Farquhar's arrival, Farquhar was compelled to sign the treaty not with the official head of the sultanate, but rather, the Raja Muda (Regent or Crown Prince) of Riau. Noting it as a success and reporting it as such back to Raffles, Raffles sailed to Malacca in late 1818 to personally secure a British presence in the Riau area, especially  Singapura , which was favored by him both through the readings of Malayan histories and by Farquhar's explorations.   Despite  Lord Hastings'  less-than-stellar opinion of Raffles before (which had necessitated his trip to England to clear his name at the end of his tenure as Governor-General of Java), the now well-connected and successful Raffles was able to secure the permission to set up a settlement where in  Malaysian history  the name  Lion City  was applied and was in a strategically advantageous position. However, he was not to provoke the Dutch, and his actions were officially disavowed. Despite the best efforts in London by authorities such as the  Viscount Castlereagh  to quell Dutch fears and the continuing efforts to reach an agreement between the nations that eventually became the  Anglo-Dutch Treaty  of London of 1824, as well as to send instructions to Raffles to undertake far less intrusive actions, the distance between the Far East and Europe had meant that the orders had no chance of reaching Raffles in time for his venture to begin.     [ edit ]   Singapore     [ edit ]   Establishment   After a brief survey of the  Karimun Islands , on 29 January 1819, he established a post at the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula. It was established that there was no Dutch presence on the island of Singapore. Johore also no longer had any control of the area, so contact was made with the local Temenggong, or Raja. The contacts were friendly and Raffles, knowledgeable about the muddled political situation, took advantage to provide a rudimentary treaty between the nominal chiefs of the area that called for the exclusivity of trade and the English protection of the area. Members of Raffles' party surveyed the island and proceeded to request the presence of the sultan, or whoever at the time had supreme nominal power, to sign a formal treaty, while Major Farquhar was ordered to do the same in Rhio. A few days later, the formal treaty signed by a man who claimed to be the ""lawful sovereign of the whole of territories extending from  Lingga  and  Johor  to  Mount Muar "". This man was  Hussein Shah of Johor , who, although having had no previous contact with the British, had certainly heard of the might of the  British navy  and was in no position to argue against the terms. However, Raffles was able to charm the man and to reassure him that the Dutch posed no threat in the area. Hussein Shah had been the crown Prince of Johor, but while he was away in Pahang to get married, his father died and his younger brother was made sultan, supported by some of the court officials and the Dutch. To circumvent the situation of having to negotiate with a sultan influenced by the Dutch, Raffles decided to recognise, on behalf of the British Crown, Hussien Shah as being the rightful ruler of Johor. Farquhar's attempt to establish a more favorable treaty in Rhio was met with greater challenge, as the Dutch were present and made for a rather awkward position. The Dutch were alarmed and sent a small contingent to the island. Despite a covert offer of subterfuge against the Dutch offered by the Raja of Rhio, Farquhar returned and an official protest was sent by the Raja to Java regarding the matter.   Raffles declared the foundation of what was to become modern Singapore on 6 February, securing the transfer of control of the island to the East India Company. Much pomp and ceremony was done, and the official treaty was read aloud in languages representing all nations present, as well as the Malay and Chinese inhabitants. Hussien Shah was paid $5000 a year while the local Temenggong received $3000 a year, both massive sums at the time, equivalent to several hundred thousand dollars now [ citation needed ] . Farquhar was officially named the Resident of Singapore as Raffles was named as ""Agent to the Most Noble the Governor-General with the States of Rhio, Lingin and Johor"". Although ownership of the post was to be exclusively British, explicit orders were given to Farquhar to maintain free passage of ships through the  Strait of Singapore  and a small military presence was established alongside the trading post. After issuing orders to Farquhar and the remaining Europeans, Raffles left the next day, 7 February 1819.     [ edit ]   Achin, and the early conflict/crisis with the Dutch   Raffles also planned to start a British presence in  Achin , at the northern tip of Sumatra. As soon as he left, the Raja of Rhio sent letters to the Dutch, claiming innocence and a British encroachment. The Dutch in Malacca acted at once, and ordered that no Malays could go to Singapore. Raffles' bold claim of Singapore created a curious geographic situation where although Penang was clearly closer distance-wise to Singapore, Raffles, in his capacity as the Governor-General of Bencoolen, was in control. This undoubtedly irked the authorities in Penang to the point where they refused to send any sepoys to Singapore to complete the garrison. Official Dutch complaints came before the end of the month, and Raffles attempted to appease the situation by instructing Farquhar to not interfere with the politics of surrounding islands. Despite numerous threats and serious considerations by the Dutch Governor-General in Java, the Dutch did not take any military action.   The muddled political situation in Johore and Rhio also created a certain uneasiness and instability for the two nations. Tengku Long  was claimed to be a  pretender  to the throne, and since the  succession  laws in the Malay sultanates were not as clear cut as, for example, the  Salic  laws of Europe, the treaties signed between native rulers and the European powers always seemed to be on the verge of being invalidated, especially if a sultan is deposed by one of his siblings or other pretenders.   Nevertheless, amidst the uncertainty and intrigue, Raffles landed in Achin on 14 March 1819, with the begrudging help of Penang. Once again, it seems that multiple people were in power, but none wanted to formally deal with the British. The hostile atmosphere created allowed for Raffles to cancel the only meeting he was able to arrange, with  Panglima Polim , a powerful divisional chief, fearing treachery. As the influential merchant  John Palmer , Raffles, and fellow commissioner John Monckton Coombs of Penang sat offshore, waiting for a response, Calcutta debated whether to reinforce Singapore or not. Evacuation plans were made, but the Dutch never acted and finally Lord Hastings prompted Colonel Bannerman, the Governor of Penang, to send funds to reinforce Singapore.   Raffles finally was able to convince his fellow commissioners to sign a treaty with Jauhar al-Alam Shah, the ruler of Achin, which placed a British resident as well as the exclusivity of trade. By the time Raffles returned to Singapore, on 31 May, much of the immediate crisis that the establishment of the colony had caused in both Penang and Calcutta had passed. By then, the initial five-hundred villagers had grown to become five-thousand merchants, soldiers, and administrators on the island. Raffles was determined to both destroy the Dutch monopoly in the area, and create a gateway to the trade with China and Japan, the latter of which he attempted and failed to reach while governing Java.     [ edit ]   The first year of Singapore   While in Singapore, Raffles established schools and churches in the native languages. He allowed  missionaries  and local businesses to flourish. Certain colonial aspects remained: a European town was quickly built to  segregate  the population, separated by a river; carriage roads were built and cantonments constructed for the soldiers. Otherwise, however, no duties were imposed and confident that Farquhar would follow his instructions well, he sailed for Bencoolen once again on 28 June.     [ edit ]   Bencoolen, once again   Raffles was still the Governor-General of  Bencoolen  and having returned to it after the settling of Singapore, Raffles started more reforms that were, by now, almost trademarks of his reign upon colonies. Forced labor was abolished when he first arrived, and he declared Bencoolen a  free port  as well. Currency was regulated and as he had an excess of out-of-work  civil servants , formed committees to advise him in the running of the colony. However, Bencoolen was not as self-sufficient as Singapore. The area was poor and disease-ridden, and the first reports from the committees reflected very poorly upon the condition of the colony. Unlike the  salutary neglect  Raffles granted upon Singapore, he slowed the European-inspired reforms and emphasized on the cultivation of whatever land that was available. Native authorities were given power in their respective districts and were answerable only to the Governor-General. The slave-debtor system was brought in in exchange instead of the old slavery system that Raffles abolished in Java, Borneo, and initially in Bencoolen. Slave-debtors were registered, and educational reforms started to focus on the children instead of the entire population. Raffles was looking into a long-term plan for a slow reform of Bencoolen.   Unlike many other European colonizers, Raffles did not impose upon the colonized the language, culture, or other aspects of the colonizer. In addition to preserving the  artifacts ,  fauna , and  flora  of his colonies, he also allowed  religious freedom  in his colonies, especially important as the  Malay states  were largely  Muslim . However,  Christian  schools, especially schools for the very young and impressionable, were started by missionaries in all of his colonies.     [ edit ]   Consolidation of the Eastern Isles   The death of Colonel Bannerman of Penang in October 1819 brought upon a new opportunity for Raffles to expand his power to also include the other minor British factories and outposts from Sumatra to  Cochin China . He sailed to Calcutta and as Lord Hastings sought to consolidate all of the small British possessions in the  East Indies . During his sojourn, he had the opportunity to argue for free trade and the protection of the private enterprise. Education and the retention of small British outposts were also discussed.   The Dutch claim on the Sultanate of Johore and hence, Rhio, and the diplomatic exchanges between Baron  Godert van der Capellen  and Calcutta continued throughout this time. The legitimacy of the British treaties were also questioned once again, but finally, as Singapore grew at an exponential rate, the Dutch gave up their claim on the island, allowing the colony to continue as a British possession. However, the pressures put upon Calcutta ensured that no single governor of all British possessions in the Strait or on Sumatra was appointed, and Raffles, whose health was slowly ailing, returned to Bencoolen.     [ edit ]   Administration of Bencoolen, 1820 - 1822   Raffles returned to Bencoolen in ill-health, but as his health improved, he continued on his quest to learn about the island which he now called home. He studied the  Batak   cannibals  of  Tappanooly  and their rituals and laws regarding the consumption of human flesh, writing in detail about the transgressions that warranted such an act as well as their methods. He also noted the rise of the Sikh religion in certain parts of Sumatra.   By early 1820, Tunku Long had firmly established himself as the Sultan of Johore to the British, but the political situation in the area remains a befuddled mess, with the old sultan dying and many new ones attempting to gain either the crown or regency. As Farquhar was involving himself poorly in local politics, Raffles appointed Travers as the Resident of Singapore, replacing Farquhar. Upon his arrival, Travers found the colony a delightful smrgsbord of different races and cultures, numbering over six thousand, and the Singapore trade was slowly overtaking the Java trade.   As in Java, Raffles collected samples of local species of plants and animals, as well as described them in his journals. He also described other local tribes and their customs, especially their  religions  and laws. He brought the island of  Nias  under British rule as well, noting its more civilized state and production of rice.   Yet, the production of food remained somewhat of a problem in Bencoolen. Raffles paid special attention to the agricultural methods of the  Chinese , and wrote an introduction to the only issue of  Proceedings of the Agricultural Society , in order to remedy this. His employer, the  East India Company , however, had no other concerns outside of profit, and even as Raffles lived like a country gentleman and ran his colony as an estate, his expenditures in natural preservation was frowned upon. His removal was discussed in both Calcutta and London, while Castlereagh continued negotiations with the Dutch regarding the ongoing diplomatic conflicts.   Luckily, the Singapore issue had its supporters in the House, so as negotiations went on in Europe, Raffles remained largely idle in Bencoolen. The only major issue, outside of the politics of local sultans, involved the replacement of Farquhar, who decided that he had no intention of leaving his post voluntarily, causing a moment of tension between him and Travers. Raffles' request for Travers to deliver dispatches to India nullified the issue late in the year, and Farquhar remained in charge in Singapore, with its survival still in doubt for many in both India and London, who believed that it would either be handed over to the Dutch or taken violently by the Dutch at the end of Castlereagh's negotiations.   Farquhar, however, stirred up more trouble, conflicting especially with local English merchants over trivial matters of self-importance and overreaction over small infractions of white traders, for some of which he was reprimanded by Calcutta officially.  Public works , commissioned by Raffles but undertaken by Farquhar, was becoming overwhelmingly expensive.   Personal tragedies also started for Raffles. His eldest son, Leopold, died during an  epidemic  on 4 July 1821. The oldest daughter, Charlotte, was also sick with dysentery by the end of the year, but it would be his youngest son, Stamford Marsden, who would perish first with the disease, 3 January 1822, with Charlotte to follow ten days later. For the good part of four month the couple remained devastated. The year would be eventful with the suicide of Castlereagh and the appointment of  Lord Amherst  as the  Governor-General of India , replacing Hastings. As Raffles grew restless and depressed, he decided to visit Singapore, before heading home to England. Accompanying him would be his wife Sophia and only surviving child, Ella.     [ edit ]   Singapore - 1822 - 1823          The  Plan of the Town of Singapore , or more commonly known as the  Jackson Plan       Raffles was pleased at the fact that Singapore had grown exponentially in such short years. The colony was a bustling hub of trade and activity. However, Farquhar's development work was deemed unsatisfactory and Raffles drew up what is now known as the  Jackson Plan , and replanned the city according to recommendations of a committee headed by the colony's engineer, Phillip Jackson.   It was still a segregated plan, giving the best land to the Europeans, yet it was considered remarkably scientific for the time. It was also during the replanning and reconstruction of the town that allowed Farquhar to clash dramatically with Raffles, who now considered Farquhar unfit for the position of Resident. Raffles took direct control with a heavy hand. In 1823, Raffles instituted a code of settlement for the populace, and soon followed with laws regarding the freedom of trade. He also quickly instituted a registration system for all land, regardless of ownership, and the repossession of the land by the government if land remained unregistered. This act greatly asserted the power of the British government as it covered land previously owned by the Sultan as well. A police force and magistrate was then set up, under British principles. In a very short period of time, Raffles had turned a semi-anarchic trading post into a proper city with at least a semblance of order.   Repeated efforts by Raffles for Calcutta to send a replacement for Farquhar remained unanswered. As Raffles started to hint at his impending retirement, he made Johore a British protectorate, causing a protest from van der Capellen. Finally, Calcutta appointed  John Crawfurd , who had followed Raffles for over twenty years, as the Resident of Singapore. Captain  William Gordon MacKenzie  took over Bencoolen from Raffles. It's March 1823, and coincidentally, on the same day he was replaced, he received an official reprimand from London for the takeover of Nias.   With politics against him, Raffles finally turned back to the natural sciences. He gave a speech regarding the opening of a Malay college in Singapore that heavily involved his observations of his years in Southeast Asia and the importance of both the local and the European languages. Raffles personally gave $2000 towards the effort, as the East India Company gave $4000.   In 1823, Raffles drafted the first constitution for Singapore, which followed a fairly moralistic stance, outlawing gaming and slavery. A specific regulation in the constitution called for the multiethnic population of Singapore to remain as is, and there shall be no crimes based on being a race. He then went to work drafting laws, defining on exactly ""what"" constituted a crime. Finally, on 9 July 1823, feeling that his work on establishing Singapore was finished, he boarded a ship for home, but not before a stop in Batavia to visit his old home and adversary, van der Capellen. A final stop in Bencoolen ensued, and finally, a voyage home, interrupted by a harrowing experience when one of the ships caught fire off Rat Island, which claimed many of his drawings and papers.   The  Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824  finally settled the score in the East Indies. The British gained dominance in the north, while the entirety of Sumatra became Dutch. The Malay Peninsula and the  Indian subcontinent  were both free of Dutch interference.   Raffles finally returned to England 22 August 1824, over a year after he left Singapore. His longest tenure in Singapore was only eight months, but he was considered the founder of Singapore nevertheless.     [ edit ]   England and death   Upon arrival in England in poor health, both Sir Stamford and Lady Raffles convalesced in  Cheltenham  until September, after which he entertained distinguished guests in both London and his home. He also made considerations to run for parliament during this time, but this ambition was never realized. He moved to London at the end of November, just in time to have a war of words in front of the Court of Directors of the EIC regarding Singapore with Farquhar, who had also arrived in London. Despite several severe charges put upon Raffles, Farquhar was ultimately unable to discredit him and was denied a chance to be restored to Singapore, but he was given a military promotion instead.   With the Singapore matter settled, Raffles turned to his other great hobby - botany. Raffles was a founder (in 1825) and first president (elected April 1826) of the  Zoological Society of London  and the  London Zoo . Meanwhile, he was not only not granted a  pension , but was called to pay over twenty-two thousand pounds sterling for the losses incurred during his administrations. Raffles replied and clarified his actions, and moved to his country estate, Highwood, but before the issue was resolved, he was already much too ill.   He died in London, England, a day before his forty-fifth birthday, on 5 July 1826, of  apoplexy . His estate amounted around ten thousand pounds sterling, which was paid to the Company to cover his outstanding debt. Because of his  anti-slavery  stance, he was refused burial inside his local parish church (St. Mary's,  Hendon ) by the  vicar , whose family had made its money in the slave trade. A brass tablet was finally placed in 1887 and the actual whereabouts of his body was not known until 1914 when it was found in a vault. When the church was extended in the 1920s his tomb was incorporated into the body of the building.     [ edit ]   Coat of Arms   The Blazon of his Armorial Ensigns reads:     ""Or a double headed Eagle displayed Gules charged on the breast with an Eastern Crown on the first, on a Chief Vert pendent from a chain two oval Medallions in Pale the one bearing Arabic characters and the other a dagger in fess the blade wavy the point towards the dexter in relief Or, the said medallions and chain being a representation of a personal decoration called the Order of the Golden Sword conferred upon by him by the Chief or King of Atcheen in Sumatra as a mark of the high regard of the said King and in testimony of the good understanding which had been happily established between that Prince and the British Government; and for a crest out of an Eastern Crown Or a Gryphon's Head Purpure gorged with a collar gemel Gold.""     The  Coat of Arms  has been adapted into the school arms of  Raffles Institution  and  Raffles Junior College . It can also be found as part of a  stained-glass window  in  St. Andrew's Cathedral, Singapore . The motto of the Raffles family is  in cruce triumphans , meaning  triumphing in the cross .

He was also heavily involved in the conquest of the Indonesian island of  Java  from Dutch and French military forces during the  Napoleonic Wars .

His father was involved in the  Caribbean   slave trade , and died suddenly when Raffles was fourteen, leaving his family in debt. Raffles then started working as a  clerk  in London for the  British East India Company , the trading company that shaped many of Britain's overseas conquests. In 1805 he was sent to what is now  Penang  in the country of  Malaysia , then called the Prince of Wales Island, starting his long association with  Southeast Asia . He started with a post under the Honourable  Philip Dundas , the Governor of Penang.   As he was gazetted assistant secretary to the new Governor of Penang in 1805, he married Olivia Mariamne Devenish, a widow who was formerly married to Jacob Cassivelaun Fancourt, an assistant surgeon in Madras who had died in 1800. It was also at this time that he made acquaintance with  Thomas Otho Travers , who would accompany him for the next twenty years.     [ edit ]   Java   His knowledge of the  Malay language  as well as his wit and ability, gained him favour with  Lord Minto ,  governor of India , and he was sent to  Malacca . Then, in 1811, after the invasion and annexation of the  Kingdom of Holland  by France during Napoleon's war, Raffles had no choice but to leave the country. He mounted a military expedition against the Dutch and French in  Java ,  Indonesia . The war was swiftly conducted by  Admiral Robert Stopford , General Wetherhall, and Colonel Gillespie, who led a well-organized army against an army of mostly French conscripts with little proper leadership. The previous Dutch governor,  Herman Willem Daendels , had built a well-defended fortification at  Meester Cornelis  (now  Jatinegara ), and at the time, the governor,  Jan Willem Janssens  (who, coincidentally, surrendered to the British at the  Cape Colony ), mounted a brave but ultimately futile defense at the fortress. The British, led by Colonel Gillespie, stormed the fort and captured it within three hours. Janssens attempted to escape inland but was captured. The British invasion of Java took a total of forty-five days, during which Raffles was appointed the Lieutenant-Governor by Lord Minto before hostilities formally ceased. He took his residence at  Buitenzorg  and despite having a small subset of Britons as his senior staff, he kept many of the Dutch civil servants in the governmental structure. He also negotiated peace and mounted some small military expeditions against local princes to subjugate them to British rule, as well as a takeover of  Bangka Island  to set up a permanent British presence in the area in the case of the return of Java to Dutch rule after the end of the  War of the Sixth Coalition  in Europe.   During his governorship, Raffles introduced partial  self-government , stopped the slave trade, became an early opponent of the  Opium trade  by placing strict limitations upon its importation, much to the dismay of Calcutta, led an expedition to rediscover and restore  Borobudur  and other ancient monuments, and replaced the Dutch forced agriculture system with a  land tenure  system of land management, probably influenced by the earlier writings of Dirk van Hogendorp (1761-1822). He also changed the Dutch colonies to the British system of driving on the left, [ citation needed ] which is why Indonesia drives on the left today.   Under the harsh conditions of the island, Olivia died on 26 November 1814, an event that devastated Raffles. In 1815, he left again for England after the island of Java was returned to control of the Netherlands following the  Napoleonic Wars , under the terms of the  Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814 , but not before he was officially replaced by  John Fendall  on account of the poor financial performance of the colony during his administration, as deemed by the successors of Lord Minto in Calcutta. He sailed to England in early 1816 to clear his name, and en route, visited  Napoleon , who was in exile at  St. Helena , but found him unpleasant and unimpressive.     [ edit ]   Interlude in England          Raffles in 1817       In 1817, Raffles wrote and published a book entitled  History of Java , describing the history of the island from ancient times. In 1817 he was knighted by the prince regent, whose daughter,  Princess Charlotte , was particularly close to him. At the publication of the book, he also stopped using the name ""Thomas"", preferring to use his middle name, ""Stamford"", possibly to avoid confusion amongst his associates with  Sir Thomas Sevestre  or his cousin who bore the same name. On 22 February, he married his second wife, Sophia Hull.   He was appointed as the Governor-General of Bencoolen (now  Bengkulu ) on 15 October 1817, and set sail to take the post with his new wife.     [ edit ]   Bencoolen (Bengkulu) and Malaya   Raffles arrived in Bencoolen ( Bengkulu ) on 19 March 1818. Despite the prestige connected with the title, Bencoolen was a colonial backwater whose only real export was pepper and only the murder of a previous Resident, Thomas Parr, gained it any attention back home in Britain. Raffles found the place wretched, and set about reforms immediately, mostly similar to what he had done in Java - abolishing slavery and limiting cockfighting and such games. To replace the slaves, he used a contingent of  convicts , already sent to him from India. It is at this point when he realized the importance of a British presence that both challenged the Dutch hegemony in the area and could remain consistently profitable, unlike Bencoolen or Batavia. However, the strategic importance of poorly-maintained but well-positioned  British possessions  such as Penang or Bencoolen made it impossible for the British to abandon such unprofitable colonies in such close proximity to the Dutch in Java. The competition in the area, between Raffles and the aggressive Dutch  de jure  Governor, Elout, certainly led at least in part to the later  Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 . Raffles looked into alternatives in the area - namely Bangka, which had been ceded to the Dutch after its conquest by the British during its occupation of Java.   Bintan  was also under consideration. Despite the fact that  Warren Hastings  overlooked the island before settling upon Penang in 1786, the  Riau Archipelago  was an attractive choice just to the south of the  Malay Peninsula , for its proximity to  Malacca . In his correspondences with Calcutta, Raffles also emphasized the need to establish a certain amount of influence with the native chiefs, which had greatly waned since the return of the Dutch. Raffles sent Thomas Travers as an ambassador to the Dutch, to possibly negotiate an expansion of British economic interests. When this failed, and when Raffles' own expeditions into his new dominion found only treacherous terrain and few exportable goods, his desire to establish a better British presence was cemented.   However, the Anglo-Dutch Convention of 1814 was not completely clear, especially on the issue of certain possessions such as  Padang . The Convention of 1814 only returned Dutch territory that was held before 1803, which did not include Padang. Raffles asserted the British claim personally, leading a small expedition to the  Sultanate of Minangkabau . Yet, as Raffles confirmed with the sultan regarding the absolute British influence of the area, he realized that the local rulers had only limited power over the well-cultivated and civilized country, and the treaty was largely symbolic and had little actual force.     [ edit ]   The founding of Singapore          Statue of Sir Stamford Raffles in Singapore, based on the original by  Thomas Woolner       Meanwhile, Major  William Farquhar , the  British Resident  of Malacca, had been attempting to negotiate  commercial treaties  with the local chiefs of the Riau Archipelago, especially with the heads of the  Sultanate of Johore . Due to the death and subsequent turmoil of the sultanate at the time of Farquhar's arrival, Farquhar was compelled to sign the treaty not with the official head of the sultanate, but rather, the Raja Muda (Regent or Crown Prince) of Riau. Noting it as a success and reporting it as such back to Raffles, Raffles sailed to Malacca in late 1818 to personally secure a British presence in the Riau area, especially  Singapura , which was favored by him both through the readings of Malayan histories and by Farquhar's explorations.   Despite  Lord Hastings'  less-than-stellar opinion of Raffles before (which had necessitated his trip to England to clear his name at the end of his tenure as Governor-General of Java), the now well-connected and successful Raffles was able to secure the permission to set up a settlement where in  Malaysian history  the name  Lion City  was applied and was in a strategically advantageous position. However, he was not to provoke the Dutch, and his actions were officially disavowed. Despite the best efforts in London by authorities such as the  Viscount Castlereagh  to quell Dutch fears and the continuing efforts to reach an agreement between the nations that eventually became the  Anglo-Dutch Treaty  of London of 1824, as well as to send instructions to Raffles to undertake far less intrusive actions, the distance between the Far East and Europe had meant that the orders had no chance of reaching Raffles in time for his venture to begin.     [ edit ]   Singapore     [ edit ]   Establishment   After a brief survey of the  Karimun Islands , on 29 January 1819, he established a post at the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula. It was established that there was no Dutch presence on the island of Singapore. Johore also no longer had any control of the area, so contact was made with the local Temenggong, or Raja. The contacts were friendly and Raffles, knowledgeable about the muddled political situation, took advantage to provide a rudimentary treaty between the nominal chiefs of the area that called for the exclusivity of trade and the English protection of the area. Members of Raffles' party surveyed the island and proceeded to request the presence of the sultan, or whoever at the time had supreme nominal power, to sign a formal treaty, while Major Farquhar was ordered to do the same in Rhio. A few days later, the formal treaty signed by a man who claimed to be the ""lawful sovereign of the whole of territories extending from  Lingga  and  Johor  to  Mount Muar "". This man was  Hussein Shah of Johor , who, although having had no previous contact with the British, had certainly heard of the might of the  British navy  and was in no position to argue against the terms. However, Raffles was able to charm the man and to reassure him that the Dutch posed no threat in the area. Hussein Shah had been the crown Prince of Johor, but while he was away in Pahang to get married, his father died and his younger brother was made sultan, supported by some of the court officials and the Dutch. To circumvent the situation of having to negotiate with a sultan influenced by the Dutch, Raffles decided to recognise, on behalf of the British Crown, Hussien Shah as being the rightful ruler of Johor. Farquhar's attempt to establish a more favorable treaty in Rhio was met with greater challenge, as the Dutch were present and made for a rather awkward position. The Dutch were alarmed and sent a small contingent to the island. Despite a covert offer of subterfuge against the Dutch offered by the Raja of Rhio, Farquhar returned and an official protest was sent by the Raja to Java regarding the matter.   Raffles declared the foundation of what was to become modern Singapore on 6 February, securing the transfer of control of the island to the East India Company. Much pomp and ceremony was done, and the official treaty was read aloud in languages representing all nations present, as well as the Malay and Chinese inhabitants. Hussien Shah was paid $5000 a year while the local Temenggong received $3000 a year, both massive sums at the time, equivalent to several hundred thousand dollars now [ citation needed ] . Farquhar was officially named the Resident of Singapore as Raffles was named as ""Agent to the Most Noble the Governor-General with the States of Rhio, Lingin and Johor"". Although ownership of the post was to be exclusively British, explicit orders were given to Farquhar to maintain free passage of ships through the  Strait of Singapore  and a small military presence was established alongside the trading post. After issuing orders to Farquhar and the remaining Europeans, Raffles left the next day, 7 February 1819.     [ edit ]   Achin, and the early conflict/crisis with the Dutch   Raffles also planned to start a British presence in  Achin , at the northern tip of Sumatra. As soon as he left, the Raja of Rhio sent letters to the Dutch, claiming innocence and a British encroachment. The Dutch in Malacca acted at once, and ordered that no Malays could go to Singapore. Raffles' bold claim of Singapore created a curious geographic situation where although Penang was clearly closer distance-wise to Singapore, Raffles, in his capacity as the Governor-General of Bencoolen, was in control. This undoubtedly irked the authorities in Penang to the point where they refused to send any sepoys to Singapore to complete the garrison. Official Dutch complaints came before the end of the month, and Raffles attempted to appease the situation by instructing Farquhar to not interfere with the politics of surrounding islands. Despite numerous threats and serious considerations by the Dutch Governor-General in Java, the Dutch did not take any military action.   The muddled political situation in Johore and Rhio also created a certain uneasiness and instability for the two nations. Tengku Long  was claimed to be a  pretender  to the throne, and since the  succession  laws in the Malay sultanates were not as clear cut as, for example, the  Salic  laws of Europe, the treaties signed between native rulers and the European powers always seemed to be on the verge of being invalidated, especially if a sultan is deposed by one of his siblings or other pretenders.   Nevertheless, amidst the uncertainty and intrigue, Raffles landed in Achin on 14 March 1819, with the begrudging help of Penang. Once again, it seems that multiple people were in power, but none wanted to formally deal with the British. The hostile atmosphere created allowed for Raffles to cancel the only meeting he was able to arrange, with  Panglima Polim , a powerful divisional chief, fearing treachery. As the influential merchant  John Palmer , Raffles, and fellow commissioner John Monckton Coombs of Penang sat offshore, waiting for a response, Calcutta debated whether to reinforce Singapore or not. Evacuation plans were made, but the Dutch never acted and finally Lord Hastings prompted Colonel Bannerman, the Governor of Penang, to send funds to reinforce Singapore.   Raffles finally was able to convince his fellow commissioners to sign a treaty with Jauhar al-Alam Shah, the ruler of Achin, which placed a British resident as well as the exclusivity of trade. By the time Raffles returned to Singapore, on 31 May, much of the immediate crisis that the establishment of the colony had caused in both Penang and Calcutta had passed. By then, the initial five-hundred villagers had grown to become five-thousand merchants, soldiers, and administrators on the island. Raffles was determined to both destroy the Dutch monopoly in the area, and create a gateway to the trade with China and Japan, the latter of which he attempted and failed to reach while governing Java.     [ edit ]   The first year of Singapore   While in Singapore, Raffles established schools and churches in the native languages. He allowed  missionaries  and local businesses to flourish. Certain colonial aspects remained: a European town was quickly built to  segregate  the population, separated by a river; carriage roads were built and cantonments constructed for the soldiers. Otherwise, however, no duties were imposed and confident that Farquhar would follow his instructions well, he sailed for Bencoolen once again on 28 June.     [ edit ]   Bencoolen, once again   Raffles was still the Governor-General of  Bencoolen  and having returned to it after the settling of Singapore, Raffles started more reforms that were, by now, almost trademarks of his reign upon colonies. Forced labor was abolished when he first arrived, and he declared Bencoolen a  free port  as well. Currency was regulated and as he had an excess of out-of-work  civil servants , formed committees to advise him in the running of the colony. However, Bencoolen was not as self-sufficient as Singapore. The area was poor and disease-ridden, and the first reports from the committees reflected very poorly upon the condition of the colony. Unlike the  salutary neglect  Raffles granted upon Singapore, he slowed the European-inspired reforms and emphasized on the cultivation of whatever land that was available. Native authorities were given power in their respective districts and were answerable only to the Governor-General. The slave-debtor system was brought in in exchange instead of the old slavery system that Raffles abolished in Java, Borneo, and initially in Bencoolen. Slave-debtors were registered, and educational reforms started to focus on the children instead of the entire population. Raffles was looking into a long-term plan for a slow reform of Bencoolen.   Unlike many other European colonizers, Raffles did not impose upon the colonized the language, culture, or other aspects of the colonizer. In addition to preserving the  artifacts ,  fauna , and  flora  of his colonies, he also allowed  religious freedom  in his colonies, especially important as the  Malay states  were largely  Muslim . However,  Christian  schools, especially schools for the very young and impressionable, were started by missionaries in all of his colonies.     [ edit ]   Consolidation of the Eastern Isles   The death of Colonel Bannerman of Penang in October 1819 brought upon a new opportunity for Raffles to expand his power to also include the other minor British factories and outposts from Sumatra to  Cochin China . He sailed to Calcutta and as Lord Hastings sought to consolidate all of the small British possessions in the  East Indies . During his sojourn, he had the opportunity to argue for free trade and the protection of the private enterprise. Education and the retention of small British outposts were also discussed.   The Dutch claim on the Sultanate of Johore and hence, Rhio, and the diplomatic exchanges between Baron  Godert van der Capellen  and Calcutta continued throughout this time. The legitimacy of the British treaties were also questioned once again, but finally, as Singapore grew at an exponential rate, the Dutch gave up their claim on the island, allowing the colony to continue as a British possession. However, the pressures put upon Calcutta ensured that no single governor of all British possessions in the Strait or on Sumatra was appointed, and Raffles, whose health was slowly ailing, returned to Bencoolen.     [ edit ]   Administration of Bencoolen, 1820 - 1822   Raffles returned to Bencoolen in ill-health, but as his health improved, he continued on his quest to learn about the island which he now called home. He studied the  Batak   cannibals  of  Tappanooly  and their rituals and laws regarding the consumption of human flesh, writing in detail about the transgressions that warranted such an act as well as their methods. He also noted the rise of the Sikh religion in certain parts of Sumatra.   By early 1820, Tunku Long had firmly established himself as the Sultan of Johore to the British, but the political situation in the area remains a befuddled mess, with the old sultan dying and many new ones attempting to gain either the crown or regency. As Farquhar was involving himself poorly in local politics, Raffles appointed Travers as the Resident of Singapore, replacing Farquhar. Upon his arrival, Travers found the colony a delightful smrgsbord of different races and cultures, numbering over six thousand, and the Singapore trade was slowly overtaking the Java trade.   As in Java, Raffles collected samples of local species of plants and animals, as well as described them in his journals. He also described other local tribes and their customs, especially their  religions  and laws. He brought the island of  Nias  under British rule as well, noting its more civilized state and production of rice.   Yet, the production of food remained somewhat of a problem in Bencoolen. Raffles paid special attention to the agricultural methods of the  Chinese , and wrote an introduction to the only issue of  Proceedings of the Agricultural Society , in order to remedy this. His employer, the  East India Company , however, had no other concerns outside of profit, and even as Raffles lived like a country gentleman and ran his colony as an estate, his expenditures in natural preservation was frowned upon. His removal was discussed in both Calcutta and London, while Castlereagh continued negotiations with the Dutch regarding the ongoing diplomatic conflicts.   Luckily, the Singapore issue had its supporters in the House, so as negotiations went on in Europe, Raffles remained largely idle in Bencoolen. The only major issue, outside of the politics of local sultans, involved the replacement of Farquhar, who decided that he had no intention of leaving his post voluntarily, causing a moment of tension between him and Travers. Raffles' request for Travers to deliver dispatches to India nullified the issue late in the year, and Farquhar remained in charge in Singapore, with its survival still in doubt for many in both India and London, who believed that it would either be handed over to the Dutch or taken violently by the Dutch at the end of Castlereagh's negotiations.   Farquhar, however, stirred up more trouble, conflicting especially with local English merchants over trivial matters of self-importance and overreaction over small infractions of white traders, for some of which he was reprimanded by Calcutta officially.  Public works , commissioned by Raffles but undertaken by Farquhar, was becoming overwhelmingly expensive.   Personal tragedies also started for Raffles. His eldest son, Leopold, died during an  epidemic  on 4 July 1821. The oldest daughter, Charlotte, was also sick with dysentery by the end of the year, but it would be his youngest son, Stamford Marsden, who would perish first with the disease, 3 January 1822, with Charlotte to follow ten days later. For the good part of four month the couple remained devastated. The year would be eventful with the suicide of Castlereagh and the appointment of  Lord Amherst  as the  Governor-General of India , replacing Hastings. As Raffles grew restless and depressed, he decided to visit Singapore, before heading home to England. Accompanying him would be his wife Sophia and only surviving child, Ella.     [ edit ]   Singapore - 1822 - 1823          The  Plan of the Town of Singapore , or more commonly known as the  Jackson Plan       Raffles was pleased at the fact that Singapore had grown exponentially in such short years. The colony was a bustling hub of trade and activity. However, Farquhar's development work was deemed unsatisfactory and Raffles drew up what is now known as the  Jackson Plan , and replanned the city according to recommendations of a committee headed by the colony's engineer, Phillip Jackson.   It was still a segregated plan, giving the best land to the Europeans, yet it was considered remarkably scientific for the time. It was also during the replanning and reconstruction of the town that allowed Farquhar to clash dramatically with Raffles, who now considered Farquhar unfit for the position of Resident. Raffles took direct control with a heavy hand. In 1823, Raffles instituted a code of settlement for the populace, and soon followed with laws regarding the freedom of trade. He also quickly instituted a registration system for all land, regardless of ownership, and the repossession of the land by the government if land remained unregistered. This act greatly asserted the power of the British government as it covered land previously owned by the Sultan as well. A police force and magistrate was then set up, under British principles. In a very short period of time, Raffles had turned a semi-anarchic trading post into a proper city with at least a semblance of order.   Repeated efforts by Raffles for Calcutta to send a replacement for Farquhar remained unanswered. As Raffles started to hint at his impending retirement, he made Johore a British protectorate, causing a protest from van der Capellen. Finally, Calcutta appointed  John Crawfurd , who had followed Raffles for over twenty years, as the Resident of Singapore. Captain  William Gordon MacKenzie  took over Bencoolen from Raffles. It's March 1823, and coincidentally, on the same day he was replaced, he received an official reprimand from London for the takeover of Nias.   With politics against him, Raffles finally turned back to the natural sciences. He gave a speech regarding the opening of a Malay college in Singapore that heavily involved his observations of his years in Southeast Asia and the importance of both the local and the European languages. Raffles personally gave $2000 towards the effort, as the East India Company gave $4000.   In 1823, Raffles drafted the first constitution for Singapore, which followed a fairly moralistic stance, outlawing gaming and slavery. A specific regulation in the constitution called for the multiethnic population of Singapore to remain as is, and there shall be no crimes based on being a race. He then went to work drafting laws, defining on exactly ""what"" constituted a crime. Finally, on 9 July 1823, feeling that his work on establishing Singapore was finished, he boarded a ship for home, but not before a stop in Batavia to visit his old home and adversary, van der Capellen. A final stop in Bencoolen ensued, and finally, a voyage home, interrupted by a harrowing experience when one of the ships caught fire off Rat Island, which claimed many of his drawings and papers.   The  Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824  finally settled the score in the East Indies. The British gained dominance in the north, while the entirety of Sumatra became Dutch. The Malay Peninsula and the  Indian subcontinent  were both free of Dutch interference.   Raffles finally returned to England 22 August 1824, over a year after he left Singapore. His longest tenure in Singapore was only eight months, but he was considered the founder of Singapore nevertheless.     [ edit ]   England and death   Upon arrival in England in poor health, both Sir Stamford and Lady Raffles convalesced in  Cheltenham  until September, after which he entertained distinguished guests in both London and his home. He also made considerations to run for parliament during this time, but this ambition was never realized. He moved to London at the end of November, just in time to have a war of words in front of the Court of Directors of the EIC regarding Singapore with Farquhar, who had also arrived in London. Despite several severe charges put upon Raffles, Farquhar was ultimately unable to discredit him and was denied a chance to be restored to Singapore, but he was given a military promotion instead.   With the Singapore matter settled, Raffles turned to his other great hobby - botany. Raffles was a founder (in 1825) and first president (elected April 1826) of the  Zoological Society of London  and the  London Zoo . Meanwhile, he was not only not granted a  pension , but was called to pay over twenty-two thousand pounds sterling for the losses incurred during his administrations. Raffles replied and clarified his actions, and moved to his country estate, Highwood, but before the issue was resolved, he was already much too ill.   He died in London, England, a day before his forty-fifth birthday, on 5 July 1826, of  apoplexy . His estate amounted around ten thousand pounds sterling, which was paid to the Company to cover his outstanding debt. Because of his  anti-slavery  stance, he was refused burial inside his local parish church (St. Mary's,  Hendon ) by the  vicar , whose family had made its money in the slave trade. A brass tablet was finally placed in 1887 and the actual whereabouts of his body was not known until 1914 when it was found in a vault. When the church was extended in the 1920s his tomb was incorporated into the body of the building.     [ edit ]   Coat of Arms   The Blazon of his Armorial Ensigns reads:     ""Or a double headed Eagle displayed Gules charged on the breast with an Eastern Crown on the first, on a Chief Vert pendent from a chain two oval Medallions in Pale the one bearing Arabic characters and the other a dagger in fess the blade wavy the point towards the dexter in relief Or, the said medallions and chain being a representation of a personal decoration called the Order of the Golden Sword conferred upon by him by the Chief or King of Atcheen in Sumatra as a mark of the high regard of the said King and in testimony of the good understanding which had been happily established between that Prince and the British Government; and for a crest out of an Eastern Crown Or a Gryphon's Head Purpure gorged with a collar gemel Gold.""     The  Coat of Arms  has been adapted into the school arms of  Raffles Institution  and  Raffles Junior College . It can also be found as part of a  stained-glass window  in  St. Andrew's Cathedral, Singapore . The motto of the Raffles family is  in cruce triumphans , meaning  triumphing in the cross .

He was also heavily involved in the conquest of the Indonesian island of  Java  from Dutch and French military forces during the  Napoleonic Wars . He is one of the more famous  Britons  who contributed to the expansion of the  British Empire .

His father was involved in the  Caribbean   slave trade , and died suddenly when Raffles was fourteen, leaving his family in debt. Raffles then started working as a  clerk  in London for the  British East India Company , the trading company that shaped many of Britain's overseas conquests. In 1805 he was sent to what is now  Penang  in the country of  Malaysia , then called the Prince of Wales Island, starting his long association with  Southeast Asia . He started with a post under the Honourable  Philip Dundas , the Governor of Penang.   As he was gazetted assistant secretary to the new Governor of Penang in 1805, he married Olivia Mariamne Devenish, a widow who was formerly married to Jacob Cassivelaun Fancourt, an assistant surgeon in Madras who had died in 1800. It was also at this time that he made acquaintance with  Thomas Otho Travers , who would accompany him for the next twenty years.     [ edit ]   Java   His knowledge of the  Malay language  as well as his wit and ability, gained him favour with  Lord Minto ,  governor of India , and he was sent to  Malacca . Then, in 1811, after the invasion and annexation of the  Kingdom of Holland  by France during Napoleon's war, Raffles had no choice but to leave the country. He mounted a military expedition against the Dutch and French in  Java ,  Indonesia . The war was swiftly conducted by  Admiral Robert Stopford , General Wetherhall, and Colonel Gillespie, who led a well-organized army against an army of mostly French conscripts with little proper leadership. The previous Dutch governor,  Herman Willem Daendels , had built a well-defended fortification at  Meester Cornelis  (now  Jatinegara ), and at the time, the governor,  Jan Willem Janssens  (who, coincidentally, surrendered to the British at the  Cape Colony ), mounted a brave but ultimately futile defense at the fortress. The British, led by Colonel Gillespie, stormed the fort and captured it within three hours. Janssens attempted to escape inland but was captured. The British invasion of Java took a total of forty-five days, during which Raffles was appointed the Lieutenant-Governor by Lord Minto before hostilities formally ceased. He took his residence at  Buitenzorg  and despite having a small subset of Britons as his senior staff, he kept many of the Dutch civil servants in the governmental structure. He also negotiated peace and mounted some small military expeditions against local princes to subjugate them to British rule, as well as a takeover of  Bangka Island  to set up a permanent British presence in the area in the case of the return of Java to Dutch rule after the end of the  War of the Sixth Coalition  in Europe.   During his governorship, Raffles introduced partial  self-government , stopped the slave trade, became an early opponent of the  Opium trade  by placing strict limitations upon its importation, much to the dismay of Calcutta, led an expedition to rediscover and restore  Borobudur  and other ancient monuments, and replaced the Dutch forced agriculture system with a  land tenure  system of land management, probably influenced by the earlier writings of Dirk van Hogendorp (1761-1822). He also changed the Dutch colonies to the British system of driving on the left, [ citation needed ] which is why Indonesia drives on the left today.   Under the harsh conditions of the island, Olivia died on 26 November 1814, an event that devastated Raffles. In 1815, he left again for England after the island of Java was returned to control of the Netherlands following the  Napoleonic Wars , under the terms of the  Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814 , but not before he was officially replaced by  John Fendall  on account of the poor financial performance of the colony during his administration, as deemed by the successors of Lord Minto in Calcutta. He sailed to England in early 1816 to clear his name, and en route, visited  Napoleon , who was in exile at  St. Helena , but found him unpleasant and unimpressive.     [ edit ]   Interlude in England          Raffles in 1817       In 1817, Raffles wrote and published a book entitled  History of Java , describing the history of the island from ancient times. In 1817 he was knighted by the prince regent, whose daughter,  Princess Charlotte , was particularly close to him. At the publication of the book, he also stopped using the name ""Thomas"", preferring to use his middle name, ""Stamford"", possibly to avoid confusion amongst his associates with  Sir Thomas Sevestre  or his cousin who bore the same name. On 22 February, he married his second wife, Sophia Hull.   He was appointed as the Governor-General of Bencoolen (now  Bengkulu ) on 15 October 1817, and set sail to take the post with his new wife.     [ edit ]   Bencoolen (Bengkulu) and Malaya   Raffles arrived in Bencoolen ( Bengkulu ) on 19 March 1818. Despite the prestige connected with the title, Bencoolen was a colonial backwater whose only real export was pepper and only the murder of a previous Resident, Thomas Parr, gained it any attention back home in Britain. Raffles found the place wretched, and set about reforms immediately, mostly similar to what he had done in Java - abolishing slavery and limiting cockfighting and such games. To replace the slaves, he used a contingent of  convicts , already sent to him from India. It is at this point when he realized the importance of a British presence that both challenged the Dutch hegemony in the area and could remain consistently profitable, unlike Bencoolen or Batavia. However, the strategic importance of poorly-maintained but well-positioned  British possessions  such as Penang or Bencoolen made it impossible for the British to abandon such unprofitable colonies in such close proximity to the Dutch in Java. The competition in the area, between Raffles and the aggressive Dutch  de jure  Governor, Elout, certainly led at least in part to the later  Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 . Raffles looked into alternatives in the area - namely Bangka, which had been ceded to the Dutch after its conquest by the British during its occupation of Java.   Bintan  was also under consideration. Despite the fact that  Warren Hastings  overlooked the island before settling upon Penang in 1786, the  Riau Archipelago  was an attractive choice just to the south of the  Malay Peninsula , for its proximity to  Malacca . In his correspondences with Calcutta, Raffles also emphasized the need to establish a certain amount of influence with the native chiefs, which had greatly waned since the return of the Dutch. Raffles sent Thomas Travers as an ambassador to the Dutch, to possibly negotiate an expansion of British economic interests. When this failed, and when Raffles' own expeditions into his new dominion found only treacherous terrain and few exportable goods, his desire to establish a better British presence was cemented.   However, the Anglo-Dutch Convention of 1814 was not completely clear, especially on the issue of certain possessions such as  Padang . The Convention of 1814 only returned Dutch territory that was held before 1803, which did not include Padang. Raffles asserted the British claim personally, leading a small expedition to the  Sultanate of Minangkabau . Yet, as Raffles confirmed with the sultan regarding the absolute British influence of the area, he realized that the local rulers had only limited power over the well-cultivated and civilized country, and the treaty was largely symbolic and had little actual force.     [ edit ]   The founding of Singapore          Statue of Sir Stamford Raffles in Singapore, based on the original by  Thomas Woolner       Meanwhile, Major  William Farquhar , the  British Resident  of Malacca, had been attempting to negotiate  commercial treaties  with the local chiefs of the Riau Archipelago, especially with the heads of the  Sultanate of Johore . Due to the death and subsequent turmoil of the sultanate at the time of Farquhar's arrival, Farquhar was compelled to sign the treaty not with the official head of the sultanate, but rather, the Raja Muda (Regent or Crown Prince) of Riau. Noting it as a success and reporting it as such back to Raffles, Raffles sailed to Malacca in late 1818 to personally secure a British presence in the Riau area, especially  Singapura , which was favored by him both through the readings of Malayan histories and by Farquhar's explorations.   Despite  Lord Hastings'  less-than-stellar opinion of Raffles before (which had necessitated his trip to England to clear his name at the end of his tenure as Governor-General of Java), the now well-connected and successful Raffles was able to secure the permission to set up a settlement where in  Malaysian history  the name  Lion City  was applied and was in a strategically advantageous position. However, he was not to provoke the Dutch, and his actions were officially disavowed. Despite the best efforts in London by authorities such as the  Viscount Castlereagh  to quell Dutch fears and the continuing efforts to reach an agreement between the nations that eventually became the  Anglo-Dutch Treaty  of London of 1824, as well as to send instructions to Raffles to undertake far less intrusive actions, the distance between the Far East and Europe had meant that the orders had no chance of reaching Raffles in time for his venture to begin.     [ edit ]   Singapore     [ edit ]   Establishment   After a brief survey of the  Karimun Islands , on 29 January 1819, he established a post at the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula. It was established that there was no Dutch presence on the island of Singapore. Johore also no longer had any control of the area, so contact was made with the local Temenggong, or Raja. The contacts were friendly and Raffles, knowledgeable about the muddled political situation, took advantage to provide a rudimentary treaty between the nominal chiefs of the area that called for the exclusivity of trade and the English protection of the area. Members of Raffles' party surveyed the island and proceeded to request the presence of the sultan, or whoever at the time had supreme nominal power, to sign a formal treaty, while Major Farquhar was ordered to do the same in Rhio. A few days later, the formal treaty signed by a man who claimed to be the ""lawful sovereign of the whole of territories extending from  Lingga  and  Johor  to  Mount Muar "". This man was  Hussein Shah of Johor , who, although having had no previous contact with the British, had certainly heard of the might of the  British navy  and was in no position to argue against the terms. However, Raffles was able to charm the man and to reassure him that the Dutch posed no threat in the area. Hussein Shah had been the crown Prince of Johor, but while he was away in Pahang to get married, his father died and his younger brother was made sultan, supported by some of the court officials and the Dutch. To circumvent the situation of having to negotiate with a sultan influenced by the Dutch, Raffles decided to recognise, on behalf of the British Crown, Hussien Shah as being the rightful ruler of Johor. Farquhar's attempt to establish a more favorable treaty in Rhio was met with greater challenge, as the Dutch were present and made for a rather awkward position. The Dutch were alarmed and sent a small contingent to the island. Despite a covert offer of subterfuge against the Dutch offered by the Raja of Rhio, Farquhar returned and an official protest was sent by the Raja to Java regarding the matter.   Raffles declared the foundation of what was to become modern Singapore on 6 February, securing the transfer of control of the island to the East India Company. Much pomp and ceremony was done, and the official treaty was read aloud in languages representing all nations present, as well as the Malay and Chinese inhabitants. Hussien Shah was paid $5000 a year while the local Temenggong received $3000 a year, both massive sums at the time, equivalent to several hundred thousand dollars now [ citation needed ] . Farquhar was officially named the Resident of Singapore as Raffles was named as ""Agent to the Most Noble the Governor-General with the States of Rhio, Lingin and Johor"". Although ownership of the post was to be exclusively British, explicit orders were given to Farquhar to maintain free passage of ships through the  Strait of Singapore  and a small military presence was established alongside the trading post. After issuing orders to Farquhar and the remaining Europeans, Raffles left the next day, 7 February 1819.     [ edit ]   Achin, and the early conflict/crisis with the Dutch   Raffles also planned to start a British presence in  Achin , at the northern tip of Sumatra. As soon as he left, the Raja of Rhio sent letters to the Dutch, claiming innocence and a British encroachment. The Dutch in Malacca acted at once, and ordered that no Malays could go to Singapore. Raffles' bold claim of Singapore created a curious geographic situation where although Penang was clearly closer distance-wise to Singapore, Raffles, in his capacity as the Governor-General of Bencoolen, was in control. This undoubtedly irked the authorities in Penang to the point where they refused to send any sepoys to Singapore to complete the garrison. Official Dutch complaints came before the end of the month, and Raffles attempted to appease the situation by instructing Farquhar to not interfere with the politics of surrounding islands. Despite numerous threats and serious considerations by the Dutch Governor-General in Java, the Dutch did not take any military action.   The muddled political situation in Johore and Rhio also created a certain uneasiness and instability for the two nations. Tengku Long  was claimed to be a  pretender  to the throne, and since the  succession  laws in the Malay sultanates were not as clear cut as, for example, the  Salic  laws of Europe, the treaties signed between native rulers and the European powers always seemed to be on the verge of being invalidated, especially if a sultan is deposed by one of his siblings or other pretenders.   Nevertheless, amidst the uncertainty and intrigue, Raffles landed in Achin on 14 March 1819, with the begrudging help of Penang. Once again, it seems that multiple people were in power, but none wanted to formally deal with the British. The hostile atmosphere created allowed for Raffles to cancel the only meeting he was able to arrange, with  Panglima Polim , a powerful divisional chief, fearing treachery. As the influential merchant  John Palmer , Raffles, and fellow commissioner John Monckton Coombs of Penang sat offshore, waiting for a response, Calcutta debated whether to reinforce Singapore or not. Evacuation plans were made, but the Dutch never acted and finally Lord Hastings prompted Colonel Bannerman, the Governor of Penang, to send funds to reinforce Singapore.   Raffles finally was able to convince his fellow commissioners to sign a treaty with Jauhar al-Alam Shah, the ruler of Achin, which placed a British resident as well as the exclusivity of trade. By the time Raffles returned to Singapore, on 31 May, much of the immediate crisis that the establishment of the colony had caused in both Penang and Calcutta had passed. By then, the initial five-hundred villagers had grown to become five-thousand merchants, soldiers, and administrators on the island. Raffles was determined to both destroy the Dutch monopoly in the area, and create a gateway to the trade with China and Japan, the latter of which he attempted and failed to reach while governing Java.     [ edit ]   The first year of Singapore   While in Singapore, Raffles established schools and churches in the native languages. He allowed  missionaries  and local businesses to flourish. Certain colonial aspects remained: a European town was quickly built to  segregate  the population, separated by a river; carriage roads were built and cantonments constructed for the soldiers. Otherwise, however, no duties were imposed and confident that Farquhar would follow his instructions well, he sailed for Bencoolen once again on 28 June.     [ edit ]   Bencoolen, once again   Raffles was still the Governor-General of  Bencoolen  and having returned to it after the settling of Singapore, Raffles started more reforms that were, by now, almost trademarks of his reign upon colonies. Forced labor was abolished when he first arrived, and he declared Bencoolen a  free port  as well. Currency was regulated and as he had an excess of out-of-work  civil servants , formed committees to advise him in the running of the colony. However, Bencoolen was not as self-sufficient as Singapore. The area was poor and disease-ridden, and the first reports from the committees reflected very poorly upon the condition of the colony. Unlike the  salutary neglect  Raffles granted upon Singapore, he slowed the European-inspired reforms and emphasized on the cultivation of whatever land that was available. Native authorities were given power in their respective districts and were answerable only to the Governor-General. The slave-debtor system was brought in in exchange instead of the old slavery system that Raffles abolished in Java, Borneo, and initially in Bencoolen. Slave-debtors were registered, and educational reforms started to focus on the children instead of the entire population. Raffles was looking into a long-term plan for a slow reform of Bencoolen.   Unlike many other European colonizers, Raffles did not impose upon the colonized the language, culture, or other aspects of the colonizer. In addition to preserving the  artifacts ,  fauna , and  flora  of his colonies, he also allowed  religious freedom  in his colonies, especially important as the  Malay states  were largely  Muslim . However,  Christian  schools, especially schools for the very young and impressionable, were started by missionaries in all of his colonies.     [ edit ]   Consolidation of the Eastern Isles   The death of Colonel Bannerman of Penang in October 1819 brought upon a new opportunity for Raffles to expand his power to also include the other minor British factories and outposts from Sumatra to  Cochin China . He sailed to Calcutta and as Lord Hastings sought to consolidate all of the small British possessions in the  East Indies . During his sojourn, he had the opportunity to argue for free trade and the protection of the private enterprise. Education and the retention of small British outposts were also discussed.   The Dutch claim on the Sultanate of Johore and hence, Rhio, and the diplomatic exchanges between Baron  Godert van der Capellen  and Calcutta continued throughout this time. The legitimacy of the British treaties were also questioned once again, but finally, as Singapore grew at an exponential rate, the Dutch gave up their claim on the island, allowing the colony to continue as a British possession. However, the pressures put upon Calcutta ensured that no single governor of all British possessions in the Strait or on Sumatra was appointed, and Raffles, whose health was slowly ailing, returned to Bencoolen.     [ edit ]   Administration of Bencoolen, 1820 - 1822   Raffles returned to Bencoolen in ill-health, but as his health improved, he continued on his quest to learn about the island which he now called home. He studied the  Batak   cannibals  of  Tappanooly  and their rituals and laws regarding the consumption of human flesh, writing in detail about the transgressions that warranted such an act as well as their methods. He also noted the rise of the Sikh religion in certain parts of Sumatra.   By early 1820, Tunku Long had firmly established himself as the Sultan of Johore to the British, but the political situation in the area remains a befuddled mess, with the old sultan dying and many new ones attempting to gain either the crown or regency. As Farquhar was involving himself poorly in local politics, Raffles appointed Travers as the Resident of Singapore, replacing Farquhar. Upon his arrival, Travers found the colony a delightful smrgsbord of different races and cultures, numbering over six thousand, and the Singapore trade was slowly overtaking the Java trade.   As in Java, Raffles collected samples of local species of plants and animals, as well as described them in his journals. He also described other local tribes and their customs, especially their  religions  and laws. He brought the island of  Nias  under British rule as well, noting its more civilized state and production of rice.   Yet, the production of food remained somewhat of a problem in Bencoolen. Raffles paid special attention to the agricultural methods of the  Chinese , and wrote an introduction to the only issue of  Proceedings of the Agricultural Society , in order to remedy this. His employer, the  East India Company , however, had no other concerns outside of profit, and even as Raffles lived like a country gentleman and ran his colony as an estate, his expenditures in natural preservation was frowned upon. His removal was discussed in both Calcutta and London, while Castlereagh continued negotiations with the Dutch regarding the ongoing diplomatic conflicts.   Luckily, the Singapore issue had its supporters in the House, so as negotiations went on in Europe, Raffles remained largely idle in Bencoolen. The only major issue, outside of the politics of local sultans, involved the replacement of Farquhar, who decided that he had no intention of leaving his post voluntarily, causing a moment of tension between him and Travers. Raffles' request for Travers to deliver dispatches to India nullified the issue late in the year, and Farquhar remained in charge in Singapore, with its survival still in doubt for many in both India and London, who believed that it would either be handed over to the Dutch or taken violently by the Dutch at the end of Castlereagh's negotiations.   Farquhar, however, stirred up more trouble, conflicting especially with local English merchants over trivial matters of self-importance and overreaction over small infractions of white traders, for some of which he was reprimanded by Calcutta officially.  Public works , commissioned by Raffles but undertaken by Farquhar, was becoming overwhelmingly expensive.   Personal tragedies also started for Raffles. His eldest son, Leopold, died during an  epidemic  on 4 July 1821. The oldest daughter, Charlotte, was also sick with dysentery by the end of the year, but it would be his youngest son, Stamford Marsden, who would perish first with the disease, 3 January 1822, with Charlotte to follow ten days later. For the good part of four month the couple remained devastated. The year would be eventful with the suicide of Castlereagh and the appointment of  Lord Amherst  as the  Governor-General of India , replacing Hastings. As Raffles grew restless and depressed, he decided to visit Singapore, before heading home to England. Accompanying him would be his wife Sophia and only surviving child, Ella.     [ edit ]   Singapore - 1822 - 1823          The  Plan of the Town of Singapore , or more commonly known as the  Jackson Plan       Raffles was pleased at the fact that Singapore had grown exponentially in such short years. The colony was a bustling hub of trade and activity. However, Farquhar's development work was deemed unsatisfactory and Raffles drew up what is now known as the  Jackson Plan , and replanned the city according to recommendations of a committee headed by the colony's engineer, Phillip Jackson.   It was still a segregated plan, giving the best land to the Europeans, yet it was considered remarkably scientific for the time. It was also during the replanning and reconstruction of the town that allowed Farquhar to clash dramatically with Raffles, who now considered Farquhar unfit for the position of Resident. Raffles took direct control with a heavy hand. In 1823, Raffles instituted a code of settlement for the populace, and soon followed with laws regarding the freedom of trade. He also quickly instituted a registration system for all land, regardless of ownership, and the repossession of the land by the government if land remained unregistered. This act greatly asserted the power of the British government as it covered land previously owned by the Sultan as well. A police force and magistrate was then set up, under British principles. In a very short period of time, Raffles had turned a semi-anarchic trading post into a proper city with at least a semblance of order.   Repeated efforts by Raffles for Calcutta to send a replacement for Farquhar remained unanswered. As Raffles started to hint at his impending retirement, he made Johore a British protectorate, causing a protest from van der Capellen. Finally, Calcutta appointed  John Crawfurd , who had followed Raffles for over twenty years, as the Resident of Singapore. Captain  William Gordon MacKenzie  took over Bencoolen from Raffles. It's March 1823, and coincidentally, on the same day he was replaced, he received an official reprimand from London for the takeover of Nias.   With politics against him, Raffles finally turned back to the natural sciences. He gave a speech regarding the opening of a Malay college in Singapore that heavily involved his observations of his years in Southeast Asia and the importance of both the local and the European languages. Raffles personally gave $2000 towards the effort, as the East India Company gave $4000.   In 1823, Raffles drafted the first constitution for Singapore, which followed a fairly moralistic stance, outlawing gaming and slavery. A specific regulation in the constitution called for the multiethnic population of Singapore to remain as is, and there shall be no crimes based on being a race. He then went to work drafting laws, defining on exactly ""what"" constituted a crime. Finally, on 9 July 1823, feeling that his work on establishing Singapore was finished, he boarded a ship for home, but not before a stop in Batavia to visit his old home and adversary, van der Capellen. A final stop in Bencoolen ensued, and finally, a voyage home, interrupted by a harrowing experience when one of the ships caught fire off Rat Island, which claimed many of his drawings and papers.   The  Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824  finally settled the score in the East Indies. The British gained dominance in the north, while the entirety of Sumatra became Dutch. The Malay Peninsula and the  Indian subcontinent  were both free of Dutch interference.   Raffles finally returned to England 22 August 1824, over a year after he left Singapore. His longest tenure in Singapore was only eight months, but he was considered the founder of Singapore nevertheless.     [ edit ]   England and death   Upon arrival in England in poor health, both Sir Stamford and Lady Raffles convalesced in  Cheltenham  until September, after which he entertained distinguished guests in both London and his home. He also made considerations to run for parliament during this time, but this ambition was never realized. He moved to London at the end of November, just in time to have a war of words in front of the Court of Directors of the EIC regarding Singapore with Farquhar, who had also arrived in London. Despite several severe charges put upon Raffles, Farquhar was ultimately unable to discredit him and was denied a chance to be restored to Singapore, but he was given a military promotion instead.   With the Singapore matter settled, Raffles turned to his other great hobby - botany. Raffles was a founder (in 1825) and first president (elected April 1826) of the  Zoological Society of London  and the  London Zoo . Meanwhile, he was not only not granted a  pension , but was called to pay over twenty-two thousand pounds sterling for the losses incurred during his administrations. Raffles replied and clarified his actions, and moved to his country estate, Highwood, but before the issue was resolved, he was already much too ill.   He died in London, England, a day before his forty-fifth birthday, on 5 July 1826, of  apoplexy . His estate amounted around ten thousand pounds sterling, which was paid to the Company to cover his outstanding debt. Because of his  anti-slavery  stance, he was refused burial inside his local parish church (St. Mary's,  Hendon ) by the  vicar , whose family had made its money in the slave trade. A brass tablet was finally placed in 1887 and the actual whereabouts of his body was not known until 1914 when it was found in a vault. When the church was extended in the 1920s his tomb was incorporated into the body of the building.     [ edit ]   Coat of Arms   The Blazon of his Armorial Ensigns reads:     ""Or a double headed Eagle displayed Gules charged on the breast with an Eastern Crown on the first, on a Chief Vert pendent from a chain two oval Medallions in Pale the one bearing Arabic characters and the other a dagger in fess the blade wavy the point towards the dexter in relief Or, the said medallions and chain being a representation of a personal decoration called the Order of the Golden Sword conferred upon by him by the Chief or King of Atcheen in Sumatra as a mark of the high regard of the said King and in testimony of the good understanding which had been happily established between that Prince and the British Government; and for a crest out of an Eastern Crown Or a Gryphon's Head Purpure gorged with a collar gemel Gold.""     The  Coat of Arms  has been adapted into the school arms of  Raffles Institution  and  Raffles Junior College . It can also be found as part of a  stained-glass window  in  St. Andrew's Cathedral, Singapore . The motto of the Raffles family is  in cruce triumphans , meaning  triumphing in the cross .

In 1795 Raffles became a clerk for the powerful British East India Company, which (with the support of the British government) was battling with the Dutch for control of Southeast Asia. Raffles flourished, rising to become lieutenant governor of Java in 1811. In 1819 he founded Singapore by purchasing the land for the British East India Company. Singapore became a bustling port and a key element in the expanding British empire, securing Raffles' place in history. (Singapore became an independent state in 1965.) Unlike many empire builders, Raffles is generally remembered fondly, as a benevolent figure who opened doors of opportunity and fought slave trading in the region. Raffles also was an enthusiastic natural historian who founded the London Zoological Society (and along with it the London Zoo). He was knighted in 1817, the same year he published his well-received  History of Java .    Raffles was born at sea, off the coast of Jamaica... The Raffles Hotel in Singapore was opened in 1887 and became one of the world's most famous inns; according to local lore, the Singapore Sling cocktail was invented in the hotel's Long Bar in 1915 by bartender Ngiam Tong Boon.

A man of vision, industry, and feeling, he made incalculable contributions to the knowledge of the Malay Archipelago and to the British overseas empire. Born on July 6, 1781, off the coast of Jamaica on board a ship under the command of his father, Benjamin Raffles, Stamford Raffles became a clerk in the office of the East India Company in London at the age of 14. In 1805 he was sent to Penang to serve as assistant secretary. Prior to his departure he married a widow, Mrs. Olivia Fancourt, who died in 1814. On the trip out, Raffles studied the Malay language intensively, and his  proficiency  in this then little-known language was remarked upon by those who came in contact with him. Three years after his arrival his health broke, and he was sent to Malacca to  recuperate . The East India Company was on the point of abandoning this port, but a report which Raffles prepared and in which he argued the superiority of Malacca over Penang as a potential port persuaded the company to  rescind  its order. Java Annexation Lord Minto, the governor general of India, was so impressed with the report that he called Raffles on 2 months' leave to Calcutta. During his visit Raffles convinced Lord Minto of the necessity of annexing Java, then in French hands, and the governor general appointed him agent to the governor general of the Malay States. Raffles then returned to Malacca and participated in preparations for the attack on Java. In August 1811 a British fleet of some 100 ships with an expeditionary force of about 12,000 men arrived off  Batavia , and the city fell without a struggle. Gen. Janssens retreated to  Semarang  on the north-central coast of Java; in September he capitulated to the British. Lord Minto thereupon appointed Raffles lieutenant general of Java and admonished him, ""While we are in Java, let us do all the good we can."" Raffles introduced numerous reforms, among which were the division of Java into 16 residencies, the introduction of a land tax, and improvements in the legal and judicial system; he also attempted to abolish slavery. He himself regarded his new land-tenure system, which prevented the native rulers from exacting feudal services, as the most solid accomplishment of his administration. The lands which were withdrawn from the control of feudal rulers were leased on a short-term basis at a moderate  rental  and were assessed at the value of two-fifths of the rice crop, with the remainder of the yield free of assessment and the growers  exempt  from personal taxes. In spite of his excellent intentions and  superb  knowledge of the people, their language, and their customs, Raffles was not able to make Java a profitable enterprise. His hope of turning Batavia into the hub of a new British insular empire was dashed, and when the Netherlands regained its independence, Lord Castlereagh vigorously opposed British retention of the Dutch holdings in the East. Raffles sent in a report explaining the great importance of Java to Britain, but his failure to make Java financially viable, together with Britain's desire to  conciliate  the Dutch, militated against a reversal of Lord Castlereagh's decision, and in March 1816 Raffles was removed from office and recalled. The following year he married Sophia Hull in London. His lasting contributions in Java can be seen in the fact that when the Dutch received this island back they adopted many of his reforms. Founding of Singapore In November 1817 Raffles, now Sir Stamford, departed England for Ft. Marlborough (or Benkoelen), in southern Sumatra, where he assumed the residentship of this town. He and Col. R. J. Farquhar, former British resident at  Amboina , were on the  lookout  for a strategically situated way station in the Malay Archipelago which would play in the East the role Malta was playing in the West. On Jan. 28, 1819, they landed on the Island of Singapore and immediately recognized it as ideal for their purpose. They arrived at an agreement with the Sultan of Johore, and on February 6 a treaty was signed marking the establishment of Singapore as a British settlement. Farquhar was installed as its first governor under the supervision of Raffles at Benkoelen. As Charles E. Wurtzburg (1954) wrote, ""It would be difficult to imagine that, had there been no Raffles, there would have been any Singapore."" During the next 4 years four of Raffles's children died in Benkoelen; his health and that of his wife  deteriorated ; and in 1823 he submitted his resignation. Before leaving for England, however, he decided to pay a final visit to Singapore, where he remained 9 months. He planned the city, prepared laws, and laid the foundation of the Singapore Institution, a Malay school. In 1824 Raffles returned to England to face a charge brought against him by the East India Company, which required him to repay to it a substantial sum for salaries and expenses that had been disbursed to him and only years later disallowed by the court of directors. Raffles was endeavoring to arrange payment when he became seriously ill again. On July 5, 1826, less than 3 months after receiving the court's letter demanding  repayment , Raffles died of an  apoplectic  stroke. In his short span of life Raffles had suffered numerous crushing blows which would have felled a lesser man. That he survived them in spite of a less than robust constitution can be explained, in part at least, by his tremendous interest in, and enthusiasm for, every aspect of life in the East. He was, at once, amateur natural scientist, archeologist, Oriental philologist, and reviver and active president of the Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences. An enduring monument to his knowledge and  indefatigable  industry is his famed  History of Java  (2 vols., 1817), which was the first comprehensive work on this subject and, although  outdated , is still regarded as a classic in its field. Further Reading An intimate and contemporary account of Raffles is in Lady Sophia H. Raffles,  Memoir of the Life and Public Services of Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles  (1830; new ed., 2 vols., 1835), which contains many private letters and public dispatches. Although there is no adequate biography of Raffles, the most extensive study is Charles E. Wurtzburg,  Raffles of the Eastern Isles,  edited by Clifford Witting (1954). A very  readable  account, with interesting plates, is Maurice Collis,  Raffles  (1966). The following are less valuable because they make little use of the records in the India Office Library: Demetrius C.

Administrator in the British  East India Company  and founder of Singapore. He joined the British East India Company at age 14, and his hard work won him an appointment as assistant secretary to the government of Penang (in present-day Malaysia). There he undertook an intensive study of the Malayan peoples, and his knowledge allowed him to play a key role in 1811, when the British defeated Dutch-French forces in Java. He subsequently became lieutenant governor there and inaugurated a mass of reforms aimed at transforming the Dutch colonial system and improving the condition of the native population. He was recalled by the company, which deemed his reforms too costly; though he was popular in London (he was knighted in 1816), his authority when he resumed his service in Southeast Asia was severely restricted. Undeterred, he founded the port city of Singapore in 1819 in order to to ensure British access to the China seas; in 1824 the Dutch relinquished all claims to Singapore. Raffles is credited with creating Britain's Far Eastern empire.

Raffles joined the  East India Company  in 1795 and was appointed to Penang, where he rapidly rose to be secretary to the council. In 1810 he was made agent to the Malay states to prepare an invasion of Java, then under the control of the Batavian Republic. He governed Java between 1811 and 1816, instituting far-reaching economic reforms. In 1818 he became lieutenant-governor of Fort Marlborough (Sumatra). Fearing Dutch influence, he persuaded the company to found a settlement at Singapore. He raised the flag there on 2 June 1819 and, by the time of his final return to England in 1824, had established it as an important port.                            Columbia Encyclopedia:       Raffles, Sir Thomas Stamford Bingley,       Home  >  Library  >  Miscellaneous  >  Columbia Encyclopedia - People       17811826, British East Indian administrator. He was one of the founders of Britain's empire in East Asia. Beginning his career (1795) as a clerk in the British East India Company, he was sent to Pinang, Malaya (Malaysia), in 1805 as assistant secretary. Through his knowledge of the Malay language and customs he played a large part in planning the capture of Java from the Dutch. He ruled Java as lieutenant governor (181115) and reduced the power of native princes. Raffles also reorganized the administration, launched reforms in taxation, abolished forced labor and feudal dues, and provided security of land tenure. Recalled (1815) on the eve of Java's restoration to the Dutch, he returned to England, where his  History of Java  (1817) was published. While lieutenant governor of Bencooleen in Sumatra (181823), he introduced coffee and sugar cultivation and established schools. He secured the transfer (1819) of Singapore to the East India Company and initiated policies that contributed greatly to Singapore's vital role in the lucrative China trade. Raffles was outstanding for his liberal attitude toward peoples under colonial rule, his rigorous suppression of the slave trade, and his zeal in collecting historical and scientific information. He played the chief role in founding the Zoological Society of London and was its first president. He was knighted in 1817. Bibliography See biographies by C. E. Wurtzberg (1954) and M.

His father was involved in the  slave trade  in the  Caribbean , and died suddenly when Raffles was fourteen, leaving his family in debt. The younger Raffles immediately started working as a  clerk  in  London  for the  British East India Company , the quasi-government trading company that shaped many of Britain's overseas conquests. In 1805 he was sent to what is now  Penang  in the country of  Malaysia , then called Prince of Wales Island, starting a long association with  Southeast Asia , starting with a post under the Honourable  Philip Dundas , the Governor of Penang.   As he was gazetted assistant secretary to the new Governor of Penang in 1805, he married Olivia Mariamne Devenish, a widow who was formerly married to Jacob Cassivelaun Fancourt, an assistant surgeon in Madras who had died in 1800. It was also at this time that he made acquaintance with Thomas Otho Travers, who would accompany him for the next twenty years.       Java   His knowledge of the  Malay language  as well as his wit and ability, gained him favour with  Lord Minto ,  governor of India , and he was sent to  Malacca . Then, in 1811, after the invasion and annexation of the  Kingdom of Holland  by  France  during Napoleon's war, Raffles had no choice but to leave the country. He mounted a military expedition against the Dutch and French in  Java ,  Indonesia . The war was swiftly conducted by Admiral Robert Stopford, General Wetherhall, and Colonel Gillespie, who led a well-organized army against an army of mostly French conscripts with little proper leadership. The previous Dutch governor,  Herman Willem Daendels , had built a well-defended fortification at  Meester Cornelis  (now  Jatinegara ), and at the time, the governor,  Jan Willem Janssens  (who, coincidentally, surrendered to the British at the  Cape Colony ), mounted a brave but ultimately futile defense at the fortress. The British, led by Colonel Gillespie, stormed the fort and captured it within three hours. Janssens attempted to escape inland but was captured. The British invasion of Java took a total of forty-five days, during which Raffles was appointed the Lieutenant-Governor by Lord Minto before hostilities formally ceased. He took his residence at  Buitenzorg  and despite having a small subset of Britons as his senior staff, he kept many of the Dutch civil servants in the governmental structure. He also negotiated peace and mounted some small military expeditions against local princes to subjugate them to British rule, as well as a takeover of  Bangka Island  to set up a permanent British presence in the area in the case of the return of Java to Dutch rule after the end of the  War of the Sixth Coalition  in Europe.   During his governorship, Raffles introduced partial  self-government , stopped the slave trade, became an early opponent of the  Opium trade  by placing strict limitations upon its importation, much to the dismay of Calcutta, led an expedition to rediscover and restore  Borobudur  and other ancient monuments, and replaced the Dutch forced agriculture system with a  land tenure  system of land management, probably influenced by the earlier writings of Dirk van Hogendorp (1761-1822). He also changed the Dutch colonies to the British system of driving on the left, [ citation needed ] which is why Indonesia drives on the left today.   Under the harsh conditions of the island, Olivia died on  November 26 , 1814, an event that devastated Raffles. In 1815, he left again for England after the island of Java was returned to control of the Netherlands following the  Napoleonic Wars , under the terms of the  Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814 , but not before he was officially replaced by  John Fendall  on account of the poor financial performance of the colony during his administration, as deemed by the successors of Lord Minto in Calcutta. He sailed to England in early 1816 to clear his name, and en route, visited  Napoleon , who was in exile at  St. Helena , but found him unpleasant and unimpressive.       Interlude in England          Raffles in 1817       In 1817, Raffles wrote and published a book entitled  History of Java , describing the history of the island from ancient times. In 1817 he was knighted by the prince regent, whose daughter,  Princess Charlotte , was particularly close to him. At the publication of the book, he also stopped using the name ""Thomas"", preferring to use his middle name, ""Stamford"", possibly to avoid confusion amongst his associates with Sir Thomas Sevestre or his cousin who bore the same name. On  22 February , he married his second wife, Sophia Hull.   He was appointed as the Governor-General of Bencoolen (now  Bengkulu ) on  15 October , 1817, and set sail to take the post with his new wife.       Bencoolen (Bengkulu) and Malaya   Raffles arrived in Bencoolen ( Bengkulu ) on  19 March , 1818. Despite the prestige connected with the title, Bencoolen was a colonial backwater whose only real export was pepper and only the murder of a previous Resident, Thomas Parr, gained it any attention back home in Britain. Raffles found the place wretched, and set about reforms immediately, mostly similar to what he had done in Java - abolishing slavery and limiting cockfighting and such games. To replace the slaves, he used a contingent of  convicts , already sent to him from India. It is at this point when he realized the importance of a British presence that both challenged the Dutch hegemony in the area and could remain consistently profitable, unlike Bencoolen or Batavia. However, the strategic importance of poorly-maintained but well-positioned  British possessions  such as Penang or Bencoolen made it impossible for the British to abandon such unprofitable colonies in such close proximity to the Dutch in Java. The competition in the area, between Raffles and the aggressive Dutch  de jure  Governor, Elout, certainly led at least in part to the later  Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 . Raffles looked into alternatives in the area - namely Bangka, which had been ceded to the Dutch after its conquest by the British during its occupation of Java.   Bintan  was also under consideration. Despite the fact that  Warren Hastings  overlooked the island before settling upon Penang in 1786, the  Riau Archipelago  was an attractive choice just to the south of the  Malay Peninsula , for its proximity to  Malacca . In his correspondences with Calcutta, Raffles also emphasized the need to establish a certain amount of influence with the native chiefs, which had greatly waned since the return of the Dutch. Raffles sent Thomas Travers as an ambassador to the Dutch, to possibly negotiate an expansion of British economic interests. When this failed, and when Raffles' own expeditions into his new dominion found only treacherous terrain and few exportable goods, his desire to establish a better British presence was cemented.   However, the Anglo-Dutch Convention of 1814 was not completely clear, especially on the issue of certain possessions such as  Padang . The Convention of 1814 only returned Dutch territory that was held before 1803, which did not include Padang. Raffles asserted the British claim personally, leading a small expedition to the  Sultanate of Minangkabau . Yet, as Raffles confirmed with the sultan regarding the absolute British influence of the area, he realized that the local rulers had only limited power over the well-cultivated and civilized country, and the treaty was largely symbolic and had little actual force.       The founding of Singapore          Statue of Sir Stamford Raffles in Singapore, based on the original by  Thomas Woolner       Meanwhile, Major  William Farquhar , the  British Resident  of Malacca, had been attempting to negotiate  commercial treaties  with the local chiefs of the Riau Archipelago, especially with the heads of the  Sultanate of Johore . Due to the death and subsequent turmoil of the sultanate at the time of Farquhar's arrival, Farquhar was compelled to sign the treaty not with the official head of the sultanate, but rather, the Raja Muda (Regent or Crown Prince) of Riau. Noting it as a success and reporting it as such back to Raffles, Raffles sailed to Malacca in late 1818 to personally secure a British presence in the Riau area, especially  Singapura , which was favored by him both through the readings of Malayan histories and by Farquhar's explorations.   Despite  Lord Hastings'  less-than-stellar opinion of Raffles before (which had necessitated his trip to England to clear his name at the end of his tenure as Governor-General of Java), the now well-connected and successful Raffles was able to secure the permission to set up a settlement where in  Malaysian history  the name  Lion City  was applied and was in a strategically advantageous position. However, he was not to provoke the Dutch, and his actions were officially disavowed. Despite the best efforts in London by authorities such as the  Viscount Castlereagh  to quell Dutch fears and the continuing efforts to reach an agreement between the nations that eventually became the  Anglo-Dutch Treaty  of London of 1824, as well as to send instructions to Raffles to undertake far less intrusive actions, the distance between the Far East and Europe had meant that the orders had no chance of reaching Raffles in time for his venture to begin.       Singapore       Establishment   After a brief survey of the  Karimun Islands , on  29 January   1819 , he established a post at the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula. It was established that there was no Dutch presence on the island of Singapore. Johore also no longer  "

Small and sickly, impoverished as a boy, a clerk at age 14, he rose to become one of the great leaders of the British Empire, to end slavery wherever he encountered it, to discover an ancient hidden mountain carved with statues and to found Singapore.               Stamford Raffles               Stamford Raffles loved to learn and he liked to work hard and that brought him his first piece of good luck. In 1805 the British East India Company made him assistant secretary in Penang, and quintupled his salary.                One week later Raffles married.               She was ""a Madras assistant surgeon's penniless widow, of Irish and possibly Indian extraction, who was ten years his senior but strikingly beautiful, vivacious, and intelligent."" Raffles' meagre schooling had left him with a passion for acquiring knowledge. On the honeymoon voyage he taught himself Malay and embarked on a lifetime study of the history, flora, and fauna of the Malay region.         Adventures in Penang and Java         When he was a young man Raffles had an uncanny ability to make setback a step forward. Working three jobs in Penang, he fell ill under the strain and was sent to Melaka to recuperate. He arrived just in time to prevent the city from being demolished. Sailing to Calcutta in hopes of advancing his career, Raffles was rebuffed in his hopes for a better job. But Governor-General Lord Minto named him his agent in preparation for the Java campaign.       Raffles did a brilliant job, and won over the sultan of Palembang (Oxford DNB).                Finding the hidden mountain          The invasion was a success, and Raffles was unexpectedly named lieutenant-governor, with far-reaching powers.                  He immediately began to dismantle the Dutch system of monopoly and forced labour, remodelled the judicial administration and introduced a jury system.        He travelled all over Java to gather information about the island's history, languages, and products, and was meticulous in respecting local culture. He hired scientists to study the flora and fauna and to send specimens to London. Like him, they were fearless in the face of malaria.        Raffles had heard  of a lost mountain covered with sculptures, centuries old and        buried under volcanic ash and jungle vegetation. Thirty years old, he sent out an expedition to find and excavate the great monument in central Java.  Borobudur  is an astonishing, 8th-century stone mountain - two million cubic feet of fine-grained, mellow gray stone carved to illustrate the Buddhas life and teachings. Its concentric terraces are lined with more than a mile of continuous sculpture, not including 504 life-size statues of the Buddha.                 Borobudur                  Image: Copyright Jan Egil Kirkebø,  Travel Earth                            In 1814 Raffles was heartbroken by the death of his wife, and he was accused of making Java less profitable than it had been under the Dutch. Since he had ended the practice of forced labour without compensation this charge contained some truth. Then in 1815 world politics intervened.               A new treaty called for handing Java back to the Dutch. Raffles fought it, was accused of  persevering imprudence  and was ordered to take a post in Sumatra.        But Raffles was his own man. He sailed to London first, fought the personal charges of malfeasance against him and was cleared, wrote and published a two-volume history which introduced Java to the world, was knighted, became a member of the Royal Society and  married for a second time. He accomplished all this in less than two years. In November 1817 Raffles and Sophia embarked for Sumatra and Bencoolen. Their first child was born at sea.        Malaria, chaos, slavery                Raffles's arrival at malaria-ridden Fort Marlborough on 22 March 1818 was sobering. Recent earthquakes had destroyed most buildings, the administration was in chaos, pepper production (which represented Bencoolen's sole livelihood) was hardly alive, and, to Raffles' horror, the East India Company had slaves.          He immediately freed them, prohibited gambling, and set about reorganizing the administration, improving pepper production, and introducing an enlightened convict labour system. He also arranged for a botanist to take Sophia and himself on an arduous exploration of central Sumatra.          Dream of a city          Two flowers which he discovered bear his name -  Rafflesia arnoldi  and  Nepenthes rafflesiana  - as do several birds, a fish and a spider.                  However, Raffles' main object was to protect free trade.         This required ingenuity, negotiating treaties with various local rulers and the brilliant stroke of founding the city of Singapore. Raffles expected that the Dutch would oppose his efforts. That he was also undermined by British bureaucrats was a little disappointing.                 He laid down the rules for governing Singapore in 1819 before returning to Bencoolen. Unfortunately the East India Company's military administrator was not up to the job. Meanwhile, in Bencoolen, Raffles and Sophia lost three of their four children to illness. They made plans to return to Britain, but before he did, Raffles was determined to pay a last visit to Singapore.                   Saving Singapore          On arrival he was dismayed by the distinct lack of interest in enforcing the rule of law. Despite blinding headaches, Raffles stripped the military commandment of his office, took over as resident and laid down permanent principles for the island city-state -          Absolute freedom of trade was declared a permanent principle, not merely a temporary expedient to build up commerce.          Supported by a committee comprising European officials and merchants, with representatives of the various Asian ethnic groups, Raffles drew up a town plan and resettled a large part of the population according to their different communities.          He established a magistracy administering English law, with Malay social custom where appropriate for the indigenous people.          Prohibiting slave trading, he provided for existing debt slaves to work off their obligations in five years.         He banned the carrying of arms, gambling, and cock-fighting outright, and introduced deterrent taxation on. . .alcohol and opium. (Oxford DNB)          Raffles also founded a university (now the University of Singapore) with generous donations  and a pledge for annual funding from the East India Company. His ideal was to revive Asian cultures in alliance with the best of Western tradition.               Escaping fire, going home, starting the London zoo, going broke          On their return to London, Raffles and Sophia barely escaped a fire on board their ship. The inferno destroyed all their worldly possessions.          Thousands of botanical and zoological collections, Raffles' notes on the history of Sumatra and Singapore and irreplaceable scientific papers, drawings and paintings were lost.               Back in Britain with his wife and only surviving child, and still hopeful, Raffles became a farmer.          In 1826 Raffles was elected the first president of the Zoological Society and began plans for the London Zoo.                  That same year a bank failure took his remaining capital. The East India Company recognized all that he had done, and the soundness of his administration, but demanded that he pay them thousands of pounds in alleged overpayments, and denied him his pension.               A month later, one day before his 45th birthday, Sophia found Raffles lying dead at the foot of the stairs. He had been felled by a brain tumour.               His most enduring monument was Singapore. Under the rule of law and free trade the smallest nation in Southeast Asia has become the 6th wealthiest country in the world in terms of per capita GDP.                The first statue to Raffles in Singapore was erected by the British. The second statue was erected by the people of Singapore. Museums, hospitals, schools, hotels and the famous club bear his name.                        When you contribute to this website,         you support Brits at their Best.

The  Great Wall of China  ( simplified Chinese :   ;  traditional Chinese :   ;  pinyin : Chngchng; literally ""long city/fortress"") or ( simplified Chinese :   ;  traditional Chinese :   ;  pinyin : Wnl Chngchng; literally ""The long wall of 10,000  Li  ()"" [ 1 ] ) is a series of stone and earthen  fortifications  in  China , built, rebuilt, and maintained between the 5th century BC and the 16th century to protect the northern borders of the  Chinese Empire  from  Xiongnu  attacks during the rule of  successive dynasties . Several walls, referred to as the Great Wall of China, were built since the 5th century BC. One of the most famous is the wall built between 220206 BC by the first  Emperor of China ,  Qin Shi Huang ; little of it remains; it was much farther north than the current wall, which was built during the  Ming Dynasty . [ 2 ]   The Great Wall stretches over approximately 6,400 km (4,000 miles) [ 3 ]  from  Shanhaiguan  in the east to  Lop Nur  in the west, along an arc that roughly delineates the southern edge of  Inner Mongolia , but stretches to over 6,700 km (4,160 miles) in total. [ 4 ]  At its peak, the  Ming  Wall was guarded by more than one million men. [ 5 ]  It has been estimated that somewhere in the range of 2 to 3 million Chinese died as part of the centuries-long project of building the wall.

During the  Warring States Period  from the 5th century BC to 221 BC, the states of  Qi ,  Yan  and  Zhao  all constructed extensive fortifications to defend their own borders. Built to withstand the attack of small arms such as swords and spears, these walls were made mostly by stamping earth and gravel between board frames.  Qin Shi Huang  conquered all opposing states and unified China in 221 BC, establishing the  Qin Dynasty . Intending to impose centralized rule and prevent the resurgence of feudal lords, he ordered the destruction of the wall sections that divided his empire along the former state borders. To protect the empire against intrusions by the  Xiongnu  people from the north, he ordered the building of a new wall to connect the remaining fortifications along the empire's new northern frontier. Transporting the large quantity of materials required for construction was difficult, so builders always tried to use local resources. Stones from the mountains were used over mountain ranges, while  rammed earth  was used for construction in the plains. There are no surviving historical records indicating the exact length and course of the Qin Dynasty walls. Most of the ancient walls have eroded away over the centuries, and very few sections remain today. Later, the  Han ,  Sui ,  Northern  and  Jin  dynasties all repaired, rebuilt, or expanded sections of the Great Wall at great cost to defend themselves against northern invaders.   The Great Wall concept was revived again during the  Ming Dynasty  following the Ming army's defeat by the  Oirats  in the  Battle of Tumu  in 1449. The Ming had failed to gain a clear upper-hand over the  Manchurian  and  Mongolian  tribes after successive battles, and the long-drawn conflict was taking a toll on the empire. The Ming adopted a new strategy to keep the  nomadic  tribes out by constructing walls along the northern border of China. Acknowledging the Mongol control established in the  Ordos Desert , the wall followed the desert's southern edge instead of incorporating the bend of the  Huang He .          Photograph of the Great Wall in 1907       Unlike the earlier Qin fortifications, the Ming construction was stronger and more elaborate due to the use of  bricks  and stone instead of rammed earth. As  Mongol raids  continued periodically over the years, the Ming devoted considerable resources to repair and reinforce the walls. Sections near the Ming capital of  Beijing  were especially strong. [ 7 ]   Towards the end of the Ming Dynasty, the Great Wall helped defend the empire against the  Manchu  invasions that began around 1600. Under the military command of  Yuan Chonghuan , the Ming army held off the Manchus at the heavily fortified  Shanhaiguan  pass, preventing the Manchus from entering the Chinese heartland. The Manchus were finally able to cross the Great Wall in 1644, when the gates at Shanhaiguan were opened by  Wu Sangui , a Ming border general who disliked the activities of rulers of the  Shun Dynasty . The Manchus quickly seized Beijing, and defeated the newly founded Shun Dynasty and remaining Ming resistance, to establish the  Qing Dynasty .   Under Qing rule, China's borders extended beyond the walls and  Mongolia  was annexed into the empire, so construction and repairs on the Great Wall were discontinued.     Notable areas          An area of the sections of the Great Wall at  Jinshanling                     The following three sections are in Beijing municipality, which were renovated and which are regularly visited by modern tourists today.     ""North Pass"" of  Juyongguan  pass, known as the  Badaling . When used by the Chinese to protect their land, this section of the wall has had many guards to defend Chinas capital Beijing. Made of stone and bricks from the hills, this portion of the Great Wall is 7.8 meters (25.6 ft) high and 5 meters (16.4 ft) wide.       ""West Pass"" of  Jiayuguan (pass) . This fort is near the western edges of the Great Wall.       ""Pass"" of  Shanhaiguan . This fort is near the eastern edges of the Great Wall.       One of the most striking sections of the Ming Great Wall is where it climbs extremely steep slopes. It runs 11 kilometers (7 mi) long, ranges from 5 to 8 meters (1626 ft) in height, and 6 meters (19.7 ft) across the bottom, narrowing up to 5 meters (16.4 ft) across the top. Wangjinglou is one of  Jinshanling 's 67  watchtowers , 980 meters (3,215 ft) above sea level.   South East of  Jinshanling , is the  Mutianyu  Great Wall which winds along lofty, cragged mountains from the southeast to the northwest for approximately 2.25 kilometers (about 1.3 miles). It is connected with Juyongguan Pass to the west and Gubeikou to the east.   25 km west of the Liao Tian Ling stands of part of Great wall which is only 2~3 stories high. According to the records of Lin Tian, the wall was not only extremely short compared to others, but it appears to be silver. Archeologists explain that the wall appears to be silver because the stone they used were from Shan Xi, where many mines are found. The stone contains extremely high metal in it causing it to appear silver. However, due to years of decay of the Great Wall, it is hard to see the silver part of the wall today.     Another notable section lies near the eastern extremity of the wall, where the first pass of the Great Wall was built on the  Shanhaiguan  (known as the Number One Pass Under Heaven), the first mountain the Great Wall climbs. Jia Shan is also here, as is the Jiumenkou, which is the only portion of the wall that was built as a bridge. Shanhaiguan Great Wall is called the Museum of the Construction of the Great Wall, because of the Meng Jiang-Nu Temple, built during the  Song Dynasty .     Characteristics          The Great Wall on an 1805 map       Before the use of bricks, the Great Wall was mainly built from  Earth or Taipa , stones, and wood.   During the Ming Dynasty, however, bricks were heavily used in many areas of the wall, as were materials such as  tiles ,  lime , and stone. The size and weight of the bricks made them easier to work with than earth and stone, so construction quickened. Additionally, bricks could bear more weight and endure better than rammed earth. Stone can hold under its own weight better than brick, but is more difficult to use. Consequently, stones cut in rectangular shapes were used for the foundation, inner and outer  brims , and  gateways  of the wall.  Battlements  line the uppermost portion of the vast majority of the wall, with defensive gaps a little over 30 cm (one foot) tall, and about 23 cm (9 inches) wide.     Condition          The Great Wall at  Mutianyu , near  Beijing              The Great Wall in fog       While some portions north of Beijing and near tourist centers have been preserved and even reconstructed, in many locations the Wall is in disrepair. Those parts might serve as a village playground or a source of stones to rebuild houses and roads. [ 8 ]  Sections of the Wall are also prone to  graffiti  and  vandalism . Parts have been destroyed because the Wall is in the way of construction. [ 9 ]  No comprehensive survey of the wall has been carried out, so it is not possible to say how much of it survives, especially in remote areas. Intact or repaired portions of the Wall near developed tourist areas are often frequented by sellers of tourist  kitsch .   More than 60 kilometres (37 mi) of the wall in  Gansu  province may disappear in the next 20 years, due to erosion from  sandstorms . In places, the height of the wall has been reduced from more than five meters (16.4 ft) to less than two meters. The square lookout towers that characterize the most famous images of the wall have disappeared completely. Many western sections of the wall are  constructed from mud , rather than brick and stone, and thus are more susceptible to erosion. [ 10 ]     Watchtowers and barracks          Watchtower       Communication between the army units along the length of the Great Wall, including the ability to call reinforcements and warn  garrisons  of enemy movements, was of high importance. Signal towers were built upon hill tops or other high points along the wall for their visibility.     Visibility from space          The Great Wall of China as seen in a  false-color  radar image from the  Space Shuttle , taken in April 1994         Visibility from the moon   Popular beliefs ranging from  Ripley's Believe It or Not! ' s cartoons from 1930s, which claimed that the Great Wall is ""the mightiest work of man, the only one that would be visible to the human eye from the moon,"" to  Richard Halliburton 's 1938 book  Second Book of Marvels  which makes a similar claim, have persisted, assuming  urban legend  status, and sometimes even appeared in school textbooks. Arthur Waldron, author of  The Great Wall of China: From History to Myth , has speculated that the belief might go back to the fascination with the  ""canals""  once believed to exist on  Mars .   One of the earliest known reference to this myth appears in a letter written in 1754 by the English antiquary  William Stukeley . Stukeley wrote that, ""This mighty wall of four score miles in length ( Hadrian's Wall ) is only exceeded by the Chinese Wall, which makes a considerable figure upon the  terrestrial globe , and may be discerned at the moon."" [ 11 ]   The Great Wall is a maximum 9.1m (30 ft) wide and is about the same color as the soil surrounding it. Based on the optics of resolving power (distance versus the width of the iris: a few millimetres for the human eye, metres for large telescopes) an object of reasonable contrast to its surroundings some 70 miles in diameter (1 arc-minute) would be visible to the unaided eye from the moon, whose average distance from Earth is 384,393 km (238,857 miles). The Great Wall is of course not a disc but more like a threadit can be seen from much further than would be possible if it were simply a 30 foot disc. Still, the apparent width of the Great Wall from the moon is the same as that of a human hair viewed from 2 miles away. To see the wall from the moon would require spatial resolution  17,000 times  better than normal (20/20) vision. [ 12 ]  Not surprisingly, no lunar astronaut has ever claimed seeing the Great Wall from the moon.   Incidentally, if it were possible to see the Great Wall from the moon, one ought to be able to see many of the world's highways as well, given that many surpass the Great Wall in width and brightness.     Visibility from low earth orbit   A more controversial question is whether the Wall is visible from  low earth orbit , i.e an altitude of as little as 100 miles (160 km).  NASA  claims that it is barely visible, and only under nearly perfect conditions; it is no more conspicuous than many other man-made objects. [ 13 ]  Other authors have argued that due to limitations of the optics of the eye and the spacing of  photoreceptors  on the  retina , it is impossible to see the wall with the naked eye, even from low orbit, and would require visual acuity of 20/3 (7.7 times better than normal). [ 12 ]     Anecdotal reports   Astronaut  William Pogue  thought he had seen it from  Skylab  but discovered he was actually looking at the  Grand Canal of China  near Beijing. He spotted the Great Wall with  binoculars , but said that ""it wasn't visible to the unaided eye."" U.S. Senator  Jake Garn  claimed to be able to see the Great Wall with the naked eye from a  space shuttle  orbit in the early 1980s, but his claim has been disputed by several U.S. astronauts. Veteran U.S. astronaut  Gene Cernan  has stated: ""At Earth orbit of 100 miles (160 km) to 200 miles (320 km) high, the Great Wall of China is, indeed, visible to the naked eye.""  Ed Lu ,  Expedition 7  Science Officer aboard the  International Space Station , adds that, ""it's less visible than a lot of other objects. And you have to know where to look.""   In October 2003, Chinese astronaut  Yang Liwei  stated that he had not been able to see the Great Wall of China. In response, the  European Space Agency  (ESA) issued a press release reporting that from an orbit between 160 and 320 km, the Great Wall is visible to the naked eye. In an attempt to further clarify things, the ESA published a picture of a part of the Great Wall photographed from Space. However, in a press release a week later (no longer available in the ESAs website), they acknowledged that the ""Great Wall"" in the picture was actually a river.          Topographic maps put together showing the location of the eastern parts of the wall between the  Yellow River  and the  Bohai Sea .       Neil Armstrong  stated about the view from  Apollo 11 : ""I do not believe that, at least with my eyes, there would be any man-made object that I could see. I have not yet found somebody who has told me they've seen the Wall of China from Earth orbit. ...I've asked various people, particularly Shuttle guys, that have been many orbits around China in the daytime, and the ones I've talked to didn't see it. [ 14 ]   Leroy Chiao , a  Chinese-American  astronaut, took a photograph from the  International Space Station  that shows the wall. It was so indistinct that the photographer was not certain he had actually captured it. Based on the photograph, the  China Daily  later reported that the Great Wall can be seen from space with the naked eye, under favorable viewing conditions, if one knows exactly where to look.

With numerous additions and modifications during their history, they were the last great  fortification  system of Antiquity, and one of the most complex and elaborate systems ever built.   Initially built by Constantine the Great, the walls surrounded the new city on all sides, protecting it against attack from both sea and land. As the city grew, the famous double line of the Theodosian Walls was built in the 5th century. Although the other sections of the walls were less elaborate, when well manned, they were almost impregnable for any medieval besieger, saving the city, and the  Byzantine Empire  with it, during sieges from the  Avars ,  Arabs ,  Rus' , and  Bulgars , among others (see  Sieges of Constantinople ). The advent of  gunpowder  siege cannons rendered the fortifications less impregnable, although the end of the final siege, leading to the  fall of Constantinople  to the  Ottomans  on  May 29th   1453 , seems to have come about because some Ottoman troops gained entrance through a gateway, rather than because the walls had been broken down.   The walls were largely maintained intact during most of the Ottoman period, until sections began to be dismantled in the 19th century, as the city outgrew its medieval boundaries. Despite the subsequent lack of maintenance, many parts of the walls survived and are still standing today.

At the time the city consisted of an  acropolis  and little more. Byzantium, despite being a prosperous trading post, was relatively unimportant during the Roman period, but featured prominently in the civil war between  Septimius Severus  and  Pescennius Niger , holding out a Severan siege for three years (193-96 AD). As punishment, Severus had the strong walls demolished and the city deprived of its status. [ 1 ]  However, appreciating the city's strategic importance, he rebuilt and endowed the city with many monuments (including the  Hippodrome ) and a new set of walls, increasing its area. No details are known of the Severan Wall, except its general course and that its main gate was located shortly before the entrance of the later Forum of Constantine. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Wall of Constantine   When Constantine the Great moved the capital of the  Empire  to Byzantium, which he refounded as Constantinopolis, ""City of Constantine"", he greatly expanded the new city by building a new wall about 2.8 km (15  stadia ) westwards of the Severan wall and incorporating even more territory. [ 3 ] [ 4 ]  Constantine's fortification consisted of a single wall, reinforced with towers at regular distances, which began to be constructed in 324 and was completed under  Constantius II . [ 5 ]  The approximate course of the wall is known, running from the area of the Plateia Gate of the Golden Horn sea walls to near the Gate of St. Aemilianus on the Propontis walls (see section on the Sea Walls below). The wall survived during much of the Byzantine period, even though it was replaced by the Theodosian Walls as the city's primary defence; it still stood when  Justinian  ascended the throne, but only the Old Golden Gate, often attributed to Constantine but of uncertain age, still survived to late Byzantine times, until destroyed by an earthquake in 1509. [ 6 ]  The gate, known by chroniclers as the ""Gate of Attalos"", was described by the late Byzantine scholar  Manuel Chrysoloras  as being built of ""wide marble blocks with a lofty opening"", and crowned by a kind of  stoa . In earlier centuries, it was decorated with many statues, including one of Constantine, which fell down in an earthquake in 740. In late Byzantine times, a painting of the  Crucifixion  was placed on the gate, leading to its Ottoman name,  sakapi  (""Gate of Jesus""). [ 6 ]   Already by the early 5th century however, Constantinople had expanded outside the Constantinian Wall, in the extramural area known as the  Exokionion . [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Theodosian Walls          Restored section of the Theodosian Walls at the Selymbria Gate. The Outer Wall and the wall of the moat are visible, with a tower of the Inner Wall in the background.       In 408, during the reign of  Emperor   Theodosius II , construction began on a new wall, about 1,500 m to the west of the old, which stretched for 5,630 meters between the  Sea of Marmara  and the suburb of  Blachernae  near the  Golden Horn . [ 8 ]  The new wall, which, despite the fact that construction commenced when the Emperor was seven years old, became known as the  Theodosian Wall  ( Greek   Theodosianon Teichos ). The wall was built under the direction of  Anthemius , the  Praetorian prefect of the East , and completed in 413. [ 9 ]  The walls stretched for about 5.5 km from south to north, from the Marble Tower, Turkish  Mermer Kule  (in Greek  Pyrgos Vasileiou kai Knstantinou , ""Tower of  Basil  and  Constantine "") on the  Propontis  coast to the Blachernae, ending at about the area of the  Palace of the Porphyrogenitus  (known in  Turkish  as  Tekfur Saray ), where they adjoined the later walls of Blachernae. New Rome now enclosed seven hills and justified the appellation  Eptalofos , like Old  Rome . On  November 6 ,  447 , however, a powerful earthquake destroyed large parts of the wall, and Theodosius II ordered the  urban prefect   Cyrus of Panopolis  (sometimes referred to as Constantine) to supervise the urgent repairs, as the city was threatened at the time by  Attila the Hun . Cyrus employed the city's  dmoi  (more widely known as "" Circus  factions"") in the work, and succeeded in restoring the walls within 60 days, as testified in two inscriptions in Greek and Latin on the Mevlevihane Gate. [ 8 ]  At the same time, a second outer wall was added, and a wide  ditch  opened in front of the walls. [ 10 ]     [ edit ]   Construction          The Second Military Gate or Gate of Belgrade       The walls were built in two lines of defense, which adjoined the ditch. The main Inner Wall (   ,  Es Teichos  or  Mega Teichos , ""Great Wall"") is a solid structure, 5 meters thick and 12 meters high. It is faced with carefully cut limestone blocks, while its core is filled with mortar made of lime and crushed bricks. Between seven and eleven bands of  brick , ca. 40 cm thick, traverse the structure, not only as a form of decoration, but also strengthening the cohesion of the structure by bonding the stone faade with the mortar core, and increasing endurance to  earthquakes . [ 11 ]  The wall was strengthened with 96 towers, mainly square but also octagonal or hexagonal, 18-20 meters tall, and placed at intervals of 55 meters. [ 12 ]  Each tower had a battlemented terrace on the top. Its interior was usually divided by a floor in two chambers. The lower chamber, which opened to the city, was used for storage, while the upper one could be entered from the wall's walkway, and had windows for view and for firing projectiles. Access to the wall was provided by large ramps along their side. [ 13 ]   The Outer Wall (   ,  Ex Teichos  or  Proteichisma ) was built 1520 metres from the main wall, creating a space between the two walls called  perivolos . The Outer Wall was 2 metres thick at its base, and featured arched chambers on the level of the  perivolos , crowned with a battlemented walkway, reaching a height of 8.5 meters. [ 14 ]  Access to the Outer Wall from the city was provided either through the main gates or through small  posterns  on the base of the Inner Wall's towers. The Outer Wall likewise had 96 towers, square or crescent-shaped, situated midway between the Inner Wall's towers, and acting in supporting role to them. [ 13 ]  They featured a room with windows on the level of the  perivolos , crowned by a battlemented terrace, while their lower portions were either solid or featured small posterns, which allowed access to the outer terrace. [ 14 ]  The Outer Wall was a formidable defensive edifice in its own right: in the sieges of 1422 and 1453, the Byzantines and their allies, being too few to hold the both lines of wall, concentrated on the defense of the Outer Wall. [ 15 ]   The moat ( souda ) was situated at a distance of about 15 metres from the Outer Wall, creating a terrace called  parateichion , where a paved road ran along the walls' length. The moat itself was about 20 metres wide and 10 metres deep, featuring a 1.5 metre tall  crenellated  wall on the inner side, serving as a first line of defence. Transverse walls in the moat allowed it to be flooded and retain water even though the walls followed the rise of the land. [ 16 ]     [ edit ]   Gates          Detailed course and description of the Land Walls (from south to north), after van Millingen       The wall contained 8 main gates and a number of smaller posterns. The main public gates led across the moat on bridges, while the secondary gates, traditionally called ""Military Gates"", led to the outer sections of the walls. It must be noted however that this division is mostly a matter of historiographical convention, as there is sufficient evidence that several of the secondary gates were also used by civilian traffic, [ 17 ]  and indeed, the very accuracy of the division between civilian and ""military"" gates has been questioned. [ 18 ]   The exact identification of several gates is a debatable, both because the Byzantine chroniclers provide more names than the number of the gates and because of the inadequate information provided by literary and archaeological sources. In order, from south to north, these gates were:     [ edit ]   Golden Gate   The Golden Gate ( Greek :    ,  Latin :  Porta Aurea ,  Turkish :  Altnkap  or  Yaldzlkap ), was the main state entrance into the capital, used especially for the occasions of a  triumphal  return of victorious emperors from battle. [ 19 ]  The Gate was used for triumphal entries until the Komnenian period; thereafter, the only such occasion was the entry of  Michael VIII Palaiologos  into the city on  15 August   1261 , after its reconquest from the  Latins . [ 20 ]   Originally, the Golden Gate was a  triumphal arch , erected in ca. 388, during the reign of  Theodosius I , to celebrate his victory over  Magnus Maximus . At that time it stood alone, well outside the Constantinian Wall, straddling the  Via Egnatia . [ 20 ]  It is architecturally elaborate, built of large square blocks of polished  marble  fitted together without cement, with three arches, and was decorated with numerous sculptures, including a bronze elephant-drawn  quadriga  on top, echoing the  Porta Triumphalis  of Rome. [ 21 ]  The gates themselves were originally plated in gold, whence their name derives. In 965 however,  Nikephoros II Phokas  installed the captured bronze city gates of  Mopsuestia  in their place. [ 22 ]   When the gate was incorporated into the Theodosian Walls, an outer gate was added, which in later centuries was flanked by an ensemble of reused marble reliefs in two tiers. According to descriptions of English travelers from the 17th century, these reliefs featured mythological scenes. These reliefs, lost since the 17th century, were probably put in place in the 9th or 10th centuries to form the appearance of a triumphal gate. [ 23 ]  According to other descriptions, the outer gate was also topped by a statue of  Victory , holding a crown. [ 24 ]   After the Ottoman conquest, the  Yedikule Fortress  was erected behind the gate complex. Since the main Gates were usually kept closed, a small postern exists after the Fort (between towers 11 and 12), the so-called  Yedikule Kaps , which was used for everyday traffic. The Golden Gate was emulated by the  Kievan Rus' , who built monumental city gates named ""Golden Gate"" at  Kiev  and  Vladimir .     [ edit ]   Second Military Gate   The Second Military Gate or  Xylokerkos Gate  (   ) lay between towers 22 and 23. [ 25 ]  Its second name derives from the fact that it led to a wooden  circus  (amphitheatre) outside the walls. [ 26 ]  Its is known today as  Belgrade  Gate  ( Belgrad Kaps ), after the Serbian artisans settled there by Sultan  Suleyman the Magnificent  after he conquered Belgrade in 1521. According to a story related by  Niketas Choniates , in 1189 the gate was walled off by Emperor  Isaac II Angelos , because according to a prophecy, it was this gate that Western Emperor  Frederick Barbarossa  would enter the city through. [ 27 ]  It was re-opened in 1346 [ 28 ]  but closed again before the siege of 1453, and remained closed until 1886.     [ edit ]   Gate of the Spring   The Gate of the Spring or Pg Gate (    ) was named so after a monastery outside the Walls, the  Zodochos Pg  ("" Life-giving Spring "") in the modern suburb of Balkl. Also known as the  Gate of Melantias  ( Porta Melantiados ) because there the old highway from the town of Melantias entered the city, and is possibly the so-called  Gate of Kalagros  (    ). In Turkish, it is known as the  Selymbria  Gate  ( Silivri Kaps ). It lies between towers 35 and 36, which were extensively rebuilt in later Byzantine times, while the gate arch itself was replaced in Ottoman times. [ 29 ]   It was through this gate that the forces of the  Empire of Nicaea , under General  Alexios Strategopoulos  entered and retook the city from the Latins on  25 July   1261 . [ 30 ]     [ edit ]   Third Military Gate   This gate lies shortly after the Pege Gate, exactly before the C-shaped section of the walls known as the ""Sigma"", between towers 39 and 40. It has no Turkish name, and is of middle or late Byzantine construction. The corresponding opening in the outer wall preserved until the early 20th century, but has since disappeared. [ 31 ]     [ edit ]   Gate of Rhegion   The  Gate of Rhegion  (    ), modern  Yeni Mevlevihane Kaps , was located between towers 50 and 51 and named after the suburb of Rhegion. [ 32 ]  It was also called     (""Gate of the Reds""), because it had been repaired in 447 by the  dmos  of the Reds ( Rousioi ).     [ edit ]   Gate of St. Romanus   The gate (    ), named so after a nearby church, was earlier known as the  Fourth Military Gate . It lies between towers 59 and 60, and with a gatehouse of 26,5 m, it is the second-largest gate after the Golden Gate. Between the Gate of St. Romanus and the Gate of Charisius lay the so-called  Mesoteichion  (""Middle Wall""), a stretch of walls with a length of 1,250 metres. It was considered as the weakest part of the walls, [ 15 ]  because the ground descended towards the valley of the Lycus stream, as a result of which the walls lay lower than the opposing slopes. It was here that Mehmed II had placed most of his artillery, and much of this portion of the walls lies still in ruins today.     [ edit ]   Topkapi   The gate known in Turkish as  Topkap , the ""Cannon Gate"", lies shortly after the Gate of St Romanus, between towers 65 and 66. Its name comes from the great cannon (the "" Basilic "") that was placed opposite it during the 1453 siege. This gate was earlier identified as the ""civil"" Gate of St Romanus. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Fifth Military Gate   The Fifth Military Gate (    ) lies to the north of the Lycus stream, between towers 77 and 78. It is also identified with the Byzantine Gate of St Kyriake, [ 15 ]  and called  Sulukulekap  or  Hcum Kaps , the ""Assault Gate"", in Turkish, because there the decisive breakthrough was achieved on the morning of  May 29 ,  1453 .     [ edit ]   Gate of Charisius          The restored Gate of Charisius or Adrianople Gate, where Sultan Mehmed II entered the city       The gate (    ) is also known as  Gate of Polyandrion  or  Myriandrion  (    ), [ 15 ]  because it led to a cemetery outside the Walls. A further corrupted form of the name, recorded during the siege of 626, is  Koliandros . The last Byzantine emperor,  Constantine XI , established his command here in 1453. [ 33 ]  In Turkish it isknown as  Edirnekap  ("" Adrianople  Gate ""), and it is here where  Mehmed II  made his triumphal entry into the conquered city. This gate stands on top of the sixth hill, and was the highest point of the old city at 77 meters.     [ edit ]   Minor gates and posterns   The first postern was the so-called Gate of Christ from the  Chi-R   Christogram  above it, lay between the two first towers of the main wall. It was known in late Ottoman times as the  Tabak Kap . Similar posterns are the  Yedikule Kaps  and the gates between towers 30/31 and 42/43, just north of the ""Sigma"". On the  Yedikule Kaps , opinions vary as to its origin: some scholars consider it to date already to Byzantine times, [ 34 ]  while others consider it an Ottoman addition. [ 35 ]     [ edit ]   Kerkoporta   According to the historian  Michael Doukas , on the morning of 29 May 1453, the small postern called  Kerkoporta  was left open by accident, allowing the first thirty or so  Ottoman  troops to enter the city. The Ottomans raised their banner atop the tower, signifying the beginning of the rout of the defenders, and the  fall of the city . Scholars like van Millingen, [ 36 ]   Steven Runciman , [ 37 ]  and others , have traditionally placed the Kerkoporta at the end of the Theodosian Walls, between tower 96 and the so-called  Palace of the Porphyrogenitus , or at the Komnenian Wall of Blachernae (see  below ). [ 38 ]  However, there is no evidence of a gate in the area, and it may be that the story is derived from the earlier legend concerning the  Xylokerkos Gate , which several earlier scholars also equated with the  Kerkoporta . [ 36 ]     [ edit ]   Later history   The impression made by the mighty Theodosian Walls on the Western Crusaders who encountered them can be seen in the 13th century  Caernarfon Castle  in Wales, built by  Edward I of England  as a royal residence, which is said to have been modeled on them. With the advent of siege cannons, however, the fortifications became obsolete, but their massive size still provided effective defence, as demonstrated during the  Second Ottoman Siege  in 1422. In the final siege, which led to the fall of the city to the Ottomans in 1453, the defenders, severely outnumbered, still managed to repeatedly counter Turkish attempts at undermining the walls, repulse several frontal attacks, and restore the damage from the siege cannons for almost two months. Finally, on 29 May, the decisive attack was launched, and when the Genoese general  Giovanni Giustiniani  was wounded and withdrew, causing a panic among the defenders, the walls were taken. After the capture of the city, Mehmed had the walls repaired in short order among other massive public works projects, and they were kept in repair during the first centuries of Ottoman rule.     [ edit ]   Yedikule Fortress          The Castle of Seven Towers (1827)       A fortress ( Greek :   ) was in existence behind the Golden Gate by the early 1350s, [ 39 ]  when it was garrisoned by  Catalan  soldiers loyal to  John VI Kantakouzenos . [ 40 ] [ 41 ]  After Kantakouzenos' resignation in 1354, it was partially demolished by  John V Palaiologos . [ 42 ]  In 1389-90 however, John V rebuilt and expanded the fortress, extending its walls all the way to the sea walls. [ 43 ]  Soon, John V was forced to flee there from a coup led by his grandson,  John VII . John V was held out successfully in a siege that lasted several months, and in which cannons were possibly employed. [ 44 ]  In 1391 however, John V was compelled to raze the fort by Sultan  Bayezid I , who otherwise threatened to blind his son  Manuel , whom he held captive. [ 45 ]  Emperor  John VIII Palaiologos  attempted to rebuild it in 1434, but was thwarted by Sultan  Murad II .          The sinister  Yedikule  today       After the final capture of Constantinople, Sultan Mehmed II rebuilt the fort in 1457, again with seven towers (to the four pre-existing ones on the Inner Theodosian Wall - towers eight to eleven - three larger ones were added behind the wall), as the  Yedikule Hisar  (Turkish for ""Fortress of Seven Towers""). During much of the Ottoman era, it was used as a treasury and state prison. The ambassadors of states currently at war with the  Porte  were usually imprisoned there. Amongst its most notable prisoners was the young Sultan  Osman II , who was imprisoned and executed there by the  Janissaries  in 1622. [ 46 ]   During the  Napoleonic Wars , the fortress was the prison of many French prisoners, including the writer and diplomat  Francois Pouqueville  who was detained there for more than two years (1799 to 1801) and who wrote an extensive description of the area. [ 47 ]     [ edit ]   Walls of Blachernae          The section of the Theodosian Walls that adjoins the walls of Blachernae, with the  Palace of Porphyrogenitus  in the background, as they appear today in suburban  Istanbul .       In the northwestern corner of the city, the suburb of Blachernae with its important church of  Panagia Vlacherniotissa  was left out of the Theodosian walls. To defend it, in the face of the great  Avar siege , a single wall was built, around 627, in the reign of  Heraclius . In 814,  Leo V the Armenian  built a new wall in front of the Heraclean one to safeguard against  Bulgarian  raids. In the 12th century, when Blachernae had become the favored imperial residence,  Manuel I Komnenos  built a wall, starting from the end of the Theodosian Walls, to protect the imperial palaces, which was connected by a later wall (possibly under  Isaac II Angelos ) to the Heraclean wall. [ 10 ]  Despite all this, the defenses of the Blachernae section remained weaker than at the Theodosian Walls, and it was here the Crusaders of the  Fourth Crusade  managed to penetrate and first enter the city.   The Walls of Blachernae consist of four single walls built in different periods. Generally they are about 12-15 meters in height; thicker than the Theodosian Walls and with more closely spaced towers. Situated on a steep slope, they lacked a moat, except on their lower end towards the Golden Horn, where Emperor John VI Kantakouzenos had dug one. [ 48 ]  The fortification begins at the end of the Theodosian Walls with the Komnenian Wall, connected by the Angelian wall to the Heraclean wall, which in turn is connected to the Sea Walls at the Golden Horn. The wall of Leo V lies in front of the Heraclean wall.   The wall of Manuel Komnenos is an architecturally-excellent fortification, extending for 220 m, with 9 towers, the small gate ( paraportion ) of St. Kallinikos between the second and third towers, and one gate after the sixth tower, the modern  Eri Kap  (the ""Crooked Gate""), which is identified with the old  Kaligaria Pyl , the ""Gate of the Bootmakers' Quarter"". The  Eri Kap  is so named because the road in front of it detours sharply around a tomb, which is supposed to belong to Hazret Hafiz, a companion of the Prophet  Muhammad , who died there during the  first Arab siege  of the city. [ 49 ]   The Komnenian wall ends at the third tower from the gate, and the newer wall (from the late 12th century), architecturally much inferior, continues for about 400 metres. This wall has four square towers and a gate, the Gyrolimne Gate (   , from  Argyr Limn , the ""Silver Lake"") between the second and third of them, now walled up, which led to the  Blachernae Palace . [ 50 ]  The last stretch of the wall is adjoined by two structures: the Tower of  Isaakios Angelos , built around 1188 as a residence for the Emperor, and the nearby building and tower known as  Prisons of Anemas , dated to the 7th century but named after  Michael Anemas , a general of  Alexios I  who was imprisoned there after a failed plot against the Emperor. [ 51 ]   The wall of Heraclius begins from there and extends for about 100 metres to the Sea Walls. It has three strong hexagonal towers, and the Gate of Blachernae (    ). The wall of Leo V complements it from the outside, forming a sort of rectangular fort, with an internal space of about 25 metres between the two walls. At the edge of the Leontian wall stands the Tower of  St. Nicholas , originally built by Leo V and rebuilt by Emperor  Romanus I Lecapenus . The Leontian Wall is thinner and of inferior construction to the Heraclean, and features four small towers along with a now collapsed gate, which formed the outer counterpart of the Blachernae Gate. Since the Sea Walls at the Golden Horn were built at a distance from the shore, a wall extended from the end of the Land Walls to the shoreline, the so-called  Vrakhiolion , erected at the same time as the main Heraclean wall, in 627. It had a single gate, the ""Wooden Gate"" (   or    ).     [ edit ]   Preservation and restoration work on the Walls   The land walls run through the heart of modern Istanbul, with a belt of parkland flanking their course. They are pierced at intervals by modern roads leading westwards out of the city. Many sections were restored during the 1980s, with financial support from  UNESCO , but the restoration program has been criticized for destroying historical evidence, focusing on superficial restoration, the use of inappropriate materials and poor quality of work. This became apparent in the  1999 earthquakes , when the restored sections collapsed while the original structure underneath remained intact. [ 52 ]  The threat posed by urban pollution, and the lack of a comprehensive restoration effort, prompted the  World Monuments Fund  to include them on its 2008 Watch List of the 100 Most Endangered Sites in the world. [ 53 ]     [ edit ]   Sea Walls   The sea walls enclosed the city on the sides of the Propontis (Sea of Marmara) and the gulf of the  Golden Horn  (   ). Although the original city of Byzantium certainly had sea walls, traces of which survive, [ 54 ]  the exact date for the construction of the medieval walls is a matter of debate. For long, the seaward walls were attributed to Constantine I, along with the construction of the main land wall. [ 55 ]  However, the first actual reference to their construction comes in 439, when the urban prefect  Cyrus of Panopolis  was ordered to repair the city walls and complete them on the seaward side. [ 56 ]  This activity is certainly not unconnected to the fact that in the same year,  Carthage  fell to the  Vandals , an event which signaled the emergence of a naval threat in the Mediterranean. [ 19 ] [ 57 ]  Nevertheless, the walls are not specifically mentioned as extant until much later, around the year 700. [ 58 ]   The Sea Walls were architecturally similar to the Theodosian Walls, but of simpler construction. They were formed by a single wall, considerably lower than the land walls, with inner circuits in the locations of the harbours. Enemy access to the walls facing the Golden Horn was prevented by the presence of a heavy chain or boom, installed by Emperor  Leo III , supported by floating barrels and stretching across the mouth of the inlet. One end of this chain was fastened to the Tower of Eugenius, in the modern suburb of  Sirkeci , and the other in  Galata , to a large, square tower, the basement of which was later turned into the Yeralt (underground) Mosque. [ 8 ]   During the early centuries of its existence, Constantinople faced few naval threats. Especially after the wars of Justinian, the Mediterranean had again become a ""Roman lake"". It was during the first siege of the city by the  Avars  and the  Sassanid Persians  that for the first time, a naval engagement was fought off the city itself. However, after the  Arab conquests  of  Syria  and  Egypt , followed later by  Crete , an new naval threat emerged, prompting successive emperors to attend to the sea walls. They were renovated in the early 8th century under  Tiberios III  or  Anastasios II , [ 59 ]  while  Michael II  initiated a wide-scale reconstruction, eventually completed by his successor  Theophilos , which increased their height. [ 60 ]  During the siege of the city by the Fourth Crusade, the sea walls nonetheless proved to be a weak point in the city's defences, as the Venetians managed to storm them. [ 10 ]   Following this experience,  Michael VIII Palaiologos  took particular care to heighten and strengthen the seaward walls after the recapture of the city in 1261, as he faced the further threat of a possible invasion by  Charles d'Anjou .     [ edit ]   Propontis Wall   The wall of the Propontis was built almost at the shoreline, with the exception of harbours and quays, and had a height of 1215 metres, with 10 gates, 3 small gates, 188 towers and a total length of almost 8,460 metres, with further 1,080 metres comprising the inner wall of the Vlanga harbour. Several sections of the wall were damaged during the construction of the  Kennedy Caddesi  coastal road in 195657. [ 8 ]  From the Marble Tower to the cape at the edge of the ancient acropolis of the city (modern  Sarayburnu , Seraglio Point), the wall's gates were:     the Gate of St. John Studites ( Pyl Agiou Iannou tou Stouditou ), modern  Narlkap  (""Gate of Roses""), which led to the important  monastery  of the same name.   the Gate of Psamathos ( Porta Psamatheos , Turkish  Samatya Kaps ), leading to the suburb of  Psamathia .   the Gate of St. Aemilianus ( Pyl Agiou Aimilianou , Turkish  Davutpaa Kaps ), before the harbours of Eleutherios and Theodosios.   the Vlanga Gate ( Porta Vlaggas ), at the mouth of the Lycus stream, within the harbours. It was demolished after the Ottoman conquest, and a new gate ( Yenikap ) build in its place.   the Kontoscalion Gate ( Porta Kontoskaliou , Turkish  Kumkap ), at the harbour of the same name.   the Iron Gate ( Sidra Pyl ), leading to and from the harbour of Sophia or Sophianon ( Limn Sofiann ), also called harbour of  Julian  ( Limn Ioulianou ). In Turkish it is called  Kadrgaliman Kaps .   the Bull and Lion Gate ( Porta Vos kai Leontos , shortened to  Voukolen ), which led to the harbour and imperial palace of  Bucoleon , in Turkish  atladkap .   an unnamed gate, at the southeastern edge of the Imperial quarter, modern  Ahrkaps .   an unnamed gate, at the southeastern edge of the Imperial quarter, modern  Balkhane Kaps  (it lies immediately within the later perimeter of the  Topkap Palace ).   the Gate of  St. Lazarus  ( Porta Agiou Lazarou ), at the ancient Temple of  Poseidon .   the Postern of the  Odegetria  ( Porta ts Odgtrias ), at the Palace of Mangana, modern  Demirkap .   the Postern of Michael Protovestiarius ( Porta Mikhal Prtovestiariou ), today  Deirmen Kap .   the Eastern Gate ( Ea Pyl ) or Gate of  St. Barbara  ( Pyl Agias Barbaras ), in Turkish  Top Kaps , from which  Topkap Palace  takes its name.       [ edit ]   Golden Horn Wall   The wall facing towards the Golden Horn, where in later times most seaborne traffic was conducted, stretched for a total length of 5,600 metres from the cape of St. Demetrius to the Blachernae, where it adjoined the Land Walls. Although much of the wall was demolished in the 1870s, during the construction of the railway line, its course and the position of most gates and towers is known with accuracy. It was built further inland, up to 40 metres from the shore, and was about 10 metres tall, with 17 gates (plus two added in Ottoman times) and 110 towers. The gates were, in order: [ 8 ]     the Gate of Eugenios (   ), leading to the Prosphorion harbour. It was named after the nearby 4th century Tower of Eugenius, where the great chain that closed the entrance to the Golden Horn was kept and suspended from. The gate was also called  Marmaroporta  (""Marble Gate""), because it was covered in marble, and featured a statue of the Emperor  Julian . It is usually identified with the  Yalkk Kaps , and was destroyed in 1871. [ 61 ]   the Gate of Bonos (  B ).   the Neorion Gate (   , ""Shipyard Gate"") or Horaia Gate (   , ""Beautiful Gate""), leading to the Neorion harbour.   the Hikanatissa Gate (   ).   the Gate of  St. Mark  (    ) or Hebrew Gate (   ), as it led to suburbs inhabited by  Venetians  and  Jews . Its modern name is  Balkpazar Kaps .   the Gate of the Perama (   ), in the suburb of Perama, from which the ferry to  Pera  (Galata) sailed.   the so-called Gate of St John de Cornibus, from the nearby church, in Turkish  Zindan Kaps .   the Gate of the  Drungarii  (   ), modern  Odunkaps .   the  Ayazma Kaps  Gate.   the Gate of the Plataia (    ), modern  Unkapan Kaps ..   the Gate of Eis Pegas (    ), also known as  Putei Gate , [ 62 ]  modern  Cibali Kaps . It was named so because it looked towards the quarter of Pegae on the other shore of the Golden Horn.   the St. Theodosia Gate (    ), named after the great church of St Theodosia (possibly modern  Gl Mosque ). Known in Turkish as  Ayakap  (""Holy Gate"").   the  Yeni Aya kap  gate (""New Holy Gate""), shortly after the Gate of St Theodosia, is not Byzantine. It was built by the great Ottoman architect  Sinan  in 1582.   the Petrion Gate (    , Turkish  Petri Kaps ), one of the two gates of the Petrion Fort, formed by a double stretch of walls. The gate of the fort's inner wall, which led to the city, was called the Gate of Diplophanarion. It was at the Petrion Gate that the Venetians, under the personal leadership of Doge  Enrico Dandolo , scaled the walls and entered the city in 1204.   the Phanarion Gate (    , Turkish  Fener Kap ), the second gate of the Petrion Fort, named after the local light-tower. The light-tower later gave its name to the suburb, which is still known as  Phanar .   the Royal Gates (   ), in Turkish  Balat Kap  (""Palace Gate""), which led to the Palace of Blachernae.   the Kynegon Gate (    , ""Gate of the Hunters"").   the Gate of  St. Anastasia  (    ).   the Kyliomene Gate (   , ""Rolled Gate""), in Turkish  Ayvansaray  Kaps  near the  Church of St. Thecla .       [ edit ]   Garrisons of the city   During the whole existence of the Byzantine Empire, the garrison of the city was quite small: the imperial guards and the small city watch (the  kerketon ) under the  urban prefect  were the only permanent armed force available. Any threat to the city would have to be dealt with by the field armies in the provinces, before it could approach the city itself. In times of need, such as the earthquake of 447 or the raids by the Avars in the early 7th century, the general population would be conscripted and armed, or additional troops would be brought in from the provincial armies. [ 63 ]   In the early centuries, the imperial guard consisted of the units of the  Excubitores  and  Scholae Palatinae . In time, they declined to parade-ground troops, but in the 8th century the Emperors, faced with successive revolts by the  thematic  armies and pursuing deeply unpopular  Iconoclastic  policies, established the imperial  tagmata  for their own security. Although the  tagmata  formed the core of imperial expeditionary armies and were often absent from the city, two of them, the  Noumeroi  and the  Teicheitai  remained permanently stationed in Constantinople, garrisoned around the  Palace district  or in various locations, such as disused churches, in the capital. These units were never very numerous, numbering a few thousands at best, but they were complemented by several detachments stationed around the capital, in Thrace and  Bithynia . [ 63 ]   The small size of the city's garrison was due to the uneasiness of Emperors and populace alike towards a permanent large military force, both for fear of a military uprising and because of the considerable financial burden its maintenance would entail. Furthermore, a large force was largely unnecessary, because of the inherent security provided by the city walls themselves. As historian John Haldon notes: ""Providing the gates were secured and the defences provided with a skeleton force, the City was safe against even very large forces in the pre-gunpowder period."" [ 63 ]     [ edit ]   Fortifications around Constantinople          The oldest surviving map of Constantinople, dated from 1422. The fortifications of Constantinople and of  Galata , at the northern shore of the  Golden Horn , are prominently featured. The water trench [ 64 ] [ 65 ]  in front of the Theodosian walls at the western end of the city is also depicted, as well as the  Maiden's Tower  in the middle of the Bosporus.       Several fortifications were built at various periods in the vicinity of Constantinople, and can be said to have formed an integrated defensive system along with the city's main walls. The first and greatest of these is the 56 km long  Anastasian Wall  (Greek  Anastaseio Teichos  or  Makron Teichos , ""Long Wall""), built in the mid-5th century as an outer defense to Constantinople, some 65 km westwards of the city. It was 3.30 m thick and over 5 m high, but its effectiveness was limited, and it was abandoned at some time in the 7th century for want of resources to maintain and men to man it. For centuries thereafter, its materials were used in local buildings, but several parts are still extant. [ 66 ]   In addition, between the Anastasian Wall and the city itself, there were several small towns and fortresses like Selymbria, Rhegion or the great suburb of Hebdomon (""Seventh"", modern  Bakrky , so named from its distance of seven  Roman miles  from the city walls), the site of major military encampments. Beyond the Long Walls, the towns of  Bizye  and  Arcadiopolis  covered the northern approaches. These localities were strategically situated along the main routes to the city, and formed the outer defences of Constantinople throughout its history, serving to muster forces, confront enemy invasions or at least buy time for the capital's defences to be brought in order. [ 63 ]  It is notable that during the final Ottoman siege, several of them, such as Selymbria, surrendered only after the fall of Constantinople itself. In Asia Minor, their role was mirrored by the cities of  Nicaea  and  Nicomedia , and the large field camp at Malagina. [ 63 ]     [ edit ]   Walls of Galata   Galata , then the suburb of  Sykai , was fortified under  Justinian , but the settlement declined and disappeared after the 7th century, leaving only the  great tower  (the  kastellion tou Galatou ) in modern Karaky, that guarded the chain extending across the mouth of the Golden Horn. After the sack of the city in 1204, Galata became a Venetian quarter, and later a  Genoese   extraterritorial  colony, effectively outside Byzantine control. Despite Byzantine opposition, the Genoese managed to surround their quarter with a moat, and by joining their castle-like houses with walls they created the first wall around the colony. The  Galata Tower , then called  Christea Turris  (""Tower of Christ""), and another stretch of walls to its north were built in 1349. Further expansions followed in 1387, 1397 and 1404, enclosing an area larger than that originally allocated to them, stretching from the modern district of Azapkap north to ihane, from there to Tophane and thence to Karaky. [ 67 ]  After the Ottoman conquest, the walls were maintained until the 1870s, when most were demolished to facilitate the expansion of the city. [ 68 ]  Today only the Galata Tower, visible from most of historical Constantinople, remains intact, along with several smaller fragments. [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Anadolu and Rumeli Fortresses          The Rumelihisar Fortress, seen from the Bosporus       The twin forts of  Anadoluhisar  and  Rumelihisar  lie to the north of Constantinople, at the narrowest point of the  Bosporus . They were built by the  Ottomans  to control this strategically vital waterway in preparation for their final assault on Constantinople.  Anadoluhisar  (Turkish for ""Fortress of  Anatolia ""), also called  Akehisar  and  Gzelcehisar  in earlier times, was constructed by Sultan  Bayezid I  in 1394, and initially consisted of just a 25 m high, roughly pentagonal watchtower surrounded by a wall. [ 68 ]  The much larger and elaborate  Rumelihisar  (""Fortress of  Rumeli "") was built by Sultan  Mehmed II  in just over 4 months in 1452. It consists of three large and one small towers, connected by a wall reinforced with 13 small watchtowers. With cannons mounted on its main towers, the fort gave the Ottomans complete control of the passage of ships through Bosporus, a role evoked clearly in its original name,  Boazkesen  (""cutter of the strait/throat""). After the conquest of Constantinople, it served as a customs checkpoint and a prison, notably for the embassies of states that were at war with the Empire. After suffering extensive damage in the 1509 earthquake, it was repaired, and was used continuously until the late 19th century.

The  Great Wall of China  ( simplified Chinese :   ;  traditional Chinese :   ;  pinyin : Chngchng; literally ""long city/fortress"") or ( simplified Chinese :   ;  traditional Chinese :   ;  pinyin : Wnl Chngchng; literally ""The long wall of 10,000  Li  ()"" [ 1 ] ) is a series of stone and earthen  fortifications  in  China , built, rebuilt, and maintained between the 5th century BC and the 16th century to protect the northern borders of the  Chinese Empire  from  Xiongnu  attacks during the rule of  successive dynasties . Several walls, referred to as the Great Wall of China, were built since the 5th century BC. One of the most famous is the wall built between 220206 BC by the first  Emperor of China ,  Qin Shi Huang ; little of it remains; it was much farther north than the current wall, which was built during the  Ming Dynasty . [ 2 ]   The Great Wall stretches over approximately 6,400 km (4,000 miles) [ 3 ]  from  Shanhaiguan  in the east to  Lop Nur  in the west, along an arc that roughly delineates the southern edge of  Inner Mongolia , but stretches to over 6,700 km (4,160 miles) in total. [ 4 ]  At its peak, the  Ming  Wall was guarded by more than one million men. [ 5 ]  It has been estimated that somewhere in the range of 2 to 3 million Chinese died as part of the centuries-long project of building the wall.

During the  Warring States Period  from the 5th century BC to 221 BC, the states of  Qi ,  Yan  and  Zhao  all constructed extensive fortifications to defend their own borders. Built to withstand the attack of small arms such as swords and spears, these walls were made mostly by stamping earth and gravel between board frames.  Qin Shi Huang  conquered all opposing states and unified China in 221 BC, establishing the  Qin Dynasty . Intending to impose centralized rule and prevent the resurgence of feudal lords, he ordered the destruction of the wall sections that divided his empire along the former state borders. To protect the empire against intrusions by the  Xiongnu  people from the north, he ordered the building of a new wall to connect the remaining fortifications along the empire's new northern frontier. Transporting the large quantity of materials required for construction was difficult, so builders always tried to use local resources. Stones from the mountains were used over mountain ranges, while  rammed earth  was used for construction in the plains. There are no surviving historical records indicating the exact length and course of the Qin Dynasty walls. Most of the ancient walls have eroded away over the centuries, and very few sections remain today. Later, the  Han ,  Sui ,  Northern  and  Jin  dynasties all repaired, rebuilt, or expanded sections of the Great Wall at great cost to defend themselves against northern invaders.   The Great Wall concept was revived again during the  Ming Dynasty  following the Ming army's defeat by the  Oirats  in the  Battle of Tumu  in 1449. The Ming had failed to gain a clear upper-hand over the  Manchurian  and  Mongolian  tribes after successive battles, and the long-drawn conflict was taking a toll on the empire. The Ming adopted a new strategy to keep the  nomadic  tribes out by constructing walls along the northern border of China. Acknowledging the Mongol control established in the  Ordos Desert , the wall followed the desert's southern edge instead of incorporating the bend of the  Huang He .          Photograph of the Great Wall in 1907       Unlike the earlier Qin fortifications, the Ming construction was stronger and more elaborate due to the use of  bricks  and stone instead of rammed earth. As  Mongol raids  continued periodically over the years, the Ming devoted considerable resources to repair and reinforce the walls. Sections near the Ming capital of  Beijing  were especially strong. [ 7 ]   Towards the end of the Ming Dynasty, the Great Wall helped defend the empire against the  Manchu  invasions that began around 1600. Under the military command of  Yuan Chonghuan , the Ming army held off the Manchus at the heavily fortified  Shanhaiguan  pass, preventing the Manchus from entering the Chinese heartland. The Manchus were finally able to cross the Great Wall in 1644, when the gates at Shanhaiguan were opened by  Wu Sangui , a Ming border general who disliked the activities of rulers of the  Shun Dynasty . The Manchus quickly seized Beijing, and defeated the newly founded Shun Dynasty and remaining Ming resistance, to establish the  Qing Dynasty .   Under Qing rule, China's borders extended beyond the walls and  Mongolia  was annexed into the empire, so construction and repairs on the Great Wall were discontinued.     Notable areas          An area of the sections of the Great Wall at  Jinshanling                     The following three sections are in Beijing municipality, which were renovated and which are regularly visited by modern tourists today.     ""North Pass"" of  Juyongguan  pass, known as the  Badaling . When used by the Chinese to protect their land, this section of the wall has had many guards to defend Chinas capital Beijing. Made of stone and bricks from the hills, this portion of the Great Wall is 7.8 meters (25.6 ft) high and 5 meters (16.4 ft) wide.       ""West Pass"" of  Jiayuguan (pass) . This fort is near the western edges of the Great Wall.       ""Pass"" of  Shanhaiguan . This fort is near the eastern edges of the Great Wall.       One of the most striking sections of the Ming Great Wall is where it climbs extremely steep slopes. It runs 11 kilometers (7 mi) long, ranges from 5 to 8 meters (1626 ft) in height, and 6 meters (19.7 ft) across the bottom, narrowing up to 5 meters (16.4 ft) across the top. Wangjinglou is one of  Jinshanling 's 67  watchtowers , 980 meters (3,215 ft) above sea level.   South East of  Jinshanling , is the  Mutianyu  Great Wall which winds along lofty, cragged mountains from the southeast to the northwest for approximately 2.25 kilometers (about 1.3 miles). It is connected with Juyongguan Pass to the west and Gubeikou to the east.   25 km west of the Liao Tian Ling stands of part of Great wall which is only 2~3 stories high. According to the records of Lin Tian, the wall was not only extremely short compared to others, but it appears to be silver. Archeologists explain that the wall appears to be silver because the stone they used were from Shan Xi, where many mines are found. The stone contains extremely high metal in it causing it to appear silver. However, due to years of decay of the Great Wall, it is hard to see the silver part of the wall today.     Another notable section lies near the eastern extremity of the wall, where the first pass of the Great Wall was built on the  Shanhaiguan  (known as the Number One Pass Under Heaven), the first mountain the Great Wall climbs. Jia Shan is also here, as is the Jiumenkou, which is the only portion of the wall that was built as a bridge. Shanhaiguan Great Wall is called the Museum of the Construction of the Great Wall, because of the Meng Jiang-Nu Temple, built during the  Song Dynasty .     Characteristics          The Great Wall on an 1805 map       Before the use of bricks, the Great Wall was mainly built from  Earth or Taipa , stones, and wood.   During the Ming Dynasty, however, bricks were heavily used in many areas of the wall, as were materials such as  tiles ,  lime , and stone. The size and weight of the bricks made them easier to work with than earth and stone, so construction quickened. Additionally, bricks could bear more weight and endure better than rammed earth. Stone can hold under its own weight better than brick, but is more difficult to use. Consequently, stones cut in rectangular shapes were used for the foundation, inner and outer  brims , and  gateways  of the wall.  Battlements  line the uppermost portion of the vast majority of the wall, with defensive gaps a little over 30 cm (one foot) tall, and about 23 cm (9 inches) wide.     Condition          The Great Wall at  Mutianyu , near  Beijing              The Great Wall in fog       While some portions north of Beijing and near tourist centers have been preserved and even reconstructed, in many locations the Wall is in disrepair. Those parts might serve as a village playground or a source of stones to rebuild houses and roads. [ 8 ]  Sections of the Wall are also prone to  graffiti  and  vandalism . Parts have been destroyed because the Wall is in the way of construction. [ 9 ]  No comprehensive survey of the wall has been carried out, so it is not possible to say how much of it survives, especially in remote areas. Intact or repaired portions of the Wall near developed tourist areas are often frequented by sellers of tourist  kitsch .   More than 60 kilometres (37 mi) of the wall in  Gansu  province may disappear in the next 20 years, due to erosion from  sandstorms . In places, the height of the wall has been reduced from more than five meters (16.4 ft) to less than two meters. The square lookout towers that characterize the most famous images of the wall have disappeared completely. Many western sections of the wall are  constructed from mud , rather than brick and stone, and thus are more susceptible to erosion. [ 10 ]     Watchtowers and barracks          Watchtower       Communication between the army units along the length of the Great Wall, including the ability to call reinforcements and warn  garrisons  of enemy movements, was of high importance. Signal towers were built upon hill tops or other high points along the wall for their visibility.     Visibility from space          The Great Wall of China as seen in a  false-color  radar image from the  Space Shuttle , taken in April 1994         Visibility from the moon   Popular beliefs ranging from  Ripley's Believe It or Not! ' s cartoons from 1930s, which claimed that the Great Wall is ""the mightiest work of man, the only one that would be visible to the human eye from the moon,"" to  Richard Halliburton 's 1938 book  Second Book of Marvels  which makes a similar claim, have persisted, assuming  urban legend  status, and sometimes even appeared in school textbooks. Arthur Waldron, author of  The Great Wall of China: From History to Myth , has speculated that the belief might go back to the fascination with the  ""canals""  once believed to exist on  Mars .   One of the earliest known reference to this myth appears in a letter written in 1754 by the English antiquary  William Stukeley . Stukeley wrote that, ""This mighty wall of four score miles in length ( Hadrian's Wall ) is only exceeded by the Chinese Wall, which makes a considerable figure upon the  terrestrial globe , and may be discerned at the moon."" [ 11 ]   The Great Wall is a maximum 9.1m (30 ft) wide and is about the same color as the soil surrounding it. Based on the optics of resolving power (distance versus the width of the iris: a few millimetres for the human eye, metres for large telescopes) an object of reasonable contrast to its surroundings some 70 miles in diameter (1 arc-minute) would be visible to the unaided eye from the moon, whose average distance from Earth is 384,393 km (238,857 miles). The Great Wall is of course not a disc but more like a threadit can be seen from much further than would be possible if it were simply a 30 foot disc. Still, the apparent width of the Great Wall from the moon is the same as that of a human hair viewed from 2 miles away. To see the wall from the moon would require spatial resolution  17,000 times  better than normal (20/20) vision. [ 12 ]  Not surprisingly, no lunar astronaut has ever claimed seeing the Great Wall from the moon.   Incidentally, if it were possible to see the Great Wall from the moon, one ought to be able to see many of the world's highways as well, given that many surpass the Great Wall in width and brightness.     Visibility from low earth orbit   A more controversial question is whether the Wall is visible from  low earth orbit , i.e an altitude of as little as 100 miles (160 km).  NASA  claims that it is barely visible, and only under nearly perfect conditions; it is no more conspicuous than many other man-made objects. [ 13 ]  Other authors have argued that due to limitations of the optics of the eye and the spacing of  photoreceptors  on the  retina , it is impossible to see the wall with the naked eye, even from low orbit, and would require visual acuity of 20/3 (7.7 times better than normal). [ 12 ]     Anecdotal reports   Astronaut  William Pogue  thought he had seen it from  Skylab  but discovered he was actually looking at the  Grand Canal of China  near Beijing. He spotted the Great Wall with  binoculars , but said that ""it wasn't visible to the unaided eye."" U.S. Senator  Jake Garn  claimed to be able to see the Great Wall with the naked eye from a  space shuttle  orbit in the early 1980s, but his claim has been disputed by several U.S. astronauts. Veteran U.S. astronaut  Gene Cernan  has stated: ""At Earth orbit of 100 miles (160 km) to 200 miles (320 km) high, the Great Wall of China is, indeed, visible to the naked eye.""  Ed Lu ,  Expedition 7  Science Officer aboard the  International Space Station , adds that, ""it's less visible than a lot of other objects. And you have to know where to look.""   In October 2003, Chinese astronaut  Yang Liwei  stated that he had not been able to see the Great Wall of China. In response, the  European Space Agency  (ESA) issued a press release reporting that from an orbit between 160 and 320 km, the Great Wall is visible to the naked eye. In an attempt to further clarify things, the ESA published a picture of a part of the Great Wall photographed from Space. However, in a press release a week later (no longer available in the ESAs website), they acknowledged that the ""Great Wall"" in the picture was actually a river.          Topographic maps put together showing the location of the eastern parts of the wall between the  Yellow River  and the  Bohai Sea .       Neil Armstrong  stated about the view from  Apollo 11 : ""I do not believe that, at least with my eyes, there would be any man-made object that I could see. I have not yet found somebody who has told me they've seen the Wall of China from Earth orbit. ...I've asked various people, particularly Shuttle guys, that have been many orbits around China in the daytime, and the ones I've talked to didn't see it. [ 14 ]   Leroy Chiao , a  Chinese-American  astronaut, took a photograph from the  International Space Station  that shows the wall. It was so indistinct that the photographer was not certain he had actually captured it. Based on the photograph, the  China Daily  later reported that the Great Wall can be seen from space with the naked eye, under favorable viewing conditions, if one knows exactly where to look.

The  Great Wall of China  ( simplified Chinese :   ;  traditional Chinese :   ;  pinyin : Chngchng; literally ""long city/fortress"") or ( simplified Chinese :   ;  traditional Chinese :   ;  pinyin : Wnl Chngchng; literally ""The long wall of 10,000  Li  ()"" [ 1 ] ) is a series of stone and earthen  fortifications  in  China , built, rebuilt, and maintained between the 5th century BC and the 16th century to protect the northern borders of the  Chinese Empire  from  Xiongnu  attacks during the rule of  successive dynasties . Several walls, referred to as the Great Wall of China, were built since the 5th century BC. One of the most famous is the wall built between 220206 BC by the first  Emperor of China ,  Qin Shi Huang ; little of it remains; it was much farther north than the current wall, which was built during the  Ming Dynasty . [ 2 ]   The Great Wall stretches over approximately 6,400 km (4,000 miles) [ 3 ]  from  Shanhaiguan  in the east to  Lop Nur  in the west, along an arc that roughly delineates the southern edge of  Inner Mongolia , but stretches to over 6,700 km (4,160 miles) in total. [ 4 ]  At its peak, the  Ming  Wall was guarded by more than one million men. [ 5 ]  It has been estimated that somewhere in the range of 2 to 3 million Chinese died as part of the centuries-long project of building the wall.

During the  Warring States Period  from the 5th century BC to 221 BC, the states of  Qi ,  Yan  and  Zhao  all constructed extensive fortifications to defend their own borders. Built to withstand the attack of small arms such as swords and spears, these walls were made mostly by stamping earth and gravel between board frames.  Qin Shi Huang  conquered all opposing states and unified China in 221 BC, establishing the  Qin Dynasty . Intending to impose centralized rule and prevent the resurgence of feudal lords, he ordered the destruction of the wall sections that divided his empire along the former state borders. To protect the empire against intrusions by the  Xiongnu  people from the north, he ordered the building of a new wall to connect the remaining fortifications along the empire's new northern frontier. Transporting the large quantity of materials required for construction was difficult, so builders always tried to use local resources. Stones from the mountains were used over mountain ranges, while  rammed earth  was used for construction in the plains. There are no surviving historical records indicating the exact length and course of the Qin Dynasty walls. Most of the ancient walls have eroded away over the centuries, and very few sections remain today. Later, the  Han ,  Sui ,  Northern  and  Jin  dynasties all repaired, rebuilt, or expanded sections of the Great Wall at great cost to defend themselves against northern invaders.   The Great Wall concept was revived again during the  Ming Dynasty  following the Ming army's defeat by the  Oirats  in the  Battle of Tumu  in 1449. The Ming had failed to gain a clear upper-hand over the  Manchurian  and  Mongolian  tribes after successive battles, and the long-drawn conflict was taking a toll on the empire. The Ming adopted a new strategy to keep the  nomadic  tribes out by constructing walls along the northern border of China. Acknowledging the Mongol control established in the  Ordos Desert , the wall followed the desert's southern edge instead of incorporating the bend of the  Huang He .          Photograph of the Great Wall in 1907       Unlike the earlier Qin fortifications, the Ming construction was stronger and more elaborate due to the use of  bricks  and stone instead of rammed earth. As  Mongol raids  continued periodically over the years, the Ming devoted considerable resources to repair and reinforce the walls. Sections near the Ming capital of  Beijing  were especially strong. [ 7 ]   Towards the end of the Ming Dynasty, the Great Wall helped defend the empire against the  Manchu  invasions that began around 1600. Under the military command of  Yuan Chonghuan , the Ming army held off the Manchus at the heavily fortified  Shanhaiguan  pass, preventing the Manchus from entering the Chinese heartland. The Manchus were finally able to cross the Great Wall in 1644, when the gates at Shanhaiguan were opened by  Wu Sangui , a Ming border general who disliked the activities of rulers of the  Shun Dynasty . The Manchus quickly seized Beijing, and defeated the newly founded Shun Dynasty and remaining Ming resistance, to establish the  Qing Dynasty .   Under Qing rule, China's borders extended beyond the walls and  Mongolia  was annexed into the empire, so construction and repairs on the Great Wall were discontinued.     Notable areas          An area of the sections of the Great Wall at  Jinshanling                     The following three sections are in Beijing municipality, which were renovated and which are regularly visited by modern tourists today.     ""North Pass"" of  Juyongguan  pass, known as the  Badaling . When used by the Chinese to protect their land, this section of the wall has had many guards to defend Chinas capital Beijing. Made of stone and bricks from the hills, this portion of the Great Wall is 7.8 meters (25.6 ft) high and 5 meters (16.4 ft) wide.       ""West Pass"" of  Jiayuguan (pass) . This fort is near the western edges of the Great Wall.       ""Pass"" of  Shanhaiguan . This fort is near the eastern edges of the Great Wall.       One of the most striking sections of the Ming Great Wall is where it climbs extremely steep slopes. It runs 11 kilometers (7 mi) long, ranges from 5 to 8 meters (1626 ft) in height, and 6 meters (19.7 ft) across the bottom, narrowing up to 5 meters (16.4 ft) across the top. Wangjinglou is one of  Jinshanling 's 67  watchtowers , 980 meters (3,215 ft) above sea level.   South East of  Jinshanling , is the  Mutianyu  Great Wall which winds along lofty, cragged mountains from the southeast to the northwest for approximately 2.25 kilometers (about 1.3 miles). It is connected with Juyongguan Pass to the west and Gubeikou to the east.   25 km west of the Liao Tian Ling stands of part of Great wall which is only 2~3 stories high. According to the records of Lin Tian, the wall was not only extremely short compared to others, but it appears to be silver. Archeologists explain that the wall appears to be silver because the stone they used were from Shan Xi, where many mines are found. The stone contains extremely high metal in it causing it to appear silver. However, due to years of decay of the Great Wall, it is hard to see the silver part of the wall today.     Another notable section lies near the eastern extremity of the wall, where the first pass of the Great Wall was built on the  Shanhaiguan  (known as the Number One Pass Under Heaven), the first mountain the Great Wall climbs. Jia Shan is also here, as is the Jiumenkou, which is the only portion of the wall that was built as a bridge. Shanhaiguan Great Wall is called the Museum of the Construction of the Great Wall, because of the Meng Jiang-Nu Temple, built during the  Song Dynasty .     Characteristics          The Great Wall on an 1805 map       Before the use of bricks, the Great Wall was mainly built from  Earth or Taipa , stones, and wood.   During the Ming Dynasty, however, bricks were heavily used in many areas of the wall, as were materials such as  tiles ,  lime , and stone. The size and weight of the bricks made them easier to work with than earth and stone, so construction quickened. Additionally, bricks could bear more weight and endure better than rammed earth. Stone can hold under its own weight better than brick, but is more difficult to use. Consequently, stones cut in rectangular shapes were used for the foundation, inner and outer  brims , and  gateways  of the wall.  Battlements  line the uppermost portion of the vast majority of the wall, with defensive gaps a little over 30 cm (one foot) tall, and about 23 cm (9 inches) wide.     Condition          The Great Wall at  Mutianyu , near  Beijing              The Great Wall in fog       While some portions north of Beijing and near tourist centers have been preserved and even reconstructed, in many locations the Wall is in disrepair. Those parts might serve as a village playground or a source of stones to rebuild houses and roads. [ 8 ]  Sections of the Wall are also prone to  graffiti  and  vandalism . Parts have been destroyed because the Wall is in the way of construction. [ 9 ]  No comprehensive survey of the wall has been carried out, so it is not possible to say how much of it survives, especially in remote areas. Intact or repaired portions of the Wall near developed tourist areas are often frequented by sellers of tourist  kitsch .   More than 60 kilometres (37 mi) of the wall in  Gansu  province may disappear in the next 20 years, due to erosion from  sandstorms . In places, the height of the wall has been reduced from more than five meters (16.4 ft) to less than two meters. The square lookout towers that characterize the most famous images of the wall have disappeared completely. Many western sections of the wall are  constructed from mud , rather than brick and stone, and thus are more susceptible to erosion. [ 10 ]     Watchtowers and barracks          Watchtower       Communication between the army units along the length of the Great Wall, including the ability to call reinforcements and warn  garrisons  of enemy movements, was of high importance. Signal towers were built upon hill tops or other high points along the wall for their visibility.     Visibility from space          The Great Wall of China as seen in a  false-color  radar image from the  Space Shuttle , taken in April 1994         Visibility from the moon   Popular beliefs ranging from  Ripley's Believe It or Not! ' s cartoons from 1930s, which claimed that the Great Wall is ""the mightiest work of man, the only one that would be visible to the human eye from the moon,"" to  Richard Halliburton 's 1938 book  Second Book of Marvels  which makes a similar claim, have persisted, assuming  urban legend  status, and sometimes even appeared in school textbooks. Arthur Waldron, author of  The Great Wall of China: From History to Myth , has speculated that the belief might go back to the fascination with the  ""canals""  once believed to exist on  Mars .   One of the earliest known reference to this myth appears in a letter written in 1754 by the English antiquary  William Stukeley . Stukeley wrote that, ""This mighty wall of four score miles in length ( Hadrian's Wall ) is only exceeded by the Chinese Wall, which makes a considerable figure upon the  terrestrial globe , and may be discerned at the moon."" [ 11 ]   The Great Wall is a maximum 9.1m (30 ft) wide and is about the same color as the soil surrounding it. Based on the optics of resolving power (distance versus the width of the iris: a few millimetres for the human eye, metres for large telescopes) an object of reasonable contrast to its surroundings some 70 miles in diameter (1 arc-minute) would be visible to the unaided eye from the moon, whose average distance from Earth is 384,393 km (238,857 miles). The Great Wall is of course not a disc but more like a threadit can be seen from much further than would be possible if it were simply a 30 foot disc. Still, the apparent width of the Great Wall from the moon is the same as that of a human hair viewed from 2 miles away. To see the wall from the moon would require spatial resolution  17,000 times  better than normal (20/20) vision. [ 12 ]  Not surprisingly, no lunar astronaut has ever claimed seeing the Great Wall from the moon.   Incidentally, if it were possible to see the Great Wall from the moon, one ought to be able to see many of the world's highways as well, given that many surpass the Great Wall in width and brightness.     Visibility from low earth orbit   A more controversial question is whether the Wall is visible from  low earth orbit , i.e an altitude of as little as 100 miles (160 km).  NASA  claims that it is barely visible, and only under nearly perfect conditions; it is no more conspicuous than many other man-made objects. [ 13 ]  Other authors have argued that due to limitations of the optics of the eye and the spacing of  photoreceptors  on the  retina , it is impossible to see the wall with the naked eye, even from low orbit, and would require visual acuity of 20/3 (7.7 times better than normal). [ 12 ]     Anecdotal reports   Astronaut  William Pogue  thought he had seen it from  Skylab  but discovered he was actually looking at the  Grand Canal of China  near Beijing. He spotted the Great Wall with  binoculars , but said that ""it wasn't visible to the unaided eye."" U.S. Senator  Jake Garn  claimed to be able to see the Great Wall with the naked eye from a  space shuttle  orbit in the early 1980s, but his claim has been disputed by several U.S. astronauts. Veteran U.S. astronaut  Gene Cernan  has stated: ""At Earth orbit of 100 miles (160 km) to 200 miles (320 km) high, the Great Wall of China is, indeed, visible to the naked eye.""  Ed Lu ,  Expedition 7  Science Officer aboard the  International Space Station , adds that, ""it's less visible than a lot of other objects. And you have to know where to look.""   In October 2003, Chinese astronaut  Yang Liwei  stated that he had not been able to see the Great Wall of China. In response, the  European Space Agency  (ESA) issued a press release reporting that from an orbit between 160 and 320 km, the Great Wall is visible to the naked eye. In an attempt to further clarify things, the ESA published a picture of a part of the Great Wall photographed from Space. However, in a press release a week later (no longer available in the ESAs website), they acknowledged that the ""Great Wall"" in the picture was actually a river.          Topographic maps put together showing the location of the eastern parts of the wall between the  Yellow River  and the  Bohai Sea .       Neil Armstrong  stated about the view from  Apollo 11 : ""I do not believe that, at least with my eyes, there would be any man-made object that I could see. I have not yet found somebody who has told me they've seen the Wall of China from Earth orbit. ...I've asked various people, particularly Shuttle guys, that have been many orbits around China in the daytime, and the ones I've talked to didn't see it. [ 14 ]   Leroy Chiao , a  Chinese-American  astronaut, took a photograph from the  International Space Station  that shows the wall. It was so indistinct that the photographer was not certain he had actually captured it. Based on the photograph, the  China Daily  later reported that the Great Wall can be seen from space with the naked eye, under favorable viewing conditions, if one knows exactly where to look.

In ancient to modern times, they were used to enclose settlements. Generally, these are referred to as  city walls  or  town walls , although there were also  walls , such as the  Great Wall of China ,  Hadrian's Wall , and the metaphorical  Atlantic Wall , which extended far beyond the borders of a  city  and were used to enclose regions or mark territorial boundaries. Beyond their defensive utility many walls also had important symbolic functions  representing the status and independence of the communities they embraced.   Existing ancient walls are almost always  masonry  structures, although brick and timber-built variants are also known. Depending on the  topography  of the area surrounding the city or the settlement the wall is intended to protect, elements of the terrain (e.g. rivers or coastlines) may be incorporated in order to make the wall more effective.   Walls may only be crossed by entering the appropriate  city gate  and are often supplemented with  towers . In the Middle Ages, the right of a settlement to build a defensive wall was a privilege, and was usually granted by the so-called ""right of  crenellation "" on a  medieval fortification . The practice of building these massive walls, though having its origins in prehistory, was refined during the rise of  city-states , and energetic wall-building continued into the medieval period and beyond in certain parts of Europe.           Contents       1   History   2   Composition   3   Decline   4   Modern era   5   See also   6   Notes   7   References               [ edit ]   History   From very early history to modern times, walls have been a near necessity for every city.  Uruk  in ancient  Sumer  ( Mesopotamia ) is one of the world's oldest known walled cities. Before that, the city (or rather  proto-city ) of  Jericho  in what is now the  West Bank  had  a wall  surrounding it as early as the 8th millennium BC.   The  Assyrians  deployed large labour forces to build new palaces, temples and defensive walls. [ 1 ]   Some settlements in the  Indus Valley Civilization  were also fortified. By about 3500 B.C., hundreds of small farming villages dotted the  Indus  floodplain. Many of these settlements had fortifications and planned streets. The stone and mud brick houses of  Kot Diji  were clustered behind massive stone flood dykes and defensive walls, for neighboring communities quarreled constantly about the control of prime agricultural land. [ 2 ]  Mundigak (c. 2500 B.C.) in present day south-east  Afghanistan  has defensive walls and square bastions of sun dried bricks. [ 3 ]   Exceptions were few  notably, ancient  Sparta  and ancient  Rome  did not have walls for a long time, choosing to rely on their militaries for defense instead. Initially, these fortifications were simple constructions of wood and earth, which were later replaced by mixed constructions of stones piled on top of each other without  mortar .   In Central Europe, the  Celts  built large fortified settlements known as  oppida , whose walls seem partially influenced by those built in the Mediterranean. The  fortifications  were continuously expanded and improved.   In  ancient Greece , large stone walls had been built in  Mycenaean Greece , such as the ancient site of  Mycenae  (famous for the huge stone blocks of its ' cyclopean ' walls). In classical era Greece, the city of  Athens  built a long set of parallel stone walls called the  Long Walls  that reached their guarded seaport at  Piraeus .   Large tempered earth (ie.  rammed earth ) walls were built in  ancient China  since the  Shang Dynasty  (c. 1600-1050 BC), as the capital at ancient Ao had enormous walls built in this fashion (see  siege  for more info). Although stone walls were built in China during the  Warring States  (481-221 BC), mass conversion to stone architecture did not begin in earnest until the  Tang Dynasty  (618-907 AD). In terms of China's longest and most impressive fortification, the  Great Wall  had been built since the  Qin Dynasty  (221-207 BC), although its present form was mostly an engineering feat and remodeling of the  Ming Dynasty  (1368-1644 AD) during the 15th and 16th centuries. The large walls of  Pingyao  serve as one example. Likewise, the famous walls of the  Forbidden City  in  Beijing  were established in the early 15th century by the  Yongle Emperor .   The  Romans  fortified their cities with massive, mortar-bound stone walls. The most famous of these are the largely extant  Aurelian Walls  of  Rome  and the  Theodosian Walls  of  Constantinople , together with partial remains elsewhere. These are mostly city gates, like the  Porta Nigra  in  Trier  or  Newport Arch  in  Lincoln .   Apart from these, the early  Middle Ages  also saw the creation of some towns built around castles. These cities were only rarely protected by simple stone walls and more usually by a combination of both walls and  ditches . From the 12th century AD hundreds of settlements of all sizes were founded all across Europe, who very often obtained the right of  fortification  soon afterwards.   The founding of urban centers was an important means of territorial expansion and many cities, especially in eastern Europe, were founded precisely for this purpose during the period of  Eastern Colonisation . These cities are easy to recognise due to their regular layout and large market spaces. The fortifications of these settlements were continuously improved to reflect the current level of military development.   During the Renaissance era, the Venetians raised great walls around cities threatened by the Ottoman empire. The finest examples are, among others, in Nicosia (Cyprus) and Chania (Crete), which still stand to this day.     [ edit ]   Composition          Model of  Gttingen 's city defenses during the Thirty Years' War.       At its most simple, a defensive wall consists of a wall enclosure and its gates. For the most part, the top of the walls were accessible, with the outside of the walls having tall  parapets  with  embrasures  or  merlons . North of the Alps, this passageway at the top of the walls occasionally had a roof.   In addition to this, many different enhancements were made over the course of the centuries:     City ditch: a ditch dug in front of the walls, occasionally filled with water.   Gate tower: a tower built next to, or on top of the city gates to better defend the city gates.   Wall tower : a tower built on top of a segment of the wall, which usually extended outwards slightly, so as to be able to observe the exterior of the walls on either side. In addition to arrow slits, ballistae, catapults and cannons could be mounted on top for extra defence.   Pre-wall: wall built outside the wall proper, usually of lesser height  the space in between was usually further subdivided by additional walls.   Additional obstacles in front of the walls.     The defensive towers of west and south European fortifications in the Middle Ages were often very regularly and uniformly constructed (cf.  vila ,  Provins ), whereas Central European city walls tend to show a variety of different styles. In these cases, the gate and wall towers often reach up to considerable heights, and gates equipped with two towers on either side are much rarer. Apart from the purely military, defensive purpose, towers also played an important representative and artistic role in the conception of a fortified complex. In many senses, the architecture of the city thus competed with that of the castle of the noblemen and city walls were often a manifestation of the pride of a particular city.   Urban areas outside the city walls, so-called  Vorstdte , were often enclosed by their own set of walls and integrated into the defense of the city. These areas were often inhabited by the poorer population and held the ""noxious trades"". In many cities, a new wall was built once the city had grown outside of the old wall. This can often still be seen in the layout of the city, for example in  Nrdlingen , and sometimes even a few of the old gate towers are preserved, such as the  white tower  in  Nrnberg . Additional constructions prevented the circumvention of the city, through which many important trade routes passed, thus ensuring that tolls were paid when the caravans passed through the city gates, and that the local market was visited by the trade caravans. Furthermore, additional signaling and observation towers were frequently built outside the city, and were sometimes fortified in a castle-like fashion. The border of the area of influence of the city was often partially or fully defended by elaborate ditches, walls and/or hedges. The crossing points were usually guarded by gates or gate houses. These defenses were regularly checked by riders, who often also served as the gate keepers. Long stretches of these defenses can still be seen to this day, and even some gates are still intact. To further protect their territory, rich cities also established castles in their area of influence. A famous example of this practice is the Romanian ""Dracula Castle"" at Bran/Trzburg, which was intended to protect Kronstadt (today's  Braov ).   The city walls were often connected to the fortifications of hill castles via additional walls . Thus the defenses were made up of city and castle fortifications taken together. Several examples of this are preserved, for example in Germany  Hirschhorn  on the Neckar,  Knigsberg  and  Pappenheim ,  Franken ,  Burghausen  in  Oberbayern  and many more. A few castles were more directly incorporated into the defensive strategy of the city (e.g.  Nrnberg ,  Zons ,  Carcassonne ), or the cities were directly outside the castle as a sort of ""pre-castle"" ( Coucy-le-Chateau ,  Conwy  and others). Larger cities often had multiple stewards  for example  Augsburg  was divided into a  Reichstadt  and a bishopal (clerical) city. These different parts were often separated by their own fortifications.   With the development of firearms came the necessity to expand the existing installation, which occurred in multiples stages. Firstly, additional, half-circular towers were added in the interstices between the walls and pre-walls (s.a.) in which a handful of  cannons  could be placed. Soon after, reinforcing structures  or "" bastions ""  were added in strategically relevant positions, e.g. at the gates or corners. A well-preserved example of this is the  Spitalbastei  in  Rothenburg . However, at this stage the cities were still only protected by relatively thin walls which could offer little resistance to the cannons of the time. Therefore new,  star forts  with numerous cannons and thick earth walls reinforced by stone were built. These could resist cannon fire for prolonged periods of time. However, these massive fortifications severely limited the growth of the cities, as it was much more difficult to move them as compared to the simple walls previously employed  to make matters worse, it was forbidden to build ""outside the city gates"" for strategic reasons and the cities became more and more densely populated as a result.           Chinese  and  Korean  troops assault the  Japanese  forces of  Hideyoshi  in the  Siege of Ulsan  Castle during the  Imjin War  (15921598).         [ edit ]   Decline   In the wake of city growth and the ensuing change of defensive strategy, focusing more on the defense of  forts  around cities, most city walls were demolished. Nowadays, the presence of former city fortifications can often only be deduced from the presence of ditches or parks.   Furthermore, some street names hint at the presence of fortifications in times past, for example when words such as ""wall"" or ""glacis"" occur.   In the 19th century, less emphasis was placed on preserving the fortifications for the sake of their architectural or historical value  on the one hand, complete fortifications were restored ( Carcassonne ), on the other hand many structures were demolished in an effort to modernize the cities. A notable exception in this is the ""monument preservation"" law by the Bavarian King  Ludwig I of Bavaria , which led to the nearly complete preservation of many impressive monuments such as the  Rothenburg ob der Tauber ,  Nrdlingen  and  Dinkelsbhl . The countless small fortified towns in the  Franken  region were also preserved as a consequence of this edict.     [ edit ]   Modern era          View of the  Berlin wall       Walls and fortified wall structures were built in the modern era, too. They did not, however have the original purpose of being a structure able to resist a prolonged siege or bombardment.   Berlin's city wall from the 1730s to the 1860s was partially made of wood. Its primary purpose was to enable the city to impose tolls on goods and, secondarily, also served to prevent the desertion of soldiers from the garrison in Berlin.   The  Berlin wall  was a different form of wall, in that it did not exclusively serve the purpose of protection of an enclosed settlement. One of its purposes was to prevent the crossing of the Berlin border between the  GDR  and the  West German   exclave  of  west-Berlin .   Defensive walls have been built in Korea along the De-militarised Zone.   Further walls of the 20th century are found in  Israel  where many exclaves of Jewish settlements are surrounded by fortified walls, as are many parts of  Belfast ,  Northern Ireland  by the  Belfast Peace Lines .   Additionally, in some countries, different embassies may be grouped together in a single ""embassy district,"" enclosed by a fortified complex with walls and towers  this usually occurs in regions where the embassies run a high risk of being target of attacks.   Most of these ""modern"" city walls are made of steel and concrete. Vertical concrete plates are put together so as to allow the least space in between them, and are rooted firmly in the ground. The top of the wall is often protruding and beset with  barbed wire  in order to make climbing them more difficult. These walls are usually built in straight lines and covered by watchtowers at the corners. Double walls, i.e. two walls with an interstitial ""zone of fire"" (cf. the Berlin wall) are rare.   The only extant city walls in North America are the historic ones in Old  Quebec City , Canada.

clueweb09-enwp03-24-17384	"                     Great Wall of Gorgan          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Wall of Alexander )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search          The  Great Wall of Gorgan , also called the Gorgan Defence Wall, Anushirvn Barrier, Firuz Barrier and Qazal Al'an, and sometimes  Sadd-i-Iskandar , ( Persian  for dam or  barrier  of  Alexander ) is an ancient defensive facility located in the  Gorgan  region of northeastern  Iran , in Antiquity known as  Hyrcania . [ 1 ]  It is also known as  The Red Snake  among archaeologists due to the colour of its bricks. It protects the  Caspian Gates  which in turn gave access for the nomads of the northern steppes to the Iranian heartland, and through which Alexander passed on his hasty march to  Hyrcania  and the east.   The wall is second only to the  Great Wall of China  as the longest defensive wall in existence, but over a thousand years older and of more solid construction [ 2 ]  than the present form of the Great Wall. Larger than  Hadrian's Wall  and the  Antonine Wall  taken together, it has been called the greatest monument of its kind between Europe and  China . [ 2 ]           Contents       1   Description   2   Dating   3   See also   4   Notes   5   External links               [ edit ]   Description   The barrier consists of a wall, 155 kilometres long and 6 to 10 metres wide, along the length of which are located a number of  fortresses , spaced at intervals of between 10 and 50 kilometres. The wall is made of standardized bricks, made from the local loess soil, and fired in kilns along the line of the wall. [ citation needed ]   This wall starts from the Caspian coast, circles north of  Gonbade Kavous , continues towards the northwest, and vanishes behind the Pishkamar Mountains. A logistical archaeological survey was conducted regarding the wall in 1999 due to problems in development projects, especially during construction of the Golestan Dam, which  irrigates  all the areas covered by the wall. At the point of the connection of the wall and the drainage  canal  from the dam, architects discovered the remains of the above wall. The 40 identified castles vary in dimension and shape but the majority are square fortresses, made of the same brickwork as the wall itself and at the same period. [ 3 ]  Due to many difficulties in development and agricultural projects, archaeologists have been assigned to mark the boundary of the historical find by laying cement blocks.   Attention must be likewise given to a similar  Sassanian  defence wall and fortification on the opposite side of the Caspian Sea at the port of  Derbent  and beyond. Where the Great Wall of Gorgan continues into the Sea at the  Gulf of Gorgan , on the far side of the Caspian emerges from the Sea the great wall of Caucasus at Derbent, complete with its extraordinarily well preserved Sassanian fort.   While the impressive fortification and walls on the east side of the  Caspian Sea  remained unknown to the Graeco-Roman historians, the western half of this impressive ""northern fortifications"" in the Caucasus were well known to the Classical authors.     [ edit ]   Dating   Dr. Kiani who led the archaeological team in 1971 believed that the wall was built during the  Parthian  dynasty simultaneously with the construction of the  Great Wall of China  and it was restored during the  Sassanid  era (3-7th c. A.D.) [ 4 ]  In 2005 a team excavated samples of charcoal from the many brick kilns along the wall, and samples from the Gorgan Wall and the smaller Wall of Tammishe;  OSL  and radiocarbon dating indicated a date for both walls in the late 5th or 6th century CE. [ 5 ]   ""If we assumed that the forts were occupied as densely as those on Hadrian's Wall, then the garrison on the Gorgan Wall would have been in the order of 30,000 men. Models, taking into account the size and room number of the barrack blocks in the Gorgan Wall forts and likely occupation density, produce figures between 15,000 and 36,000 soldiers. Even the lowest estimate suggests a strong and powerful army, all the more remarkable as our investigations focused just on 200km of vulnerable frontier, a small fraction of the thousands of kilometres of borders of one of the ancient world's largest empires.""

In ancient to modern times, they were used to enclose settlements. Generally, these are referred to as  city walls  or  town walls , although there were also  walls , such as the  Great Wall of China ,  Hadrian's Wall , and the metaphorical  Atlantic Wall , which extended far beyond the borders of a  city  and were used to enclose regions or mark territorial boundaries. Beyond their defensive utility many walls also had important symbolic functions  representing the status and independence of the communities they embraced.   Existing ancient walls are almost always  masonry  structures, although brick and timber-built variants are also known. Depending on the  topography  of the area surrounding the city or the settlement the wall is intended to protect, elements of the terrain (e.g. rivers or coastlines) may be incorporated in order to make the wall more effective.   Walls may only be crossed by entering the appropriate  city gate  and are often supplemented with  towers . In the Middle Ages, the right of a settlement to build a defensive wall was a privilege, and was usually granted by the so-called ""right of  crenellation "" on a  medieval fortification . The practice of building these massive walls, though having its origins in prehistory, was refined during the rise of  city-states , and energetic wall-building continued into the medieval period and beyond in certain parts of Europe.           Contents       1   History   2   Composition   3   Decline   4   Modern era   5   See also   6   Notes   7   References               [ edit ]   History   From very early history to modern times, walls have been a near necessity for every city.  Uruk  in ancient  Sumer  ( Mesopotamia ) is one of the world's oldest known walled cities. Before that, the city (or rather  proto-city ) of  Jericho  in what is now the  West Bank  had  a wall  surrounding it as early as the 8th millennium BC.   The  Assyrians  deployed large labour forces to build new palaces, temples and defensive walls. [ 1 ]   Some settlements in the  Indus Valley Civilization  were also fortified. By about 3500 B.C., hundreds of small farming villages dotted the  Indus  floodplain. Many of these settlements had fortifications and planned streets. The stone and mud brick houses of  Kot Diji  were clustered behind massive stone flood dykes and defensive walls, for neighboring communities quarreled constantly about the control of prime agricultural land. [ 2 ]  Mundigak (c. 2500 B.C.) in present day south-east  Afghanistan  has defensive walls and square bastions of sun dried bricks. [ 3 ]   Exceptions were few  notably, ancient  Sparta  and ancient  Rome  did not have walls for a long time, choosing to rely on their militaries for defense instead. Initially, these fortifications were simple constructions of wood and earth, which were later replaced by mixed constructions of stones piled on top of each other without  mortar .   In Central Europe, the  Celts  built large fortified settlements known as  oppida , whose walls seem partially influenced by those built in the Mediterranean. The  fortifications  were continuously expanded and improved.   In  ancient Greece , large stone walls had been built in  Mycenaean Greece , such as the ancient site of  Mycenae  (famous for the huge stone blocks of its ' cyclopean ' walls). In classical era Greece, the city of  Athens  built a long set of parallel stone walls called the  Long Walls  that reached their guarded seaport at  Piraeus .   Large tempered earth (ie.  rammed earth ) walls were built in  ancient China  since the  Shang Dynasty  (c. 1600-1050 BC), as the capital at ancient Ao had enormous walls built in this fashion (see  siege  for more info). Although stone walls were built in China during the  Warring States  (481-221 BC), mass conversion to stone architecture did not begin in earnest until the  Tang Dynasty  (618-907 AD). In terms of China's longest and most impressive fortification, the  Great Wall  had been built since the  Qin Dynasty  (221-207 BC), although its present form was mostly an engineering feat and remodeling of the  Ming Dynasty  (1368-1644 AD) during the 15th and 16th centuries. The large walls of  Pingyao  serve as one example. Likewise, the famous walls of the  Forbidden City  in  Beijing  were established in the early 15th century by the  Yongle Emperor .   The  Romans  fortified their cities with massive, mortar-bound stone walls. The most famous of these are the largely extant  Aurelian Walls  of  Rome  and the  Theodosian Walls  of  Constantinople , together with partial remains elsewhere. These are mostly city gates, like the  Porta Nigra  in  Trier  or  Newport Arch  in  Lincoln .   Apart from these, the early  Middle Ages  also saw the creation of some towns built around castles. These cities were only rarely protected by simple stone walls and more usually by a combination of both walls and  ditches . From the 12th century AD hundreds of settlements of all sizes were founded all across Europe, who very often obtained the right of  fortification  soon afterwards.   The founding of urban centers was an important means of territorial expansion and many cities, especially in eastern Europe, were founded precisely for this purpose during the period of  Eastern Colonisation . These cities are easy to recognise due to their regular layout and large market spaces. The fortifications of these settlements were continuously improved to reflect the current level of military development.   During the Renaissance era, the Venetians raised great walls around cities threatened by the Ottoman empire. The finest examples are, among others, in Nicosia (Cyprus) and Chania (Crete), which still stand to this day.     [ edit ]   Composition          Model of  Gttingen 's city defenses during the Thirty Years' War.       At its most simple, a defensive wall consists of a wall enclosure and its gates. For the most part, the top of the walls were accessible, with the outside of the walls having tall  parapets  with  embrasures  or  merlons . North of the Alps, this passageway at the top of the walls occasionally had a roof.   In addition to this, many different enhancements were made over the course of the centuries:     City ditch: a ditch dug in front of the walls, occasionally filled with water.   Gate tower: a tower built next to, or on top of the city gates to better defend the city gates.   Wall tower : a tower built on top of a segment of the wall, which usually extended outwards slightly, so as to be able to observe the exterior of the walls on either side. In addition to arrow slits, ballistae, catapults and cannons could be mounted on top for extra defence.   Pre-wall: wall built outside the wall proper, usually of lesser height  the space in between was usually further subdivided by additional walls.   Additional obstacles in front of the walls.     The defensive towers of west and south European fortifications in the Middle Ages were often very regularly and uniformly constructed (cf.  vila ,  Provins ), whereas Central European city walls tend to show a variety of different styles. In these cases, the gate and wall towers often reach up to considerable heights, and gates equipped with two towers on either side are much rarer. Apart from the purely military, defensive purpose, towers also played an important representative and artistic role in the conception of a fortified complex. In many senses, the architecture of the city thus competed with that of the castle of the noblemen and city walls were often a manifestation of the pride of a particular city.   Urban areas outside the city walls, so-called  Vorstdte , were often enclosed by their own set of walls and integrated into the defense of the city. These areas were often inhabited by the poorer population and held the ""noxious trades"". In many cities, a new wall was built once the city had grown outside of the old wall. This can often still be seen in the layout of the city, for example in  Nrdlingen , and sometimes even a few of the old gate towers are preserved, such as the  white tower  in  Nrnberg . Additional constructions prevented the circumvention of the city, through which many important trade routes passed, thus ensuring that tolls were paid when the caravans passed through the city gates, and that the local market was visited by the trade caravans. Furthermore, additional signaling and observation towers were frequently built outside the city, and were sometimes fortified in a castle-like fashion. The border of the area of influence of the city was often partially or fully defended by elaborate ditches, walls and/or hedges. The crossing points were usually guarded by gates or gate houses. These defenses were regularly checked by riders, who often also served as the gate keepers. Long stretches of these defenses can still be seen to this day, and even some gates are still intact. To further protect their territory, rich cities also established castles in their area of influence. A famous example of this practice is the Romanian ""Dracula Castle"" at Bran/Trzburg, which was intended to protect Kronstadt (today's  Braov ).   The city walls were often connected to the fortifications of hill castles via additional walls . Thus the defenses were made up of city and castle fortifications taken together. Several examples of this are preserved, for example in Germany  Hirschhorn  on the Neckar,  Knigsberg  and  Pappenheim ,  Franken ,  Burghausen  in  Oberbayern  and many more. A few castles were more directly incorporated into the defensive strategy of the city (e.g.  Nrnberg ,  Zons ,  Carcassonne ), or the cities were directly outside the castle as a sort of ""pre-castle"" ( Coucy-le-Chateau ,  Conwy  and others). Larger cities often had multiple stewards  for example  Augsburg  was divided into a  Reichstadt  and a bishopal (clerical) city. These different parts were often separated by their own fortifications.   With the development of firearms came the necessity to expand the existing installation, which occurred in multiples stages. Firstly, additional, half-circular towers were added in the interstices between the walls and pre-walls (s.a.) in which a handful of  cannons  could be placed. Soon after, reinforcing structures  or "" bastions ""  were added in strategically relevant positions, e.g. at the gates or corners. A well-preserved example of this is the  Spitalbastei  in  Rothenburg . However, at this stage the cities were still only protected by relatively thin walls which could offer little resistance to the cannons of the time. Therefore new,  star forts  with numerous cannons and thick earth walls reinforced by stone were built. These could resist cannon fire for prolonged periods of time. However, these massive fortifications severely limited the growth of the cities, as it was much more difficult to move them as compared to the simple walls previously employed  to make matters worse, it was forbidden to build ""outside the city gates"" for strategic reasons and the cities became more and more densely populated as a result.           Chinese  and  Korean  troops assault the  Japanese  forces of  Hideyoshi  in the  Siege of Ulsan  Castle during the  Imjin War  (15921598).         [ edit ]   Decline   In the wake of city growth and the ensuing change of defensive strategy, focusing more on the defense of  forts  around cities, most city walls were demolished. Nowadays, the presence of former city fortifications can often only be deduced from the presence of ditches or parks.   Furthermore, some street names hint at the presence of fortifications in times past, for example when words such as ""wall"" or ""glacis"" occur.   In the 19th century, less emphasis was placed on preserving the fortifications for the sake of their architectural or historical value  on the one hand, complete fortifications were restored ( Carcassonne ), on the other hand many structures were demolished in an effort to modernize the cities. A notable exception in this is the ""monument preservation"" law by the Bavarian King  Ludwig I of Bavaria , which led to the nearly complete preservation of many impressive monuments such as the  Rothenburg ob der Tauber ,  Nrdlingen  and  Dinkelsbhl . The countless small fortified towns in the  Franken  region were also preserved as a consequence of this edict.     [ edit ]   Modern era          View of the  Berlin wall       Walls and fortified wall structures were built in the modern era, too. They did not, however have the original purpose of being a structure able to resist a prolonged siege or bombardment.   Berlin's city wall from the 1730s to the 1860s was partially made of wood. Its primary purpose was to enable the city to impose tolls on goods and, secondarily, also served to prevent the desertion of soldiers from the garrison in Berlin.   The  Berlin wall  was a different form of wall, in that it did not exclusively serve the purpose of protection of an enclosed settlement. One of its purposes was to prevent the crossing of the Berlin border between the  GDR  and the  West German   exclave  of  west-Berlin .   Defensive walls have been built in Korea along the De-militarised Zone.   Further walls of the 20th century are found in  Israel  where many exclaves of Jewish settlements are surrounded by fortified walls, as are many parts of  Belfast ,  Northern Ireland  by the  Belfast Peace Lines .   Additionally, in some countries, different embassies may be grouped together in a single ""embassy district,"" enclosed by a fortified complex with walls and towers  this usually occurs in regions where the embassies run a high risk of being target of attacks.   Most of these ""modern"" city walls are made of steel and concrete. Vertical concrete plates are put together so as to allow the least space in between them, and are rooted firmly in the ground. The top of the wall is often protruding and beset with  barbed wire  in order to make climbing them more difficult. These walls are usually built in straight lines and covered by watchtowers at the corners. Double walls, i.e. two walls with an interstitial ""zone of fire"" (cf. the Berlin wall) are rare.   The only extant city walls in North America are the historic ones in Old  Quebec City , Canada.

Up to ten crews are removed from the bottom of last year's finishing order, who must then race alongside new entrants to decide which crews gain a place (with one bumps place per 3 crews competing, subject to the maximum of 10 available places).

AlKhatim's religious journey began in Mecca from whence he travelled to  Tarim  in  Yemen  and then to  Somalia  by sea and to  Massawa  on the  Red Sea  coast where he travelled inland into the  Ethiopian  hinterland before returning to Mecca.

AlKhatim traversed the  Nubian  lands of the  Mahas  and the Sakot and went to  Kordofan  and reached the lands of the  Fur people  and the  Borno  tribe.

AlKhatim, at only 25 years of age, managed to overcome personal physical risk, the harsh geography and the tribal complexities of these lands to call its people to Islam and to set up  mosques  and Islamic centres of learning which created a link between these lands and the  Islamic World .

clueweb09-en0001-88-02305	"    Ancient Coin Vocabulary      Describing Ancient Coins   The Vocabulary of Classical Numismatics - Part 6      This site has been dedicated to the spreading of the 'word' on ancient coins.  While some attempt has been made to do this in comprehensible English, it has been necessary to use a specialized vocabulary that might not be understood fully by every person.  This continues our series that  will attempt to correct this problem.  If you have not seen the earlier pages, I would suggest starting there:  Part One. Roman Imperial Coins - the Late Empire     Our final page on the Roman Empire begins with the coinage  Reform  of Diocletian and continues to the fall of the Empire in the West (traditional date 476 AD).  As before, many terms needed to understand coins of the period have been covered on earlier pages of this series and will be mentioned here only as reinforcement.  There are, however, several new terms to be learned in this section.     Diocletian, AE1, Alexandria mint, c.300 AD    The coinage reform of 294 AD saw the introduction of several new coins.  Most important was the one known to collectors as the  Follis  or  Nummus .  At about 10g and 30mm diameter these silver washed coins were quite impressive compared to the issues they replaced.  The problem is that history has not recorded what the coins were called by the people that used them.  For years collectors used the name Follis (plural Folles) but it is reasonably certain that this term should be reserved for the much later  Byzantine  coins of 40 nummi and is inappropriate for these issues.  Other writers use Nummus which simply means ""coin"".  This student prefers to use the size scale which does not attempt to force a name on the unknown denominations but does serve to distinguish the various issues by size.  As we will see, inflation caused the decline in size of the coins so persons using either of the names will apply the same word to coins vastly different in size.  The diameter of coins of the same issue will vary a bit due to striking (there was no collar to keep the coins from spreading out as they were struck).  The traditional size scale forces coins into four groups by diameter and numbers these bronze (AE) coin groups one through four from largest to smallest.  Therefore:   AE1 = over 25mm AE2 = 21 - 25mm AE3 = 17 - 21mm AE4 = under 17mm  As a footnote we should note that this is completely different from the system used for Greek coins discussed on the first page of this series.  Our coin is an AE1 from the mint of Alexandria.  It bears  the city mark ALE (in exergue) and the officina numeral E (=5 in right field).  XXI indicates that the coin still contains the familiar alloy of one part silver to 20 parts copper.  Relatively few of the  post-reform  are marked with the allow mark and the coins tested rarely measure up to that high of a standard.  Prices at this time were quoted in a money of reckoning,  the  denarii communes .  In the early part of the reform the AE1/Follis/Nummus appears to have been valued at five denarii communes.  This ratio would change several times in the next few decades.  It is believed that these coins were valued at 1/5 a new silver denomination (of unknown name but called Argenteus by collectors).  Relative value to the gold Aureus is less certain and seems to have floated according to the market demand.  The portrait on our example shows the 'bull necked' look that became fashionable at the time of the reform.  The realism of the Emperor as First Citizen of the Empire was being replaced with a formalism showing him more as a Lord.  The reverse shows the most common type used on these issues:  Genius  of the Roman People (GENIO POPVLI ROMANI) standing holding a  cornucopia  (horn of plenty) and pouring a sacrifice from a  patera  (dish).    Maximianus, AE Post-Reform Radiate, Cyzicus mint, 295-299 AD    A second denomination of the Reform is called the  Post-Reform Radiate .  This coin appears to have been valued at 2 denarii communes making it the theoretical equivalent of the old antoninianus which it greatly resembles.  The big difference here is that this coin contained no (or only a trace) silver and was NOT issued with the silver coating that was used on antoniniani and the large coin described above.  Inflation quickly made these small coins of little demand and they were discontinued.  For collectors, it is important to note that no post-reform radiate bears the XXI mark.  This student observes that these coins often have surfaces more smooth and evenly patinated than the silvered coins.  It seems that the small amount of silver or the silver plating caused many coins to survive with rough or patchy surfaces while the silverless radiates are often more smooth and attractive.  This example in the name of Maximianus, joint Augustus with Diocletian, shows  a  sand patina  which is nothing more than soil packed on the surface of the coin and hardened over time.  While the soil would clean off with relative ease, the contrast it gives the coin is considered attractive by many collectors.  The reverse shows Jupiter presenting Victory to the Emperor, a common type on old antoniniani.  In the reverse field is the mint city initial K and the officina numeral  D .  Accompanying this coin but not shown here was a smaller silverless bronze with portrait wearing laurel wreath which represented the denarius or half the radiate.   Constantine I as Caesar, AE1, Rome mint, 307 AD    Our first coin of Constantine I  (the Great) is unusual in several ways.  It dates to early in his career when he was fighting for recognition as successor to his father Constantius I Augustus in the West.  The coin was struck at Rome which was under the control of Maxentius (whom in 313 AD Constantine would defeat at Milvian Bridge).  Our coin shows Constantine bearing the junior title of Caesar by which he was recognized in the East but other coins of this same type show him as Augustus indicating that Maxentius changed his level recognition of Constantine.  While still AE1 diameter, this coin weighs only 6g or a little over half the first coins of the AE1 denomination.  It is a rather thin coin.  Other mints at this time were issuing thicker AE2 coins with the same weight.  The mints under Maxentius often used  Architectural  types such as this scene of Roma in a Hexastyle (six column) temple.  The mintmark shows the city initial R and 4th officina Q (quartus) with a star between the letters.     Anonymous Pagan Issue, AE4, Antioch mint, c.310 AD    Even smaller in size than the bronze laureate 'denarii' are issues of strange little coins not bearing the name or portrait of an emperor.  These  Anonymous  coins show a pagan god on each side (two reverse types, if you please).  They are often called 1/4 nummus pieces but their exact place in the scheme is not known.  The obvious question is why they were issued.  Numismatists of the 19th century assigned these coins to the Pagan Revival under Julian II (360-363 AD) but this is now realized to be incorrect and the coins are assigned to the time of the Great Persecution under Galerius and Maximinus II.  Citizens at that time were required to perform a sacrifice to prove their piety to the state.  Christians considered this act sacrelegious and refused preferring to suffer death or imprisonment.  I see a distinct possibility that these coins served some role in that sacrifice.  Perhaps the requirement was as simple as throwing a sacred coin of minimal value  in the offering plate at a temple.  Perhaps this is not a coin at all but a receipt of having complied with the requirement.  This is a matter needing study.  The obverse of our example shows  Fortune (Tyche) of Antioch with swimmer (River Orontes) at her feet.  This copies the bronze statue  by Eutychides of Sicyon which was commissioned by Seleucus I when the city was founded.  The reverse shows Apollo holding his lyre.  The figure is a copy of the massive acrolithic statue of Apollo by Bryaxis that stood in the temple at Antioch.  Ancient descriptions of these statues (both now lost) enable us to be certain of the identifications.  The mintmark SMA expands to  Sacra Moneta  (Sacred Money) of Antioch.  In the field is the additive numeral of officina 9 (5+4) as seen on our previous page.  This use in itself suggests the error of the attribution to Julian since coins of his period used   Q  for officina 9.     Licinius I, AE3, Arles mint, 315 AD    By the date of our next coin, the basic denomination (Follis/Nummus) was being struck at AE3 size.  This is termed by many collectors a  Reduced  Follis or Nummus.  This example weighs 4.3g and  has lost all trace of its original silvering.  The coin shows Licinius I, ruler in the East even though the mint at Arles was under the control of Constantine.  For a decade the two Augusti alternately fought and made truces which included recognizing each other by issuing coins from their mints in the both of their names.  The reverse shows Sol the sun god (still popular as when we previously met him as Oriens under Aurelian).  In exergue we see the officina P (Primus) followed by the mint city ARL.  Coins of the many issues during the early part of the 4th Century often bear code letters in the fields.  Some of these give a value in terms of some other money; some probably refer to some other matter of mint organization; some are just not understood.  The best guess offered for the SF across the field here is Saeculi Felicitas (Happy Days) but I can not offer a reason why the mint felt the need to include these letters on this particular issue.  Licinius II Caesar, AE3, Antioch mint, 321-323 AD    Our next coin shows the young son of Licinius I, Licinius II Caesar.  With the same name as his father, coins of Licinius II are distinguished by the fact that he was only Caesar (often, as here NOB C = noble Caesar) while his father was always Augustus not holding the junior office prior to being made Augustus.  Another clue would be the fact that Licinius II was about two years old when named Caesar in 317 and about seven when this coin was issued showing him dressed in full military armor.  Portraiture was aged a bit to make it look like the Empire was certain to have a suitable successor.  Constantine had  four sons (only one of which was as old as a teen) so many coins of this period depict young rulers.  The reverse shows Jupiter holding Victory and accompanied by his eagle and a seated captive.  The mintmark reads SM (Sacred Money) ANT (the city) and Z (=7 the officina as a Greek numeral) all in the manner we have seen before.  What is new is the numeral in the right field. Inflation ravaged the Roman economy.  Since the coin supply in a cash based economy needs to mirror the actual purchasing power they represented, it was necessary to remove old issues from circulation and reissue new coins on the newly appropriate standards.  This resulted in a repetitive cycle of demonitization of the old coin followed by remelting and reissues.   This coin marks the reduction in value by half of all coins in circulation with the Follis/Nummus dropping from a theoretical value of 25 denarii (we skipped the steps when it jumped from 5 to 25!) to 12 and a half.  Doing this effectively reduced (by half) the purchasing power of money in circulation.  The numeral is XII^ or 12 and a half.  The sign for a half is variously shaped on different coins.  These look like an S, half an M or the Greek  G  and probably should be read as 'semis'.  This marking was used only for a short time before another round of inflation changed the rules again.    AE3 Constantinople - Nikomedia mint -  330-337 AD - AE3/4 Urbs Roma  - Antioch mint   To honor the founding of his new capital at Constantinople, Constantine issued a large series of  Commemorative  coins for both the new and the old capitals.  On the left we see the personification of Constantinople with a reverse type of Victory on a prow.  On the right URBS ROMA (City of Rome) with the classic scene of the wolf and twins (Romulus and Remus, legendary founders of Rome).  These coins were issued for several years and experienced some reduction in size straddling the border between AE3 and AE4.  Frequently we see them sold as AE3/4 recognizing that some of the coins are too big to be one while some are too small to be the other.  The Roma coin shows two additional points of interest.  The mintmark includes the officina 9 numeral  Q  now, under Christianity, no longer avoided due to superstition.  Several issues of the series bear code marks of unknown meaning.  On our wolf's shoulder there is a star not found on most issues.  Some collectors are particularly fond of these marked coins.  Divus Constantine, AE3/4, Antioch mint, c.337 AD     Upon the death of Constantine the Great, a consecration issue was issued by his surviving sons.  These continued for several years and included several varieties.  Our example shows Constantine veiled with legend DV (Divus) CONSTANTINVS PT(father) AVGG (of the Augusti).  The reverse type is exceptional.  Constantine, in a chariot, is riding off to heaven  reaching out to take the hand of God extended down from above.  It appears that mints under control of one son, Constans, did not participate in the issue.  It has been questioned if this indicates a problem between father and son or if Constans considered the deification of a Christian inappropriate.   Constantine had been baptized a Christian on his deathbed so this coin commemorates his becoming a Saint (as he is recognized in the Eastern Church).   This was the last consecration issue on which an Emperor was titled 'Divus'.      Constantius II, AR Siliqua, Arles mint, 355-360 AD    Constantius II, son of Constantine I who survived and ruled the longest, is most often associated with the massive issue of  FEL TEMP REPARATIO  coins.  Since I have a separate page on these silvered bronzes, Constantius will be represented by another popular coin, the silver Siliqua (again a name provided by collectors but not by history).  Several denominations of silver were struck during the 4th century and the relations between these and the silvered bronzes is not at all clear.  A particularly large issue of silver was made from several mints near the end of the reign of Constantius II.  The portrait shows a  diadem  replacing the laurel wreath common in earlier periods.  These decorations are found in several forms including the Pearl variety seen here.  The  reverse shows VOTIS XXX MVLTIS XXXX in a wreath.  This commemorates Constantius' renewing his vows to serve the state for another decade on completion of his 30th year.   Vota  issues were particularly common during the reigns of Constantine and his sons.  Numerals range for an initial five year (VOT V) to the large number shown on our example.  The mintmark of this coin includes the officina ordinal abbreviation P (Primus)  and the city name CON.  The city Arles was renamed Constantina in 328 AD creating confusion among collectors with coins of Constantinople.  The obverse legend begins with DN (Dominus Noster = Our Lord) which became the standard title of rulers from this time to the end of the Empire.  This title change reflects the development of the Emperors from the civil servants of the early period to the absolute monarchs of the late Empire.   Magnentius, AE2, Arles mint, c.353 AD    Civil wars between the sons of Constantine occupied the years following his death.  The situation was made more complex when Magnentius overthrew Constans and set himself up as Augustus in the West.  After three years of independence, Magnentius was killed and the Empire reunited under Constantius II.  Coins of Magnentius show several types not seen on other rulers of the period including the extremely popular Christian symbol the  Christogram  or Chi-Rho.   While he assumed the title Augustus, it is interesting that Magnentius is shown with a bare headed portrait rather than the Laurel wreath or diadem common to other Augusti.  Workmanship in this period was not consistently high with many coins showing partial legend or other signs of rushed work.  Note the die break running from Magnentius' nose to the edge of the flan and the very irregular flan of our example.   Note that the city of Arles reverted to its previous name while under control of Magnentius.  The mintmark in exergue reads (weakly) S (Secundus) AR.     Theodosius I, AE2, Alexandria mint       Following the death of the last member of the House of Constantine,  Rome was ruled by the dynasty known as the House of Valentinian and Theodosius.  Named for its founder Valentinian and its most prominent member, this dynasty ruled for nearly a century.  Their bronze coins were issued without silvering in all four size groups (although AE1's were unusual and only in the very beginning of the period).  Most common are AE3's showing types with military references or Victory.  During much of the period, power was shared by several rulers so the same types can be found in several names from several mints.  As in the earlier period, officina marks and series markings are common.  Our example is an AE2 of Theodosius I.  The bust is a military style with helmet and spear.  The reverse shows Victory steering the ship of state carrying the Emperor in military dress.  The reverse legend GLOR AI  ROMANORVM contains a small spelling  Error  for GLORIA ROMANORVM.  Error coins are much more commonly found in ancient coins than in modern, machine made issues.  Each die was cut individually and oddities often were overlooked.  In addition to die errors, many coins show striking or production errors.  These include  brockages, clashed dies , doublestrikes and  overstrikes .  While many collectors enjoy errors as a specialty, they are a  segment of the numismatic vocabulary that can be postponed until the student has mastered the more standard terms.  We will leave them here with this mention.     Theodosius II (Augustus in the East) AV Solidus, Constantinople mint, 441- 450 AD    Gold, in the late Empire, was issued as the  solidus  as well as its fractions and rare multiples.  Gold was required for many transactions and taxes even though the bronzes and silver might be used for daily commerce.  Following the reign of Theodosius I, the Empire was split into Eastern and Western parts with separate Emperors.  While some issued coins for their colleagues, the split was permanent with the prosperous East watching as the West (and Rome itself) fell into control of the barbarian tribes that had pressured the Empire for centuries.  Our example from the late part of the reign shows Theodosius II,  grandson of Theodosius I and son of Arcadius.  He was made Augustus in 402 AD at 9 months of age.  Ruling (at first through regents) for 48 years (a record), the Emperor was required to pay huge numbers of solidi to  barbarians  (including Attila the Hun) to maintain their position.  It may not be too far fetched to think this coin may have been part of that tribute.  It is certain that the coin has served as a decoration in more modern jewelry. Four small marks around the edge show where it was once held by prongs.   Ex-jewelry  coins are considered damaged by collectors and sell for much less than perfect coins.   Facing  military portraits as shown here became fashionable  during the last century of the Empire.  Leo I (Augustus in the East), AE4, Constantinople mint, 457-474 AD    The 5th century saw a continuation in the shrinking of the standard coin (whatever we choose to call it).  These are often termed  Nummi Minimi  or smallest coins.  Along with falling size came a reduction in quality of workmanship.  It is very rare to find a coin of this period that shows as much as half the legends.  Our example is at least typical if not better than most.  At 11mm and 1.2g this coin is twice the weight of many of its day but all were the same denomination.  Western mint coins are often much more crude than this.  Coins were gathered in pouches to make transactions easier so each coin was just a part of the group rather than money in its own right.  Bronzes floated with the market in terms of the number that would be traded for a gold solidus but 7200 is a good average.  The flan on our example has a natural hole (mostly filled with dirt) and is, at best, ragged and poorly struck.  The mintmark is off flan but is most likely CON for Constantinople  which is known to be the source of this obverse variety reading DN  L EONS PF AVG (substituting the Greek letter for the L in Leo) used with the Latin monogram (the letters of Leonis).  Monograms of the ruler's name was a popular reverse type for small bronzes of this period.  This was the pathetic end of Roman Bronze coinage.  The next reform introducing new (and much better) bronzes would take place under the Emperor Anastasius and is considered by collectors to mark the beginning of the Byzantine coinage.

Comparable engravings have been described, even further east, around  Djelfa  and in the region of  Constantine . Although in the past some authors affirmed that that these engravings derived from European  Paleolithic art , this theory is today definitively rejected.

The most important works are notably those of A. Pomel (from 1893 to 1898), Stphane Gsell (from 1901 to 1927), G. B. M. Flamand (from 1892 to 1921),  Leo Frobenius  and  Hugo Obermaier  (in 1925), l'Abb  Henri Breuil  (from 1931 to 1957), L. Joleaud (from 1918 to 1938), and Raymond Vaufrey (from 1935 to 1955).   In 1955 and 1964  Henri Lhote  had visits of several months to the region which allowed him to complete his former researches, to add hundreds of new descriptions and in 1970 to publish  Les gravures rupestres du Sud-oranais  in the series  Mmoires du Centre de recherches anthropologiques prhistoriques et ethnographiques  (CRAPE) directed at  Algiers  by Mouloud Mammeri. [ 1 ]  A notable part of the work was particularly devoted to the engravings of the El-Bayadh region. For Henri Lhote the South Oran region constitutes one of the ""three great centres of art of the antelope age"" [ 2 ]  with Tassili (""Oued Djrat"") and Fezzan.     [ edit ]   Date   In this work Lhote tells that a hearth found at the ""Station of Mandre"", near to  Brzina , had been dated to 3900 years B.C., without this figure being capable of ""being attributed to a definite category of the engravings which ornament the 'walls' of the station."" [ 3 ]  The oldest of these engravings, on the other hand, show many affinities with those of Tassili which he proposes the minimum date of around 5000. There is therefore room, according to him, to ""adopt it also for the South-Oranian material until better information may be forthcoming."" [ 4 ]   [1]  The region of El-Bayadh on WikiMapia.

Pomel, relying on identifications of animals which were later disputed, is at the root of the position of some authors who think that the engravings belong to the  Palaeolithic  age.   Stphane Gsell, on the other hand, considered the most ancient engravings showing  antelope  and  elephants  to be  Neolithic , and he distinguished from them the images of  rams , which according to him reflect an  Ancient Egyptian  ritual, which, like the depictions of  caballins  he attributed to the historical period.   The classification proposed by G. B. M. Flamand based on a study of techniques and patinas distinguished a first group of naturalistic engravings ( hartebeest , elephant,  rhinoceros , rams, donkeys, horses, antelopes), a second, libyco-berber group (engravings of decadent style, little horses,  camels , alphabetic characters) and two late groups (Arab inscriptions and modern graffiti).   For Hugo Obermaier there exist two sub-groups in the neolithic engravings, the older being of naturalistic style (hartebeest), the more recent of sub-naturalistic style (less elaborated and smaller-scale subjects). The cult of the ram with the sphere was, according to him, native to the populations of North Africa before having been adopted by the Egyptians.   Henri Breuil for his part distinguished three stages. In Stage I, contemporary with the end of the  Capsian , he places the large hartebeest with ringed horns, the elephants, and the very style-accomplished as well as large human figures (Ksar El Amar). Stage II, which he attributes to the Lower Neolithic, brings together the large ram of Bou Alem, the hartebeest, rhinoceros, elephants and other animals in less accomplished style. The ram, for him, had not yet been domesticated but only tamed, and its cult is rather the origin than the reflex to the Egyptian belief. Stage III includes the figures in decadent style.   Raymond Vaufrey, studying the industry of flint implements found at the foot of the engraved rocks, takes the naturalistic figures to the ""Neolithic of the Capsian tradition"" deriving from the Neolithic of Egypt, and places them between 4200 and 2000 B.C. The ram, which he considers domesticated, is only a transposition of the Egyptian cult of  Ammon  and the representations of it cannot be older than 2200 B.C. For Henri Lhote however, there is no any archaeological argument which should cause one to separate the rams, supposed to be later, from the giant hartebeest, elephants or rhinoceros. Being like them of Neolithic age, they cannot derive from the Egyptian ram, and need not on that account be considered as the ancestors of a cult of which the ram of Ammon would constitute a late sequel.     [ edit ]   Classification of Henri Lhote   Henri Lhote distinguished seven series in the mural art of the South Oranian.          Kef el Akhal, large Hartebeest       1. Large engravings of monumental naturalistic style, or Large-scale Hartebeest style. Beside the great hartebeest, elephants and rhinoceros, Lhote placed the numerous ostriches and antelopes, boars, lions and panthers. The animals are represented absolutely in profile apart from the hartebeest, in relative profile (the two-eyed formula being frequent). Lhote placed in this ensemble the human images which accompany them (of which the hands and feet have almost always six digits). No human figure with animal head having been found, he observed that ""the hartebeest ensembles of the Saharan Atlas differ from those of Tassili-n-Ajjer and of Fezzan where these figures are running. [ 5 ]  The author also thinks that the domestication of the dog was achieved in this period and that the South Oranian presents the most ancient rock testimonies to it. This first stage also includes the ""mythic animals"". All these engravings are made by a punctuation of little dots or hollows, more or less connected, and then most often by a polishing apparently helped by a wooden utensil with the addition of wet sand. Some engravings show a beginning of polishing in the endoperigraphic area (head), others a complete polishing.          Tazina, animals in the style of the ""School of Tazina""       2. Small engravings in naturalistic style, or small-scale hartebeest stage. The stage would be constituted by the collection of engravings of more reduced size, of which the style has been designated as ""School of Tazina"" after the name of one of the sites. These naturalistic images show the same fauna (hartebeest, elephant and rhinoceros) as those of the preceding group but in very conventionalised forms, the legs and tails of the animals being very thinned out, the lines of the horns and the muzzle prolonged in a 'fantastic' way (Flamand), the lengthening of the body, the hind-quarters and the heads having inspired faulty identifications. The style is however not uniform and on certain murals these characteristic deformations co-exist with more realistic depictions. From a technical standpoint the finish of the engravings is regular, no trace surviving of a preliminary dotting-out, and the patina is similar to that of the preceding stage. The human depictions show the same character but the terminal parts of the limbs, hands and feet are generally rounded-off.          Koudia Abd El Hak, superimposed engravings.       From a chronological viewpoint, a single station (Koudiat Abd El Hak) shows an indisputable over-drawing, a little antelope with attenuated legs being overdrawn by a large elephant, although another would appear to be later than it. This fact obliged Lhote ""to ask himself if the small-scale school might be earlier than that of the large engravings, or even if the two schools might have been contemporary."" This latter hypothesis would have implied the existence ""of two different gatherings of humans living side by side or, at the least, two artistic schools operating in parallel.""   In his analysis Lhote shows that beyond the great similarity of the fauna represented and of the presence of the ""orant-ram"" association in both stages, the ""orant-hartebeest"" association was not indicated in the second, whereas the antelopes there are more numerous and the lions rarer. He adds that ""the small-scale style extends towards the south Moroccan as far as the Rio de Oro, although the large-scale style remained confined in the south oran area, with certain migrations towards the north-east."" The author's opinion therefore leans therefore towards the existence of two groups. Furthermore the style of the small-scale art, by comparison with the static forms of the large-scale figures, reflects ""rather an art which has already attained conventional formulae"", ""more advanced in the sense of a more evolved creative impulse"" and therefore later. But in this hypothesis one should be able to rediscover traces of this so distinctive style in the later group of the decadent engravings, even though these seem, to the contrary, to derive from the large-scale school. In his conclusions the author considers that the small-scale engravings, often thought of as later decadent reminiscences, would be as old as those of the large hartebeest and elephants. ""Whichever solution may prevail"", concluded Lhote, one should consider that the identity of the fauna in each of the two groups indicates that there could not have been a great lapse of time between them, and that, despite the variation of styles, one can ask oneself if they do not represent two expressions of one and the same art."" [ 6 ]          Gouiret bent Saloul, human figure sexually displayed, with axe and shield       3. Engravings of sub-naturalistic style or decadent hartebeest stage. These are characterized by the mediocrity of their style and technique, reduced to a fairly clumsy dotting and an irregular final polishing. Their patina is clearer than for the two preceding stages, an observation confirmed by the fact that they are often found on the same murals. Their dimensions are more reduced than the first group, but larger than those of the second, with which they have nothing in common. The most common theme is of sexually displayed human figures, in a semi-crouching position, seen frontally, often together with numerous lions and ostriches. The fauna, less varied than in the two first groups, still includes the last representations of hartebeest of which the horns are not always ringed, and images of elephants, cattle and panthers. The association of man-ram disappears, which seems ""to mark a rupture on the environment of the foregoing stages and shows an evolution of religious beliefs"", replaced by the man-lion association, hartebeest and elephants no longer holding the place which they had formerly occupied. It is, according to Lhote, ""the end, very degraded, of that remarkable artistic epoch of the south Oranian. [ 7 ]   4. Engravings of the sub-naturalist style of the husbandmen or the  bovidian  stage.          Gouiret bent Saloul.       The domestic cow with long or short horns sometimes wearing little spheres dominates this stage, the fauna being composed otherwise of elephants, antelope and ostriches, while images of humans are rare. The engravings are in various different styles, the formula schematic and massive, called ""quadrangular"" by H. Breuil, seeming like the most ancient. The main group of these engravings are not found in south Oran but in the valley of the Saoura (Sahara): Lhote supposes ""a different origin to that of the preceding groups"", showing ""secondary infiltrations which have come from the south."" For the author, ""this bovidian civilization has certainly emerged from a Saharan milieu, but it has only made a very superficial appearance in the south Oran,"" following the tracks from the Hills of Ksour, having perhaps ""another direct contact with the Sahara in the region of Brsina."" [ 8 ] .    5. Engravings of schematic carriages, which ought to occupy a comparable chronological position to that of the carriages of the Sahara.   6. Libyco- Berber  engravings.   7. Modern Arabo-Berber engravings.     [ edit ]   Other views          Bou Alem, the largest ram.       For F. Cominardi, analysing most recently the superimposition of engravings at ""Koudiat Abd el Hak"", [ 9 ]  it seems accepted that the naturalistic large-scale stage and the naturalistic small-scale stage (the most ancient level being constituted of very tiny engravings, the most recent by works of slightly superior execution) were contemporary, at least within a single epoch, ""the first not being extinguished before the second began."" The author leans, ""on account of the arguments of the more evolved schematic style, towards placing the naturalistic large-scale stage in the first place, and to making the naturalistic small-scale stage begin before the disappearance of the former.""          R'cheg Dirhem, hartebeest and human.       According to F. Cominardi, ""It would be during the lapse of time while they coexisted, that the engravings of the plaque of Koudiat were made. Were these two so differentiated artistic worlds brought into being by different peoples? It is possible. It could be explained that they dwelt rarely together on the same rocks, and that the school of Tazina should be so individualized geographically."" ""If the small-scale naturalistic stage is, by comparison with the older stage, if not contemporary, at least starting to unfold during that time, one could, provisionally, place it between the 6th and the 4th millennium.""    [ edit ]   Interpretation   Henri Lhote identified among the south Oran engravings 41 images of rams or of sheep-like creatures, which is comparatively few in the sum of the representations, ""especially as this figure includes small scale images and the uncertain ones of the decadent school."" [ 10 ]  Their symbolic attributes (spheroids, manes, collars) remain very variable, in contrast to those of the Egyptian ram of Ammon, which was furnished right from the start with the symbols which it would always keep, one could claim, according to the author, that they had not yet been fixed in a definitive fashion and we find ourselves here looking at a cult which was just beginning to take form."" The difference ""shows, if it were still necessary to show, that the South Oranians had not adopted the cult from Egypt. [ 11 ]   In 13 cases the engraved rams are associated with human figures. Analyzing their possible relations, the author's conclusion is ""that the Ram played a religious role of first importance to the south-Oranians, that its association with man, though he may have been in a praying position, should have been armed with an axe, shows that it certainly had the character of a divinity which one would ask things of and which one might, on suitable occasions, sacrifice."" [ 12 ]  This role, he adds, ""is well attested in the two hartebeest stages of large and small scale, but disappears in the age of the decadent style where nothing of it remains except the mere vestige.""   The representations of hartebeest, more numerous (73 for the region) and in 13 cases associated with the presence of a human, show despite the absence of the spheroid ""which may have been the object of rites associating it with men,"" [ 13 ]  that it ""held an eminent place in the beliefs of the ancient populations of the South Oranians. [ 14 ]  As for the lion, represented with facing head in the old hartebeest stage where it is only a single time associated with a man, but shown in profile in the decadent style where its associations with humans are on the contrary quite frequent, it seems to have replaced hartebeest and rams. One should be able, according to Lhote, ""to interpret this phenomenon as a radical modification in the behaviour of south Oranians, a real change, unless it represents the arrival of new human populations."" [ 15 ]   For Henri Lhote, ""the south Oran engravings are certainly among the oldest artistic and cultic manifestations of Africa which we know of, and the beliefs of which they are the reflection may perhaps have helped to influence the later populations of the  Nile valley  and of black Africa where  animism  was to undergo so great a development."" [ 16 ]     [ edit ]   Who were the artists?   Conjectures on the identities of the artists have been many. Lhote tells that some have believed them to belong to the black populations ancestral to the  Mandinka  and the  Haoussas . But the  Touareg , the Egyptians and the ancestors of the  Berbers  have also been invoked.

It was a series of political and military confrontations between  Julius Caesar , his political supporters, and his  legions , against the traditionalist conservative faction in the  Roman Senate , sometimes known as the  Optimates , or  boni , backed by legions loyal to  Pompey .   After a long political and military struggle, between 49 and 45 BC, which would take in battles in  Italia ,  Greece ,  Egypt ,  Africa , and  Hispania , Caesar finally defeated the last of the traditional faction of the Roman senate at the  Battle of Munda  and became dictator.   Caesar's civil war and its resulting changes in Roman government all but swept away the political traditions of the  Roman Republic , a blow which eventually led to the  Roman Empire .

The  First Triumvirate , as it was first called by  Cicero , consisted of  Julius Caesar ,  Crassus , and  Pompey , and came to power in 59 BC when Caesar was elected  consul . The union of Pompey's military might, Caesar's influence, and Crassus' money was solidified with the marriage of Pompey to Caesar's daughter Julia in 59 B.C. Caesar's first consulship tasked him with watching over the forests. This position was specially created because of the enemies Caesar had in the Senate. It was meant to give Caesar no fame or wealth, and to limit the climb of his career path, or,  cursus honorum . The Triumvirate reform program was enacted and Caesar got himself promoted to the position of  governor  of  Illyricum  and  Gaul .   After the First Triumvirate ended, the senate supported Pompey, who became sole consul in 52 BC. Meanwhile, Caesar had become a military hero as well as a champion of the people. The  senate  feared him and wanted him to give up his army, knowing that he hoped to be consul when his term in Gaul expired. In December 50 BC, Caesar wrote to the senate saying that he would give up his army if Pompey would give up his. The senate heard the letter with fury and demanded that Caesar disband his army at once or be declared an enemy of the peoplean illegal bill, for Caesar was entitled to keep his army until his term was up. Another reason for Caesar's immediate want for another consulship was to delay his inevitable senatorial prosecutions waiting for him after retirement of his position. The potential prosecutions were based on irregularities related to his term as consul and loose accusations of war crimes throughout his campaigns in Gaul.   Two  tribunes  faithful to Caesar,  Marcus Antonius  (Mark Antony) and  Quintus Cassius Longinus  vetoed the bill and were quickly expelled from the senate. They fled to Caesar, who assembled his army and asked for the support of the soldiers against the senate. The army called for action.   In 50 BC, the Senate, led by Pompey, ordered Caesar to return to Rome and disband his army because his term as Proconsul had finished. Moreover, the Senate forbade Caesar to stand for a second consulship  in absentia . Caesar thought that he would be prosecuted and politically marginalized if he entered Rome without the immunity enjoyed by a Consul or without the power of his army. Pompey accused Caesar of insubordination and treason.     [ edit ]   The civil war     [ edit ]   Crossing the Rubicon   Further information:  Rubicon  and  Alea iacta est   On  January 10 ,  49 BC  Caesar crossed the  Rubicon  with one  legion , the  Legio XIII Gemina . The Rubicon marked the boundary between the Roman province of Cisalpine Gaul to the north and Italy proper to the south, and Roman law forbade any general from crossing it with an army. The purpose of the law was to protect the republic from internal military threat. Caesar's action thus marked the beginning of the civil war.   Historians differ as to what Caesar said upon crossing the Rubicon; the two major competing lines are "" Alea iacta est "" (""The  die  is cast""), and ""Let the dice fly high!"" (a quotation from a line by the  New Comedy  poet  Menander ). This minor controversy is occasionally seen in modern literature when Colleen McCullough attributes the less popular Menander line to Caesar in her Masters of Rome series of novels. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   The march on Rome & the early Hispanian campaign   Further information:  Battle of Massilia ,  Siege of Massilia ,  Massilia , and  Battle of Ilerda   Caesar's march to  Rome  was a triumphal progress. Not knowing that Caesar had only one legion with him and fearing the worst, the Senate offered Pompey their backing, which he neither denied nor accepted. Pompey, realizing that Rome was in danger, made the statement ""Rome cannot be defended"" and with the reigning consuls, and the more conservative senators (known as the Optimates), fled to  Capua . This retreat was later reflected on by Cicero to be an ""outward sign of weakness,"" giving Caesar time to consolidate his forces in his quest for eventual dictatorship.   Pompey did have some armies at his disposal: two legions he had commanded Caesar to send from Gaul earlier (11,500 men), plus hastily levied Italian troops under Domitius Ahenobarbus, who established their camp in central Italy. As Caesar moved further south, Pompey removed to southern Italy. From there, he repeatedly urged Domitius to move north against Caesar, who was making his way south along the eastern coast, in hopes of intercepting him before he got to Rome. Domitius repeatedly refused. Caesar marched right up to his camp, engaged his armies and defeated them. Pompey then went to Brundisium to await the ships that would take him to the eastern provinces, where he had enormous influence. From there he hoped to raise armies and money and blockade Italy by sea. The Optimates, including  Metellus Scipio  and  Cato the Younger , fled south to join him, leaving a rear guard at Capua.   While Pompey's fortification was taking place, Caesar turned his eye toward  Hispania , and its leaderless army. He wanted to make sure he destroyed the remnants of any army that Pompey could later use against him. Therefore he attacked and defeated Afrainius and Petrieus during his Illerda campaign in 49 B.C. On that campaign, Caesar took six legions along with 3,000 cavalry from his Gallic campaigns and 900 horsemen kept as his personal bodyguard. The casualty count for the Romans was 70 deaths while the Pompeians lost 200 and had 600 wounded.   Caesar pursued Pompey to Brundisium, hoping to restore their alliance of ten years prior. In fact, throughout the early stages of the war, Caesar made frequent offers to lay down his arms if Pompey would do the same. Pompey persistently refused, on the grounds that Caesar was his subordinate and was duty-bound to cease his advance and dismiss his armies before any negotiations could take place. Pompey commanded the legitimacy as Consul of Rome, whereas Caesar's choice to cross the Rubicon legally declared him a de facto Enemy of the Senate and People of Rome.   Pompey eluded Caesar's advance on Brundisium and fled (March, 49 BC) with his fleet to  Greece .   Caesar then made an astonishing 27-day route-march to  Hispania  where he defeated Pompey's legates and armies and pacified that province. Returning to Rome, Caesar held the  dictatorship  for 11 days in early December, long enough to get himself elected consul, and then set out for Greece in pursuit of Pompey.     [ edit ]   Campaigns in Greece and Africa   Further information:  Battle of Dyrrhachium (48 BC) ,  Battle of Pharsalus ,  Battle of Utica (49 BC) , and  Battle of Bagradas River (49 BC)   At  Brundisium , Caesar collected a small army of about 15,000 men and slipped across the strait to Epirus. At the time, Pompey was considering three options: allying himself with the King of  Parthia , an erstwhile ally far to the east; exploiting his overwhelming naval superiority by invading Italy; or facing Caesar in one decisive battle. Allying with Parthia was a non-starter: no one would look favorably upon using Parthian troops against Roman legions. Invading Italy was politically unsavory as well as risky: the Italians, who had rebelled against Rome only 30 years earlier, might rise against him now. On his councilor's advice, he opted for the single decisive battle.   Caesar's pursuit across the  Adriatic  into  Illyrium  settled it. On  July 10 ,  48 BC  he met Pompey at  Dyrrhachium  but lost 1,000 veterans and was forced to fall back. Pompey could not believe his inexperienced army had bested Caesar's seasoned legions, and believing the retreat was a trap refused to give chase, thus losing the chance to end the civil war quickly. Caesar began a long retreat southward, with Pompey in pursuit. Near  Pharsalus , Caesar camped in a strategic location. Pompey, who had a far larger army, was persuaded to attack Caesar but was routed in an exceedingly short engagementPompey had lost his nerve.     [ edit ]   The Egyptian dynastic struggle       Main article:  Cleopatra VII       Pompey fled to  Egypt , where he was murdered by an officer of  King Ptolemy XIII . In Rome in the meantime, Caesar was appointed  dictator , with Mark Antony as his  Master of the Horse ; Caesar resigned this dictatorate after eleven days and was elected to a second term as consul with  Publius Servilius Vatia Isauricus  as his colleague. He pursued the Pompeian army to  Alexandria , where they camped and became involved with the Alexandrine civil war between Ptolemy and his sister, wife, and co-regnant queen, the  Pharaoh   Cleopatra VII . Perhaps as a result of Ptolemy's role in Pompey's murder, Caesar sided with Cleopatra; he is reported to have wept at the sight of Pompey's head, which was offered to him by Ptolemy's chamberlain  Pothinus  as a gift. In any event, Caesar defeated the Ptolemaic forces and installed Cleopatra as ruler, with whom he fathered his only known biological son,  Ptolemy XV Caesar , better known as ""Caesarion"". Caesar and Cleopatra never married, due to Roman law that prohibited a marriage with a non-Roman citizen.     [ edit ]   The war against Pharnaces       Main article:  Pharnaces II of Pontus       After spending the first months of 47 BC in Egypt, he went to  Syria , and then to  Pontus  to deal with  Pharnaces II , a  client king  of Pompey's who had taken advantage of the Romans being distracted by their civil war to oppose the Roman-friendly  Deiotarus  and make himself the ruler of  Colchis  and lesser  Armenia . At  Nicopolis  he had defeated what little Roman opposition Caesar's Asian lieutenant  Domitius Calvinus  could muster. He had also taken the city of Amisus, which was a Roman ally, made all the boys  eunuchs  and sold the inhabitants to slave traders. After this show of strength against the Romans, Pharnaces drew back to suppress revolt in his new conquests.   Nevertheless, the extremely rapid approach of Caesar in person forced Pharnaces to turn his attention back to the Romans. At first, recognizing the threat, he made offers of submission, with the sole object of gaining time until Caesar's attention fell elsewhere; Caesar's speed brought war quickly and battle took place near  Zela  (modern Zile in Turkey), where Pharnaces was routed with just a small detachment of cavalry. Caesar's victory was so swift and complete that, in a letter to a friend in Rome, he famously said of the short war,  Veni, vidi, vici  (I came, I saw, I conquered) - indeed, for his Pontic triumph, that may well have been the label displayed above the spoils.   Pharnaces himself fled quickly back to the Bosporus, where he managed to assemble a small force of  Scythian  and  Sarmatian  troops, with which he was able to gain control of a few cities; however, a former governor of his, Asandar, attacked his forces and killed him. The historian  Appian  states that Pharnaces died in battle;  Dio Cassius  says Pharnaces was captured and then killed.     [ edit ]   The later campaign in Africa: the war on Cato   Further information:  Battle of Ruspina ,  Battle of Thapsus , and  Anti-Cato   Caesar returned to Rome to deal with several mutinous legions. While Caesar had been in Egypt installing Cleopatra as Queen, four of his veteran legions encamped outside of Rome under the command of Mark Antony. The legions were waiting for their discharges and the bonus pay Caesar had promised them before the battle of Pharsalus. As Caesar lingered in Egypt, the situation quickly deteriorated. Antony lost control of the troops and they began looting estates south of the capital. Several delegations of diplomats were dispatched to try to quell the mutiny. Nothing worked and the mutineers continued to call for their discharges and back pay. After several months, Caesar finally arrived to address the legions in person. Caesar knew he needed these legions to deal with Pompey's supporters in north Africa, who had mustered 14 legions of their own. Caesar also knew that he did not have the funds to give the soldiers their back pay, much less the money needed to induce them to reenlist for the north African campaign.   When Caesar approached the speaker's dais, a hush fell over the mutinous soldiers. Most were embarrassed by their role in the mutiny in Caesar's presence. Caesar coldy asked the troops what they wanted. Ashamed to demand money, the men began to call out for their discharge. Caesar bluntly addressed them as ""citizens"" instead of ""soldiers,"" a tacit indication that they had already discharged themselves by virtue of their disloyalty. He went on to tell them that that they would all be discharged immediately. He said he would pay them the money he owed them after he won the north African campaign with other legions. The soldiers were shocked. They had been through 15 years of war with Caesar and they had become fiercely loyal to him in the process. It had never occurred to them that Caesar did not need them. The soldiers' resistance collapsed. They crowded the dais and begged to be taken to north Africa. Caesar feigned indignation and then allowed himself to be won over. When he announced that he would suffer to bring them along, a huge cheer arose from the assembled troops. Through a brilliant combination of personal charisma and  reverse psychology , Caesar reenlisted four enthusiastic veteran legions to invade north Africa without spending a single  sesterce .   In the same year he set out for  Africa , where the followers of Pompey had fled, to end their opposition led by  Cato .   Caesar quickly gained a significant victory at  Thapsus  in 46 BC over the forces of Metellus Scipio (who was drowned) and Cato the Younger and Juba (who both committed suicide).     [ edit ]   The second Hispanian campaign: end of the war       Main article:  Battle of Munda       Nevertheless, Pompey's sons  Gnaeus Pompeius  and  Sextus Pompeius , together with  Titus Labienus  (Caesar's former propraetorian legate ( legatus   propraetore ) and second in command in the Gallic War) escaped to Hispania. Caesar gave chase and defeated the last remnants of opposition in the  Munda  in March 45 BC. During this time, Caesar was elected to his third and fourth terms as consul in 46 BC (with  Marcus Aemilius Lepidus ) and 45 BC (without colleague).

clueweb09-en0009-90-00104	                In the 1640s Scotland was sacked by a evil leader  The  evil king sent a invasion force which massacred 1000s of Scots, from massacres  in Aberdeen, to after the battle of Tippermore, and in terrifying raids on Argyll.  In what were among the worst massacres in the history of Scotland. The raids on  Argyll killed 900 men according to records. It was so men of fighting age would  not be available to fight. http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Scottish_Civil_War_-_Tippermuir_Aberdeen_and_Inverlochy/id/2133763 He  first of all said Scotland must change it's religon. Scotland said, no, and then  the king invaded he failed, and then he invaded, again, and after Scots won, his  son tried to make Scotland invade England, causing it lose. using links with ruling  nobles as dictators. promissing them rewards There were some large scale pro Scottish  independance, and Scottish maybe even Socialist style ways revolts, against the  incompetent nobles, in the civil war, and some against the king. Often later. In  1644 Royalist forces massacred 118 Aberdonian civilians, in a town, which before  hand had been the least strong supporting city of the Presbyterians, who the Royalists  were attacking. As of the local people being less Puritanical many say this massacre  was a major factor in the Royalists losingm as now they could not have any of  the most populous areas of Scotland, not even the less Knoxite North East. This  Massacre of Aberdeen was the worst in Aberdeen's history. The massacre came  after the 13 September 1644 battle, after this, men of the town were stripped  of their clothes then shot in the street and women raped. Some sources claim Montrose  felt guilty, but some say Montrose promissed a sacking of the city as a reward  for effective service by some units. as said in the book The Battle for Aberdeen  1644, by Chris Brown Tempus Publishing 2002, with this balanced source stating  it is unlikely Montrose could have lost all control of his army,  The other  major battle massacres being 100s in the 1660s-90s, by the Royalists, with more  dying in ships and such as prisoners sent away from Scotland,  Other major  scenes of massacres included some kills in cities in sackings, but those records  are not recorded very well. Plus After the Battle of Tippermore, when soldiers,  were fleeing, and when townsfolk were in some numbers there to watch the battle.  Many Covenanter side soldiers, and townsfolk were massacred there. There may have  been some troops massacred after the Battle of Aberdeen, and some people in villages  massacred too.  But the major claims, are that 1300 were essentially massacred  after the Battle of Inverlochy, by the Royalist army and the forces it got onside,  with only exhaustion stopping the massacre of al fleeing soldiers, including the  fact that the leader of the Campbells, was beheaded by the leader of the Royalist  force, and 200 after Kilsyth, The fact is 500 prisoners were taken at Kilsyth  in some claims. Reports on Kilsyth state though that in the rout after the battle,  when essentially untrained Covenenaters were fleeing the demonic Royalist side,  that the Royal army not aonly sley fleeing soldiers, but sleyed many Country people,  that they found on the way, It was said by many sources of Inverlochy, that no  quarter was given. Partly the killings in this rout were revenge on the strengh  of the Campbells under prior Kings,  At the battle of Tippermuir, sometimes  spelt Tibbermore, it was said barely 10 Covenanters died in actual fighting the  rest died while they were fleeing, though 10 is maybe a underestimate, the fact  is certainly this involved massacres.  And also there was that raid and  some deaths in the 1630s by some from Ireland probabaly organised on some level  by the king to see what major Presbyterian lords would do, as he faered after  he had made them his allies they would turn against him, but they did, and so  he attacked, causing the Bishops war, then saw a truce, then orghanised for another  attack, indeed Presbyartians feared a force from Ulster sent by the king would  attack, to weaken Scotland, and so make it easier to deal with Parliament, and  they were preparing their attack, undoubtably the evidence is certain, so Scotland  helped Palriament beat the king, and then the King's army from Ulster invaded  Scotland and caused many deaths, it was the same army that had killed many Protestants  in Ulster, in the Irish uprising against colonisation by Royalist forces,  Added  to this, during the battle of Auldearn one leader of the Royalist army saw that  some of his forces were begining to panic, so the low life executed some,  At  Auldearn 1-3000 Covenanter soldiers, died, it was said by one source the main  reason for this was as very little quarter was givenm by the Royalist side,  So  my calculation is that during the 1640s alone, never mind other decades where  they massacres many borderers, and jailed serfs, that in the 1640s, that the Royalists  just in massacres killed were 118 as of Aberdeen, 1300 as of Inverlochy, 900 as  of the massacres in Argyll, 100 as of massacres elsewhere in towns across Scotland  and such, for instance I read of a article that said some women were pushed into  a barn by the Royalist army in Argyll, and burned by the royalists in that area,  and there weere kills I believe in other areas of Scotland surely the other sackings  saw deaths, and lets say 300 from Tippermuir, and 500 after Kilysth, but for Auldearn,  and Alford lets say the total is 900 combined, so in total 4118, Scotland had  about 1 million people at the time, so it's allot, Even the highest reasonable  estimates of kills for the Covenaters, and the Cromwellian army put together,  can not get up to 2500, so that makes the Royalists the baddies of the seventeenth  Century, And the whole war was started by the Royalists anyhow, and restarted  again and again, with messengers sent to Scotland across the 1650s to stir up  rebellions, when left wing rebellions against the king were more spontanous, the  kings forces had to say we offer you this to stir up revolts, maybe famines caused  by Royalisty raids in argyll which caused many deaths ion the 1640s and other  places across Scotland can compared to the deaths of massacre deaths too, that  would surely add thousands as too the plague spread by the invasion of Scotland  In the raid on Campbell territory of Argyll and such, some Royalist allied soldiers  boasted that they had left no home, or hold unburned, and that they had rid the  Campbells of much cattle, and corn, so surely famine came, in this genocidal attack.  Surely this would have caused many thousands of deaths. Like his raid on Moray,  and Banff, and Aberdeenshire, Brechin and Dundee, and many other places, Over  4500 I would guess. Especially when including other raiding moves, on other villages.  I think the evidence is there would also have been some murders by troops in the  Royal sacking of Dundee http://www.electricscotland.com/history/genhist/hist44.html,  they killed a Minister, in one town too,  This is all only comparable by  the famous massacre by the English king of Berwick, When 30,000 men women and  children were massacred in 1296. and 7000 after Culloden. Evil royalist  histories lionised the Satanic figure who carried out these 1640s massacres, but  I have stated what a scumbag he was. And his king who supported these terrible  acts. the evil marquis of montrose. They lionised the murderers, making excuses  for the Aberdeen massacre, covering up others, even claiming they were tribal  massacres, that old lie, that even though they were fighting for the king, it  was for them. The war was caused by the king, and that is that.  The Presbyterian  side did in the end committ massacres but only against people who had fought their  way through Scotland, massacring and killing, and slaughtering, after they also  had comitted some massacres in Ulster too. They killed some innocent too, but  considering what the Royalists had done, and what the camp followers had been  doing for these murderers, it is similar in being understandable to the executions  of Nazis in 1945. To focus on feeling sorry for the executed Nazis, and not the  people they killed can only lead to a worse soceity that cares more for evil people  than good people.  The Royals also punished catholics, and protestants before  and after the war in big executions re-started serfdom before the war, attacked  many witches, and had bigger clan warfare causing bigger battles, than in non  war era, more republican rule stimes, and were unfair on many clans, who at times  were executed for being of the clan, and also were unafair on many Gypsies, and  other groups, so killed many more per head than teh republic, and also forced  many Covenanters out oif the land, vbia force of what they should believe forcing  them to Ulster or even America befgore and after the war just as they did to Puritans  in England,. not that the Covenanters were all that pro democartic and nice all  the time, but the Covenanters were slightly more pro poor relief if infact not  all that much more, so were better in that way, and the left had some anti elitism  rebellions in the war, against pro king or the elite's moves and for better policvies  by teh people, and after the war with some calls for a non absolutist king, by  rebelions, and for more democracym, and even ones and Church clique for a republic  in the late 17th century, and the royals killed many by wart and battle after  the 1660 era, aswell as killing 100s or 1000s in Engl;and who were Baptist they  evicted and caused deaths via bad trteatemnt by not just in Engl;and against Catholics  and Puritans who had to flee in low life expectancy ships to America but to scots  in Scotland and Ulster, and they oppressed Irish Catolics massively pushing in  the Ulster settllement and discriminating against them, when levellers and 20th  C British democracy did not, if you look at the stats lots of thinmgs can be interpreted  as political i,e unfair ways V supposed witches, and unfair v those just not being  normal, actually the covenanters did allot of stuff to people unfairly and pol;itically  that way, but the royals did more, V many people, of clans, too beliefs to non  crimes, and crimes with no victims people, so that is that for the whole of Britain,  if you look at the facst strongly at royalist attacks on people that is so, and  their rebelions in the 1650s were mostly just teh king saying rebel for me and  I will give this lord something , while repub,lican ones were just discontent  spreading to big rebellionm the only royalist ones like that really were for a  parliament or national rifghts of place, so teh republic was best from Monmouths  rebellion to prooving the terriblness of the Royal rule of hangings to jailings  of many Quakers and seeing them die in England to the same in Scotland V presbyueerians  and v serfs and the terrible royal settlement moves into Argyll area by James  the sixth and into the Hebrides which caused many deaths puerly for his fantasy  ways and how James the sixth started the nmass witch burning craze in the 1590s  and how some royalists tried to tar parliament with that brush even thopugh their  king of the 1640s dad started that in the 1590s and saw another witche killing  craze in Scotland in the 1660s, so that is that the republican way of more equality  was better, also kings taxes in scotland and england v monopilies were more unfair  than the less monpolistic Cromwell and Covenanters, thereis more to look at search  for if you look at history from the pro democarcy standpoint and anti royal dictatorship,  and pro PC pro liberal 1990s beliefs ways, rather than the pro royalist one, which  is a terribly wrong view if britain kept that way it would have had famines in  the 1770s like France and if it had become even more leftist in the 1660s -1690s,  then a even better way as shown by how Ireland was shifted right in the 1660-90s  in discerimation anti equality ways so was teh poorest part of Britain for ages  as of thios, The treatment of teh border reivers in the 1600s and other clans,  like the Macgreggors and also jesuits and some proestants groups was bad under  royals too.  You could say as the Royals created border reivers it was a  murder for them to kill some, then again they were being unfair and evil in wehat  they did so maybe it was like crushing criminals, but certainly maybe evicting  so many borderers to Ulster was genocideal as it killed some innocents urely and  harmed there at times, and harmed people in Ireland, who would have been harmed,  by being evicted for them, also there were Charles I attacks into Scotland before  the civil war like from Ulster to teh Hebrides, and then when he asked a lord  to invade from Ireland which provkoked teh Covenanters to then attacked the Royals  in England, for the English parliament and it's people, as most people opposed  teh royals then, in England,. good old Scotland, Killing of some beggars  was bad, though maybe they were not really beggars but thugs intimidating people,  but it happened under royals and all regimes for a while, in most of Britain  The  Orkney islands saw kills of witches under royals  And teh Orkeny and Shetland  isles saw bruital slave oppression by stuarts and invasions by some to change  leaders, but still saw slavery stay under stuart kings of r awhile,  The  sile of man saw slavery or serf ways ended by parliament's regime and restarted  by the king again, and a guy executed by the king there, the channels isles saw  witches killed there under royals and some jailed for opposing royals, there and  some oppression of their religous beliefs,  Also arsitocrats killing aristoctasts  and clans clans was more in the more royals era than later, if looked at honestyly  not from a royal persepeftive but from teh democratic one, and we know democ arcy  is best so look at it from that one, Somebody should list teh riots and enclosre  revolts and riot deaths in Scotland there were many before democarcy and even  a election killing in 18th Century in the less democartic era, but before elections  for even just some, there were countless riots like ones in edinburgh killing  several every so ften, and wars between royalist factions like in Mary Queen of  Scots era, and James Vi did I say, killed a alleged witch himself once, and made  a man dribnk something to see if it was posioned which he died of, and all the  royals of 1600-1646 allowed executiosn of pals, and people for religous reasons,  and people they opposed, like some peiople in England who had religous beliefs  they found crazy, even in the 1630s, or 1640s some protestant extrme seeming people,  some people who were seen as not right to royal disdainful types, some royal dissdainful  types allowed many famous and not so famous rustic people die those decades and  some jesuits and such and many after 1660 many baptists, and saw some die of bad  treament some were well known protestants and some were not well known, people,  who would be seen as a bit crazed. believing they were some religous thing, but  some of those died in unfair ways, of the laws of the royals not allowing pre  1640s much religous freedom, Lilburne was treated horribly by the royalsm, no  wonder so many swung aianst them, Ireland saw royals settlement and evictiosn  of Irish to the 1630s, and onwards, and of course there were people tortured to  death to get evidence like in teh gu npoder plot and also added to that less violent  things than that etc etc and local kills by squires and lords etc etc of people  felt to be witches or unusual, James the sixth also toruyted a man himself, and  elixbateh the first did horrid things to peopel she knew, and later kings too,  allowed and did bad stuff,  The 1680s Killing time by the royal regime death  squads, and also 1724 Galloway leveller risings were interesting.  Overseas  colonial settlement was more deadly under royalists, from Nova Scotoa to Newfoundland,  though Royals and Cromwell sent people against their will out of Britain, the  ones not against their will, and against their hopes were also deadly, Royalist  slaving of Native Americans in the 17th Century caused very many deaths in raids  and slaving, and the Royal slaving group set up in the 1660s caused many deaths  for many years and started Britain's big slaving project it was partky led by  some of Charles I army people, of whom some acted as pirates aginst the Commonwealth  in the 1650s,  Added to this in 1651 General Monk comitted the worst Parliamentry  or Covenanter massacre in Scotland of the century when around 200 Dundonina s  were massacred in the storming of the city, some claim the figure is 2000 but  this is a figure including disease deaths, and fighting deaths. Some claim that  the garrison was put to the sword, but despatches show this to be untrue. http://www.generalmonck.com/biography.htm  There was a earlier Royalist saxcking of the city in 1644, but evidence of how  many people they killed is not total. It is the case though that 200 women and  children died, and that is that. Some claim the garrison was massacred in full  but the evidence of this is not proven. The source that claimed the massacre had  occurred is one which is full of fabrications. If you look at references which  look at the era, for many books, from the website British Civil wars to more,  the major Source is Frith and he says really the Dundee sacking and massacre probabaly  did not occur ion a huge scale.  The bias in loads fo sources i crazy,.  if a repubvlicanm linked source commits a massacre it is exajjaertaed at all extrmity  by many sources if a royalist does, then the usual, even supposedly unbviased  source gives a excuse, this is what happens normally.  So my conclusion  is that Cromwell's invasion massacred 500 people, as I read in one article 1000  died in the massacre, but few say 2000 did, but in another I read that 800 died  in the fighting and massacre in total, so I can accept 500, lets say 200 women  and children, who would not have been soldiers, so they are innocent in all likelyness,  and then add 300 men, as some say the garrision was not exexuted so that is hard.   Then for the Covenanters they would have comitted massacres in and after  battles, I say they can be held accountable for 1000 murders. at the very most  including executions of political dissidents and religous dissidents. Though I  am not including kills of witches or people killed by Social policies of the Covenanters  as that should be compared with the Royal era instead. as they were peacetime  acts and were occurring when the Royals led too. I could include them too. But  I think 1000 is the sheer naxinum for how many the Covenanters killed, and that  may be a overestimate, and allot of those they killed were war criminals and the  people who were their lovers. In a way that was not really comparable to killing  innocent people.  Get  this English Civil War / War of the Isles Timeline Mousemat, a good History Lesson  aid, it mentions the Scottish events allot, the name English Civil war was unusual  in many ways, as countrys do not usually call wars after their own land's name,  and England especially like every other land normally obeys that dictum, and it  was war that certainly did not only involve England in any way. So my  conclusion is the Covenanters were not really a regime you would want to live  under, though they broughht in more school and social help and were less corrupt  than the serfdom imposing kings of the century and the witch burning culture starting  kings. But they were better than the Royals. The Civil war also in my view can  be blamed on the kings for making no sacrifices and no compromises, evenm the  people they allied with as they hated other nobles like the, as the earlier kings  had made them so powerful i.e they opposed Argyll as earlier kings made him their  essentially sheriff of these lands, and the Ulster Catholics and Irish Catholics  the king used were only able to be used as earlier kings were colonising Ireland  and making the area unhappy, and many of the colonists were pushed there by the  kings against their will. The Cromwellian regime was not all that bad, but was  bad in some ways as it was a occupying power, even if it did add the name Scotland  to the name of the Commonwealth and had Scottish MPS, and allowed Scots on the  army. Then the Royals were worst.  In 1648 there was engagers revolt when  when Scots refused to enroll in teh army, though it was dealt with by small ways,  even executions were pardoned, and in this it was as most Scots wanted peace and  did not want to pointlessly invade Englansd for things that just benfeited the  kings and elite, nobles, and maybe church, The king Charles was happy Scotlabnd  lost at Dunbar despite being allied to it on his wish and request against Cromwell  at the timer, nd when fl;eeing from Cromwell's then invasion he brought on, said  he wdid not wnat to go to Scotland to help defend it as he had had enough of it,  despite loads dying in his name,  Serfdom which surtely would have caused  deaths, in some way to non serfs or serfs, and the Royal army caused famines could  be considered massacre deaths too.  So its a relief we have a left wing  society now, not the terribl;e bigoted master race ruling over us society of then   Links to our 100s of websites, http://www.lonympics.co.uk/    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberdeen  www.strathearn.com/ge/history2.htm Reasons  to be Proud to be Scottish Which  places in Scotland have won the most trophies, and success in football find out  here  http://www.lonympics.co.uk/top10scottishcitiesinfootball.htm A  site stating how many people died in the Highland Clearances  http://www.lonympics.co.uk/Highland%20Clearances.htm A  site on the Massacre of Berwick 1296 The  Story of the Scottish Covenanters A  Multiple Choice Quiz on Scottish History A  Scottish History Timeline Bad  stuff by Royalists in Britain in the 1640s Click  here to Find a Cottage in Scotland Click  here to view cottages in Scotland A  Timeline of the English Civil War, some events in the Wars of the Isles A  Quiz on Seventeenth Century Britain The  10 Most successful Politicians ever In conclusion I like to think the  1560s Scottish revolt helped bring in democracy and socialism, as it made the  covenanters get in power, in Scotland they helped Cromwell to power in the 1640s,  this opprtunity only arrived as of Ireland's revolt in the 1640s against imperial  oppression and Cromwell was Welsh, and a more democratic Britain for the 18th  Centiry than before was better than before, and this inspired France's revolution  and the US's and these helped 3rd world ones so the world is democratic and relativelpy  prosperopus if the Covenanters had not used some socialist welfare statements  in the 1560s they would never have got power, not that they were great to live  under, but they were better than the royals in many ways, so if we did not have  that we would probabaly still have famines in Europe, just like how Bruitain'[s  working class were poor before democarcy in the 1840s depiste Britain being wealthy  as to France in 1780, with LEs of 18 in some towns in Britain in the 1840s before  democracy and for France in the 1780s, when it was wealthy in some ways but when  many people died of famine in huge numbers, and when the LE was dreadful, without  these tools created by covenanters etc against aristo-royal dictats, we would  have been in their control and democarcy would not have come, so thats what I  feel, It was actions of the people that beat Royal dictat control tools were needed  and won,

(Engraving, by P.R. de Tirregaille, in  Plan de la Ville de Varsovie , 1762,  original owned by the National Library of Warsaw.)               ""The Strange Life of One of the Greatest European   Libraries of the Eighteenth Century: the Zaluski   Collection in Warsaw""      by Maria Witt, Instructor, Paris X Nanterre  *         Summary    During the eighteenth century, the French language conquered Poland. This period saw the creation and development of  the largest French-language library in the world outside of France: ""a giant collection containing 400,000 volumes,  consequently one of the two or three most important libraries in Europe"".   The Zaluski Library, founded by two brothers: Andrzej Stanislaw Kostka (1695-1758) and Jozef Andrzej (1702-1774),  which opened in Warsaw in 1747, was in existence for about 50 years.            The Zaluskis, Andrzej Stanislaw Kostka (1695-1758).  (Engraving, mid-18th century author unknown, Mazowieckie Museum, Plock, Poland.)         The Zaluskis, Jozef Andrzej (1702-1774).  (Engraving, 1746, by Johann Friedrich Mylius, National Museum of Warsaw.)           The library subsequently was ""transferred"" to Saint Petersburg, in 1795, as a war prize, where it served as the basis  for the Imperial Public Library. Around 50,000 of the Zaluskis' books were returned by Russia, then by the USSR, over  the course of the nineteenth century and between 1923 and 1935, but the Second World War reserved a final tragedy for  them.   Because of this strange and tragic fate, it is difficult now to reconstruct a complete picture of the Zaluski  collection, and of how the library functioned. Too many documents, letters, archival resources, catalogs, and  inventories have been lost forever.   Nevertheless, a certain picture can be reconstructed thanks to secondary documents, which have preserved information  about their contents, among them the documents presented at the 1933 Exposition at the National Library of Warsaw,  historical and biographical works published between the two World Wars, and the recent research of J. Kozlowski.       French-speaking Poland    During the eighteenth century, the French language finally conquered Poland. Up to that time, the pre-eminent  language was Latin, which served as the official language. In the second half of the seventeenth century, however, the  Polish court came under French influence due to the efforts of two women: Marie-Louise de Gonzague, daughter of the Duke  de Nevers, who married King Ladislas IV in 1645, and her confidante Marie-Casimire d'Arquien (Maryienska), the daughter  of a Nivernais gentleman, married to Jean Sobieski. In 1645 all the princes and all the nobles of the Court spoke French  more often and more willingly than they did their own language.   The height of French influence was attained during the reign of Stanislas Auguste Poniatowski (1764-1795), who  received his esthetic education in Paris, in the salons of Madame Geoffrin. He expressed himself in French better than  in Polish, he conducted his correspondence in French, and it was in French that he wrote his Moires. French became the  customary language of Polish society.   A curious example of this evolution is provided by the mixture of languages in two letters of Joseph Zaluski. The  first, a mixture of Polish and Latin written in Paris at the age of 19: ""My tu horas et monumenta mamy disposita i  wszelkiej zazywamy apllikacja..."" -- and the second, written in Polish and French at the end of his life in Russia,  ""Jezlim byl zarliwy przy wierze swietej, toc w tym zgrzeszylem car je n'ai fait que mon devoir d'ue. Chaque honne  homme fait le devoir de sa charge."" [If I was loyal to my holy faith, then I did not sin, for I have only done my duty  as a bishop. Every gentleman does the duty of his office....]       An exceptional library (1747-1795)    The Zaluski library was created by two brothers with uncommon destinies.   These two ecclestiastical aristocrats, high functionaries of the Church, conceived of an entirely democratic and  astonishingly liberal institution. Through their library, an elite knowledge reserved only for initiates was to become  accessible to all, with great freedom and without censorship.   The Zaluski brothers, Andrzej Stanislaw Kostka (Andr 1695-1758) and Jozef Andrzej (Joseph, 1702-1774), were  book-lovers from earliest youth. Descendants of an old noble Polish family, they received princely educations, including  voyages throughout Europe with long sojourns in Rome and Paris. Through their uncle, the Bishop of Plock, they were  destined for the Church.            Zaluski Library interior.  (Model by Przemyslaw Krajewski, 1997, photo by the author,  in  Biblioteka  Zaluskich : Corona urbis et orbis , National Library of Warsaw, 1997.           The Zaluskis. Paris and France (1716-1717, 1720-1723)    During their first journey the two brothers spent almost a year in Paris, from the fall of 1716 to the summer of  1717, under the tutelage of Cardinal Melchior de Polignac, the former French ambassador to Poland. They pursued their  studies in dialectic, rhetoric, Roman history, geography, the Bible and -- although they were preparing themselves for  the priesthood -- they had a dancing master. ""It is not to dance, but to learn how to bow, according to the fashion  here.""   From earliest youth, the brothers collected books: the first inventory that Joseph drew up in 1720, at the age of 18,  listed 3000 books. One year later, after the death of their uncle the bishop, they inherited a large and valuable  collection of books to which was added the collection of an ancestor, Primate Olszowski.   From 1720 to 1723, Joseph again was in Paris. He pursued advanced studies at the seminary of St. Sulpice in Paris. He  spent time at Issy-Les-Moulineaux, visited the Cistercian abbey of Carno in Brittany, gave homilies in French at the  church of St. Sulpice, visited la Trappe, spent time with Melchior de Polignac, and at the same time he constantly  visited libraries and bookstores. He bought books and manuscripts; in libraries, he copied unknown or unpublished  sources on the history of Poland.   It must be remembered that the fourth public library in Paris, ""the Caroline"", library of the priests of the  Christian Doctrine, was opened just before his arrival in Paris, on November 24, 1718, according to the bequest of a  doctor of theology at the University of Paris, Miron.       Return to Poland (1723-1736)    Named Bishop of Plock, Joseph considered founding a public library in his episcopal palace, but finally in 1723 the  two brothers decided to combine their own collections, with those they had inherited from their ancestors, in order to  open a public library in Warsaw.   According to the Leipzig newspaper in 1728, Zaluski already owned 8000 volumes, from all over Europe, and he planned  the publication of a complete bibliography of Polish and foreign writers who had written about the history of Poland.   Thus in 1732 Joseph, in  Programma Literarium , announced his plan to open a public library, and he  presented a vast publishing program based on his collections, calling on all persons interested in collecting documents  and preparing bibliographies and other reference sources. The political upheaval in Europe after the death of King  August the Strong (August II), in 1733, would make this project unrealizable, delaying the creation of the public  library for 20 years.       Lorraine (1736-1742)    In the struggle over the succession to the Polish throne, France supported as its candidate Stanislas Leszczynski,  who for eight years had been father-in-law to the king of France. Eventually it was the son of August II who would seize  the crown of Poland, with the support of Russia and Austria.   Bishop Zaluski -- francophone, francophile, and partisan of Leszczynski -- decided to leave Poland, in 1736, to go  the court of his king in exile in Lunille. His library by that time already was famous. Polish scholars begged him at  his departure to leave it in the country, at the service of science.   In Lunille, from 1736 on, he began to complete his collection. He frequently went to Paris and Versailles and  visited libraries.   According to a list he drew up himself, Zaluski made the acquaintance in Paris of 180 men of letters -- learned men,  bibliophiles, collectors, and booksellers -- and he visited numerous libraries, ""more than in any other city"". Several  authors offered him their works for his library. Certain books given to him by Jean Paul Bignon, librarian of the Royal  Library, have been preserved up to the present.   In exchange, the Bishop offered gifts of Polish books: to Buffon, he sent  Auctuarium historiae  naturalis , to Gabriel Franis Coyer, he gave books and sources for his research on Jan III Sobieski. To the  famous heraldry specialist d'Hozier, he offered the family tree of the Ossolinski princes. Rumur, the famous inventor  of the thermometer, received from Zaluski collections of Polish observations of grasshoppers, for his work in progress.   The passion for books led the bishop sometimes to the limits of the acceptable. He did not hesitate to exchange books  with Pierre-Jacob Sepher, the owner of an excellent collection of books, ""which questioned the faith, dubious,  paradoxical, fanatical, condemned to the pyre"".   At least five books from the library of the Abbey of St. Germain des Pr fell into the escarcelle [a monk's leather  purse] of the Zaluski Library, as did at least one from the Dominican establishment on the rue St. Jacques. Numerous  books come from the library of the Jesuits at the Colle Louis le Grand, from the canons of the Church of St.  Genevieve, from the Royal Library, from the Sorbonne, from the Congregation of St. Sulpice, in short from all the  libraries of Paris.   In Lorraine, Zaluski maintained relations with all of the important abbeys and colleges, and with learned men around  Lunille. At the time of his stay in Lunille, Antoine Lancelot, his friend and partner in bibliophilic exchanges,  drew up the inventory of the archives of Lorraine at the request of Louis XV.   Stanislas Leszczynski, who founded a public library which was open every day (1750), certainly discussed his project  with his friend the bishop. Their ideas on this subject, on which they were passionate, were not always the same.  Disagreements arose. It was during one of these estrangements that the bishop decided to return to Poland, in 1742.  Several years later, his collections also were sent home from Lunille: ""several thousand volumes packed in 84 crates"".   At the library of Nancy was left only, ""the small Zaluski collection"". The bishop offered certain of his volumes to  the Academy of Nancy, in order to be admitted as a foreign associate there in 1756, on the request of the King. It  should be remembered that the academy founded by Stanislas was a French language academy, ""which was not a given in a  duchy where part of the population spoke a German dialect. During the life of Stanislas, all written and oral  communication was in French, with the sole exception of a text in Latin by the famous astronomer Father Boscovitch. The  idea was to prepare the return of Lorraine to France."" ( 1 )   The mobility of the itinerant bishop can be astonishing: at a time when each voyage involved laborious preparation  and fatigue, he traveled everywhere in Europe -- Italy, Germany, Austria, Holland and Russia found themselves in his  path. He was a member of scholarly societies in Italy (Rome, Florence, Bologna) and Germany (Leipzig, Berlin, Grifie,  Jena); he belonged to the academies of St. Petersburg, Nancy, Stockholm and Olomouc (Olomuniec). But his attempts to  obtain a chair in the French Academy were unsuccessful.   His personal contacts were a very small part of his activities as a librarian: booksellers affiliated as his agents  were to be found in all the large and not-so-large cities of Europe.       Poland and Warsaw    The elder brother of Joseph, Andr also collected books from his youth. It was said that even while hunting he was  inseparable from his books. When he became a bishop at the age of 28, he gathered his books in his immense episcopal  palace at Putulsk.   Before his departure for Europe in 1736, Joseph prepared his future library, concerned about his books being stored  in inappropriate places and being made inaccessible to researchers. (Remember his  Programma Literarium  of  1732, mentioned above). Around 1734 the brothers sent their collections to the cloister of the Carmelites, in Warsaw,  where some of the books scattered in the cells were eaten by rats.   On April 7, 1736, Andrbought the Danilowiczowski Palace, in the center of Warsaw, as a possible site for his future  library. While his brother Joseph was staying in Europe, Andrreceived the library of the deceased Jean III Sobieski  (800 volumes), who had bequeathed it to him in 1740. This collection became the principal treasure of his library. It  included several books inherited from the kings Sigismond August, Batory, Sigismond III, and Ladislas IV.   The preparation for the opening of the library would last ten years, at first because of construction in the Palace  which was intended to receive the collections. In 1744 Joseph devised and founded the ""Society of Readers"" (Towarzystwo  Czytelnicze), the purpose of which was the purchase and reading of books. After being selected by its members, the books  were to be donated to the library.   In 1745, the brothers used the press  Kurier Polski [Polish News]  to call on printers to give them new  works, so that they could establish a national library. This appeal was renewed twice in the same newspaper.       CIVIUM IN USUS    Finally the library ""CIVIUM IN USUS"" (FOR THE USE OF CITIZENS) was inaugurated, on August 8, 1747, although  construction still would continue for 15 years. At the opening, there were about 180,000 volumes. ( 2 )           View of the Danilowiczowski Palace gallery : Civium in usus.          At the entrance of the Palace, over the doorway, were the following inscriptions: ""Adolescentibus illicium [an  attraction for the young]"", ""Senibus subsidium [an aid to the old]"", ""Studiosis negotium [a mission for the curious]"",  ""Occupatis diverticulum [a diversion for workers]"", ""Otiosis spectaculum [a spectacle for the idle]"", and ""Conditori  gloriosum monumentum [a glorious monument for its founder]"". Under these inscriptions was the coat of arms of Junosza de  Zaluski, with the motto, ""Sic vos, non vobis"".   It was planned to be open ""Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, morning and evening"". From its opening in 1746, the library  had internal rules instituted by Andr Certain rules had, in addition to their role in the codification of principles,  a didactic purpose: they taught appropriate behavior in a public library.   The Zaluski Library was a lending library: it permitted patrons to consult the collection on site or to borrow books,  in the capital as well as in the provinces, which was extraordinary for that time (an ancestor of today's interlibrary  loan).       The Danilowiczowski Palace and its collections    From this time forward, the Danilowiczowski Palace became an obligatory place to visit for any cultivated foreigner  visiting Poland in the last years of the monarchy. The detailed descriptions that they left witness their admiration for  the collection and the organization of the library.   It was a large and ancient palace, with an elongated quadrangular floor plan, and it was embellished with statues.  ""The interior,"" says Jacques Bernouilli in his description of his trip to Poland in 1778, ( 3 ) ""is a  great labyrinth of rooms full of books, some two hundred thousand. The largest room, sumptuously decorated, contains  numerous French works, and the others are exceptional either because of their bindings or the numerous engravings they  contain. That room, long, beautiful and with very high ceilings, is also decorated by numerous statues that the eminent  Zaluski brothers have commissioned in memory of the worthiest and most noble men of their country... The Latin books on  the third floor also occupy a very large room, completely full of shelves; next to it there are several more rooms  completely crowded with books. In the attic are placed the duplicates of the Polish books; I doubt however that all the  duplicates are stored there, for sometimes the founders of the library have acquired five, six, or even seven copies of  these 'rare works'.""       Acquisitions    The Zaluski collection was put together in the same spirit as the information for the Great Encyclopedia: a  representation of the totality of human knowledge. Zaluski wanted to bring together all written texts, for, ""only  posterity will be able to judge the usefulness of certain manuscripts or printed works."" Using the press, from 1745 on  he requested printers to send him their books, ""even the most slender, because what will not serve one, can be useful to  another.""   The brothers were the first to set themselves the goal of collecting all Polish printed works. It was an enormous  task, given that printers in Poland became active by 1473 (among the first in Europe, three years after Paris). From  that date on the production of printed works continued to increase. And, nonetheless, the Polish collections of the  Zaluski Library in 1740 were already so rich that the bibliophile bishop sought only authors who were, ""forgotten,  unknown, or lost"".   It is known that the Zaluski Library contained small-format books and pamphlets, which was rare since librarians of  former times disdained these types of documents. The two brothers never agreed: the elder reproached his younger brother  for a penchant for loose pamphlets and small books, ""worthy of bric-brac"". In their place, he wanted to see in the  library, ""autores classicos et in biblioteca pernecessarios"" (classical authors and those thoroughly necessary for a  library).   Printers, scholarly societies, or individual authors responded willingly to the appeals of the Zaluskis, who  continued to search through Polish and foreign libraries and follow auctions, buying personal collections at the death  of scholars. In the collections of the National Library in Warsaw are found, for example, the catalog of the public sale  of the Mylius firm in Berlin (1767), carefully annotated by Zaluski, and the bill for some sixty books.   When the acquisition of a book was not possible, Joseph Zaluski ordered a copy of the document, which was then  prepared at his request. (The magnates employed ""scriptores"" -- whenever the demand for a document was rare, it was more  profitable to re-write the book than to publish a few copies).   At the end of its existence, the library had doubled its collection and it contained more than 400,000 volumes. The  collections moved to St. Petersburg were counted twice (by Bogdanov in 1796 and Antonovskij in 1806), and reflect these  statistics.       Disciplines and their classification    Joseph presented the library's collection through the principal disciplines such as theology, philosophy, scholastics  and history. Law and medicine were not his principal preoccupations. But Olenin, director of the Imperial Library at St.  Petersburg, described the library at Warsaw as ""absolutely encyclopedic"" and possessing books of all disciplines, human  sciences, and arts. The most numerous was the theology collection, and after that history and literature.   According to several sources the books were classified first by language, then by theme, next by format, and finally  by alphabetical order. The principles of thematic classification established by Joseph well before the library's opening  remained in effect until 1787. Then this thematic classification was replaced by the systematic classification of  Konopczynski, which identified five areas of knowledge: Religion, Thought, Memory, Imagination, Language.( 4 ) This classification scheme would last only seven years.       Preservation    The sources contain some information about the preservation of the collection. To guard against rats, the books were  put in trunks and a cat was bought: it was allowed to circulate freely in the Palace, thanks to openings specially  devised. To avoid dust, special slipcovers were put on the globes. During the renovation of the building, Andrasked  his brother Joseph to demolish the adjoining storage building, so that, ""the sun and wind might circulate around the  library"". He also asked him to avoid putting books against the walls until they were completely dry.   After the death of the Zaluskis, in order to reduce the humidity, it was decided to put crushed stone beneath the  floor. In the courtyard there was a canopy under which dusty books were shaken and damp ones were dried. ""Rotten or  worm-eaten books"" which threatened to infect the others were buried (burning them was too dangerous and could cause a  fire), or isolated far from the rest of the collection.       Catalogs and processing    The document collections of the library were described in numerous catalogs, manuscripts and printed works. During  the eighteenth century, nearly one hundred manuscript catalogs of the collection were produced. At the beginning of the  1760s, when there already were more than 50, a list was drawn up that later was included under the title  Cataloghi  Bibliothecae meae inservientes [Catalogs used in my library]  in the  Bibliographie Zalusciana  of  Janocki (1763-1766).   The list was soon out of date, since new catalogs continually were developed. In addition to catalogs, throughout  the life of the library guides or selected lists of the collections of books were devised, beginning with  Les  titres de la librairie publique de Zaluski [Titles of the Public Library of Zaluski]  and  Librairie  encyclopique des meilleurs auteurs dans chaque matie [Encyclopedic Library of the Best Authors in Each  Subject] .   In the library, processing was mainly the responsibility of Joseph Zaluski who, book in hand, made decisions about  classification, adding letters and numbers to the title pages. These symbols were a sort of shelf number, which allowed  the arrangement of the books in a given order as well as their retrieval from the shelf.   Zaluski analyzed the documents carefully: on the title page, he underlined the elements necessary for cataloging --  name of the author, title, and date of the work. If these data were lacking, he added his own title based on the  provenance of the document. He thus engaged in a real effort of bibliographic control and, when necessary, completed the  record with a commentary, with missing first name, title of nobility or profession (dignit, membership in a religious  order, nationality, etc. Very often, especially for Polish documents, he expanded or identified pseudonyms, cryptonyms,  or anonymous authors.   Sometimes, particularly for precious manuscripts, he added a note of evaluation. In the same way rare and precious  books were indicated by stars or by the expressions ""liber rarus"" (rare book), ""perrarus"" (very rare), or ""rarissimus""  (extremely rare).        Bibliographic and reference services    An information service for researchers in foreign countries was available [at the Zaluski], through the publications  of the library (for example bio-bibliographic dictionaries of Polish scholars) or through answers to oral or written  questions -- a true reference service.   Numerous periodicals (mostly German, such as  Neue Zeitungen von Gelehrten Sachen [New Journals on Scholarly  Subjects] ,  Pommerische Nachrichten von Gelehrten Sachen [Pomeranian Reports on Learned Subjects] ,   Critische Nachrichten [Critical Reports] ,  New Germanic Library , and  Schlesische  Privilegierte Zeitung [Schlesian Privileged Journal] ) published reports on the Zaluski Library and science in  Poland.  The idea of this service is linked to the contacts Zaluski established in Lorraine, notably Jacques Perard (who  stayed in Szczecin in 1742), with whom he corresponded regularly until the Seven Years' War, sending him information  about the intellectual life of the Republic.   Regular information about new works in the  Kurier Polski [Polish News]  filled the role of a current  Polish bibliography.  Books sent sent to ""the Zaluski"" were the object of criticism in the periodicals associated with  the library. This initiative was conceived as ""auto-transmissible"": the information on new works was to encourage  publishers and authors to give, spontaneously, copies of their works to the Zaluskis (what one could call today the  phenomenon of synergy). New works came from publishers in all the cities of Poland: Wilno, Lwow, Lublin, Poczajow,  Suprasl, Zamosc, Poznan, Kalisz etc., from learned societies. Numerous writers from the Zaluski circle donated part of  their collections (such as Radziwill, Czartoryski, Sapieha, Antonina Zamoyska, the Jesuits of Lithuania, the Carmelites  of Cracovia, etc.).   Zaluski himself served as intermediary for the Polish bibliophiles for foreign acquisitions, since under the Saxon  kings bookstores did not reliably provide that service.       Collections of objects    The library also possessed various curiosities. First off, the building of the Zaluski Library is known to the  inhabitants of Warsaw as ""the House of Kings"" (Dom pod Krami), because of the busts of the sovereigns of Poland which  decorate its facade. AndrZaluski bought them in 1746, from the widow of the palatine of Lublin, Stanislaw  Chomentowski.   The gallery of sculptures and paintings was found in an annex constructed specially for this purpose. Other busts of  kings and dignitaries of the Polish kingdom were housed there. In addition, numerous busts and sculptures in relief, as  well as medallions of scholars, decorated the principal reading room.   The print room contained a large collection of engravings, mostly works of the principal European engravers of the  sixteenth and seventeenth centuries: more than 40,000 engravings of which only 13,500 were returned to Poland before the  Second World War. This collection, as well as the collection of medals, was begun in 1731 with purchases made in  Leipzig. One year afterwards, Zaluski writes in his  Programma Litterarium , ""I am collecting medals as well  as  'kopersztychy [engravings]' that are Polish or connected with Poland.""   As for maps, it was Bruzen de la Martinie, an inhabitant of the Hague, who gave Zaluski the collecting bug for  those. Zaluski decided to buy, in Amsterdam, 60 giant maps that he planned to hang on the walls of his apartment.   Zaluski assembled an impressive collection of maps of Poland, ""tam veteris quam geographicarium [both ancient and  geographic]"". The geographic collection was to serve the  Maximum Lexicon Universale Historico-Polonicum [Great  Universal Dictionary of the History of Poland] , a work planned as early as 1732.   It was his intention to include, among others, a chapter entitled, ""Topographium, veterem et recentiorum,  Provinciarum, regionum Urbium, Oppidorum, montium, fluviorum et aliorum locorum insignium veteros sarmatiae et modernae  Poloniae cum adjecta, situs, longitudinis, distantiae et qualitatis locurum specificatione [Topography, ancient and more  recent, of provinces, urban regions, towns, mountains, rivers, and other significant places of ancient Sarmatia and  modern Poland, together with locations, longitudes, distances and descriptions of places]"".   Lastly, Zaluski prepared the work entitled,  Polska w obszernych swoich wiadomosciach skrona [Brief  Description of  Poland, in Several Volumes] , of which the first part is  Opisanie Polski topograficzne i cywilne  [Topographic and  civil  description of Poland] , including the study of the maps of Poland, ancient Polish topographic places, rivers,  bodies of  water, and mountains.   As if these collections were insufficient, the Zaluski also housed a natural history museum, with its herbaria and  ""other things from the mineral, animal and vegetable kingdoms [in Latin]""; also mathematical instruments, geometric,  physical, and astronomical. Collected principally by Andr these objects did not have the approval of Joseph, who tried  to reclaim the rooms where the collection was housed to use them for books. The instruments were much appreciated as  teaching tools, however; in 1752 it was suggested that they be used at the school for military engineers.   From the time when the Palace was purchased, AndrZaluski planned to install ""ad instar observatorii [some sort of  observatories]"" in the attic, and on June 6, 1761 ""well-born ladies and noblemen"" were able to observe the passage of  Venus across the sun, guided by the Jesuit Father Luskina, trained in astronomy in Vienna and the owner of precision  astronomical instruments bought in Paris.           The Junosza Coat of Arms.  (Engraving, 1743, by Michael Bukowski, National Museum of Warsaw.)          Personnel    When the Zaluski brothers began organizing their public library, they had at their disposal the model of foreign  libraries and numerous manuals. This is why one finds principles valid in other European libraries, in the organization  of jobs, the rules for the duties of librarians, and the required levels of competence.   In his letters to Joseph, elder brother Andrrecommended several times (1748-1754) that the positions should be  occupied by three ""bibliotekariusz [librarians]"" and two ""adjutants [assistants]"". The manager of the library was called  a ""Prefect""; this position existed from 1751. Previously the directors of the library had the title ""Secretary"" or  ""referendarz koronny [representative of the crown]"". Later, after the death of Joseph (1774), the directors were called  ""curators"".   In 1746, when the library already owned 180,000 volumes, the personnel proved insufficient; the processing backlog  was accumulating, given the rapid growth of the collection, the most rapid among the great European libraries. In  comparison, the imperial library of Vienna, with a smaller collection than that of the Zaluski, employed fourteen  librarians in 1774. In the best case, in Warsaw there were seven librarians.   The polyglot Joseph possessed an uncommon memory. He said, ""I know ten languages, Latin, Polish, French, Italian,  German... I understand all English, Spanish, Portugese, Dutch, and Czech books. A certain foreign emissary has thus said  of me: 'Monsignor Zaluski could be the interpreter of the Tower of Babel'."" To this list should be added Greek and  Hebrew.   As for library personnel, the Zaluskis were very demanding. They made sure that their personnel perfected their  knowledge abroad. Familiarity with languages, knowledge of several disciplines and classical literature, poetry writing,  musical and artistic culture (notably in painting), a good memory, professional knowledge, an open mind, ability to  perfect professional skills: such were the principal qualities required.   The most important among the personnel was Janocki, who spent 40 years at the library. Joseph had brought him from  Dresden, in 1745. In 1751 Andrhad financed a sojourn in Dresden for him, ""that he might be a perfect librarian"". It  was Janocki who wrote the biography of Joseph Zaluski, and who published several bibliographic works based on the  library's collection.       The death of Joseph Zaluski in 1774, and the Library from 1774-1795    In October 1767, Nicolas Repnin, the Russian ambassador to Poland, unhappy with the opposition and their anti-Russian  tendencies, had several members of the Senate removed, among them Joseph Zaluski. Joseph was imprisoned from 1767 to  1773, and he died the following year in Warsaw.   Despite his imprisonment, for some years Zaluski was exceptionally active intellecturally, working on the publication  of literary and scientific works: the history of his family, bibliographies and encyclopedias, but also poems, dramas  and autobiographical narratives. From Kaluga in Siberia, he continued to manage ""his"" library: among his cares were  daily problems, roof repairs, cataloging, and the work and behavior of the librarians.  One of them was strongly  reprimanded by Zaluski for his abuse of alcohol, and forcefully urged to devote more effort to helping develop the  catalog.           Portrait of Jef Zaluski.  (Lithograph, 1861-1863, by C. Schultz,  in  Biuletyn Informacyjny  Biblioteki Narodowej  1997 no. 4.)           Zaluski especially advised concern with fire prevention: ""fire, fire, the pumps should always be ready and in good  working condition"". He also watched over the completion of projects begun before his imprisonment. In his letters he  requested that all the bills of the book agents and foreign bookstores be paid -- those in Amsterdam, Berlin, Leipzig,  Wroclaw. ( 5 )   In his letter addressed to King Stanislas in August of January 1774, Zaluski defended the idea of founding an  academy. At the same time he declared himself ready to donate the collections of his library, which had meanwhile been  passed on to the Jesuits for a public use, to the academy in perpetuity.   After his death the library, by public demand, came under the personal protection of the king. Stanislas August gave  the position of director to Count Ignacy Potocki, as well as the Komisja Edukacji Narodwej [National Education  Commission]. In fact, the library from that time on was under the authority of that national institution.       Influence of the library    Until now the role that the Zaluski Library played in Polish cultural and scientific life has been underestimated. It  created a true intellectual milieu by attracting not only the learned but also all those interested in the history of  Poland, its literature and its culture.   Thanks to numerous emissaries and foreign correspondents, the library created real scientific networks. The  information agency of Antoine Ignace Gibes, founded in the 1740s, was in operation until 1756. Gibes received  scientific news which was edited afterwards in Warsaw, then transmitted by post horse to the provinces; he exchanged  publications and even money. This is why Zaluski entrusted to him the administration of the Association of Scholars, a  society whose task was to send for ""interesting works published abroad"".  The bookseller Michel Grl had a ""kantor  [card catalog]"" of addresses and sales firms, the reviews  Warszawskie Ekstraordynaryjne Wiadomosci [Extraordinary  News of Warsaw] ,  Journal Polonais [Polish News]  (in French) and bookselling agencies not only in  Poland but abroad. In 1764 Zaluski entrusted Grl with the auction at the library.   The idea of a public library accessible to all was propagated throughout Poland by the Zaluskis. Numerous private  collections owned by magnates were made public by the second half of the eighteenth century (Radziwill, Sapieha). In  1754 Sierakowski gave his own library to the Jesuit college in Przmeysl, financed the construction of the library  building, and the post of a librarian, all with the condition that the library be open to the public. In 1781 King  Stanislas Auguste decided to make his collection of books accessible to the Republic.   In 1790, a decree of the Komisja Edukacji Narodowej stipulated that the libraries of the national schools of Cracow  and Wilno be open to the public. One year later that same ""K.E.N."" spoke of the necessity of creating public libraries  in the cities. In addition, numerous ecclesiastical and academic libraries and archive collections belonging to magnates  imitated the functioning and arrangement of the Zaluski library.   The learned of the Zaluskis' circle, through their publications, requests for documentation, and the library's  collections, helped the spread of the modernization of education.  The schools organized their own collections and used  the collection of the Zaluski: mathematical and physical instruments, globes, etc. Numerous school manuals were based on  the library.s sources.   For some twenty years the library was the center of culture and scientific thought in the liberal spirit.  After the  death of Andr the Jesuits took over the administration and control of the library. With their arrival Joseph began to  exclude some troublesome documents.   In his research, Kozlowski presents an impressive list of the Library's activities which had an impact on the  development of science in Poland. It suffices to emphasize the initiation of the depository copy, of a national  bibliography, of published catalogs of printed works and manuscripts, as well as the Library's activities in publishing  and printing and documentary research for Polish and foreign patrons.           Exlibris of the Zaluski Library.  (Etching by Jan Jef Filipowicz, mid-18th century, National Library  of Warsaw.)          The Dispersal of the collection    While the Zaluski brothers were still alive, some books were given away or sold at auction, with their consent. In  the 50 years of its existence, the library lost several volumes destroyed by humidity or stolen. These losses can be  enumerated at some 15,000 to 20,000 volumes.   What became of that collection -- its sad fate -- was in total contradiction with the will of Joseph Zaluski: ""I  forbid the division, sale, or dispersion... of my library.""   The Zaluski library, ""transferred"" to St. Petersburg as spoils of war, served as the basis for the Imperial Public  Library (opened in 1814). During successive moves, many books were destroyed or lost. According to  the historian Joachim Lelewel, the Zaluski's books, ""could be bought at Grodno by the basket"" (korzec=60 volumes). It  seems that 30,000 volumes were saved from pillaging by scholars (Tadeusz Czacki, Joachim Chreptowicz).   In the same way, in St. Petersburg the Zaluski's books disappeared or were dispersed. Several thousand rotted in  caves. Many were sold at auction. Others were scattered among other Russian libraries.   Some parts of the Zaluski collection came back to Poland on three separate dates: 1842, 1863, and after the peace  treaty with the Soviets between 1923 and 1935, after Poland had regained its independence at the end of the First World  War.   It is difficult to estimate precisely the number of volumes which were returned, since these restitutions also  included documents with provenance from other Polish collections. According to Kozlowski about 50,000 of the Zaluski's  books were returned in all. ( 6 )  After the twentieth century restitution, books from the Zaluski  library formed the nucleus of the Polish National Library, founded by presidential decree on February 24, 1928.   The Nazi aberration caused around sixteen million volumes to disappear in Poland: 70 to 80% of libraries were  carefully burned by the Brandkommandos, soldiers of fire whose mission and specialty were to burn Warsaw. In October  1944, the Krasinski library thus disappeared, with all of its books and manuscripts from the fifteenth to eighteenth  centuries. The Rapperswil collection did as well, with its considerable holdings on the history of the country, which  emigres had laboriously accumulated in Switzerland until the independence of Poland in 1918 had allowed them to install  it in their own country. ( 7 )   The collection of the Zaluski library previously returned by the Soviets suffered the same fate at the end of the  Second World War. Some 170,000 volumes of the National Library were moved by the order and under the protection of  German officers to a ""safe place"", but the Nazi troops burned them after the Insurrection of Warsaw, in October 1944.  Thus, unfortunately, the restored portion of the Zaluski collection burned almost entirely.   Certain treasures miraculously were spared (an example of a saved treasure --  Rocznik Swietokrzyski  [Swietokrzyski Annual] ). From time to time, documents from the Zaluski Library, ""Zalusciana"", appear in  auctions.           View of the Public Library.   (Watercolor, ca. 1785, by Zygmunt Vogel, National Museum of Warsaw,   in  Biblioteka Zaluskich : Corona urbis et orbis  National Library of Warsaw, 1997, color photo by  R. Stasiuk.)          Sources of reconstruction    Because of the consequences of this strange and tragic fate, it is difficult to reconstruct a complete picture of the  Zaluski collection and the functioning of the library. Too many documents, letters, archival sources, catalogs and  inventories have been lost forever. Nonetheless a partial picture can be reconstructed thanks to secondary documents,  which have preserved the information originally found in the primary sources, among them the documents presented at the  1933 exposition at the National Library in Warsaw, and historical and biographical works published between the two World  Wars.   However some letters of Joseph Zaluski remain, of which only a small part have been published. Jan Kozlowski, the  Polish historian of science and libraries, did remarkable research on the Zaluski Library and at the time [the 1980s]  made reference to 8500 letters still preserved in Warsaw. Letters addressed to Zaluski often bear annotations, which  permit a glimpse of his dialogue and his reactions ""in the heat of the moment"", even if his responses are more rare than  are the letters addressed to him. A book by Kozlowski using numerous sources scattered throughout Poland and the rest of  Europe has been announced, for publication by the National Library in Warsaw.             --oOo--              *  Maria Witt,  witt_m04@yahoo.com   -- Expert certifien information et documentation (LIS) ADBS  -- Spialitnormalisation bibliothonomique   Original appearance of this paper: in French --  http://www.ifla.org/IV/ifla71/papers/128f-Witt.pdf   -- and in English, translated from the French original by Robert O.

After the  underhanded transactions of the First World War, Poland would eventually receive only 11,000 volumes of the 15,000  first claimed. Since the manuscripts of the Zaluski remaining in St. Petersburg can be identified by the letter ""Z"",  that Russian librarians included in the call number, researchers have recently found 200 manuscripts, among them 100 in  French: mostly illuminated manuscripts, also listed in the catalog of Gustave Bertrand, ""Catalogue des manuscrits  franis la Bibliothue de Saint Petersbourg [Catalog of French manuscripts in the S. Petersburg Library]"", in   Revue des Soci Savantes [Review of Scholarly Societies]  (Novembre-Dembre 1873). The catalogs of the  manuscripts currently are being restored by the Manuscript Department of the National Library of Warsaw.   7)  Polastron, Lucien.
