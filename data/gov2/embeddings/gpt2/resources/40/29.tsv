Dye effluents contain chemicals that are toxic to fish and mammalian species. There is currently no single economically feasible method of treating textile effluents. Conventional biological processes have not proven to be particularly effective. Similarly, for disperse dyes, carbon adsorption and ozonation result in poor color removal. Chemical coagulation and reverse osmosis result in a large proportion of color removal, but the former produces large amounts of toxic sludge while the latter involves high capital costs. The novel concept in this Phase I project deals with treating textile wastewaters by an electrochemical approach where oxidation of organic waste is achieved together with the recovery of toxic metals (chromium and copper) found in textile dyes. High molecular weight dyes are decomposed into low molecular weight compounds, which are amenable to biodegradation. Preliminary results have clearly demonstrated the feasibility and the high potential of the new technology to efficiently decompose textile dyes and recover toxic metals resulting from dye decomposition. The objective of this SBIR project is to identify the key features and optimize specific process parameters to achieve maximum process efficiency.

Dye effluents contain chemicals that are toxic to fish and mammalian species. There is currently no single economically feasible method of treating textile effluents. Conventional biological processes have not proven to be particularly effective. Similarly, for disperse dyes, carbon adsorption and ozonation result in poor color removal. Chemical coagulation and reverse osmosis result in a large proportion of color removal, but the former produces large amounts of toxic sludge while the latter involves high capital costs. The novel concept in this Phase I project deals with treating textile wastewaters by an electrochemical approach where oxidation of organic waste is achieved together with the recovery of toxic metals (chromium and copper) found in textile dyes. High molecular weight dyes are decomposed into low molecular weight compounds, which are amenable to biodegradation. Preliminary results have clearly demonstrated the feasibility and the high potential of the new technology to efficiently decompose textile dyes and recover toxic metals resulting from dye decomposition. The objective of this SBIR project is to identify the key features and optimize specific process parameters to achieve maximum process efficiency.

This investigation is carried    out in the context of implementing a membrane-based treatment train for reusing    wastewater from a textile bleach and dye facility at Harlingen, Texas. This    effort is divided into six tasks: 1) bench-scale experiments of continuous flow    membrane filtration of ""model"" colloidal suspensions and solutes under    highly controlled conditions, 2) characterization of the morphology of colloidal    deposits on the membrane and the mechanisms of colloid deposition, 3) comparison    of time variable permeate flux calculated from theory with membrane permeate    flux behavior observed in the experiments, 4) experiments with textile dye wastes,    5) numerical and bench-scale screening of membrane types for treatment of dye    wastes and, 6) integration of results with field-scale pilot evaluations of    the most promising pretreatment options based on bench-scale evaluations.           Summary/Accomplishments: Bench scale membrane filtration experiments with textile dye wastes from the    Harlingen facility indicated that the fouling potential of domestic wastewater    is comparable to or greater than that of wastewater from textile mill. Colloidal    material in the domestic wastewater appeared to be the primary fouling agent.    Subsequent experiments with model colloids revealed that membrane fouling varied    both as a function of particle size and operating mode. Membranes operated in    a constant pressure mode fouled less than those operated in a constant permeate    flux mode. A model developed for colloidal fouling of membrane yields the same    qualitative result. However, quantitative comparison between laboratory data    and model calculations shows that our current understanding of the membrane    fouling process is inadequate to predict membrane fouling better than within    a factor of 2. Uncertainties regarding the morphology of the colloidal deposit    appear to be an important factor in determining inaccuracies. Considerable improvement    in model predictions is achieved when the structure of the colloidal cake deposited    on a membrane is accounted for.

This work brings together bench-scale experiments, field-scale pilot testing,    and rigorous mathematical modeling of the process based on first principles    to advance implementation of membrane-based treatment trains for reusing textile    mill wastewater. The work to be performed will provide results that can be generalized    to other reuse applications. Moreover, this work will address a particularly    pressing need for information surrounding membrane treatment of textile wastes    which will facilitate the implementation of this technology by the Harlingen    Water Works System in Harlingen, Texas as part of a water reuse effort.   The purpose of the proposed work is to evaluate and model the effect of membrane    operating parameters, geometry, and module design on the colloidal fouling of    membranes and thereby improve our predictive capability in matching membrane    processes and operating conditions with a given feed stream. This investigation will be carried out in the context of implementing a membrane-based treatment    train for reusing textile mill wastewater at Harlingen, Texas.   The objectives of the proposed effort are to: 1) Obtain information on the colloidal fouling    of membrane ultrafiltration and nanofiltration membranes in controlled bench-scale    experiments using model suspensions and dye wastes; 2) Compare membrane performance    under various operating conditions and membrane geometries in a series of simulations    and experiments and; 3) Evaluate membrane-based pretreatment options for treating    the dye waste for reverse osmosis treatment and water reuse.           Approach: This effort is divided into six tasks: 1) bench-scale experiments of continuous    flow membrane filtration of ""model"" colloidal suspensions and solutes    under highly controlled conditions, 2) characterization of the morphology of    colloidal deposits on the membrane and the mechanisms of colloid deposition,    3) comparison of time variable permeate flux calculated from theory with membrane    permeate flux behavior observed in the experiments, 4) experiments with textile    dye wastes, 5) numerical and bench-scale screening of membrane types for treatment    of dye wastes and, 6) delivery of results for use in field-scale pilot evaluations    of the most promising pretreatment options based on bench-scale evaluations.

This work brings together bench-scale experiments, field-scale pilot testing,    and rigorous mathematical modeling of the process based on first principles    to advance implementation of membrane-based treatment trains for reusing textile    mill wastewater. The work to be performed will provide results that can be generalized    to other reuse applications. Moreover, this work will address a particularly    pressing need for information surrounding membrane treatment of textile wastes    which will facilitate the implementation of this technology by the Harlingen    Water Works System in Harlingen, Texas as part of a water reuse effort.   The purpose of the proposed work is to evaluate and model the effect of membrane    operating parameters, geometry, and module design on the colloidal fouling of    membranes and thereby improve our predictive capability in matching membrane    processes and operating conditions with a given feed stream. This investigation    will be carried out in the context of implementing a membrane-based treatment    train for reusing textile mill wastewater at Harlingen, Texas. The objectives    of the proposed effort are to: 1) Obtain information on the colloidal fouling    of membrane ultrafiltration and nanofiltration membranes in controlled bench-scale    experiments using model suspensions and dye wastes; 2) Compare membrane performance    under various operating conditions and membrane geometries in a series of simulations    and experiments and; 3) Evaluate membrane-based pretreatment options for treating    the dye waste for reverse osmosis treatment and water reuse.           Approach: This effort is divided into six tasks: 1) bench-scale experiments of continuous    flow membrane filtration of ""model"" colloidal suspensions and solutes    under highly controlled conditions, 2) characterization of the morphology of    colloidal deposits on the membrane and the mechanisms of colloid deposition,    3) comparison of time variable permeate flux calculated from theory with membrane    permeate flux behavior observed in the experiments, 4) experiments with textile    dye wastes, 5) numerical and bench-scale screening of membrane types for treatment    of dye wastes and, 6) delivery of results for use in field-scale pilot evaluations    of the most promising pretreatment options based on bench-scale evaluations.

This work brings together bench-scale experiments, field-scale pilot testing,    and rigorous mathematical modeling of the process based on first principles    to advance implementation of membrane-based treatment trains for reusing textile    mill wastewater. The work to be performed will provide results that can be generalized    to other reuse applications. Moreover, this work will address a particularly    pressing need for information surrounding membrane treatment of textile wastes    which will facilitate the implementation of this technology by the Harlingen    Water Works System in Harlingen, Texas as part of a water reuse effort.   The purpose of the proposed work is to evaluate and model the effect of membrane    operating parameters, geometry, and module design on the colloidal fouling of    membranes and thereby improve our predictive capability in matching membrane    processes and operating conditions with a given feed stream. This investigation    will be carried out in the context of implementing a membrane-based treatment    train for reusing textile mill wastewater at Harlingen, Texas. The objectives    of the proposed effort are to: 1) Obtain information on the colloidal fouling    of membrane ultrafiltration and nanofiltration membranes in controlled bench-scale    experiments using model suspensions and dye wastes; 2) Compare membrane performance    under various operating conditions and membrane geometries in a series of simulations    and experiments and; 3) Evaluate membrane-based pretreatment options for treating    the dye waste for reverse osmosis treatment and water reuse.           Approach: This effort is divided into six tasks: 1) bench-scale experiments of continuous    flow membrane filtration of ""model"" colloidal suspensions and solutes    under highly controlled conditions, 2) characterization of the morphology of    colloidal deposits on the membrane and the mechanisms of colloid deposition,    3) comparison of time variable permeate flux calculated from theory with membrane    permeate flux behavior observed in the experiments, 4) experiments with textile    dye wastes, 5) numerical and bench-scale screening of membrane types for treatment    of dye wastes and, 6) delivery of results for use in field-scale pilot evaluations    of the most promising pretreatment options based on bench-scale evaluations.

This work brings together bench-scale experiments, field-scale pilot testing,    and rigorous mathematical modeling of the process based on first principles    to advance implementation of membrane-based treatment trains for reusing textile    mill wastewater. The work to be performed will provide results that can be generalized    to other reuse applications. Moreover, this work will address a particularly    pressing need for information surrounding membrane treatment of textile wastes    which will facilitate the implementation of this technology by the Harlingen    Water Works System in Harlingen, Texas as part of a water reuse effort . The    purpose of this work is to evaluate and model the effect of membrane operating    parameters, geometry, and module design on the colloidal fouling of membranes    and thereby improve our predictive capability in matching membrane processes    and operating conditions with a given feed stream.    This investigation is carried out in the context of implementing a membrane-based    treatment train for reusing textile mill wastewater at Harlingen, Texas. The    objectives of the proposed effort are to:     1) Obtain information on the colloidal fouling of membrane ultrafiltration and    nanofiltration membranes in controlled bench-scale experiments using model suspensions    and dye wastes;     2) Compare membrane performance under various operating conditions and membrane    geometries in a series of simulations and experiments and;     3) Evaluate membrane-based pretreatment options for treating the dye waste for    reverse osmosis treatment and water reuse.     This effort is divided into six tasks:     1) bench-scale experiments of continuous flow membrane filtration of ""model""    colloidal suspensions and solutes under highly controlled conditions,     2) characterization of the morphology of colloidal deposits on the membrane    and the mechanisms of colloid deposition,     3) comparison of time variable permeate flux calculated from theory with membrane    permeate flux behavior observed in the experiments,     4) experiments with textile dye wastes,     5) numerical and bench-scale screening of membrane types for treatment of dye    wastes and,     6) delivery of results for use in field-scale pilot evaluations of the most    promising pretreatment options based on bench-scale evaluations.     During year 1 of this effort, equipment to be used in tasks 1 and 4 will be    obtained, assembled and tested. Methodological issues regarding sampling and    measurement of membrane deposits will be resolved. Experiments described in    tasks 1 and 4 will be initiated. These tasks will be completed by the end of    year 2. Year 3 will be dedicated to data analysis, modeling work, integration    of the results of this work with on-site investigation in Harlingen, and final    report preparation.           Progress Summary: Tasks 3,4,5, and 6 have been completed as described in earlier progress reports.    Work on tasks 1, 2, and 3 address general principle's of colloidal fouling of    membranes as anticipated in reuse applications. Progress on these tasks continues    and tasks will be completed by July 31 2001. The most recent results on Tasks    1, 2 and 3 include advanced modeling of the morphomogy of colloidal deposits    on membranes and comparisons with experimental data. A cake interface modeled    as a progressively changing zone of concentration yields the behavior of permeate    flux decline observed in experiments. Moreover, a significant modeling result    suggests that the structure of the fouling layer is defined by the least stable    materials in suspension while the chemistry of the fouling layer is defined    by more stable materials. These results have important implications for the    pre-treatment of membrane feed streams and the periodic chemical cleaning of    membrane units.      Future Activities: Three manuscripts are in preparation for submission to refereed journals based    on the MS Thesis of the student supported by this work. This student will continue    work towards the Ph.D. on a related topic with other sources of funding upon    completion of this project.

Summary/Accomplishments: Bench scale membrane filtration experiments with textile dye wastes from the    Harlingen facility indicated that the fouling potential of domestic wastewater    is comparable to or greater than that of wastewater from textile mill. Colloidal    material in the domestic wastewater appeared to be the primary fouling agent.    Subsequent experiments with model colloids revealed that membrane fouling varied    both as a function of particle size and operating mode. Membranes operated in    a constant pressure mode fouled less than those operated in a constant permeate    flux mode. A model developed for colloidal fouling of membrane yields the same    qualitative result. However, quantitative comparison between laboratory data    and model calculations shows that our current understanding of the membrane    fouling process is inadequate to predict membrane fouling better than within    a factor of 2. Uncertainties regarding the morphology of the colloidal deposit    appear to be an important factor in determining inaccuracies. Considerable improvement    in model predictions is achieved when the structure of the colloidal cake deposited    on a membrane is accounted for.

This work brings together bench-scale experiments, field-scale pilot testing,    and rigorous mathematical modeling of the process based on first principles    to advance implementation of membrane-based treatment trains for reusing textile    mill wastewater. The work to be performed will provide results that can be generalized    to other reuse applications. Moreover, this work will address a particularly    pressing need for information surrounding membrane treatment of textile wastes    which will facilitate the implementation of this technology by the Harlingen    Water Works System in Harlingen, Texas as part of a water reuse effort.   The purpose of the proposed work is to evaluate and model the effect of membrane    operating parameters, geometry, and module design on the colloidal fouling of    membranes and thereby improve our predictive capability in matching membrane    processes and operating conditions with a given feed stream. This investigation    will be carried out in the context of implementing a membrane-based treatment    train for reusing textile mill wastewater at Harlingen, Texas. The objectives    of the proposed effort are to: 1) Obtain information on the colloidal fouling    of membrane ultrafiltration and nanofiltration membranes in controlled bench-scale    experiments using model suspensions and dye wastes; 2) Compare membrane performance    under various operating conditions and membrane geometries in a series of simulations    and experiments and; 3) Evaluate membrane-based pretreatment options for treating    the dye waste for reverse osmosis treatment and water reuse.           Approach: This effort is divided into six tasks: 1) bench-scale experiments of continuous    flow membrane filtration of ""model"" colloidal suspensions and solutes    under highly controlled conditions, 2) characterization of the morphology of    colloidal deposits on the membrane and the mechanisms of colloid deposition,    3) comparison of time variable permeate flux calculated from theory with membrane    permeate flux behavior observed in the experiments, 4) experiments with textile    dye wastes, 5) numerical and bench-scale screening of membrane types for treatment    of dye wastes and, 6) delivery of results for use in field-scale pilot evaluations    of the most promising pretreatment options based on bench-scale evaluations.

Dye effluents contain chemicals that are toxic to fish and mammalian species. There is currently no single economically feasible method of treating textile effluents. Conventional biological processes have not proven to be particularly effective. Similarly, for disperse dyes, carbon adsorption and ozonation result in poor color removal. Chemical coagulation and reverse osmosis result in a large proportion of color removal, but the former produces large amounts of toxic sludge while the latter involves high capital costs. The novel concept in this Phase I project deals with treating textile wastewaters by an electrochemical approach where oxidation of organic waste is achieved together with the recovery of toxic metals (chromium and copper) found in textile dyes. High molecular weight dyes are decomposed into low molecular weight compounds, which are amenable to biodegradation. Preliminary results have clearly demonstrated the feasibility and the high potential of the new technology to efficiently decompose textile dyes and recover toxic metals resulting from dye decomposition. The objective of this SBIR project is to identify the key features and optimize specific process parameters to achieve maximum process efficiency.

This work brings together bench-scale experiments, field-scale pilot testing,    and rigorous mathematical modeling of the process based on first principles    to advance implementation of membrane-based treatment trains for reusing textile    mill wastewater. The work to be performed will provide results that can be generalized    to other reuse applications. Moreover, this work will address a particularly    pressing need for information surrounding membrane treatment of textile wastes    which will facilitate the implementation of this technology by the Harlingen    Water Works System in Harlingen, Texas as part of a water reuse effort.   The purpose of the proposed work is to evaluate and model the effect of membrane    operating parameters, geometry, and module design on the colloidal fouling of    membranes and thereby improve our predictive capability in matching membrane    processes and operating conditions with a given feed stream. This investigation will be carried out in the context of implementing a membrane-based treatment    train for reusing textile mill wastewater at Harlingen, Texas.   The objectives of the proposed effort are to: 1) Obtain information on the colloidal fouling    of membrane ultrafiltration and nanofiltration membranes in controlled bench-scale    experiments using model suspensions and dye wastes; 2) Compare membrane performance    under various operating conditions and membrane geometries in a series of simulations    and experiments and; 3) Evaluate membrane-based pretreatment options for treating    the dye waste for reverse osmosis treatment and water reuse.           Approach: This effort is divided into six tasks: 1) bench-scale experiments of continuous    flow membrane filtration of ""model"" colloidal suspensions and solutes    under highly controlled conditions, 2) characterization of the morphology of    colloidal deposits on the membrane and the mechanisms of colloid deposition,    3) comparison of time variable permeate flux calculated from theory with membrane    permeate flux behavior observed in the experiments, 4) experiments with textile    dye wastes, 5) numerical and bench-scale screening of membrane types for treatment    of dye wastes and, 6) delivery of results for use in field-scale pilot evaluations    of the most promising pretreatment options based on bench-scale evaluations.

During year 1 of this effort, equipment to be used in tasks 1 and 4 will be    obtained, assembled and tested. Methodological issues regarding sampling and    measurement of membrane deposits will be resolved. Experiments described in    tasks 1 and 4 will be initiated. These tasks will be completed by the end of    year 2. Year 3 will be dedicated to data analysis, modeling work, integration    of the results of this work with on-site investigation in Harlingen, and final    report preparation.           Progress Summary: Tasks 3,4,5, and 6 have been completed as described in earlier progress reports.    Work on tasks 1, 2, and 3 address general principle's of colloidal fouling of    membranes as anticipated in reuse applications. Progress on these tasks continues    and tasks will be completed by July 31 2001. The most recent results on Tasks    1, 2 and 3 include advanced modeling of the morphomogy of colloidal deposits    on membranes and comparisons with experimental data. A cake interface modeled    as a progressively changing zone of concentration yields the behavior of permeate    flux decline observed in experiments. Moreover, a significant modeling result    suggests that the structure of the fouling layer is defined by the least stable    materials in suspension while the chemistry of the fouling layer is defined    by more stable materials. These results have important implications for the    pre-treatment of membrane feed streams and the periodic chemical cleaning of    membrane units.      Future Activities: Three manuscripts are in preparation for submission to refereed journals based    on the MS Thesis of the student supported by this work.

This work brings together bench-scale experiments, field-scale pilot testing,    and rigorous mathematical modeling of the process based on first principles    to advance implementation of membrane-based treatment trains for reusing textile    mill wastewater. The work to be performed will provide results that can be generalized    to other reuse applications. Moreover, this work will address a particularly    pressing need for information surrounding membrane treatment of textile wastes    which will facilitate the implementation of this technology by the Harlingen    Water Works System in Harlingen, Texas as part of a water reuse effort.   The purpose of the proposed work is to evaluate and model the effect of membrane    operating parameters, geometry, and module design on the colloidal fouling of    membranes and thereby improve our predictive capability in matching membrane    processes and operating conditions with a given feed stream. This investigation    will be carried out in the context of implementing a membrane-based treatment    train for reusing textile mill wastewater at Harlingen, Texas. The objectives    of the proposed effort are to: 1) Obtain information on the colloidal fouling    of membrane ultrafiltration and nanofiltration membranes in controlled bench-scale    experiments using model suspensions and dye wastes; 2) Compare membrane performance    under various operating conditions and membrane geometries in a series of simulations    and experiments and; 3) Evaluate membrane-based pretreatment options for treating    the dye waste for reverse osmosis treatment and water reuse.           Approach: This effort is divided into six tasks: 1) bench-scale experiments of continuous    flow membrane filtration of ""model"" colloidal suspensions and solutes    under highly controlled conditions, 2) characterization of the morphology of    colloidal deposits on the membrane and the mechanisms of colloid deposition,    3) comparison of time variable permeate flux calculated from theory with membrane    permeate flux behavior observed in the experiments, 4) experiments with textile    dye wastes, 5) numerical and bench-scale screening of membrane types for treatment    of dye wastes and, 6) delivery of results for use in field-scale pilot evaluations    of the most promising pretreatment options based on bench-scale evaluations.

This work brings together bench-scale experiments, field-scale pilot testing,    and rigorous mathematical modeling of the process based on first principles    to advance implementation of membrane-based treatment trains for reusing textile    mill wastewater. The work to be performed will provide results that can be generalized    to other reuse applications. Moreover, this work will address a particularly    pressing need for information surrounding membrane treatment of textile wastes    which will facilitate the implementation of this technology by the Harlingen    Water Works System in Harlingen, Texas as part of a water reuse effort.   The purpose of the proposed work is to evaluate and model the effect of membrane    operating parameters, geometry, and module design on the colloidal fouling of    membranes and thereby improve our predictive capability in matching membrane    processes and operating conditions with a given feed stream. This investigation will be carried out in the context of implementing a membrane-based treatment    train for reusing textile mill wastewater at Harlingen, Texas.   The objectives of the proposed effort are to: 1) Obtain information on the colloidal fouling    of membrane ultrafiltration and nanofiltration membranes in controlled bench-scale    experiments using model suspensions and dye wastes; 2) Compare membrane performance    under various operating conditions and membrane geometries in a series of simulations    and experiments and; 3) Evaluate membrane-based pretreatment options for treating    the dye waste for reverse osmosis treatment and water reuse.

While the color issue has received considerable attention, more  recently heavy metals (copper and chromium in particular) found in some dyes,  and the toxicity of organics formed by the degradation of dyes and dye  auxiliaries are being considered within the framework of pretreatment  regulations. Furthermore, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is  attempting to reduce the hazards associated with waste sludges disposed of in  landfill sites through the requirements of the Toxicity Characteristics Leachate  Procedure (TCLP). Metals such as chromium and selected organics, including some  acknowledged dye breakdown products, e.g., aromatic amines, are the focus of  concern. Additionally, under federal mandate, states are establishing stream  water quality standards which will tighten National Pollution Discharge  Elimination System (NPDES) permits.   In this Phase I effort, two approaches were investigated to treat textile  effluents. The electrochemical treatment by anodic oxidation using anodes with  catalytic coatings effectively oxidized the dye wastes. However, three  industrial effluents tested generated chlorine gas during anodic oxidation  making the process, limited in it?s applicability due to the possibility of  forming chlorinated byproducts. Cathodic treatment using electrochemically  assisted Fenton?s reagent also effectively oxidized the dye solutions. However,  this method required initial pH adjustment to between 2 and 4, before the  electrochemical step, making the process unattractive.   The other method tested using ion-exchanged zeolites together with hydrogen  peroxide, was a very attractive process. Several synthetic zeolites and a  natural zeolite were ion-exchanged with different cations, e.g., Fe(II),  Fe(III), Cu(II), Zn(II), Mn(II) and Ni(II). Out of the synthetic zeolites,  Fe(II) exchanged ZSM-5 was superior. Clinoptilolite, a natural zeolite,  ion-exchanged with Fe(II) was found to be even more effective than  Fe(II)-exchanged ZSM-5. Since the catalytic Fe(II) sites are bound to the  zeolite structure, no sludges are formed and the cations released to the  solution during organometallic dye degradation were found to absorbed by the  zeolites. Thus, toxic metals like copper or cobalt released during dye  degradation can be easily recovered using this process. Similarly, the process  is amenable to scale-up as packed columns of Fe(II)-exchanged zeolites can be  used for waste oxidation. Similarly, the toxic metals ion-exchanged onto  zeolites can be easily leached out using dilute acids. In addition, it was also  found that spent zeolite columns loaded with organic dyes can be regenerated by  using 30% hydrogen peroxide solutions. This allows the effective regeneration of  the columns.   The hydrogen peroxide decays to oxygen and water, so the entire system is  environmentally friendly. Zeolites are non-toxic aluminosilicates and pose no  disposal problems. Natural zeolites and the chemicals required (hydrogen  peroxide and ferrous sulfate) are inexpensive making the process economical.

This work brings together bench-scale experiments, field-scale pilot testing,    and rigorous mathematical modeling of the process based on first principles    to advance implementation of membrane-based treatment trains for reusing textile    mill wastewater. The work to be performed will provide results that can be generalized    to other reuse applications. Moreover, this work will address a particularly    pressing need for information surrounding membrane treatment of textile wastes    which will facilitate the implementation of this technology by the Harlingen    Water Works System in Harlingen, Texas as part of a water reuse effort . The    purpose of this work is to evaluate and model the effect of membrane operating    parameters, geometry, and module design on the colloidal fouling of membranes    and thereby improve our predictive capability in matching membrane processes    and operating conditions with a given feed stream.    This investigation is carried out in the context of implementing a membrane-based    treatment train for reusing textile mill wastewater at Harlingen, Texas. The    objectives of the proposed effort are to:     1) Obtain information on the colloidal fouling of membrane ultrafiltration and    nanofiltration membranes in controlled bench-scale experiments using model suspensions    and dye wastes;     2) Compare membrane performance under various operating conditions and membrane    geometries in a series of simulations and experiments and;     3) Evaluate membrane-based pretreatment options for treating the dye waste for    reverse osmosis treatment and water reuse.     This effort is divided into six tasks:     1) bench-scale experiments of continuous flow membrane filtration of ""model""    colloidal suspensions and solutes under highly controlled conditions,     2) characterization of the morphology of colloidal deposits on the membrane    and the mechanisms of colloid deposition,     3) comparison of time variable permeate flux calculated from theory with membrane    permeate flux behavior observed in the experiments,     4) experiments with textile dye wastes,     5) numerical and bench-scale screening of membrane types for treatment of dye    wastes and,     6) delivery of results for use in field-scale pilot evaluations of the most    promising pretreatment options based on bench-scale evaluations.     During year 1 of this effort, equipment to be used in tasks 1 and 4 will be    obtained, assembled and tested. Methodological issues regarding sampling and    measurement of membrane deposits will be resolved. Experiments described in    tasks 1 and 4 will be initiated. These tasks will be completed by the end of    year 2. Year 3 will be dedicated to data analysis, modeling work, integration    of the results of this work with on-site investigation in Harlingen, and final    report preparation.           Progress Summary: Tasks 3,4,5, and 6 have been completed as described in earlier progress reports.    Work on tasks 1, 2, and 3 address general principle's of colloidal fouling of    membranes as anticipated in reuse applications. Progress on these tasks continues    and tasks will be completed by July 31 2001. The most recent results on Tasks    1, 2 and 3 include advanced modeling of the morphomogy of colloidal deposits    on membranes and comparisons with experimental data. A cake interface modeled    as a progressively changing zone of concentration yields the behavior of permeate    flux decline observed in experiments. Moreover, a significant modeling result    suggests that the structure of the fouling layer is defined by the least stable    materials in suspension while the chemistry of the fouling layer is defined    by more stable materials. These results have important implications for the    pre-treatment of membrane feed streams and the periodic chemical cleaning of    membrane units.      Future Activities: Three manuscripts are in preparation for submission to refereed journals based    on the MS Thesis of the student supported by this work. This student will continue    work towards the Ph.D. on a related topic with other sources of funding upon    completion of this project.

While the color issue has received considerable attention, more  recently heavy metals (copper and chromium in particular) found in some dyes,  and the toxicity of organics formed by the degradation of dyes and dye  auxiliaries are being considered within the framework of pretreatment  regulations. Furthermore, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is  attempting to reduce the hazards associated with waste sludges disposed of in  landfill sites through the requirements of the Toxicity Characteristics Leachate  Procedure (TCLP). Metals such as chromium and selected organics, including some  acknowledged dye breakdown products, e.g., aromatic amines, are the focus of  concern. Additionally, under federal mandate, states are establishing stream  water quality standards which will tighten National Pollution Discharge  Elimination System (NPDES) permits.   In this Phase I effort, two approaches were investigated to treat textile  effluents. The electrochemical treatment by anodic oxidation using anodes with  catalytic coatings effectively oxidized the dye wastes. However, three  industrial effluents tested generated chlorine gas during anodic oxidation  making the process, limited in it?s applicability due to the possibility of  forming chlorinated byproducts. Cathodic treatment using electrochemically  assisted Fenton?s reagent also effectively oxidized the dye solutions. However,  this method required initial pH adjustment to between 2 and 4, before the  electrochemical step, making the process unattractive.   The other method tested using ion-exchanged zeolites together with hydrogen  peroxide, was a very attractive process. Several synthetic zeolites and a  natural zeolite were ion-exchanged with different cations, e.g., Fe(II),  Fe(III), Cu(II), Zn(II), Mn(II) and Ni(II). Out of the synthetic zeolites,  Fe(II) exchanged ZSM-5 was superior. Clinoptilolite, a natural zeolite,  ion-exchanged with Fe(II) was found to be even more effective than  Fe(II)-exchanged ZSM-5. Since the catalytic Fe(II) sites are bound to the  zeolite structure, no sludges are formed and the cations released to the  solution during organometallic dye degradation were found to absorbed by the  zeolites. Thus, toxic metals like copper or cobalt released during dye  degradation can be easily recovered using this process. Similarly, the process  is amenable to scale-up as packed columns of Fe(II)-exchanged zeolites can be  used for waste oxidation. Similarly, the toxic metals ion-exchanged onto  zeolites can be easily leached out using dilute acids. In addition, it was also  found that spent zeolite columns loaded with organic dyes can be regenerated by  using 30% hydrogen peroxide solutions. This allows the effective regeneration of  the columns.   The hydrogen peroxide decays to oxygen and water, so the entire system is  environmentally friendly. Zeolites are non-toxic aluminosilicates and pose no  disposal problems. Natural zeolites and the chemicals required (hydrogen  peroxide and ferrous sulfate) are inexpensive making the process economical.

While the color issue has received considerable attention, more  recently heavy metals (copper and chromium in particular) found in some dyes,  and the toxicity of organics formed by the degradation of dyes and dye  auxiliaries are being considered within the framework of pretreatment  regulations. Furthermore, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is  attempting to reduce the hazards associated with waste sludges disposed of in  landfill sites through the requirements of the Toxicity Characteristics Leachate  Procedure (TCLP). Metals such as chromium and selected organics, including some  acknowledged dye breakdown products, e.g., aromatic amines, are the focus of  concern. Additionally, under federal mandate, states are establishing stream  water quality standards which will tighten National Pollution Discharge  Elimination System (NPDES) permits.   In this Phase I effort, two approaches were investigated to treat textile  effluents. The electrochemical treatment by anodic oxidation using anodes with  catalytic coatings effectively oxidized the dye wastes. However, three  industrial effluents tested generated chlorine gas during anodic oxidation  making the process, limited in it?s applicability due to the possibility of  forming chlorinated byproducts. Cathodic treatment using electrochemically  assisted Fenton?s reagent also effectively oxidized the dye solutions. However,  this method required initial pH adjustment to between 2 and 4, before the  electrochemical step, making the process unattractive.   The other method tested using ion-exchanged zeolites together with hydrogen  peroxide, was a very attractive process. Several synthetic zeolites and a  natural zeolite were ion-exchanged with different cations, e.g., Fe(II),  Fe(III), Cu(II), Zn(II), Mn(II) and Ni(II). Out of the synthetic zeolites,  Fe(II) exchanged ZSM-5 was superior. Clinoptilolite, a natural zeolite,  ion-exchanged with Fe(II) was found to be even more effective than  Fe(II)-exchanged ZSM-5. Since the catalytic Fe(II) sites are bound to the  zeolite structure, no sludges are formed and the cations released to the  solution during organometallic dye degradation were found to absorbed by the  zeolites. Thus, toxic metals like copper or cobalt released during dye  degradation can be easily recovered using this process. Similarly, the process  is amenable to scale-up as packed columns of Fe(II)-exchanged zeolites can be  used for waste oxidation. Similarly, the toxic metals ion-exchanged onto  zeolites can be easily leached out using dilute acids. In addition, it was also  found that spent zeolite columns loaded with organic dyes can be regenerated by  using 30% hydrogen peroxide solutions. This allows the effective regeneration of  the columns.   The hydrogen peroxide decays to oxygen and water, so the entire system is  environmentally friendly. Zeolites are non-toxic aluminosilicates and pose no  disposal problems. Natural zeolites and the chemicals required (hydrogen  peroxide and ferrous sulfate) are inexpensive making the process economical. All  these advantages makes this advanced non-photoassisted catalytic oxidation  process using Fe(II)-exchanged natural zeolites, a very attractive process for a  variety of applications in environmental remediation. The feasibility of this  process has been amply demonstrated to recommend further studies under a  possible follow-on Phase II project.

This investigation is carried    out in the context of implementing a membrane-based treatment train for reusing    wastewater from a textile bleach and dye facility at Harlingen, Texas. This    effort is divided into six tasks: 1) bench-scale experiments of continuous flow    membrane filtration of ""model"" colloidal suspensions and solutes under    highly controlled conditions, 2) characterization of the morphology of colloidal    deposits on the membrane and the mechanisms of colloid deposition, 3) comparison    of time variable permeate flux calculated from theory with membrane permeate    flux behavior observed in the experiments, 4) experiments with textile dye wastes,    5) numerical and bench-scale screening of membrane types for treatment of dye    wastes and, 6) integration of results with field-scale pilot evaluations of    the most promising pretreatment options based on bench-scale evaluations.           Summary/Accomplishments: Bench scale membrane filtration experiments with textile dye wastes from the    Harlingen facility indicated that the fouling potential of domestic wastewater    is comparable to or greater than that of wastewater from textile mill. Colloidal    material in the domestic wastewater appeared to be the primary fouling agent.    Subsequent experiments with model colloids revealed that membrane fouling varied    both as a function of particle size and operating mode. Membranes operated in    a constant pressure mode fouled less than those operated in a constant permeate    flux mode. A model developed for colloidal fouling of membrane yields the same    qualitative result. However, quantitative comparison between laboratory data    and model calculations shows that our current understanding of the membrane    fouling process is inadequate to predict membrane fouling better than within    a factor of 2. Uncertainties regarding the morphology of the colloidal deposit    appear to be an important factor in determining inaccuracies. Considerable improvement    in model predictions is achieved when the structure of the colloidal cake deposited    on a membrane is accounted for.

This work brings together bench-scale experiments, field-scale pilot testing,    and rigorous mathematical modeling of the process based on first principles    to advance implementation of membrane-based treatment trains for reusing textile    mill wastewater. The work to be performed will provide results that can be generalized    to other reuse applications. Moreover, this work will address a particularly    pressing need for information surrounding membrane treatment of textile wastes    which will facilitate the implementation of this technology by the Harlingen    Water Works System in Harlingen, Texas as part of a water reuse effort.   The purpose of the proposed work is to evaluate and model the effect of membrane    operating parameters, geometry, and module design on the colloidal fouling of    membranes and thereby improve our predictive capability in matching membrane    processes and operating conditions with a given feed stream. This investigation    will be carried out in the context of implementing a membrane-based treatment    train for reusing textile mill wastewater at Harlingen, Texas. The objectives    of the proposed effort are to: 1) Obtain information on the colloidal fouling    of membrane ultrafiltration and nanofiltration membranes in controlled bench-scale    experiments using model suspensions and dye wastes; 2) Compare membrane performance    under various operating conditions and membrane geometries in a series of simulations    and experiments and; 3) Evaluate membrane-based pretreatment options for treating    the dye waste for reverse osmosis treatment and water reuse.           Approach: This effort is divided into six tasks: 1) bench-scale experiments of continuous    flow membrane filtration of ""model"" colloidal suspensions and solutes    under highly controlled conditions, 2) characterization of the morphology of    colloidal deposits on the membrane and the mechanisms of colloid deposition,    3) comparison of time variable permeate flux calculated from theory with membrane    permeate flux behavior observed in the experiments, 4) experiments with textile    dye wastes, 5) numerical and bench-scale screening of membrane types for treatment    of dye wastes and, 6) delivery of results for use in field-scale pilot evaluations    of the most promising pretreatment options based on bench-scale evaluations.

Welcome to the NCER Site Customization tool. Personalization of your NCER homepage allows you to more easily view new items   added to the NCER page in topic categories of interest to you.  By selecting various preset topics or creating your own customized    searches you can keep current with all new information posted to the NCER site.    View an  example  of a personalized page to see what the topic pick list and customized    searches will return for you      on the personalized page.   This function will basically save you the trouble of  constructing searches on topics that you have       a long term interest in each time you log on.   The personlized page also reports news, calendar of events and open RFAs in        addition to topical and custom search updates.  The page can be adjusted to display or remove any of these categories and         to adjust the time period over which to search for new information.

Unless a comprehensive  management plan can be developed, suburban sprawl will continue to consume our  forests, degrading our environment and our quality of life.   As a preliminary and partial step in this long process, I have proposed a  project to specifically study changes in forest cover sixty miles south of  Washington, DC along the Interstate 95 corridor in northern Virginia. The main  focus will be on the tree canopy, with underlying effects on soil erosion,  stormwater runoff, air pollution, carbon sequestration and energy savings. The  second step of the project will involve researching local tree and zoning  ordinances to determine their effect on development plans in forested areas.   Analysis will be completed with CITYgreenTM, an interactive program for  mapping urban ecology and measuring the economic benefits of trees, soils and  other natural resources. It utilizes ArcView 3.0 for Windows Geographic  Information Systems (GIS) software with aerial photography and satellite imagery  for local and regional analysis.   From the visual and statistical analysis from CITYgreen and knowledge of the  policies and regulations regarding land use, options for forest conservation  management will be created. The analysis findings will be a public policy tool  to demonstrate to local decision-makers the tangible and quantifiable values of  their urban and suburban forest.

The purpose of this study is to: (a) measure 'total' exposure (i.e., all important pathways to selected pesticides for a sample of children living in central-city, suburban, and rural neighborhoods in Minnesota; (b) identify and quantify relative contributions of important pathways/sources to measured exposures; and (c) compare childrens' pesticide exposure between an inner-city urban area, a suburban neighborhood, and a rural agricultural community. To accomplish these goals, a wide diversity of information will be collected over a six-day period for each child in the study, including: questionnaire date describing the residence, the occupants, and the study participant; diary data characterizing the child's activities during the study period; dermal contact data on pesticide quantities adhering to the skin; and monitoring data on pesticide concentrations in air, water, food, house dust, outside soil, urine, and blood. Results will directly improve assessments of risks to children from pesticide exposure, thereby informing and strengthening regulatory decisions about which pesticide risks are unacceptable and what, if anything, should be done about them. Moreover, the multiplicity of approaches, methods, and techniques used to measure important exposure-related variables will provide valuable insights that can be used to design future exposure and epidemiologic studies that are both more effective and efficient.

In fact, solvent components in ink  waste are among 17 chemicals targeted by the Environmental Protection Agency  (EPA) for minimization.  The proposed process technology recycles ink waste on-site versus disposal.  By merging state-of-the-art spectrophotometry, new software and innovative  filtration methods, ink waste destined for incineration becomes reusable ink.  This prototype process originated from a successful study funded in part by  an EPA grant. The process begins with a procedural change from waste management  to resource management and requires disciplined ink waste collection and  segregation into chemical type and primary color. Segregated materials are  analyzed using advanced spectrophotometric instrumentation, identified by a  unique software, and remanufactured using proprietary technology. The process  results in a closed loop of ink and solvent resources recycled into press-ready  ink.  Success of the project will result in a demonstration of the commercial  feasibility of recycling for nearly 1,000 package printers and 300+ product  printers. Further success will lead to other segments in the printing industry  comprising over 52,000 plants.

My overall hypothesis is  that habitat and landscape features affect squirrel movement patterns. If true,  changes in habitat and landscape structure through forest management may  influence the success of dispersing individuals. The current forest management  plan for the Tongass National Forest in southeast Alaska calls for protecting a  system of small reserves to maintain viable populations of small  forest-associated mammals. Understanding how different habitat and landscape  features influence squirrel movement will help in locating both reserves and  corridors. Analyzing squirrel movement will also help to test spatially-explicit  conservation theory and to assess the effectiveness of connected reserve  systems.   In my study, I will use translocations to induce movement in squirrels. I  will move individuals from their home ranges in intact forest on one side of a  clearcut or second-growth forest stand to unfamiliar ground on the other side  and release them. For each translocated squirrel, the most direct return route  to its home range will be across the clearcut or second-growth forest.  Consequently, translocations will force individuals to make movement decisions  at habitat edges. I will identify homing paths using tracking spools,  radio-telemetry, and visual observations. I will analyze the characteristics of  the homing path squirrels use relative to available habitat and will test for  associations between detailed movement patterns and habitat and landscape  features.

My overall hypothesis is  that habitat and landscape features affect squirrel movement patterns. If true,  changes in habitat and landscape structure through forest management may  influence the success of dispersing individuals. The current forest management  plan for the Tongass National Forest in southeast Alaska calls for protecting a  system of small reserves to maintain viable populations of small  forest-associated mammals. Understanding how different habitat and landscape  features influence squirrel movement will help in locating both reserves and  corridors. Analyzing squirrel movement will also help to test spatially-explicit  conservation theory and to assess the effectiveness of connected reserve  systems.   In my study, I will use translocations to induce movement in squirrels. I  will move individuals from their home ranges in intact forest on one side of a  clearcut or second-growth forest stand to unfamiliar ground on the other side  and release them. For each translocated squirrel, the most direct return route  to its home range will be across the clearcut or second-growth forest.  Consequently, translocations will force individuals to make movement decisions  at habitat edges. I will identify homing paths using tracking spools,  radio-telemetry, and visual observations. I will analyze the characteristics of  the homing path squirrels use relative to available habitat and will test for  associations between detailed movement patterns and habitat and landscape  features.

Objectives/Hypothesis:  The goal of our studies is to assess the  significance of endocrine disruptors that activate retinoid signaling pathways  for the development of deformities in frogs, and to understand their mechanism  of action so as to better assess the implications for human health. In  preliminary studies we have discovered a frequent yet novel malformation which  we call a bony triangle. Triangles have been seen before in several species of  animals and in humans, but only as a result of exposure to retinoids. Hence our  central hypothesis is that inappropriate activation of retinoid signaling  pathways at sensitive stages causes deformities, and that triangles are  diagnostic of exogenous retinoids. Mechanistically, we propose that triangles  arise as a consequence of changes in pattern specification along the  proximal-distal limb axis, mediated by retinoid-induced alterations in the  expression of genes important for establishment of limb pattern. We further  propose that the triangles in deformed frogs in the wild arise as a result of  exposure to endocrine disruptors acting on retinoid signaling pathways.           Approach: We will test this hypothesis by achieving three objectives. The first (1) objective is to characterize the formation of bony triangles in response to retinoid exposure. We will treat metamorphosing Xenopus larvae with receptor-selective retinoids to establish the time, dose, stage and signaling pathway involved in triangle formation. Once the treatment is optimized for consistent triangle formation, we will examine the molecular mechanisms of triangle formation, establish the target genes, and study the role that altered growth might play. In the second (2) objective we will determine whether commonly used chemicals induce triangles. Because most deformed frogs come from agricultural areas it is plausible that a commonly used agrochemical is involved. Chemicals that test positive in our Xenopus assay will be retested using a native frog species (Rana pipiens) known to develop deformities in the wild. In the third (3) objective, we will screen and fractionate field samples collected from deformed frog sites to identify the agent(s) causing abnormalities in the wild. We will use a high-throughput bioassay-guided screen for fractions that can activate retinoid receptors in cultured cells. Positive fractions will be assayed for their ability to induce triangles.           Expected Results: This study will provide critical information about the links between deformed  frogs and environmental retinoids. Accomplishment of the first objective will  establish the connection between retinoid exposure, altered gene expression and  altered pattern specification leading to abnormal morphogenesis and formation of  triangles. Accomplishment of the second objective will establish the potential  for currently-used agricultural/industrial chemicals to cause triangles in  frogs. Accomplishment of the third objective will identify chemicals that can  disrupt retinoid signaling and cause bony triangles in the environment where  deformed frogs have been collected.   Improvements in Risk Assessment/Management:  The results of this study  are important for understanding what agents in the environment are causing frog  abnormalities, not only to be able to assess the relevance of such agents for  the health and survival of amphibian populations, but also to assess their  possible significance for human health, both in terms of teratogenesis and  carcinogenesis and other developmental diseases.
