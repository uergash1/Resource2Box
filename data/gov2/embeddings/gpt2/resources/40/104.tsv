GX007-18-12046464	"The National Institutes of Health  Investments, Progress, and Plans  FY 1999 - 2003     Prepared April 2001            Table of Contents     National Cancer Institute     National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute     National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research     National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases     National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke     National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases     National Institute of General Medical Sciences     National Institute of Child Health and Human Development     National Eye Institute     National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences     National Institute on Aging     National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases     National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders     National Institute of Mental Health     National Institute on Drug Abuse     National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism     National Institute of Nursing Research     National Human Genome Research Institute     National Center for Research Resources     National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine     Fogarty International Center     National Library of Medicine           National Cancer Institute (NCI)  Investments, Progress, and Plans  FY 1999 - 2003       Early Detection Research Network (EDRN)  The EDRN provides an infrastructure for supporting collaborative research on molecular, genetic, and other biomarkers of cancer.  Participating investigators make exhaustive efforts through Biomarker Developmental Laboratories, Biomarkers Validation Laboratories, and Clinical and Epidemiology Centers to ensure that a marker is ready and practical for medical application.  The long-term Goal is to discover and evaluate biomarkers and reagents that will enable the earlier detection of cancer and assessment of risk.     Within a year of initial funding, developmental researchers reported 18 promising biomarkers and related advances in multiple scientific journal articles and abstracts.  Three markers associated with a variety of cancers including bladder, head and neck, and lung, have advanced to the validation stage.  One group of scientists funded through EDRN has developed a novel approach to early detection based on identifying genetic mutations found in the DNA housed in a cell's mitochondria.  Mutations are more typically sought in a cell's nucleus, but because there is only one nucleus but many mitochondria in a cell, mitochondrial mutations are much easier to find and potentially more ideal avenues for detection.  When further developed, this approach holds promise for non-invasive screening for many types of cancer based on analysis of easily collected body fluids.    Mouse Models of Human Cancers Consortium (MMHCC)  This consortium of scientists was established to develop and validate mouse models with heritable malignancies that parallel human disease.  The long-term goal is to make readily available valid mouse models that will accelerate the study of cancer progression, the testing of new approaches to detection and diagnosis, and the evaluation of prevention and treatment strategies.   As a result of the Consortium's innovative and cooperative efforts to date, three mouse models are now available for public use, and nearly 60 more are complete and being readied for distribution.    The Director's Challenge: Toward a Molecular Classification of Tumors  The Director's Challenge supports investigators in developing profiles of molecular alterations to help identify clinically relevant subsets of tumors and hematopoietic cancers.  The Long-term goal is to enable precise molecular diagnoses that will allow for more targeted and effective interventions with fewer adverse side effects.   One effort funded through this initiative, the Lymphoma/Leukemia Molecular Profiling Project, is using Lymphochip cDNA microarrays to define the gene expression profiles of all types of human lymphoid malignancies.  This project supported the discovery of subtypes for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and with it, the promise of more accurate diagnosis and more targeted treatment for DLBCL.    Rapid Access to Intervention Development (RAID) Program  Through the RAID program, NCI staff work to identify promising new therapies, assist investigators in the final stages of drug development, and assess whether the selected treatment is an appropriate candidate for clinical trials.  The long-term goal is to hasten the speed at which new cancer treatments come into use.   About 50 new drugs and biological therapeutic agents (e.g., vaccines and targeted gene therapies) have been identified for assessment through the RAID program, and more than 10 of these will reached or be ready for clinical trials by the end of 2001.    Quick Trials for Novel Cancer Therapies  The Quick Trials Program accelerates the testing of promising new therapies in pilot, phase I, and phase II clinical trials by providing scientists with a streamlined application and review process that enables awards to be issued within five months of receipt.  The long-term goal is to expedite the development of new cancer therapies.   Since January 2000, when the program completed an initial trial and was expanded to include all forms of cancer, NCI has made 15 awards for early clinical trials or associated laboratory testing of new therapies.      Future Initiatives       Molecular Targets Laboratories (MTLs) Initiative  These laboratories will accelerate discovery, development, and testing of ""molecular target agents"" to be used for cancer treatment and prevention.  These agents work by reversing or blocking certain molecular defects in cells that cause them to become malignant or by specifically inhibiting the growth of tumor cells.  The MTLs will emphasize collaboration among chemists and biologists to identify potential anti-cancer compounds and develop high throughput computerized screening assays for confirming the ability of the compounds to alter the targeted tumor-causing molecular aberration.  The long-term goal will be to develop better prevention and treatment modalities that target cancer at the molecular level.    Clinical Trials Expansion   As part of NCI's continuing efforts to promote participation in clinical trials, the Institute will be offering physicians and their patients more opportunities to be involved in the large-scale clinical trials.  NCI will reach out to ""non-Group"" physicians and their patients by expanding access to NCI's Cooperative Groups, networks of health care professionals affiliated with medical schools, teaching hospitals, and community-based cancer treatment centers.  A simple, computer-based system will assist these physicians with easy enrollment of patients.  The long-term goal is to increase access to and participation in clinical trials.    Centers for Population Health  To increase understanding of cancer-related health disparities, NCI will create four Centers for Population Health beginning in 2002.  These centers will carry out research to: (1) expand our understanding of the social and environmental causes of cancer-related health disparities and the psychosocial, behavioral, and biological factors that mediate them, (2) develop hypotheses for cancer control research at individual, social, institutional, and policy levels, and (3) develop, apply, evaluate, and disseminate evidence-based interventions for reducing cancer-related health disparities.  The long-term goal of the Centers will be to inform policy and care decisions that affect cancer outcomes and reduce cancer care and outcome disparities.    Additional In vivo Cellular and Molecular Imaging Centers (ICMICs)  These centers foster closer ties between the basic scientists who discover new cancer genes and the pathways by which cancer develops, the imaging scientists who can apply that information in non-invasive studies of cancer progression, and the physicians that treat cancer patients.  In fiscal year 2002, the NCI plans to further its support for this approach to imaging research by expanding the number of centers from three to five.  If funding is available, the Institute expects to continue to expand the program in subsequent years.  The long-term goal is to accelerate the development and implementation of functional imaging technology for use in more precise and non-invasive diagnosis and treatment of cancer as well as to evaluate treatment outcomes.    Expansion of the Rapid Access to Intervention Development (RAID) Program  Through the RAID program, NCI staff identify promising new therapies, assist investigators in the final stages of drug development, and assess the appropriateness of selected treatments for clinical trials.  With roughly 50 new drugs and biological therapeutic agents (e.g., vaccines and targeted gene therapies) already under development, the RAID program is projected to reach capacity in the first half of Fiscal Year 2001.  Increased funds in Fiscal Year 2002 will allow NCI to accept additional agents into the RAID program, without waiting for therapies currently under development to make their way through the pipeline.  The long-term goal is to hasten the speed at which new cancer treatments come into use.        National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute  (NHLBI)  Investments, Progress, and Plans  FY 1999 - 2003       Programs for Genomic Applications (PGAs)  The PGAs, which will apply and expand on data and technologies developed to map and sequence the human genome, are the largest, most ambitious, basic science program the NHLBI has ever funded.  The immediate purpose of the PGAs is to clearly identify the subsets of genes linked to heart, lung, blood, and sleep function.  The long-term goal is to use knowledge generated by the PGA program to develop better methods for prevention, diagnosis, and therapy in heart, lung, blood, and sleep function.  Launched in October 2000, the program currently includes 37 PGAs.    Programs of Excellence in Gene Therapy (PEGTs)  The PEGTs will focus on rapid translation of findings from basic research in heart, lung, and blood diseases into pilot studies in human volunteers, with appropriate attention to safeguarding the welfare of the patients.   To accomplish this goal, the PEGTs will provide shared access to specialized services such as preclinical toxicology testing, developing ""vectors"" to ferry therapeutic genes to their target tissues, producing large amounts of biological reagents, providing biostatistical support, and establishing a high-quality training program for M.D., M.D./Ph.D., and Ph.D. scientists.  The long-term goal of this coordinated approach is to help make the promise of gene therapy a reality.  Five PEGTs were awarded in September 2000.    Pediatric Heart Disease Clinical Research Network  The Pediatric Heart Disease Clinical Research Network will support an interactive group of centers that will accelerate research in the diagnosis and management of pediatric heart disease; standardize existing treatments; and evaluate new therapies.  A primary goal is rapid dissemination of the findings from Network clinical studies to the medical community.   Thirty-four applications have been received and are scheduled for initial review in early April.  They will then go to the June National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council for funding consideration.  It is anticipated that six or seven clinical centers and one coordinating center will be awarded in midsummer of 2001.    Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA)  MESA is a major NHLBI study that will seek new ways to detect heart disease in its early stages, before symptoms appear.  MESA could also yield more specific predictors of heart disease and determine which factors best predict heart disease in men and women, and in white, African American, Hispanic, and Asian populations.  MESA will collect information on heart disease risk factors, as well as other sociodemographic, lifestyle, and psychosocial factors.  It will also examine a variety of newly emerging factors, such as calcium deposits in the coronary artery.  Six field centers, three image analysis centers, a central laboratory, and a coordinating center were funded in Fall 2000.    Sequencing the Rat Genome  The laboratory rat, whose genome is similar in size to the human genome, is widely used as a disease model in research directed at understanding, treating, and preventing many human diseases.  Knowledge of the rat genome, therefore, will give important hints for understanding human biology and new impetus to genomic-based research on human disease.   In February 2001, the NHLBI and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) awarded a major initiative to determine the DNA sequence of the genome of the laboratory rat.      Future Initiatives       Innovative Concepts and Approaches to Developing Functional Tissues and Organs for Heart, Vascular, Lung, and Blood Applications — Exploratory/Developmental Awards  This initiative will support research to develop functional tissues and organs, and suitable substitutes such as artificial blood components or heart valves.  It originated at the recommendation of a working group convened to identify extraordinary research opportunities that should be supported if the Institute received a significant funding increase.  Estimates of the total U.S. health care costs for patients with tissue loss or end-stage organ failure exceed $400 billion annually.  Moreover, because of the dearth of transplantable organs, many of these people die.  For example, the American Heart Association reports that, in 1997, only 2,300 of the 40,000 Americans who needed a new heart received one.    Minority Medical School Research Program  The NHLBI's Minority Medical School Research Program will help minority medical schools develop the infrastructure and resources required to conduct state-of-the-art research and to recruit and train future scientists.  Given the disproportionate burden of disease among racial and ethnic minorities and the unique sociocultural issues involved in disease pathogenesis and management among these groups, it is critical that more minority individuals be brought into the biomedical research workforce.     Novel Biomarkers of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)  This program will support research to identify and characterize COPD biomarkers, i.e., biochemicals that change during the development and progression of COPD.  Understanding them will allow clinicians to make earlier diagnoses and more accurate prognoses and ultimately should lead to customized treatments for individual patients.  COPD, which is the fourth leading cause of death in this country, affects 15 million Americans and will likely continue to be a major cause of disability and premature death for many years to come.    Role of Infectious Agents in Vascular Diseases  This initiative will support research to delineate mechanisms by which infectious agents contribute to coronary heart disease (CHD) and other vascular diseases.  CHD is the second leading cause of death in the United States and costs Americans $55 billion each year in health care expenditures.  Established risk factors such as high cholesterol levels, smoking, diabetes, and hypertension do not fully explain the etiology or incidence of this condition, and evidence implicating infectious agents is increasing.  Understanding the link between infectious agents and vascular disease is an essential step for the development of new approaches to disease prevention and treatment.    Trials Assessing Innovative Strategies to Improve Clinical Practice through Guidelines in Heart, Lung, and Blood Diseases  This initiative will support research to elucidate why many physicians do not apply research results to clinical practices, even when results are incorporated into clinical recommendations and guidelines designed to help them treat their patients.  Researchers also will develop strategies to improve clinical guideline adherence.   Because many clinicians do not incorporate evidence-based guidelines when developing treatment strategies for their patients, some people do not benefit from research advances.  This lack of communication between the clinical researchers and the practicing clinicians may cause patients to suffer needless morbidity and mortality.  For example, providing state-of-the-art treatment to all patients experiencing acute myocardial infarctions could help to prevent an estimated 18,000 deaths per year.  Until the barriers for educating physicians about the most effective treatments are identified and methods for overcoming them are developed, it is unlikely that the nation will maximize its return on its investment in medical research.         National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research  (NIDCR)  Investments, Progress, and Plans  FY 1999 - 2003       Applying Biomimetics to Repairing and Restoring Oral and Facial Tissues  With more Americans living longer lives, there is an increasing need to repair and restore damaged bone and tissue.  Inherited disorders, infectious and neoplastic diseases, oral injuries, and many other chronic and disabling diseases can all result in damage to craniofacial bones and tissues.  The new discipline of biomimetics takes cues from nature to develop new approaches to repair and replace body tissues.  In the past three years NIDCR has used a portion of its increased funding to take advantage of the opportunities created by this emerging interdisciplinary field, with the long term goal of developing new techniques and methods of restoring orofacial bone and tissue.   NIDCR is supporting a series of new biomimetic projects.  For example, NIDCR has funded research with the long term goal of engineering fully functional skeletal muscle tissues to be used in craniofacial reconstructive surgery.  On the reconstruction of hard tissues —  including those of the temporomandibular joint — the Institute is supporting research on biocomputing techniques to design and manufacture  implants with specific architecture and shape to promote the growth of  new bone-forming cells. An additional series of new projects is directed at repair and replacement of dental tissue.  For example, scientists are focusing on the interface formed between two dissimilar tooth structures (enamel and dentin) to eventually biomimetically recreate this interface in tooth restorative materials. Although we expect the major impact of this body of research will take years to develop, some of these projects have already yielded results.  For example, one group of NIDCR-funded scientists have identified a key genetic protein that results in defective mineralization of teeth in mice.  If this protein proves to have a similar role in humans, this discovery could lead to new strategies to re-mineralize damaged teeth.      Using Microbial Genomics to Develop New Insights on Common Dental Diseases  The two most prevalent dental diseases, caries and periodontal diseases, are the major causes of tooth loss.  Once thought to be natural consequences of aging, caries and periodontal diseases are now recognized to be infections caused by bacteria in the biofilm that forms on teeth and other oral surfaces.  A variety of organisms have been implicated in causing these diseases, making it more difficult to determine why some individuals are more susceptible and others more resistant.  NIDCR has funded a series of efforts to sequence and analyze the genomes of several major organisms commonly found in the oral cavity.  The long-term goal of this research is to promote understanding of the roles these different organisms play in the development and progression of caries and periodontal diseases, leading to more effective prevention and treatment.   NIDCR has funded a series of projects in microbial genomics designed to sequence the genomes of six major organisms.  These organisms are all associated with caries and periodontal diseases, and several have also been implicated in other infections throughout the body.  Furthermore, several of these pathogens are closely related to organisms that cause other infectious diseases such as pneumonia.  These projects will enhance our capability to prevent and manage caries and periodontal diseases.    Reducing Oral Health Disparities  As we move into the 21st century, NIDCR can look back to over 50 years of progress in understanding, treating, and preventing the complex diseases that affect the mouth and face.  However, not all Americans have shared equally in the benefits of these important scientific breakthroughs.  Disparities in oral health continue to exist at all ages and among the different population groups that comprise our society. For example, African American men are one-third more likely to be diagnosed with oral cancer than whites, and their 5-year survival rate is only 28 percent, compared to a 53 percent survival rate for white men.  Women are more likely to develop autoimmune disorders such as Sjogren's syndrome, and more frequently suffer from temporomandibular disorders.  NIDCR's long term goal is to eliminate health disparities by improving health outcomes for disadvantaged populations through biomedical research.     NIDCR has sponsored additional work on health disparities across several scientific areas.  For example, in fiscal year 2001 NIDCR will be establishing the Centers for Research to Reduce Oral Disparities in partnership with the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as well as numerous NIH institutes and offices.  We are also expanding efforts to communicate research findings appropriately to populations at highest risk and to health professionals, and have embarked upon planning grants for state-wide models aimed at preventing oral cancer.       Future Initiatives       Construction of an Artificial Salivary Gland  NIDCR will also use the new technology of tissue engineering to focus on development of a ""first of its kind"" artificial salivary gland.  Saliva is a remarkable, multipurpose fluid whose presence most of us take for granted. Yet it is estimated that over one million people suffer a loss of salivary gland function as a result of Sjgren's syndrome (an autoimmune disease) or from radiation treatment for head or neck cancer. The resulting loss of saliva flow markedly impairs quality of life. Without adequate saliva, patients may experience difficulty speaking, chewing and swallowing. They may also experience rampant tooth decay, infections, loss of taste, and considerable discomfort. No effective treatments currently exist to help these patients.  NIDCR scientists are focused on creating a small tube that can be placed into the cheek of patients whose salivary gland cells have been destroyed. The tube would be lined with cells engineered to secrete a saliva-like substance. Scientists believe that this artificial salivary gland will be ready for clinical testing within 5-7 years.    Novel Genes Involved in Craniofacial Disorders  Through a new initiative, NIDCR is identifying and cataloguing the genes involved in specific stages of craniofacial development to find those responsible for craniofacial disorders and birth defects. Recently, 20,000 different markers from genes active in early embryos were identified. The next goal will be to identify the subset of genes that are expressed uniquely in the developing craniofacial tissues. Information available from the Human Genome Project also is helping to determine the location of expressed genes on human chromosomes. If the expressed genes map to sites close to known human genetic disorders, then they will be tested as a possible cause of that disease.    Centers for Research Excellence on Head and Neck Cancer  In fiscal year 2002, NIDCR and NCI will introduce a new initiative to co-fund Specialized Programs of Research Excellence (SPOREs) on head and neck cancers. These specialized programs are designed to support translational research that will have the most immediate impact on reducing the incidence, morbidity and mortality of organ-site cancers. Basic and clinical researchers will work together to search for new approaches to early detection, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of cancers. These programs are not only expected to conduct a wide spectrum of research, but also to contribute to the development of research model systems and the expansion of the research base through collaborations with laboratory scientists and clinicians nationwide.        National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases  (NIDDK)  Investments, Progress, and Plans  FY 1999 - 2003       Development of Cell Replacement Therapy for Diabetes  NIDDK aims to exploit emerging knowledge of the insulin-producing beta cell to develop innovative targets for treatment/prevention, including beta cell replacement/regeneration techniques to cure type 1 diabetes; strategies for preservation/replenishment of beta cell function to halt or delay disease progression; and methods to combat diminished insulin secretion/action and beta cell failure in type 2 diabetes.   NIDDK has:  (1) Capitalized on recent successes in islet transplant research through RFA on Human Islet Transplantation into Humans and establishment of intramural Transplant and Autoimmunity Branch; (2) Established Beta Cell Biology Consortium to [a] address islet supply shortage by developing new sources of islets from adult stem cells, [b] understand beta cell growth and development to facilitate efforts at beta cell regeneration, and [c] understand basis for islet cell failure in type 2 diabetes. (3) Launched initiative on functional genomics of the endocrine pancreas, and created consortium database, with Website; (4) Expanded initiative to disseminate microarray technology by creation of biotechnology centers and grant supplements; (6) Issued RFAs on adult stem cells and developmental aspects of the endocrine pancreas and on beta cell surface markers; (7) Advance: Identified genes for transcription factors crucial for islet and beta cell development.    Genetics of Type 2 Diabetes and Diabetic Nehropathy  Activities in this initiative focus on finding genes in polygenic diseases that confer susceptibility in terms of beta cell failure and insulin resistance, as well as genes that, independent of diabetes risk, confer susceptibility to irreversible kidney failure in diabetes patients.   NIDDK has:  (1) Created and expanded the International Type 2 Genetics Linkage Consortium; (2) Joined CIDR; (3) Added minorities to initial populations being studied in type 2 genetics consortium and launched new initiative:  FIND - Family Investigation of Nephropathy and Diabetes for genetic analysis of patient populations of different ethnic backgrounds; (4) Advances: [a] Identified SNPs of candidate genes; [b] Cloned MODY genes, many of which are transcription factors involved in beta cell development efforts described above; [c] Cloned NIDDM 1 gene, providing new targets for therapy/prevention.    Development of More Effective Treatments for Hepatitis C, with Emphasis on Minority Populations with Poor Response to Antiviral Drugs  NIDDK's goal is to combat hepatitis C, which is a major cause of chronic liver disease and liver failure, by understanding and redressing the reasons that a large proportion of patients, especially African Americans, do not respond to advances in therapy (interferon and ribavirin).   NIDDK has:  (1) Organized centers and launched major clinical trials — HALT-C trial and ancillary studies, plus new trial Chronic Hepatitis C in African Americans: Study of Resistance to Antiviral Therapy; (2) Spearheaded NIH-wide RFA on Hepatitis C: Natural History, Pathogenesis, Therapy and Prevention; (3) Co-sponsored RFA with NCCAM on Milk Thistle in Treatment of Hepatic Diseases; (5) Developed plans for health awareness campaign for minority populations.    Reducing ESRD through Understanding the Causes of and Developing Treatments for Inherited Kidney Diseases, with Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD) as a Model  This initiative's goal is to reduce the enormous personal and societal costs of end stage renal disease by halting/delaying the progression of PKD and other major ""precursor"" kidney diseases toward irreversible kidney failure and attendant dialysis/transplantation.   NIDDK has:  (1) Created 4 centers to capitalize on discovery of genes for PKD1 and PKD2, and to exploit mouse models and test innovative treatments; (2) Advance: Tyrosine kinase inhibitor cured PKD in mouse model; (3) Using developments in technology and mouse studies, launched consortium to test non-invasive  assessment of cyst enlargement as useful means of monitoring effectiveness of treatment strategies to be tested in future intervention trial planned for FY 2002 and for possible extension to other inherited kidney diseases; (4) Developed prospectus for FY 2002 planned intervention trial of converting enzyme inhibitors for slowing PKD progression; (5) Planned new National Kidney Disease Education Program.    Epidemiology and Treatment of Benign Urologic Diseases  NIDDK supports research to reduce the burden of painful inflammation, infections and obstructions of the genitourinary tract.   NIDDK has:  (1) Launched ""Urology in America Data Base"" to understand the natural history and progression of these diseases; (2) Established Urinary Incontinence Network for clinical research, and urinary incontinence awareness campaign; (3) Established Chronic Prostatitis Consortium, with enhanced minority recruitment; (4) Strengthened BPH portfolio, including initiative on plant-derived complementary therapies with NCCAM; (5) Issued RFA on Innovative Research Approaches to Basic Bladder Biology and the Painful Bladder Syndrome, which has significant relevance to interstitial cystitis; (6) Advance: New insights into virulence factors with respect to E. coli that increase the likelihood of bladder invasion by thread-like appendages on the surface of bacteria called pili — leading to UTIs. This advance may speed development of a vaccine to prevent UTIs in those at risk.      Future Initiatives       Type 1 Diabetes Trial Net  NIDDK will attain full-scale operation of this clinical trial network (clinical centers and coordinating center) to test innovative interventions to preserve pancreatic beta cell function and prevent type 1 diabetes.    Type 2 Diabetes in Children and Adolescents, with Emphasis on Minority Populations  NIDDK plans to develop and test effective prevention strategies and treatment regimens to combat the alarming increases of type 2 diabetes in young age groups through solicitation of investigator-initiated clinical trial proposals and a coordinating center.  Emphasis  will be on studies of community or school-based prevention programs that can be applied in a cost-effective manner to decrease risk factors and lower disease incidence and on treatment trials that may include lifestyle changes and/or medical therapy.    Diabetes Genome Anatomy Project  NIDDK will undertake gene profiling, not only of pancreatic tissue, but of all tissue relevant to diabetes, including fat, muscle, and kidney, to gain insights into the pathogenesis of diabetes and its complications.    Surgical Treatment of Obesity and Environmental Approaches to Its Prevention  NIDDK will undertake clinical study of gastric bypass surgery; initiate clinical trials in high-risk special populations; and enhance research on environmental approaches to prevention of obesity through accumulation of preliminary data needed for design of large-scale prevention trials.    Barrett's Esophagus and Adenocarcinoma  NIDDK plans to mount a major collaborative effort with NCI to define prevalence, natural history, pathogenesis and means of prevention and therapy based on workshops held in FY 2001.    Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Genetics Consortium and Clinical Research Network  NIDDK will establish an IBD Genetics Consortium based on results of FY 2001 workshop to review genetics studies; to identify specific risk alleles; and to understand gene-gene and gene-environment interactions, as well as population-specific differences.  Initiate clinical research network to facilitate timely and efficient testing of emerging drug therapies for IBD.    Clinical Research Network for Study of Fatty Liver Disease, NASH (Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis) To Prevent Progression to Cirrhosis and End-Stage Liver Disease  NIDDK will frame an interlocking set of cooperative agreements for 4-6 clinical centers and a data coordinating center for the design and implementation of a database and clinical research network to study the etiology, natural history, course, complications, contributing factors and therapy of this disease.  NASH typically occurs in middle-aged persons who are overweight and diabetic and for which there is currently no specific therapy.    Database on Living Donor Liver Transplantation  NIDDK will establish a database of 4 to 6 participating centers to elucidate the ethical, technical, medical and basic research issues surrounding this surgery, based on recommendations of an NIH workshop.  Although this surgery is difficult and potentially fatal, it is an important area for study because it represents a surgical alternative that avoids the lengthening waiting period for cadaveric transplant, may decrease the mortality rate on that waiting list, and change liver transplantation from an emergency into a scheduled procedure.    Prospective Cohort Study of Chronic Renal Insufficiency (CRIC)  NIDDK will establish a multicenter prospective study of factors associated with rapid decline in renal function and identify risk factors for cardiovascular disease.  Also establish central repository for biological specimens, including genetic material.    Expansion of Outreach and Public Education Efforts  NIDDK plans to expand existing National Diabetes Education Program (NDEP) to include a new initiative aimed at health care providers.  NIDDK will also launch a new National Kidney Disease Education Program, based on plans developed with the kidney community in FY 2001.        National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke  (NINDS)  Investments, Progress, and Plans  FY 1999 - 2003       Morris K. Udall Parkinson's Disease Research Centers of Excellence  Beginning in FY 1999 NINDS has funded a network of eleven Parkinson's disease research centers at universities and medical centers throughout the country.  The Udall centers provide the collaborative environment necessary to take full advantage of emerging discoveries in the basic and technological sciences that are the prelude to advances in treating, preventing, and curing Parkinson's disease.  Center activities range from basic studies of how genes and environment influence this disorder, to developing drugs, gene therapy, and surgical treatments.  The Centers will help find better ways to treat, and finally prevent or cure Parkinson's disease.    Specialized Neuroscience Research Programs at Minority Institutions  Since FY 1999 NINDS, working together with NCRR, the ORMH and other Institutes, has expanded its original center at Morehouse School of Medicine  to eight specialized neuroscience research centers at minority institutions and a network of research consortia at 28 leading neuroscience research programs.  The program is geographically diverse, including  centers in Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. NINDS is planning further expansion of SNRP activities with a parallel development of other research units focusing on health disparities as an integral part of the Institute plan for addressing heath disparities.  Our goal is to prepare future neuroscience and health professionals who can assist NIH in reducing the disease disparity of populations that are historically at increased risk for diseases and disorders of the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nervous system.    Implementation of the Parkinson's Research Agenda  In FY 2001 NIH began aggressively implementing a five year  plan for Parkinson's disease research, from basic science to clinical priorities such as drug, surgical, and cell transplantation therapies.  Actions so far, or planned for the near term, include expedited grant supplements, several workshops, grant and contract solicitations, and efforts to recruit new investigators, encourage resource sharing among researchers, create a patient registry and provide an extensive web site.  Costs will increase further as progress moves into large phase III clinical trials.  The long-term goal is to find ways to treat, prevent and cure Parkinson's disease and related disorders    NINDS Infrastructure Supplement Program  Neuroscience has always been highly dependent on technology.  In FY 1999 NINDS offered grantees the opportunity to submit one page applications, with rapid review,  for supplements to purchase small equipment essential for everyday experiments to replace outmoded, and often inadequate, items. The response was overwhelming, with more than 1400 applications, indicating a critical unmet need in the neuroscience research community. NINDS has continued the Infrastructure support program in subsequent years.  The program has the added advantage of providing essential support without a multi-year budget commitment.  The program's goal is to improve the efficiency of research in all areas of the NINDS mission.    Developing Tests for Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSEs)  Response to the public health and economic threats presented by transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (""mad cow disease"") are severely hampered by the lack of adequate tests.  NINDS has long been a leader in this formerly obscure area of neuroscience.  The Institute has directed that expertise, through a major contract program funded in FY 2000, to developing the needed tests.  NINDS' goal is to address the critical need for early and sensitive detection of TSEs    Emergency Stroke Program  Now that NINDS sponsored trials have demonstrated that improvements in emergency treatment of stroke can improve outcome, it is crucial to build on those findings and develop better emergency treatments. The NIH intramural environment provides unique opportunities for interdisciplinary collaborations, but lacked the necessary emergency facilities.  Beginning in FY 1999, the Institute recruited leading clinical stroke researchers and created an emergency stroke treatment research program in cooperation with local Suburban Hospital with the aim of improving diagnosis and emergency treatment of stroke.  Our goal in implementing the program is to  improve emergency care of stroke, thereby reducing death and disability.      Future Initiatives       Acute Stroke Centers  In 1995 NINDS demonstrated the first effective treatment for acute ischemic stroke, but the drug TPA is only partly effective and can not be used in all strokes.  The NINDS sponsors many laboratory research projects that demonstrate the potential of other drugs for stroke, but translating those findings to practical treatments has been hampered by the slow emergence of state-of-the-art acute stroke centers, in part due to financial constraints of the healthcare marketplace. NINDS is therefore planning to support a network of acute stroke centers across the U.S., each capable of  treating  patients rapidly and serving as a clinical laboratory for scientific projects carrying out investigations related to acute stroke.  The network should reduce the incidence of death and disability from stroke.    Neuroprotection Trial for Parkinson's Disease  NINDS is developing  a program of clinical trials focusing on drugs that, unlike current options, actually slow the course of Parkinson's disease.  The design will efficiently evaluate several compounds during a single trial and involve a large number of patients at more than 40 clinical centers.  NINDS will seek suggestions broadly for possible drugs to test, from NIH investigators, the Parkinson's research community, Parkinson's patients and advocates, and pharmaceutical companies.  Our goal is to find drugs that slow or stop the progression of Parkinson's disease.    Bioengineering Research Partnerships  NINDS enthusiastically participated in the trans-NIH Bioengineering Research Partnership, in 1999 and 2000. The Institute  has a longstanding program in neural prosthesis development that relates to the initiative, but applications received spanned other emerging areas of opportunity including brain imaging, predicting and preventing epileptic seizures and automated MR imaging in multiple sclerosis.  In view of the number of high quality applications received, NINDS proposes to expand its participation in this initiative in FY 2002.  Through participation, we hope to harness bioengineering for reducing the burden of neurological disorders.    Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke  Despite many studies, the reasons for the geographical and racial disparities in stroke are poorly understood.  The well documented disparities between the ""stroke belt"" and other areas of the U.S. cannot be explained by known risk factors and racial characteristics.   NINDS proposes to fund a large-scale study, using an innovative combination of home visits and clinical measurements, that is expected to answer questions about stroke disparities that have plagues scientists, clinicians, and policy makers.  Our goal is to eliminate the geographic and racial disparities in stroke.    Achieving Benchmarks for Progress Against Epilepsy  In March 2000 NINDS organized a landmark conference focused on finding ways to cure or prevent epilepsy.  Building on the momentum of the conference an extensive planning effort by leading epilepsy experts and NIH staff produced a series of detailed benchmarks needed to accomplish the long term goals.  Achieving those benchmarks will require extensive new programs in many areas of basic and clinical science, as well as technology.  We aim to improve treatment and move toward curing and preventing epilepsy.    Developing Drugs for Neurological Disorders  Increasing understanding about the molecular basis of neurological disorders presents new targets for developing drug treatments.  However, industry is not focusing on most of these disorders.  NINDS is therefore developing programs to remove technological barriers and encourage academic investigators by providing access to high throughput drug screening technology, support for the development of rapid assays (tests) of potential new drugs, and logistic and financial help to screen compounds already approved by the FDA for other uses.  We hope to develop better drugs for neurological disorders.    Implementation of Brain Tumor Progress Review Group Recommendations  The most common types of brain tumors are often rapidly fatal, and effective treatment is not available.  The Brain Tumor Genome Anatomy Project (BTGAP), well underway in cooperation with NCI, has demonstrated the prospects for applying new approaches to understanding brain tumors. In 2000 - 2001 NINDS and NCI convened more than 100 experts in all aspects of brain tumor biology and treatment to assess the state of the science in 14 critical areas relevant to brain tumor research and to provide detailed recommendations for  stimulating  progress.   Full implementation will require engaging disciplines from basic molecular, cancer and neurosciences, through epidemiology, pharmacology, radiation biology, and imaging.  Our goal is to improve treatment for brain tumors.        National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases  (NIAID)  Investments, Progress, and Plans  FY 1999 - 2003       The Immune Tolerance Network (ITN)  The ITN was established with an October 1999 award that involves nearly 40 institutions.  The ITN develops new ways of inducing immune tolerance, i.e., inducing the ability to selectively adjust the immune system so that it inhibits harmful immune responses while keeping protective ones intact.  The strategy has promise for improving the success of transplants and treatments for autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes.  Currently underway are studies on kidney transplantation and islet cell transplantation (for treatment of type-1 diabetes).  In FY 2001, additional funds will be awarded to the ITN to expand its scope to include application of immune tolerance to prevention and treatment of asthma and allergic diseases.    The HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) and the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN)  The HVTN and the HPTN strengthen and expand capacity for HIV vaccine and other prevention research.  Both networks enable clinical trials to be conducted in a global context so that the studies  are carried out domestically as well as in the countries devastated by the AIDS pandemic.  The HVTN has a comprehensive clinical research agenda.  Formerly, early-stage HIV vaccine testing was carried out separately from the network that conducted later testing.   The HPTN has a special focus on non-vaccine HIV/AIDS prevention research.  Previously, that research was subsumed in the same network that tested HIV/AIDS vaccines.  This work is central to international efforts to contain the AIDS pandemic.   In July 2000, awards were made to establish HVTN and HPTN clinical trial sites.  In FY 2001, funds will be awarded to initiate preparations for clinical trials, such as: the first Federal Phase III (efficacy) trial of an HIV vaccine candidate (HVTN); and safety and efficacy trials of several novel topical microbicides and methods to block transmission of HIV from mother to child during the birthing process.    The Vaccine Research Center (VRC)  The VRC enables a comprehensive, multi-disciplinary approach to vaccine design and development.  Although the primary current focus of the VRC is an AIDS vaccine, the long-term mission is broader — to facilitate development of effective vaccines for human disease.  The VRC began operation as a ""laboratory without walls.""  In the summer of  2000, the Center moved into its newly completed research building.  The Center has assembled a team of world class scientists in structural biology, virology, and immunology.  The VRC also has created core laboratories in immunology, flow cytometry, vector development, a biocontainment laboratory, an animal facility, a vaccine production program, and a clinical trials program.  Research laboratories within the VRC are in the process of generating multiple vaccine candidates.    Expansion of the Malaria Vaccine Development Unit (MVDU)  A licensed vaccine against malaria, one of the most deadly infectious diseases worldwide, has been a goal of the infectious disease research community for decades.  NIAID's intramural MVDU identifies candidate vaccines, develop vaccine production processes, and test vaccine candidates in the U.S. and malaria endemic areas overseas.   The MVDU moved into newly renovated space in the Twinbrook II building in Rockville in January 2001.  The MVDU had been in temporary quarters since its establishment within the Laboratory of Parasitic Diseases.  The renovated space provides new capacity for production of recombinant proteins for use in candidate vaccines, production of clinical grade proteins, and testing of vaccine candidates in animal models.      Future Initiatives       Pathogen Functional Genomics Resource Center  The proposed Pathogen Functional Genomics Resource Center would capitalize on the information contained in recently deciphered pathogen gene sequences.  By providing the research community with a wide range of resources and technologies the Center would enable efficient determination of the function and expression of sequenced microbial genes.   The potential insights could revolutionize research on infectious disease processes and be critical to the development of new vaccines, therapies, and diagnostics.    International Centers of Excellence in Research (ICER)  Through partnerships with developing counties, the ICER program would promote the development of a sustained research program in areas with high infectious disease burdens.  Uniquely drawing the resources and skills of an intramural and an extramural division of NIAID, the ICER program would enable U.S. scientists and their counterparts in developing nations to jointly develop a scientific agenda that addresses endemic infectious diseases and would foster infrastructure development and training so that a platform for ongoing research collaboration is formed.    When to Start and When/How to Change Antiretroviral Therapy  Potent combinations of anti-HIV drugs (highly active antiretroviral therapy or ""HAART"") have reduced the number of AIDS deaths and new AIDS cases in many western countries; however, the utility of these medications is limited by cost, toxicities, complicated and disruptive dosing regimens, and development of drug resistance.  NIAID proposes initiatives on research into when to start antiretroviral therapy and into when/how to change antiretroviral therapy in order to evaluate the long-term clinical effectiveness of different approaches to therapeutic intervention.  Large, randomized clinical trials in adults, with primary endpoints of long-term morbidity, mortality and quality of life would be used to maximize the benefit and minimize the limitations of antiretroviral therapy.    Infectious Etiology of Chronic Diseases: Novel Approaches to Pathogen Detection  Over the past several years, scientists have demonstrated that infectious agents can cause diseases such as Lyme arthritis, cervical cancer, and liver cancer.  Mounting evidence indicates that infectious agents also may cause and/or contribute to coronary artery disease, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and other diseases.  NIAID seeks to identify and understand the role of infectious agents in the cause and progression of chronic diseases, with the ultimate aim of developing effective prevention and treatment strategies.    Comprehensive International Program of Research on AIDS (CIPRA)  NIAID hopes to launch the CIPRA to provide long-term support for clinical and laboratory studies to identify and develop practical, affordable, and acceptable methods to prevent and treat  HIV/AIDS in adults and children in developing countries.  Among other goals, this program would enhance the capacity of host countries to participate in large-scale trials sponsored by the HIV Vaccine Trial Network.    Sex and Gender Differences in Immune Response  This initiative would support multidisciplinary research to identify, characterize, and define sex and gender-based differences in immune responses.  Such difference may be important in autoimmune diseases (including multiple sclerosis, Sjgren's syndrome, vasculitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis), and other immune-mediated diseases such as allergies, and infectious diseases.  Knowledge of differences in the immune response should allow the development of gender targeted therapies or preventive strategies to improve the health of both men and women.    Integrated Preclinical/Clinical Program in Topical Microbicides  NIAID has a strong commitment to the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases.  A component of NIAID's research program is focused on microbicides, substances designed to prevent sexual transmission of microorganisms. The Integrated Preclinical/Clinical Program in Topical Microbicides would stimulate and support the discovery and development of novel microbicides and combination strategies, and will provide support for translational studies to move new approaches into early clinical trials.        National Institute of General Medical Sciences  (NIGMS)  Investments, Progress, and Plans  FY 1999 - 2003       Structural Genomics  The NIGMS Protein Structure Initiative is designed to organize a large-scale, cooperative effort in the field of structural genomics, which involves predicting the three-dimensional shapes of proteins from gene sequences using biophysics techniques such as X-ray crystallography and NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy.  Knowing the shapes of proteins will enable researchers to better understand how proteins function normally and how faulty protein structures can cause disease.  In September 2000, the Institute awarded $29.7 million to fund the first year of seven pilot research center projects, each of which will be funded for 5 years.  The long-term goal for the effort is to develop a public database of protein structures — in 10 years, NIGMS hopes to have 10,000 structures in this repository, which will be freely available to the scientific community.  Currently, each of the centers is buying equipment, hiring staff, and transforming itself from a collection of many individual research laboratories into a unified research center.    ""Glue"" Grants  NIGMS created an initiative to ""glue"" together large groups of scientists pursuing some of the biggest unsolved problems in biomedicine today.  In September 2000, NIGMS made the first ""glue"" grant award of $7.3 million for the first of 5 years to a consortium of basic scientists called the Alliance for Cellular Signaling (AFCS).  A key long-term goal of this initiative is to create a ""virtual cell,"" in which scientists will be able to create ""wiring diagrams"" for healthy cells.  This is expected to greatly enhance the drug development process.  To date, the AFCS has compiled a list of more than 2,400 proteins involved in cellular signaling.  The AFCS expects to begin to share its first experimental results with the scientific community within the next few months.    Pharmacogenetics  Pharmacogenetics is the science of how a person's genes influence how he or she responds to medicines.  NIGMS is leading a trans-NIH effort called the Pharmacogenetics Research Network and Knowledge Base, an interactive network of pharmacogenetics investigators who store data in a shared information library that is freely accessible to the scientific community.  The first nine pharmacogenetics research network awards — totaling $12.8 million for the first year of funding, $8.5 million of it from NIGMS — were made in April 2000.  Grantees are already collecting data.  An important long-term goal of the effort will be to expand and maintain the PharmGKB information library.    Integrative Studies of Complex Systems  NIGMS has created a set of initiatives to promote quantitative, interdisciplinary approaches to solving biomedical research problems.  These approaches are often necessary to begin to understand the complex, interactive behavior of many components, such as how cells communicate and how organs ""talk"" to each other.  The long-term goals of such integrative studies include understanding all of the genetic and environmental components that work together to regulate processes and conditions such as the development of embryos, inflammation, complex disorders like heart disease, and many others.  A key part of this effort is recruiting mathematicians, physicists, engineers, and computer scientists to this area of biomedical research.    Minority Programs  An important component of the NIGMS mission is to administer research and research training programs aimed at increasing the number of minority biomedical scientists in the United States.  In the past 3 years, NIGMS funding for all of its minority programs has nearly doubled, predominantly due to funding research at a more enabling level and to implementing new programs for minority student development.  In recent years, the number of minority students participating in one particular research program, the Minority Biomedical Research Support (MBRS) Program, has risen sharply, nearly doubling from 1997 to 2000.      Future Initiatives       Centers of Excellence in Complex Biomedical Systems Research  NIGMS recognizes that biomedical research is entering an era in which computational approaches will be vital to deepening our understanding of biological behavior.  In addition to research contributions, NIGMS-funded Centers for Excellence in Computational Biology will provide academic institutions with the means to make interdisciplinary research in complex biological systems and bioinformatics attractive career options for both established and beginning investigators.  The institutions will receive the resources to recruit new investigators who have the skills needed to develop new methods and tools, and to develop appropriate training programs in computational and information sciences.  This program is part of NIGMS' activities under the NIH Biomedical Information Science and Technology Initiative (BISTI).    Centers of Excellence in Chemical Methodology and Library Development  These centers will encourage chemists to develop new methods to create ""combinatorial chemistry libraries.""  Such libraries, which are collections of diverse molecules, are already important drug discovery tools, but they are now limited by current methods.  By establishing the centers, NIGMS intends to encourage collaboration between chemists, engineers, and biologists.  The ultimate goal is to enhance the quality and structural diversity of combinatorial chemistry libraries and to improve scientists' access to high-quality libraries for use in studying biological processes.    Instrumentation  NIGMS plans to offer funding opportunities for scientists to invest in state-of-the-art research tools such as the following:      900 megaHertz NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) imagers.  These new ultra-high-field machines can provide a much higher-quality picture of large proteins, and they can even detect protein and sugar molecules in motion as they carry out their biological functions.     ""CryoEM"" (cryo-electron microscopy).  This and other forms of so-called high-resolution microscopy can enable researchers to view molecules and cells much more clearly than is possible using other microscopic techniques, thus promoting a better understanding of fundamental biological entities.  In particular, the three-dimensional arrangement of molecules can be much better discerned using new, experimental techniques of this type.  NIGMS has already invested, and will continue to invest, in advancing technology in this area.    Synchrotron supplements.  The NIGMS synchrotron initiative will continue to provide support to enhance instrumentation and support additional staff at four U.S. synchrotrons.  These facilities are essential workhorses for scientists using X-ray crystallography to decipher the shapes of proteins.  By providing funds to upgrade synchrotrons, NIGMS continues to play an important role in opening up use of these extremely expensive pieces of equipment to many more biomedical researchers.  In addition, NIGMS, in partnership with the National Cancer Institute, is planning the development and operation of two new ""beamlines"" at the Advanced Photon Source — the newest and most advanced U.S. synchrotron — at Argonne National Laboratory in Argonne, Illinois.      Expansion of Current Efforts  NIGMS will continue to nurture the following areas of science with future NIH budget increases:      Interdisciplinary, collaborative science (planning to fund at least one more large-scale ""glue"" grant)     Pharmacogenetics (planning to enhance the Pharmacogenetics Research Network)    Structural Genomics (planning to expand the Protein Structure Initiative)         National Institute of Child Health and Human Development  (NICHD)  Investments, Progress, and Plans  FY 1999 - 2003       Learning and Learning Disabilities  Nurturing children's ability to learn is critical to their lifelong success and functioning.  This effort supports a range of activities to better understand how inherited, biological, and environmental conditions mold human learning and behavior.  Complementary efforts translate this knowledge into effective interventions.  The long-term goal is to develop dynamic research methods and a strong, scientific evidence base to support effective and developmentally appropriate interventions to maximize the learning and reading ability of all children, with and without learning disabilities.   Significant progress has been made on many fronts.  In terms of determining ""what works,"" the NICHD established the National Reading Panel to assess state-of-the art research concerning the best methods to teach reading in our nation's classrooms.  After publishing the Panel's report, ""Teaching Children to Read,"" extended efforts are being made to disseminate the findings broadly and to prepare training materials for teachers.  Scientifically-based protocols to improve reading skills and prevent reading failure among the highest risk children in Washington D.C schools are just ending.  Preliminary data show that the interventions significantly reduced reading failures in all participating schools.  Even schools where children were reading overall at the 10th percentile level reached the 50th percentile in just one year.  In addition, new grants will support critical research to understand the specific cognitive, cultural, and instructional factors that promote or impede English reading and writing for Spanish-speaking children.  Recently, a conference was held to develop early assessment models and a research agenda for early intervention programs for children, from birth to age 6, at risk for reading failure, which will guide our next research expansion in this area.   Other initiatives target children with special needs.  The extension of the Collaborative Programs of Excellence in Autism will add new studies on language development and early cognition in children with autism.  New studies concerning cognition in individuals with Down's syndrome are also being funded.  The Science and Ecology of Early Development initiative — to understand how social, economic, and environmental disadvantages influence social, emotional and cognitive development B has led to studies targeting school readiness and language development among lower income children.  Researchers are also being asked to address how early literacy is best achieved in homes where parental literacy is low, and how adult literacy affects lifelong functioning and health.  Finally, the expansion of the Learning Disabilities Research Program is applying new neuroimaging technology to assess brain changes following treatment programs for children with language and reading difficulties.    Women's Health Initiatives  This effort supports a broad range of complementary initiatives that address understudied, and often unique and preventable health conditions that seriously threaten or affect the quality of life of millions of women worldwide.  This broad effort will develop and help bring to market safe, effective and acceptable contraceptive microbicides to help women protect themselves from HIV infection; help researchers better understand, diagnose, and treat a range of urogynecologic and pelvic floor disorders, from incontinence to prolapse and vulvodynia, and support the infrastructure needed to train the next generation of clinicians dedicated to women's health research.   Over the past several years the NICHD published over 10 RFAs and PAs with set asides addressing these issues. To prevent the sexual transmission of HIV, academic and non-profit researchers are working with private industry developing, and trying to bring to market, novel microbicides.  Behavioral studies will ensure that these products are acceptable to and used by a wide range of women while basic research studies will help design more targeted and effective compounds.  Newly funded projects will aid researchers in understanding normal female pelvic structure and function as well as the disease processes related to pelvic floor disorders.  Clinical trials of improved ways to treat these conditions will soon be under way.  Several new projects promise to unlock the biology of and risk factors associated with the poorly understood, yet disabling condition, vulvodynia, while linking findings to improved treatment strategies.  Nearly 60 scholars have been appointed in the 20 new Women=s Health Research Career Development Centers, which have been established nationwide to allow newly trained OB/GYNs to enter research careers addressing such concerns as endometriosis, fibroids, and hormone regulation.  Other initiatives ensure that OB/GYNs obtain rigorous training in epidemiology and clinical trial methods.    Preventing Birth Defects and Inherited and Developmental Disorders  Building on the revolutionary advances in human genomics, this effort encourages researchers to develop new technologies along with new strategies to diagnose and prevent a range of birth defects and inherited and developmental disorders.  The many initiatives in this effort should advance technologies to characterize the genetic control of early development; develop molecular and genetic tests to diagnose early abnormal development in humans; and design safe and effective treatment and prevention strategies to prevent birth defects — the leading cause of infant mortality in the U.S. — and many other developmental disorders such as Fragile X, Rett Syndrome, and autism.   The NICHD continues to lead trans-NIH efforts to expand research that uses animal models with easy-to-visualize embryos such as the zebrafish and the frog, Xenopus.  These expanded activities will provide data on the function of developmentally relevant genes and create new ways to observe changes in early body structures and organ systems over time.  A new facility to create and share mouse models for human birth defects has also been started.  Novel studies will integrate the latest advances from developmental genetics, genomics, epidemiology, and statistical modeling to help researchers better understand the distribution of birth defects in populations.  Collaborating bench scientists and clinicians, working in newly established multidisciplinary research centers, will use the data to improve diagnostic tests as well as strategies to treat and prevent birth defects.  Concurrently, new grants will examine the genetics, disease mechanisms, and biomarkers for Rett Syndrome, a crippling brain disorder that strikes baby girls.  Support from the Fragile X Research Foundation will help fund grants targeting the genetics and neurobiology of Fragile X, the most common form of inherited mental retardation in the U.S.  In addition, expanded support for the Collaborative Programs of Excellence in Autism will enhance research on the genetics of autism.  Finally, a series of related projects plus a major, multiagency, longitudinal cohort study will examine how genetic factors interact with other biological, environmental and behavioral variables, starting in the fetal period, to produce chronic disease and influence long term health outcomes.    Medical Rehabilitation  This effort includes complementary initiatives that expand scientific resources in the field, while developing advanced technologies and novel interventions to address such concerns as traumatic brain injury (TBI), spinal cord injury, pediatric rehabilitation, and neural and tissue plasticity and recovery.  Long-term goals for this effort include transforming medical rehabilitation research into a mature science using and improving state-of-the-art technology, as well as acquiring and translating basic and clinical knowledge into innovative interventions that markedly improve the functioning and quality of life of persons with a range of disabilities.   A combination of broad and targeted initiatives have already been implemented to achieve these goals.  To establish a resource intensive foundation upon which to expand medical rehabilitation research nationwide, four regional networks have been established.  These partnerships bring together researchers from various disciplines to cross-fertilize ideas, maximize access to the newest technologies, and attract experienced researchers in the field while training new ones.  Building on this concept, a recent initiative encourages investigators to develop innovative, non-surgical or pharmaceutical, interventions to advance rehabilitation therapies by supporting pilot studies and proof-of-concept projects.  In addition, over 35 new grants will help investigators find better ways to image, analyze, and repair soft tissue injuries and find new ways to try to enable people to walk after spinal cord injury.  Researchers have also been asked to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of using pharmaceutical agents, normally used to treat adults after TBI on children, and to develop pilot studies to establish the basis for going forward with full-scale clinical trials.  Finally, researchers will soon be using functional imaging to assess the brain's circuitry, which is related to cognition and behavior, and is affected by TBI.  The insights gained by these studies will allow scientists to assess and compare the best way to overcome the long-term consequences of TBI.      Future Initiatives     Reducing Preterm Births  Much of the difference in infant mortality rates between African American and non-African American infants appears to be related to infection-associated preterm birth. To further investigate this link, the NICHD will supplement existing clinical trials and initiate new ones. This will allow researchers to assess the most effective strategies to treat and prevent infectious and inflammatory diseases in pregnant women at greatest risk of preterm birth. The Institute will also fund new studies to specifically examine the genetic factors that may contribute to preterm delivery and the continuing disparities in preterm birth rates.    Reducing Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) in Native American Communities  While public outreach initiatives to place infants on their backs to sleep have helped to reduce overall SIDS rates, disparities in SIDS rates and in adoption of risk reduction behaviors persist.  The Institute will evaluate its intensified outreach to African American communities to help reduce these disparities and to encourage more African American babies to be placed on their backs to sleep.  The Institute will also expand its outreach to Native American communities, where the highest SIDS rates in the U.S. exist.  Due to the prevalence of heavy drinking on some reservations, as well as preliminary data showing a strong association between alcohol exposure and SIDS, the NICHD will collaborate with the NIAAA and the at-risk communities to examine how prenatal alcohol exposure affects the developing fetus.  The long-term goal is to develop specific therapeutic and culturally appropriate preventive strategies to protect the mother and her developing child.    Basic and Clinical Research Targeting Uterine Fibroids  The NICHD will expand its efforts to better define the causes and most appropriate treatments for uterine fibroids -- the most frequently diagnosed tumor of the female pelvis, the number one reason for hysterectomy, and a condition that disproportionately affects African American women.  This effort will include research on the factors that lead to uterine fibroids, and support for clinical trials to assess the most effective pharmaceutical treatments and surgical approaches.    Cooperative Reproductive Science Research Centers At Minority Institutions  This effort will foster independent and competitive research capabilities of faculty, students, and fellows at minority institutions by encouraging collaborations with other NICHD-funded programs in the reproductive science.  Particular emphasis will be placed on research addressing reproductive biology, physiology, and genetics; reproductive endocrinology; and reproductive medicine encompassing infertility, gynecology, and andrology.    Male Reproductive Health and Contraceptive Development  The NICHD will support collaborative biomedical and behavioral research to develop novel scientific approaches to regulating male fertility.  The goal is to develop male contraceptive products that are acceptable to and easily adopted by men.  The Institute will also support career-development and training grants to develop a new cadre of investigators who are dedicated to advancing male reproductive health and contraceptive research.    Behavioral Interventions for Preventing Unintended Pregnancy and Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs)  A critical goal of the NICHD's strategic plan on reproductive health is to reduce the high rate of unintended pregnancy in the U.S. by influencing sexual behavior and by improving contraceptive use and services.  Building on its previous research efforts, the NICHD will support basic research on the specific factors that influence the decision to continue, discontinue, or switch contraceptive methods.  Related research will focus on preventing STDs and other reproductive tract infections, which disproportionately affect minority communities.  Based on this information, researchers will be able to develop interventions that are culturally sensitive, cost-effective, and sustainable within the targeted community.    Normative and Adverse Behavior in Teens  Other than the first three years of life, there is probably no other time when developmental changes occur so rapidly and so profoundly as during the teen years.  To better understand these processes, the NICHD will support research to understand how interactions between the brain, hormones, and environmental stimuli lead to changes in teen behavior at the onset of puberty and into young adulthood.  Researchers will also examine how these processes are modified by such external factors as peers, family, and the community. This research holds promise for significantly expanding our scientific understanding of this complex developmental period, and highlighting new ways to prevent adverse behaviors, including violence, in teens.     Self-Injurious Behavior  One of the most challenging problems in managing and treating developmental disabilities is self-injurious behavior (SIB).  Up to 20 percent of all people with intellectual and other developmental disabilities engage in repetitive SIB, and 40-50 percent of individuals with autism injure themselves.  Based on recommendations from a recent workshop, the Institute will support studies to unravel the complex interactions that lead to SIB, including how alterations in neurological ""circuitry"" in multiple brain regions may cause SIB.    Fragile X  To sustain and more effectively exploit rapid advances in the field, and to implement a recent Congressional mandate, the NICHD will initiate new center activities targeting the genetics and clinical treatment of Fragile X.  Fragile X is the most common inherited cause of mental retardation in the U.S. and provides a research avenue to study other inherited conditions.     Clinical Trials for Pediatric Trauma Rehabilitation  Although injuries and violence are the most frequent causes of death in 5 to 18 year-old children, many clinical treatments for trauma are tailored exclusively to adults, or fail to consider the long-term effects of such interventions on the developing child.  Based on preliminary data gained from planning grants for pharmacological and other interventions in pediatric TBI, the NICHD will expand successful pilot studies into full-scale clinical trials.  Related initiatives will broadly examine the effects of other forms of trauma at the cellular level, and in relation to developing tissues, organs, and systems of children.  Additional studies will target the relationship between acute care and rehabilitative treatments for children, and the impact of socioeconomic, cultural, and other factors on short- and long-term health outcomes.     Cooperative Multicenter TBI Clinical Trials Network  The NICHD will also launch its multicenter TBI rehabilitation network for adult patients.  This network will develop and conduct clinical trials of therapeutic techniques, procedures, devices and pharmaceutical agents to improve the function of people with traumatic brain injury.  Researchers will also investigate the underlying biology of these interventions.     Timing, Intensity, Duration of Rehabilitation for Stroke and Hip Fracture  Strokes and hip fractures account for the majority of inpatient rehabilitation days and expenses for the elderly.  Unfortunately, current medical practices are more heavily influenced by reimbursement rules from such payers as Medicare than by actual empirical research detailing optimal treatment schedules.  The NICHD will work with the Health Care Financing Administration in a unique collaboration to design and support clinical trials to evaluate and determine optimum rehabilitation therapy schedules and techniques.        National Eye Institute  (NEI)  Investments, Progress, and Plans  FY 1999 - 2003       Advanced Vision Research Instrumentation Initiative  This initiative was intended to establish collaborative programs to create innovative and effective approaches to satisfy vision research instrumentation needs.  As a mechanism of support, the NEI is cooperating with other institutes in sponsoring Bioengineering Science and Technology Partnerships.  Progress in the production of advanced vision research instrumentation requires multidisciplinary research teams that include bioengineers, basic scientists, and clinical scientists capable of supporting an integrative systems approach to this research.  Among the goals of this initiative are the development of assistive devices for the visually impaired, imaging devices to improve non-invasive examination of ocular tissues for both research and disease diagnosis, instruments to analyze the biomechanics and visual performance of the eye.   The NEI is currently funding six partnerships under the advanced vision research instrumentation initiative.  These projects include:  development of a long-term implantable retinal stimulator for patients blinded by retinal degenerations; investigation of ways to enhance the accessibility of intersections for pedestrians who are blind or visually impaired; development of an instrument to measure the physical properties of the retina and to create images of retinal microstructure; and merging of advances in optics and molecular and gene therapy technologies to produce images of neural activity in the visual centers of the brain.    Identification of the Genes Expressed in the Visual System  This initiative allowed the NEI to significantly increase its research to identify and sequence genes that are expressed in the visual system.  The identification of important eye genes, their nucleotide sequence and patterns of expression will be a tremendous resource for vision scientists investigating the molecular mechanisms involved in visual system development and the genetic basis of blinding eye diseases.  The ultimate goal of this initiative is to generate a complete set of full-length cDNA clones and their sequences from the visual system, which will provide more comprehensive information on the protein coding regions.  Additionally, emphasis is being placed on developing efficient methods for quantifying the expression of genes in microdissected tissue samples.   High-quality cDNA libraries are being prepared from ocular tissue that are representative qualitatively and quantitatively of the genes expressed in the visual system and are optimized to detect rare or unique sequences.  Specific cDNA libraries are being produced from both mouse and human eye tissues such as retina, lens, cornea, optic nerve, and visual cortex and discrete regions of eye tissue.  Work is currently underway in the NEI intramural program to make this catalogue of genes expressed in the visual system publicly available in an easily accessible and retrievable database through a NEI-supported website.      Future Initiatives       Diabetic Eye Disease Initiative  The NEI will support two new initiatives that were among the recommendations of the Congressionally-established Diabetes Research Working Group.  The first involves evaluation of new treatments for diabetic macular edemaa condition in which damaged retinal blood vessels leak fluid and lipids (fats) that cause swelling of the macula and blurring of vision.  The treatments include both medical and surgical approaches.  A pilot study is being planned in NEI's intramural clinical research program to test methods for evaluating less intense photocoagulation, vitamin E supplementation, and lipid lowering.  The pilot study is intended to set the stage for a major multicenter randomized clinical trial for the treatment of diabetic macular edema.  The second initiative will identify genetic associations in patients with microvascular complications of diabetes.  The NEI will supplement the Family Investigation of Nephropathy in Diabetes study funded by NIDDK to investigate the genetics of individuals and special populations  of patients with renal disease.  The NEI will support detailed eye examinations for these patients and will search for genetic associations with microvascular disease.   To identify other areas of genetic research that may aid in the prevention or more effective treatment of diabetic retinopathy, the NEI convened a workshop in September 2000 to explore whether recent advances in genetic research increased the opportunity for understanding the genetic predisposition underlying the development and progression of diabetic retinopathy.  A multidisciplinary group of clinicians, epidemiologists, statistical geneticists, and molecular geneticists examined the existing evidence for genetic factors influencing the development of diabetic retinopathy.  They also determined whether recent work on the development of diabetic nephropathy provided approaches which could be exploited for studies of diabetic retinopathy.  Nine recommendations from the workshop identifying collaborations to pursue and research studies to develop and implement are currently being finalized.  These recommendations will form the basis for expanding current research and developing future program initiatives.    Initiative on Degenerative Diseases of the Retina  The NEI will provide funds to support collaborations of scientists that could merge different scientific disciplines and technologies, share access to services and facilities, and provide a comprehensive approach for applied research on ocular diseases and disorders.  Several scientific areas such as gene therapy for retinal degenerations, rehabilitation of low vision, gene therapy for pseudoxanthoma elasticum, and the treatment of diabetic retinopathy have generated approaches that the NEI would like to see move more quickly into clinical trials or applications.  As a means of hastening this progress, the NEI plans to expand extramural and intramural support for collaborative multidisciplinary research focused on the development of novel therapies to restore or prevent the loss of function due to visual diseases and disorders.   Many visual system diseases are complex, and the rapid and efficient translation of research findings into clinical application will require a comprehensive and highly integrated approach.  Such a collaborative approach would be particularly appropriate for therapeutic research that involves a biological intervention, such as gene therapy or pharmacological approaches.  For example, the development of new therapies in the treatment of retinal degenerations using gene replacement therapy will require collaborations among geneticists who have identified and cloned a defect-specific gene, molecular biologists who can produce appropriate vectors, cell biologists with animal model systems in which to test products, and clinical researchers who can perform Phase I and/or II human safety and/or efficacy trials.  Similarly, pharmacologic treatments to preserve function, reverse degenerative processes, or facilitate transplantation strategies with neuroprotective agents, growth factors, or other biologics could require collaborations among pharmacologists who can isolate and purify factors, chemists who can synthesize drug delivery systems, cell biologists, bioengineers, toxicologists, and clinical researchers.  The creativity of such interdisciplinary teams is expected to result in the development of innovative clinical applications.        National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences  (NIEHS)  Investments, Progress, and Plans  FY 1999 - 2003       Genetic Basis of Environmental Susceptibility  Health and disease arise from complex interactions of genes and environment as a function of age and stage of development.  Scientists are now realizing that defining gene-environment interactions will be necessary to understand the root causes of most major diseases ( Science , 278:569, 1997 and 106:365, 1998;  Epidemiology , 9:211, 1998;  Nature Reviews Genetics , 1:149,2000).  The Environmental Genome Project (EGP) was initiated to identify critical variants in environmental response genes that could potentiate or ameliorate environmentally associated diseases such as cancer, birth defects, asthma, Parkinson's Disease, and Alzheimer's Disease. Currently efforts are underway to identify these variants and to establish a database of these findings that can be used by researchers throughout the world.    Mouse Genome Centers  Much of the progress in understanding and treating human diseases has come from research using experimental animals.  NIEHS is establishing five regional Mouse Genomics Centers to construct genetic models that represent specific variants of environmental response genes that confer enhanced susceptibility.  The mouse models containing these susceptibility genes will be provided to the scientific community for use in studies to better define gene-environment interactions that lead to common diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.    Toxicogenomics Initiative  Estimates are that 70-75% of the high-volume, high-use chemicals (~15,000) in commercial use in the United States have not been assessed for human toxicity or carcinogenicity. Current toxicity assays are too costly and take too long to perform to relieve this information shortfall.  To address this need, NIEHS is spearheading a national effort to merge the field of toxicology with genomics, creating a science of toxicogenomics that identifies toxicant activity at the genetic and molecular level through use of small DNA microarrays.  These arrays, where thousands of genes can be put on a single slide, use gene expression profiles or signature patterns to determine  which agents are toxic or carcinogenic. To advance this novel and promising field the NIEHS is establishing five regional Toxicogenomics Centers.  Their work will lead to toxicity test systems that can be cheaper, faster, and more informative than those currently in use.    Parkinson's Disease  A recent study ( JAMA , 281:341, 1999) showed that environmental components accounted for the majority of Parkinson's Disease (PD) cases that developed after age 50.  Based on these findings, the NIEHS recruited more university-based researchers to investigate gene-environment interactions that increase risk to PD.  We are funding 25 grants to investigate the role of environmental agents such as pesticides, solvents, and metals as risk factors for Parkinson's Disease.  We are also supporting research to develop animal models of the disease.  Findings from these studies will lead to new insight into the etiology of PD, will identify new prevention strategies, and may well suggest new therapeutic strategies to cure the disease.    Children's Environmental Health  In most cases, children are more vulnerable than adults to adverse effects of environmental exposures because of their rapid growth and immaturity of various organ systems.  To better protect this vulnerable population, NIEHS partnered with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish ten Children's Environmental Health and Disease Prevention Centers.  These centers are devoted to defining environmental components of common childhood disorders such as asthma, learning and behavioral disorders, and birth defects.  This information will be used both to design prevention strategies and to help educate pediatricians to better identify environmental components of childhood disorders.    Health Disparities  It is well recognized that the poor in this country have much increased risk of low birthweight babies, asthma, hypertension, diabetes, breast and prostate cancer and other diseases.  They also tend to live in environmentally compromised environments with high exposures to lead, air pollutants, and other toxic compounds.  The NIEHS has spearheaded an NIH-wide effort to increase research into health problems of the poor.  Additionally the NIEHS has initiated programs that foster scientific careers and achievement of students at historically underserved colleges and universities so that minority students can be recruited as future environmental health researchers and bring important insight in health disparities research design and implementation.      Future Initiatives       Genomics  As initial results from the Environmental Genome Project, Mouse Genomics Centers, and Toxicogenomics Centers are available, more resource-intensive follow-up will be required.  Identification of environmental response genes in the EGP will necessitate incorporation of this information into environmental epidemiology studies; mouse models will need to be tailored to specific human health conditions; and a large, publically accessible database will be maintained for information generated by the Toxicogenomics Centers.  This overall effort will begin to yield important clues into which environmental toxicants play a role in specific human health conditions and which individuals are most susceptible to them.  Pharmaceutical and agricultural firms will be able to better tailor their products to eliminate undesirable side effects and physicians might be able to better predict which of their patients could have adverse reactions to specific drugs.    Sister Study of Breast Cancer  Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and the role of gene-environment interactions remains to be completely defined.  The NIEHS will establish a large cohort of women who have a sister with breast cancer and, thus, are at increased risk of developing this disease.  These women will be followed longitudinally and will regularly fill out lifestyle/exposure questionnaires.  It is estimated that within five years of study initiation, important information will begin to be generated about genetic and environmental influences on breast cancer risk.    Learning Disabilities and Neurobehavioral Disorders  Learning disabilities, autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and other neurobehavioral deficits are increasing at an alarming rate.  To define the environmental components of these disorders, the NIEHS will be supporting initiatives to bring better focus to gene-environment interactions and the importance of the timing of environmental exposures in subsequent development of learning disabilities.  Information from this research can then be used for effective prevention strategies and, depending on the toxicants identified, could suggest ways for more effective interventions and treatments.    Neurodegenerative Diseases  Neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease are increasingly recognized as having important environmental components ( JAMA , 281:341, 1999;  JAMA , 285:739; 2001).  NIEHS will be enhancing research into the important genetic and environmental conditions that lead to these debilitating diseases.  Outgrowths of this research could lead to intervention strategies, better identification and counseling of at-risk groups, and therapeutics that either reduce risk or delay the disease.    Health Disparities  NIEHS will expand its emphasis on the conditions that lead to poorer health among the disadvantaged.  Studies will be conducted to better define the gene-environment interactions that lead to diseases predominant among U.S. minority populations, particularly asthma, autoimmune diseases such as lupus, and gynecological conditions such as uterine fibroids.    Exposure Assessment  Federal studies such as the NHANES survey are able to show the types and levels of exposures that are common in the U.S. population. The critical information — what are the health implications of these exposures — is lacking.  The NIEHS is developing a research program that provides insight not only on the types of toxicants to which people are exposed, but the health implications of these chemical burdens, particularly what levels are safe and what levels cause disease.        National Institute on Aging  (NIA)  Investments, Progress, and Plans  FY 1999 - 2003       Alzheimer's Disease Prevention Initiative  The NIA AD Prevention Initiative is an intensive, coordinated effort to accelerate basic research and the movement of basic research findings into the development of novel compounds to delay or slow the progress of AD or to prevent the disease entirely.  Intervention studies aimed at people caring for AD patients will develop and test ways of managing the stresses of caregiving and to reduce caregiver burden.  These studies may ultimately lead to the development of specifically targeted drugs to block the onset of AD as well as develop drug and behavior management interventions to ease the burden of caregiving and delay nursing home placement.   Since the Initiative started, basic research has identified promising new targets for directly blocking AD pathology; new mouse models of AD have been developed; clinicians are developing imaging and other tests for persons in early stages of the disease, focusing on persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a risk factor for AD; and pilot and full scale clinical trials have been initiated.  Major prevention trials started include one testing vitamin E and Aricept on persons with MCI, and others testing anti-inflammatory drugs and estrogen.  Treatment trials with estrogen patch, anti-inflammatory drugs, and vitamins for slowing progression and two trials for preventing agitation have also been started.     Longevity Assurance Gene Initiative (LAG)  The LAG is comprised of a multidisciplinary group of scientists studying several models of aging and longevity.  The goal of the LAG is to stimulate the development of research projects focused on unraveling the genetic basis and molecular mechanisms which modulate longevity and enhance health span.  The LAG now encompasses 30 investigators working on twenty-seven R01-supported research projects.  LAG investigators have identified genes that seem to modulate aging in several lower organisms.    Genetic Epidemiology Initiative  The Genetic Epidemiology Initiative includes studies to increase understanding of how genetic factors influence healthy longevity, including the risks for the presence or absence of a disease ""survival traits"", the age at which an individual develops a disease, and the rate at which the disease progresses (""rate-of change"" traits).  The goal is to identify the genes related to healthy longevity.   NIA issued an RFA for exploratory projects in May 1999. The RFA solicited proposals to identify appropriate populations, phenotypes, designs, and methods for longitudinal genetic epidemiologic studies to identify genetic effects on rates of age-related physiologic and pathologic changes, and/or survival outcomes such as age of onset of disease and disability. Nine projects have been funded and awardees have had their first annual meeting with NIA staff to exchange information on study progress.    NIA Exercise Campaign  In 1999, NIA launched a nationwide campaign to encourage older people to exercise with the publication of its free manual,  Exercise: A Guide from the National Institute on Aging .  The guide, which is based on scientific evidence, is intended to help people design their own exercise program so they will maintain and enjoy it.  In an effort to reach more people and accommodate individuals' different needs, the book has been translated into an exercise video.  The long-term goal of this initiative is to encourage more people, especially older people, to start and maintain an exercise program.  Research supported by the NIA and other NIH Institutes has shown that exercise has many physical and mental benefits, including reducing the risk of heart disease, preventing osteoporosis, relieving moderate depression and improving pain management.  It can also help to delay the onset of disabilities and life-threatening diseases.  Thus, it is vital that the NIA play a leadership role in encouraging more people to exercise.   A good measure of the initiative's progress is the public's response.  Since 1998, the NIA has distributed over 364,594 copies of the exercise guide.  15,245 copies of the video, which was released in 2000, have been distributed as well.     Gene Expression Microarrays in Aging Research  Microarray technology allows investigators to determine the activity of many thousands of genes at once.  The goal is to profile changes in gene activity that may lead to better understanding of the molecular basis for aging and eventually provide useful biomarkers of the aging process itself, markers that might be important in assessing the effectiveness of strategies to retard adverse aging-related processes.  Comparing normal age-related changes with the changes characteristic of early stages in a disease process will pinpoint altered cellular pathways and suggest strategies for intervention.   A unique collection of 15,000 mouse cDNA clones has been made freely available to the scientific community. Over 100 facilities worldwide have received the set and have started to prepare microarrays.  The set is now being expanded to 30,000 genes.      Future Initiatives       Alzheimer's Disease Vaccine Initiative  NIH is implementing a five-year initiative to speed the development of vaccine and other novel approaches for preventing AD.  In a recent breakthrough by pharmaceutical company scientists, repeated long-term injections of an amyloid vaccine has been found to cause an immune response in test mice, nearly eliminating amyloid plaques and associated neuropathology.  These studies are being confirmed and extended by NIH-funded scientists who have shown improvements in cognition in immunized animals.  A recent request for applications has set aside FY 2001 funds for studies on the mode of action and efficacy of vaccine-based interventions.    Large-scale Interventions to Reduce Frailty and Disability:  Testosterone Replacement Therapy  The potential of testosterone replacement therapy in older, hypogonadal men to prevent and or treat disease and disability is an area of ongoing research.  Major interest focuses on possible benefits in the strength of muscle and bone, body composition, cardiovascular health, sense of well-being, and mood and cognition.  Investigators are trying to establish not only the possible beneficial effect of replacement therapy in this group, but also to assess the incidence of potentially dangerous side effects including a possible increase in benign prostatic hypertrophy and prostate cancer.  As part of a possible collaboration with the Department of Veterans Affairs in the area of multi-site clinical trials in geriatric medicine, the NIA has participated in a planning effort for a large-scale trial of testosterone replacement in hypogonadal, osteopenic older men with a primary endpoint of ""time to first clinical fracture.""    Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Trials  The Alzheimer Disease Cooperative Study, the consortium of AD Centers and other Institutions, will initiate studies to develop more cost-effective ways of conducting expensive prevention trials.  It will also test a number of different approaches to slowing the course of AD including treatment with statins, as well as investigate whether valproate will decrease agitation while slowing AD cognitive decline.   Pilot and full scale trials from individual investigators are in development, including several to find other effective ways of reducing behavioral problems.    Healthy Brain Aging  The FY 2000 National Academy of Sciences study, The Aging Mind, has stimulated a number of interlocking initiatives.  These include in depth analysis of age-related changes in particular cognitive domains as they occur in cognitively normal individuals and in those in early stages of neurodegenerative disease; the effect of culture and lifespan changes on cognition and the aging brain, including risk and preventative factors for healthy brain aging; the cause and effect relationship between age-related brain and behavior changes; and development of biological and behavioral interventions to promote healthy brain aging.    Disability Decline Among Racial and Ethnic Minorities  In the mid-1990s, NIA-supported investigators reported improvements in disability rates from an analysis of data from the National Long Term Care Survey.  They determined that at least 1.2 million fewer older Americans were disabled in 1994 than there would have been if disability rates had not improved since 1982.  Additional studies, conducted by the same and other groups of investigators, have suggested that this decline is continuing.  Research is now focusing on the factors contributing to the disability decline so that specific interventions and behavioral changes can be identified to accelerate this trend.  Beginning in Fiscal Year 2002, the NIA plans to launch an initiative to explore the factors that may influence the decline of disability in various racial and ethnic groups, including research to design more culturally appropriate interventions and modes of health information dissemination.        National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases  (NIAMS)  Investments, Progress, and Plans  FY 1999 - 2003       Increased Research Support for Osteoporosis  Highlights of increased research opportunities and progress in osteoporosis include a seven-year study that was initiated to determine the extent to which the risk of fracture in men is related to bone mass and structure, biochemistry, lifestyle, tendency to fall, and other factors, and this study will also try to determine if bone mass is associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer.  Little is known about osteoporosis in men, although they can suffer severe consequences of fracture.  The Institute also initiated clinical studies to determine if combinations of some of the drugs available for osteoporosis will be more effective and have fewer side effects than any of the drugs alone.  In addition, the NIAMS is teaming with the NHLBI in issuing an RFA on bone formation and calcification in cardiovascular disease in January 2001.     A Multipronged Approach to Research on Scleroderma  Scleroderma is an autoimmune disease that causes hardening of the skin and can affect major organs.  The NIAMS increased the approaches we use to study scleroderma, including expanding the existing registry of scleroderma to the identification of multiplex families and a DNA repository; funding a Specialized Center of Research in scleroderma; and issuing an RFA in the molecular pathways and new interventions in scleroderma.    A Clinical Trial on Low Back Pain  A study comparing surgical versus nonsurgical treatments of patients suffering from low back pain was initiated in 1,450 patients at 11 medical centers with funds awarded by the NIAMS.  This project is expected to have a major impact on clinical practice and on the cost of medical services for persons with back pain.  Pain involving the lumbar spine is not only one of the most prevalent health problems for which people seek medical help, it is also one of the most costly in terms of medical treatment and disability involving days lost from work.    Improved Understanding of Ankylosing Spondylitis and Other Spondyloparthropathies  Ankylosing Spondylitis is a painful, deforming, inflammatory joint disease that leads to spontaneous fusion of the vertebra.  The NIAMS recently issued an RFA to encourage projects that explore new approaches and hypotheses on the pathogenesis of Ankylosing Spondylitis and other spondyloarthropathies, as well as to promote the development and pilot testing of new therapeutic approaches, including alternative and complementary medicine. We have also initiated a large multicenter study to explore the role of genetics in disease causation.    Skin Biology and Skin Diseases  Skin research has lagged behind in two key areas — common vocabulary to describe skin diseases and a sufficient cadre of clinical investigators being trained in dermatology.  The Institute has partnered with the Herzog Foundation to address both of these areas of need.  We are soliciting a contract to develop a national and international dermatology lexicon for use by the entire research community, and have also developed a fellowship program in epidemiology and health services research, and outcomes research in skin.  Finally, we have broadened our Multidisciplinary Clinical Research Centers so that they may include studies in skin.      Future Initiatives       Improved Understanding of the Muscular Dystrophies  In May 2000, the NIAMS sponsored two scientific workshops to lay the groundwork for research into the muscular dystrophies.  The first workshop, sponsored by the NIAMS together with the NINDS, the NIH Office of Rare Diseases, the FSH Society, Inc., and the Muscular Dystrophy Association of America, focused on the cause and treatment of Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD).  The NIAMS and the NINDS have already used the recommendations from this meeting in developing and issuing an RFA in FSHD in November 2000.  As well, the NIAMS and the NINDS have recently funded a research registry for FSHD and myotonic dystrophy.  The second workshop focused on therapeutic approaches for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, and the NIAMS and the NINDS subsequently issued a Program Announcement, ""Therapeutic and Pathogenic Approaches for the Muscular Dystrophies"" in January 2001.  This PA uses set-aside funds for FY 2002 - 2004.    Increased Research Focus on Osteoarthritis  Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis.  Based on the recommendations from a very successful scientific workshop recently sponsored by the Institute, the NIAMS issued a recent RFA on prevention of onset, progression, and disability of osteoarthritis.  In addition the Institute is establishing (with the NIA) a public-private partnership to develop clinical research resources that support discovery and evaluation of biomarkers and surrogate endpoints for osteoarthritis clinical trials.    Initiating a Program in Clinical Research Training at Minority Serving Institutions  Minority institutions have had difficulties developing and sustaining independent clinical research, and there is a shortage of ethnic minority clinical researchers who are pursuing successful clinical research careers.  The NIAMS, in partnership with NIDDK and NCMHD and 9 other NIH components, created a new strategy for enhancing clinical research training in minority-serving institutions.  The first phase, to be funded in FY 2001, is a solicitation for a one-year planning grant, and the second phase will be a 5-year grant to assist in the actual development of the clinical research curriculum, with the funding in FY 2002 and beyond.  A successful program will produce well-trained clinical researchers who can lead clinical research projects.    Creating an NIH Center of Musculoskeletal Medicine  The NIAMS, NIDCR, NICHD, and NIA are prepared to focus resources in this area and form a new collaborative Center of Musculoskeletal Medicine on the NIH campus.  This would build on the strengths that are already present and are beginning to be coordinated, enhance research productivity through synergy of the programs, develop new programs, recruit new investigators, and make it possible to create a national resource in this area.  The Center would include basic science, incorporate an Inter-Institute Bone and Cartilage Clinic, and integrate new clinical programs in osteoarthritis and molecular orthopaedics.    A Health Partnership Program  to Address Health Disparities  Recently, the NIAMS Intramural Research Program launched the Health Partnership Program, a diversity outreach initiative to reduce health disparities in diseases of the joints, muscles, bones, and skin among minority communities.  The Institute has designed a model community-based program that will first address health issues related to arthritis and other rheumatic diseases in African Americans and Hispanics/Latinos in the metropolitan, Washington, D.C. area.        National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders  (NIDCD)  Investments, Progress, and Plans  FY 1999 - 2003       Hearing Aid Clinical Trial  Although numerous studies have suggested that hearing aids provide significant benefit, carefully controlled, large-scale clinical trials have not been conducted to determine the amount of benefit.  The NIDCD and the Department of Veterans Affairs conducted a multicenter trial to compare the efficacy of three commonly used hearing aid circuits.  The goal of the trial was to determine which hearing aid circuit provided most benefit to hearing aid users.  Data from the trial showed that differences among the three hearing aid circuits were minimal and that each circuit improved speech recognition, with improvement observed for soft and loud speech under both quiet and noisy listening conditions.    Treatment for Otitis Media  Otitis media (middle ear infection) is one of the most significant health problems for children in the U.S. costing approximately 4 to 5 billion dollars annually.  It is the most common reason for a sick child to be treated by a physician.  Current treatment options for otitis media, which rely heavily on the use of oral antimicrobials, are being increasingly hampered by the emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms.  Novel therapeutic approaches need to be pursued.   NIDCD scientists have developed a detoxified lipooligosaccharide-protein conjugate to be used as a possible vaccine against nontypable Haemophilus influenzae, a leading cause of otitis media in children for which there is no vaccine available.  Currently, a Phase I clinical study is nearing completion in adult volunteers to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the investigational vaccine.  Preliminary data from this study shows that the vaccine is able to elicit the production of a specific antibody against the bacteria in a number of volunteer subjects.  The results of this trial suggest that this investigational vaccine may be useful for preventing otitis media in children.      Future Initiatives       Genetic Testing and the Clinical Management of Hereditary Hearing Impairment  Advances in the genetics of hereditary hearing impairment and in the early identification of hearing impairment have now converged.  These advances have led some to suggest genetic testing/evaluation for all infants who are identified with a hearing loss at birth.  In consideration of these developments, the NIDCD is planning an initiative to address the clinical relationship between genetic and audiologic/otologic information, as well as to address the clinical validity and utility of genetic testing in the diagnosis, treatment and management of hearing impairment. With the identification of genes that contribute to hearing function, genetic testing becomes possible, but does not necessarily imply that genetic testing is ready for widespread clinical application.  Additional research is needed to meet the unique challenges pertaining to testing for hearing impairment because these conditions are not universally considered to be disabling or even undesirable.    Early Identification and Intervention for Infants with Hearing Impairment and Other Communication Disorders  This initiative is supporting clinical studies/trials to determine and validate outcome measures to evaluate and develop intervention strategies for children identified with hearing impairment, determine which strategies are optimal for a given child in their environment, and to introduce these intervention strategies into clinical practice.  At present, there are efforts underway in many states to screen all infants for hearing impairment in the newborn nursery before discharge from the hospital.  This screening will result in many more infants being identified with hearing impairment at an early age when intervention strategies can be started that will optimize their long-term speech and language skills.  However, more research is needed to develop and validate intervention strategies and to determine the relative efficacy of various intervention strategies in infants and children with hearing impairment or other communication disorders.      A Comparison of Intervention Programs for Children with Language Impairment  Language impairment (LI) is a prevalent problem affecting approximately 7% of all school-age children in the U.S. and their families with significant related consequences to society including social, educational, and vocational costs.  Despite decades of providing language intervention to school age children, there are few studies measuring outcomes related to the intervention, and there has never been a randomized clinical study to evaluate the efficacy of any language intervention procedures.  Recently, a computerized intervention method, known as Fast ForWord, has been developed and has received national attention.  In response to these findings, NIDCD-supported scientists will conduct a randomized clinical study to compare the language outcomes of children using Fast ForWord to two other interventions (computer assisted language intervention without acoustically modified speech and individual language intervention) and to the outcomes of a general control condition.  The primary goal of the study is to determine which intervention will result in the greatest improvement in language scores in children with LI.  The researchers will also seek to determine which intervention results in the greatest gains in conversational language, produces gains after 3 and 6 months of training, results in the greatest improvement in auditory perception, and is most cost effective.        National Institute of Mental Health  (NIMH)  Investments, Progress, and Plans  FY 1999 - 2003       Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE)  CATIE encompasses two large-scale community-based clinical trials being conducted to compare the effectiveness of the atypical antipsychotic drugs in the treatment of schizophrenia and in the treatment of the aggressive behaviors in patients with Alzheimer's Disease.  The two independent protocols in CATIE (Schizophrenia and Alzheimer's) are being conducted under one research contract funding mechanism and one coordinating center.   The goal of the schizophrenia study is to enroll approximately 1800 patients to determine the long-term effectiveness and tolerability of the newer atypical antipsychotic medications relative to each other and relative to conventional antipsychotic medication.  The goal of the Alzheimer's study is to enroll 450 patients to compare the acute efficacy and effectiveness of three atypical antipsychotic medications in treating psychosis and severe agitation in outpatients with Alzheimer's Disease.  Both protocols have been developed and the 50 schizophrenia trial sites and 30 Alzheimer's trial sites have been selected.  The first 12 subjects have been enrolled in the schizophrenia trial.  Enrollment is expected to continue for approximately 24 months.    Trans-NIH Neuroscience Initiative on Mouse Mutagenesis  This trans-NIH initiative is an effort to exploit genetic and genomic resources in the mouse to more fully understand mammalian neurobiology.  Its goal is to identify and characterize the function of genes as they produce defects in mouse nervous system functioning and complex behavior.  These implicated molecules and pathways are expected to inform genetic research in humans, and greatly accelerate the dissection of the genetic bases of mental disorders.  NIMH has worked with six other NIH Institutes to organize 3 large-scale mutagenesis centers to conduct high-throughput phenotyping and genome-wide mutagenesis in the mouse.  The project set milestones to obtain at least 200 mutants/year, which will be widely distributed to the scientific community.    Translational Research in Behavioral Science  This initiative will develop research centers that support the translation of basic behavioral science research to patient-oriented studies regarding etiology, new interventions, and delivery of services for mental disorders. As an integral element of the initiative, NIMH will provide grants (using the R21 pilot/exploratory mechanism) that will better enable researchers to develop the infrastructure and procedures, as well as pilot data, that will be useful in competing successfully for either a translational RO1 grant or a translational center.  The goal is to develop more powerful, theory-based interventions and service delivery models for mental disorders through increased application of the data and paradigms of basic behavioral research.   NIMH issued an RFA for developing centers and anticipates receiving approximately 35 applications by the April 2001 deadline.  A program announcement (PA) regarding fully-implemented centers is expected to generate three to five applications for an October, 2001 deadline.    Clinical Neuroscience Research Centers  This initiative is an effort to make substantial inroads with respect to our understanding of the neurobiological substrates of the major mental disorders.  This Centers will help to translate the advances, technologies and approaches of 21st century neuroscience into mechanistic understanding of the etiology and pathophysiology of the major psychiatric illnesses.   The recent increases in the NIH budget have permitted very substantial expansion of this program.  Specifically, in FY 1999 and FY 2000 5 new Clinical Neuroscience Research Centers were funded:  Harvard (Joseph Coyle, MD); New York University/Rockefeller University/Columbia (Joseph LeDoux, PhD); University of California/University of Michigan (William Bunney,  MD); Emory/Yale/Princeton (Charles Nemeroff, MD, PhD); and Columbia (John Mann, MD) focused on schizophrenia, mood and anxiety disorders, and suicide.      Future Initiatives       Gene Hunting for Schizophrenia and Manic-Depressive Illness: Capitalizing on the Human Genome Project  Breakthrough advances in the genetic bases of mental disorders are now expected, given the recent availability of the complete human genome sequence, and new tools and technologies for genetic analysis. This initiative will support the novel application of massively parallel approaches to map genes that produce vulnerability to schizophrenia, manic-depressive illness, and related biological traits. Innovative statistical and molecular genetic methods will be utilized for the global analysis of patterns of gene expression, genetic variation, and protein expression in these mental disorders. This initiative also aims to fund high-throughput projects that target the whole genome to identify in schizophrenic and manic-depressive patients those genes that influence therapeutic response to one of several compounds (e.g., anxiolytic, antidepressant, antipsychotic, and anti-manic drugs).    Autism Centers of Excellence  NIMH will be the lead institute in establishing a program for Centers of Excellence in Autism.  This centers network will be organized as specified in the Children's Health Act of 2000.  NIMH and the other participating institutes (NINDS, NICHD, NIDCD, and possibly others) will issue an RFA for developmental grants in FY 2001 for funding in FY 2002 to facilitate the development of translational research teams and the organization of planned research programs and collaborations.  In FY 2002, an RFA will be issued for the Centers of Excellence program for funding in FY 2003.  This RFA will incorporate the stipulations regarding centers contained in the Children's Health Act and will fund, either in the first year or in successive competitions, at least 5 Centers at approximately $1.5 million per center per year total costs.  The Centers will be organized into a network for collaboration and the sharing of materials and data.    Research Units on Pediatric Psychopharmacology and Psychosocial Interventions (RUPPs)  The purpose of this initiative is to continue and expand the currently ongoing research network on Research Units on Pediatric Psychopharmacology to include up to nine new units plus a coordinating center.  The initiative will focus on important clinical questions about the use of psychotropic medications in children and adolescents, with special emphasis on safety and drugs already used in the community without adequate testing. The intent is to expand the scope of RUPP research by including research in psychosocial treatments as well.  Treatment interventions for subjects with autism and other pervasive developmental disorders will also be areas of special emphasis.    Early Therapeutics Development Program  Existing psychiatric therapeutics are highly successful, yet many patients retain residual symptoms and disability that deserve substantial new effort in treatment development.  In order to address these needs, NIMH plans to initiate a new program to spur the early development of drug and psychosocial therapies for mental disorders.  Impetus for such a program stems in part from the fact that many patients are referred for treatment because of symptoms that either fall outside canonical psychiatric syndromes or which persist despite partial remission of the symptoms of canonical disorders such as schizophrenia, depression, or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.  Because FDA approval of medications is geared toward full psychiatric syndromes rather than individual symptoms, there is decreased incentive for the pharmaceutical industry to develop critically needed symptomatic treatments.  In addition, there are compounds potentially useful for treating mental disorders that either are off-patent or represent ""long shots"" and, therefore, have not been fully tested by industry.  In the development of psychosocial treatments, industry obviously has no incentives.   The new therapeutics development program would be an Institute-wide, integrated effort, requiring the development of new symptom rating and outcome scales, for example, in the area of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia or irritability in mood disorders and the identification of promising classes of compounds.  The Institute would work with academic scientists and, ideally, with the biotechnology industry to bring promising compounds through early phase II trials, a point at which industry would be willing to develop them further.  For psychosocial treatments, NIMH would have responsibility for necessary clinical trials.        National Institute on Drug Abuse  (NIDA)  Investments, Progress, and Plans  FY 1999 - 2003       National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN)  Thanks to generous support from Congress, NIDA was able in FY 1999 to jump-start the establishment of what has already become a national clinical research infrastructure for testing science-based drug addiction treatments in real-life community-based treatment settings.  Until the establishment of the CTN, researchers and treatment providers had to rely on treatment results from studies conducted in specialized settings with somewhat restricted populations.  The CTN now provides the infrastructure to rapidly and systematically bring new treatments to diverse patient populations across the country.  By forging partnerships between researchers and community treatment providers who are serving on the front lines of clinical practice, the CTN is engaging the entire drug abuse community in a national effort against addiction and its consequences.  Additionally, the CTN provides a much needed infrastructure to more efficiently and rapidly disseminate other kinds of research findings to practitioners and patients across the country.  The CTN seeks to improve the quality of drug abuse treatment nationwide using science as the vehicle.   Since the inception of the CTN in September 1999, this national research infrastructure has grown to include 14 research centers across the country working in partnership with over 80 community treatment providers that use quite varied approaches and serve diverse patient populations.  Patients are already participating in the first seven protocols.  Patient protocol brochures have been developed in both English and Spanish.  An additional 17 new protocol concepts have been submitted to NIDA and are in various stages of pre-implementation review.    Genetics  In 1999, the confluence of both progress in the science and a generous appropriation enabled NIDA to launch a major ""Vulnerability to Addiction"" initiative.  The goal of the endeavor is to understand the role of genetic and environmental factors and how they contribute to individual differences in susceptibility to becoming addicted.  NIDA received an overwhelming response to the ""Genetics of Vulnerability"" RFA when it was first announced in 1999.  Even with the increased financial support, NIDA was only able to fund half of the excellent proposals received.  Further increases have allowed  NIDA to expand its support of genetic research to the point where we now have over 60 major projects using the full array of genetic analysis techniques so as to maximize the probabilities of successfully identifying critical genetic factors.  This initiative should help elucidate the interacting roles of genes and environment in addiction, resulting in better treatment and prevention strategies.   Researchers are learning more about what causes individual differences in vulnerability to addiction.  It appears to be a combination of genetic and environmental input, with the genetic portion accounting for anywhere from 30 to 80 percent, depending on the drug.  Given the completion of the human genome project and the advances in technology that have led to the identification of genes contributing to many complex diseases (including diabetes, asthma, and cardiovascular diseases) there is now reasonable optimism that researchers will be able to find genes that influence complex bio-behavioral diseases such as addiction.  Additionally, NIDA has been able to make much progress to encourage the genetics community to work together to share data.  For example, under NIDA's leadership a dozen grantees under the original genetics RFA have formed a NIDA Genetics Consortium to regularly discuss issues related to both NIDA's human molecular genetics program and individual projects.  A repository for storing and ultimately sharing data and materials generated from genetic grants has also been established.    Neuroscience of Addiction  NIDA's entire neuroscience portfolio is benefitting from generous financial support.  The convergence and application of powerful new scientific tools and emerging technologies are accelerating NIDA's neuroscience advances and allowing researchers to ask questions that were not possible just five years ago.  Some examples of new initiatives that are being fueled by a sustained budget increase include a multistaged strategic effort to better understand the mechanisms that underlie the transition from occasional drug user to compulsive user or addict; the use of new non-invasive neuroimaging technologies to determine the effects of drugs on the developing brain of children and adolescents; and a more focused effort to understand the role that cognitive factors such as learning and memory processes play in the development, maintenance and expression of compulsive drug craving, seeking, and use — the hallmarks of addiction.  These initiatives will help scientists develop a greater understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of addiction that can lead to new behavioral and pharmacological treatment approaches.   Neuroimaging technologies are helping us to understand the long-term effects on the brain of drugs such as methamphetamine and MDMA (ecstasy).  Emerging technologies are also helping us to predict who may be most likely to become a drug user.  For example, scientists have discovered that the amount of dopamine D2 receptors an individual has may predict whether or not that person will find using a drug to be pleasant. With the increase funding received by the Institute, NIDA announced two mechanisms to rapidly stimulate novel research on understanding the transition from drug use to addiction.  NIDA also was able to initiate a Neurobiology of Development Initiative, which is helping us to determine the structural and functional effects of prenatal drug exposure on brain development and whether children with early drug exposure are more vulnerable than non-exposed children to cognitive deficits and later drug abuse as they move into adulthood.  These sophisticated techniques are also allowing researchers to ask how drugs of abuse compromise an adult's cognitive and behavioral abilities.    Responding to Emerging Drug Problems  With increased funding, NIDA has been able to expand its research portfolio in all domains to combat emerging drug problems before they become national epidemics.  NIDA has long maintained an early warning system for emerging drug problems called the Community Epidemiology Work Group.  Enhanced funding has allowed the Institute to respond much more rapidly to the warning the CEWG provides.  For example, in December 1999, NIDA launched a Club Drug Research and Education Initiative in response to indicators suggesting an emerging epidemic of club drug use. NIDA has since made much progress in determining the long and short term consequences of many so-called club drugs and in educating the public, scientific, and professional communities about the consequences of using club drugs, such as methamphetamine, MDMA, and GHB.   NIDA will continue its efforts to establish a more integrated research and public education mechanism to avert emerging drug epidemics.  NIDA will identify potential public health hazards that are drug related, rapidly alert the public and health communities, and stimulate new research to develop new treatments and antidotes.  NIDA has made much progress in increasing our understanding of the dangers of club drugs and facilitating improved prevention and treatment efforts.  A high priority for NIDA was to ensure that the world is shown the residual effects that drugs, such as methamphetamine and MDMA, can have on the brain and body even after the individual stops using the drug.  NIDA was also able to release a number of new RFAs including one that focuses on the drug, GHB, and one that focuses on prenatal exposure to methamphetamine.  NIDA also has an aggressive information dissemination campaign on this topic.  NIDA, in collaboration with community partners, has initiated a series of public information activities to disseminate science-based information about the consequences of club drugs, including mailing a Community Drug Alert Bulletin on Club Drugs to almost half a million physicians, treatment providers, nurses, and clinicians across the country; providing fact sheets on club drugs through our fax-on-demand service, ""NIDA Infofax"";  and distributing hundreds of thousands of  ""art-cards,"" postcard-like advertisements encouraging people to contact NIDA for research-based information.  Public service announcements are also being aired nationally on this topic.        Future Initiatives       Expansion of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network  In FY 2002,  NIDA plans to increase the national coverage of the Network to include additional sites in geographic areas now unrepresented and to include approximately 160 treatment programs.  NIDA's plan is to have 10 to 20 research protocols being run at any one time.  These protocols will include tests of treatment approaches shown to be effective in laboratory settings or suggested by practitioners in the field, and they will be tested in the full array of treatment settings that exist across the country.  Those programs, in turn, will be providing treatment to diverse patient populations, including those of different ethnic and racial origins and gender preferences, adolescents, pregnant women, and poly-drug using individuals.    Establishing a National Drug Prevention Trials System  NIDA will launch an initiative to develop a National Drug Abuse Prevention Trials System that will test proven research-based efforts in a wide variety of populations.    Expansion of NIDA's Genetics Research Portfolio  NIDA will continue to support the development and utilization of powerful tools to identify the genes and gene products that render vulnerability to addiction and are altered by repeated exposure to drugs of abuse and by external factors (e.g. stress, environmental stimuli associated with drug use) that influence the development of this illness.  For example, NIDA will continue to encourage researchers to develop and  use advanced molecular genetic techniques, such as gene arrays, that can help researchers assess the changes in the expression of many genes simultaneously after drug exposure.    New Treatments for Nicotine Addiction  NIDA will significantly expand its nicotine research portfolio to focus on the development of more effective treatments to combat nicotine addiction.  For example, NIDA will continue to develop smoking cessation interventions that are tailored to adolescents.  NIDA is also planning to work with NCI to expedite the development of nicotine medications.    International Testing and Dissemination of Science-Based HIV Prevention and Treatment Findings  NIDA will support cross-national and international studies to determine what can be useful and adapted by foreign communities that are particularly vulnerable to the AIDS epidemic.  NIDA will also continue to nurture the development of its Global Research Network on HIV Prevention in Drug Using Populations.    Improving Drug Abuse Treatment Tied to the Criminal Justice System  NIDA will encourage researchers to conduct rigorous scientific study to better understand the types of treatment programs that are now being used at various points while addicted offenders are under criminal justice control, identify the most successful or model programs, and from that information develop a set of best practice principles about duration, setting, and training to help frame a more effective system of treatment for addicted criminal offenders.  At the same time, NIDA will stimulate research designed to foster the development of even more effective science-based approaches to treatment for this unique patient population.        National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism  (NIAAA)  Investments, Progress, and Plans  FY 1999 - 2003       Neuroscience and Neurogenetics: The Sum is Greater than its Parts  Additional funding is enabling us to conduct one of our most essential tasks: to integrate the different fields that contribute to our knowledge about how alcohol acts on the brain. The long-term goal is to identify biological points for intervention in alcohol-use disorders by integrating the research of relevant fields.   How we behave toward alcohol depends largely on genetic and molecular activities in our brains.  These biological responses to alcohol translate into behaviors and play a major role in deciding whether dependence on alcohol will consume our lives or whether we can simply enjoy it occasionally, without problem.  Integrating the many fields that contribute data about alcohol's actions in the brain — from genetics to molecular biology to behavioral science — is crucial to our ability to capture meaning from the data these various fields generate.   We need, for example, to draw relationships between specific genetic and molecular events in the brain and specific behaviors relevant to alcohol use.  We need to understand how inducing genetic and molecular changes in these events affects behavior.  We need computer models to manipulate and interpret these activities and to share information between disciplines.  Ultimately, we need to integrate this information so that we can identify the neural circuits — networks of nerve cells and the thousands of molecular and genetic events associated with them — that underlie the biological process of becoming dependent on alcohol. This kind of integration is beyond the scope of any single discipline and requires a major initiative that previously was not financially feasible.   An important component of our research involves biochemical and genetic changes unique to the brains of children and adolescents that put them at risk of alcoholism later in life   Additional support has enabled us to establish an Integrative Neuroscience Initiative on Alcoholism and to fund a range of research proposals that will contribute to our ability to meet our goals.  Recent genetics technology (microarrays) is contributing information that will lead to identification of genes in the brain that play a role in alcohol-use disorders.  Research made possible by additional funding also has generated new information about the vulnerability of the adolescent brain to alcohol.    New Areas of Intramural Study  The NIAAA Intramural Program has established three new laboratories that will conduct research in areas previously not represented in the Program. The budget for these laboratories is entirely dependent on funds from the doubling of the NIH budget.  Our aim is to identify points for intervention in biological mechanisms that contribute to alcohol's harmful behavioral and physiological effects.   The Laboratory of Physiologic Studies will focus on neuroendocrinology and liver biology.  Some of the brain mechanisms that regulate appetite for food also appear to influence appetite for alcohol.  The NIAAA Intramural Program now can conduct systematic studies on the role of these substances in alcohol-related behavior.  This laboratory now also enables the Intramural Program to investigate cellular and molecular mechanisms that lead to alcohol-induced liver disease (responsible for the majority of cases of liver cirrhosis in the United States), including genetic factors.  The Laboratory of Physiologic Studies has discovered a novel role of substances in the brain in control of appetite; ongoing studies suggest that these substances are involved in control of alcohol preference in mice.  This laboratory also has identified cellular proteins responsible for alcoholics' remarkably poor response to interferon therapy for treatment of hepatitis C. Targeting these proteins may offer a novel approach to treatment.   The Laboratory of Integrative Neuroscience is enabling the Intramural Program to investigate the neural basis of alcoholism. Evidence is strong that brain proteins not only are affected by alcohol, but also are among the major regulators of alcohol-seeking behavior.  Identification of these proteins is possible only through an integrative approach that combines the study of single cells and molecules with behavioral studies in animals, including genetically altered animals.  Additional funds have enabled us to add the elements of an integrative approach that previously were lacking.   The Laboratory of Molecular Physiology is enabling Intramural investigators to understand how alcohol produces its effects at the cellular level. Activities in nerve cells of the brain are triggered by outside chemical ""signals"" to molecular channels in the cells' protective membrane and to molecular connections between the cells.  Alcohol affects these signaling systems, leading to changes in behavior.  Additional funding is allowing us to alter these signaling pathways, to observe each component's effect on cellular and behavioral response to alcohol.  The combination of approaches — molecular biology, mouse genetics, electrophysiology, and rodent behavioral science — and the staff with expertise necessary for this work would not have been possible without additional funds.    COMBINE: Phase III Trial of Combinations of Pharmacotherapy and Behavioral Therapy  Additional funds have enabled NIAAA to conduct a pivotal Phase III clinical trial that is testing synergistic effects of pharmaceutical and behavioral treatments.  Although current treatments for alcoholism already are moderately successful, the prevalence and costs of alcohol-use disorders in the U.S. (14 million Americans and $185 billion each year, respectively) make crucial NIAAA's search for treatment strategies that are highly effective among a wider population of alcoholics.  In the past, budget constraints have limited most NIAAA clinical studies to Phase II trials, a necessary step in the development of treatments, but one that is smaller and less definitive than the Phase III trial.  Project COMBINE builds on previous NIAAA-supported research on behavioral treatments and pharmacotherapies, and will include studies of the pharmacogenetics of the medications used.  An economic component will provide data on cost effectiveness of therapies.  Our goal is to give clinicians the knowledge necessary to prescribe optimal combinations of medications and counseling.   COMBINE is underway at 11 clinical sites throughout the country and a coordinating center.  Recruitment of more than 1,200 patients has begun.     National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC)  To understand a disease's impact on U.S. public health and the treatment needs this disease generates, scientists must conduct longitudinal epidemiology studies.   To date, the NIAAA budget has limited us to studies of prevalence, the occurrence of alcohol-use disorders at a given point in time. Additional funding now permits NIAAA to conduct the first estimates of the incidence — the rate of development of new cases — of alcohol-use disorders and of disabilities associated with these disorders in the U.S. general population of adults.  This data that will provide direction for research in the basic science, prevention, and treatment of alcohol-use disorders.   The design of the new study will provide scientists with crucial information, unobtainable through prevalence studies, about how these disorders develop and about factors that influence remission, chronic drinking, and incidence.  The study also will enable scientists to examine unmet treatment needs of people who have mental and physical illnesses in addition to alcohol-use disorders.  Scientists also will obtain the first estimates of adverse drinking practices and alcohol-use disorders among the entire U.S. college-age population. The first of two waves of surveying necessary to obtain the kind of data we seek is prepared to take place in July 2001.    Prevention  The NIAAA has gathered critical data on what kinds of interventions are likely to be effective in preventing alcohol-related problems in specific populations.  However, budget constraints prevented us from testing those interventions, except in a limited way.  With increased funding from the doubling of the NIH budget, we now are able to test interventions in four areas that particularly need them.      Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS): FAS and related birth defects are completely preventable if pregnant women abstain from alcohol.  These deficits cost the Nation $2.8 billion annually, in health-care costs alone.  FAS occurs more often among some ethnic groups than others.     College Drinking: Several factors converged to make college-drinking a prime target for intervention testing.  At the same time research was showing that almost half of all students surveyed had engaged in binge-drinking, the media was reporting alcohol-related student deaths.  Colleges and universities were pressing the NIAAA for advice, but funding issues prevented us from responding as fully as we could have, even though we had data on promising interventions.     Drinking Among Ethnically/Economically Diverse Youth:   Project Northland tested interventions simultaneously conducted in school, family, and community that delayed initiation of drinking by largely white, rural adolescents in Minnesota. However, we do not know if the same strategies are as effective in ethnically and economically diverse urban youth, and budget constraints have prevented us from testing these successful interventions in these settings.  The doubling of the NIH budget enables us to test these interventions in urban communites.  Delaying initiation of drinking is crucial; research has shown that people who begin drinking earlier in life have a much higher risk of alcoholism than do people who begin later.    Driving-Under-the -Influence-of-Alcohol (DUI) Recidivism: Athough alcohol-related fatalities and alcohol-impaired driving have decreased in the U.S., an intractible core of repeat offenders continues to destroy lives and property.  Budget limitations have prevented us from testing the effectiveness of specific sanctions, singly and in combination, for dealing with these and other DUI offenders.  New funding enables us to conduct research that will provide judges, prosecutors, and other decision-makers with a scientific basis for their choices of sentences for DUI offenders.    Our goal is to identify interventions that are effective in preventing FAS, college drinking, drinking by urban youth, and DUI recidivism.  We have launched a special initiative that resulted in eight new studies that will test promising interventions for prevention of FAS.  A special initiative to stimulate tests of college-based prevention strategies resulted in 11 new intervention studies, and NIAAA's Advisory Council formed a Subcommittee On College Drinking.  University presidents and NIAAA-affiliated researchers have formed two panels to address the context and consequences of college drinking and prevention strategies.  We have issued a new Request for Applications to test the strategies successfully used in Project Northland in urban settings.  A  program announcement sponsored by NIAAA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has resulted in five new studies, in which judges and researchers are cooperating in determining which sanctions work best for DUI offenders.  In a major advance, judges have agreed to randomize offenders to experimental and control sanctions, to negate their own preference biases and those of the offenders.   All of these efforts are made possible by the doubling of the NIH budget.        Future Initiatives    College Drinking Requires Joint Effort by Researchers, Colleges, and Communities Media reports of alcohol-related deaths of college students are just one manifestation of a complex problem deeply entrenched in the college culture and in the communities surrounding colleges.  Additional funding from the doubling of the NIH budget now enables us to add research that will further our understanding of college drinking and result in better-informed intervention design.  A crucial effect of the additional funding is that we now can test interventions that show promise in reducing college drinking.  Previously, budget constraints prohibited us from doing this on a large scale.   We have reviewed existing research on the contexts in which college drinking occurs and its consequences, and on prevention and treatment, and have identified gaps in the research that we now can address.  For example, studies have shown that partnerships between community organizations reduce drinking in the general population, but we need to evaluate whether partnerships between community organizations and colleges can reduce drinking among students.  We also need to evaluate the effects of specific campus alcohol policies.  In addition, investigators would benefit from capturing data on the effects of alcohol-related policy changes that occur outside their purview, such as those imposed independently by lawmakers in the community or by campus administrators.  The lack of longitudinal studies that track alcohol-related behaviors from high school through young adulthood also presents a gap in the data.  A NIAAA-supported data and surveillance system will facilitate research in all of these areas.   NIAAA's Advisory Council formed a Subcommittee On College Drinking, in which university presidents and NIAAA-affiliated researchers have formed two panels to address the context and consequences of college drinking and prevention strategies.  Additional funding is enabling us to implement the recommendations these panels issued in their reports.   As part of our new college drinking initiatives, we also plan to disseminate our findings.  For example, we will sponsor regional and national workshops for college presidents and administrators and will distribute educational material developed for specific groups, such as students and administrators.    Neuroscience and Neurogenetics  The following activities are described under ""Current Initiatives Made Possible by Doubling of NIH Budget.""  However, an increase in funding would enable us to further expand these activities in FY 2002.  At that time, we will apply additional funds to noninvasive imaging techniques that will track alcohol's effects in animal and human brains.  The 2002 expansion will include functional and genetic (microchip) studies aimed at identification of the genes involved in alcohol-use disorders; these studies also will contribute vital information to medication-development efforts.  Perhaps most important, the 2002 expansion will establish an informatics database that will facilitate integration of neuroscience data across the many fields that contribute to it, speeding translation of the data into clinically useful information.    Advanced Research Program  Additional funding has enabled NIAAA to conduct high-risk research which, if successful, could result in breakthroughs on difficult alcohol-related problems.      Biosensor Creates New Possibilities for Tracking Alcohol Levels:  Researchers and clinicians lack accurate methods of continuously measuring long-term drinking in humans.  Technological advances now have made possible the development of a tamper-proof biosensor that continuously measures alcohol levels.  Currently, long-term alcohol use is measured through personal interviews or questionnaires, and these self-reports are subject to memory and the desire to give socially acceptable answers.   By measuring how much and when people drink as a matter of course, in daily life, the biosensor could provide accurate assessments of whether clinical interventions are effective in preventing drinking.  The biosensor also could contribute to our understanding of changes that take place in the brain as it adapts to chronic alcohol use.  Continuous measurements of alcohol levels in various organs could contribute to our understanding of how the body disposes of alcohol.    Theoretical and Computational Neurobiology:  This research is intended to identify circuits of nerve cells, in the brain, that are involved in biological adaptations to alcohol use.  These circuits may be involved in sensitization, tolerance, dependence, withdrawal, recover, craving, and relapse.    Geostatistical Modeling:  This research will develop new geomathematical techniques designed to prevent alcohol-related problems in inner city and Department of Defense populations, and on Indian reservations and college campuses and surrounding communities.  It will provide researchers with a much better ability to track the effects of various environmental factors on alcohol misuse.  The resulting information would be useful to policy-makers; for example, those who regulate zoning and licensing.     Genetically Engineered Rodents: A Valuable Tool for Alcohol Research  More than a year ago, the NIAAA joined other NIH Institutes in providing funding for establishment of mouse mutagenesis centers. In this approach, scientists create random, single-gene mutations in many mice.  By screening them, scientists from different fields can select mice whose mutations have resulted in traits of interest, for use in studies.  With the doubling of the NIH budget, we now have the funds to screen these mice to identify those whose mutations cause altered responses to alcohol.  Next, we will pinpoint the locations of the altered genes, which will provide us with information for finding those genes in humans.  We then can test whether the human genes play a role in heavy drinking among people.   Of particular interest is identification of genes, in rats and mice, that underlie biological mechanisms that permit an animal to drink alcohol to such excess that it is physically unable to drink any more.  In the case of this trait--the ability to drink to that point--we suspect that genetic variations in the physiologic feedback loop that normally would signal animals to stop drinking play a role.    National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC)  This initiative appears under ""Current Initiatives Made Possible by the Doubling of NIH Budget.""  A second wave of surveys will occur in 2004; it is this second wave of data-gathering that will enable us to glean information, previously unavailable, about factors that influence remission, chronic drinking, and incidence of alcohol-use disorders.        National Institute of Nursing Research  (NINR)  Investments, Progress, and Plans  FY 1999 - 2003       Enhancing Adherence to Diabetes Self-Management Behaviors  Nursing research is critical to help patients deal effectively with chronic illnesses, including diabetes. Building on the recommendations of the Congressionally-established Diabetes Research Working Group, NINR expanded efforts to focus on this clinical population to improve both patient adherence to diabetes treatment and quality of life.  A program announcement, Enhancing Adherence to Diabetes Self Management Behaviors, was announced to increase the research activity.  Current studies are evaluating barriers to treatment adherence in African American women with gestational diabetes; testing a culturally specific intervention for Native Americans who have diabetes; and establishing baseline beliefs among three low-income ethnic groups in a rural community, so that diabetes treatment and long term follow-up can be culturally congruent with those beliefs.  Notable recent findings show that adding a coping skills intervention to routine care promotes better diabetes control and improved quality of life in adolescents.    Collaborations with Clinical Trials  This initiative stimulated the submission of research to complement ongoing clinical trials that are studying promising therapies.  A request for applications, Clinical Trials:  Collaborations for Nursing Research resulted in the funding of six studies that are investigating family functioning during stroke recovery, endocrine function and conduct disorders in children, sleep and fatigue with dexamethosone treatment in childhood cancer, self-care to prevent urinary incontinence, patient outcomes in elders with heart failure, and psychosocial factors in sudden cardiac death.  The additional funds in 2000 allowed us to capitalize on the good response to the initial request for applications.  We issued another RFA to further promote collaborations between established clinical trials and nurse investigators.    End-of-Life Research  This initiative seeks to fill the gaps in knowledge that limit the evidence base for optimal care of the dying.  An RFA in 1999 Research On Care At The End Of Life resulted in 10 studies funded on clinical management; communication among the patient, family and health care team; decision making about life sustaining treatments; cultural preferences in end-of-life care; and interventions to support the bereaved.  A 2000 program announcement, Quality of Life for Individuals at the End-of-Life, was justified by the strong response to the initial RFA and continuing knowledge gaps.  An NIH-wide End of Life Research Interest Group was established to promote coordination of initiatives across NIH components.  NINR and its interest group partners sponsored a community dialogue: The End of Our Lives: Guiding the Research Agenda- to build on the interest generated by the PBS series by Bill and Judith Moyers.  Recent findings from one of our investigators demonstrated that the existence of an advance directive, whether written or verbal, eased the burden on the family, reduced the stress associated with the decision to withdraw life-sustaining treatments, and allowed more attention to focus on the quality (rather than quantity) of life.        Future Initiatives       Health Disparities Research Initiatives  With continued funding increases NINR would significantly expand activities in health disparities in two areas.  Research on Diabetes Management in Minority Populations will generate studies of self-management, adherence and other behavioral aspects of diabetes treatment in order to design effective methods of diabetes control in various cultural/ethnic groups.  Studies are needed to improve self-monitoring and adjustment of lifestyle factors and to determine how to actively involve minority groups in developing and testing intervention strategies.  Secondly, an NINR and NIH-sponsored national meeting with minority nurse associations clarified the need for issuing an initiative on Health Disparities Centers and Career Development.   This call will stimulate health disparities research in NINR centers and increase the number of researchers, especially minority researchers, who are well prepared to carry out this research.    Research on End of Life  The public's interest and support of end-of-life research is matched by enthusiastic response from the scientific community.  NINR's expansion of end-of-life research will support research into the knowledge gaps identified in the future directions conference scheduled for October 2001.  The areas of focus for additional research include the experience of dying; factors that determine where people die; methods and measurement issues in end of life research; and ethical implications of end of life research.  Another area where funds would support significant initiatives is in identifying and managing the unique end-of-life issues in persons with rare genetic diseases.    Infrastructure Development-Nursing Research Training and Centers  With additional funds, NINR could increase the growth of the pool of investigators needed to conduct nursing research.  Special emphasis would be directed toward facilitating early entry into doctoral training and career development programs, in order to address the specific recommendation for NINR in the recent National Research Council report, Addressing the Nation's Changing Needs for Biomedical and Behavioral Scientists.  An expanded training and centers program not only begins to address a national shortage of nursing researcher-faculty, but it also increases the cadre of minority and disadvantaged investigators.  An expanded Centers program will enhance interdisciplinary research training opportunities.  Schools targeted with this expansion are those that have not received major NIH support.  NINR will encourage research depth in areas including health disparities, end of life/ palliative care, chronic illness and genetics.    Caregiving  One out of four family members is a caregiver who must meet the complex requirements of the patient while meeting personal needs and obligations.  The number of people providing long-term care outside of institutional settings is increasing rapidly due to the aging of the population, the limited access to high quality long-term care and the expense of this care.  A new initiative on Informal Caregiving in Non-Institutional Settings will support studies that test interventions to provide caregivers with the skills and information they need to meet complex demands, delay institutionalization and promote quality of life both for caregivers and those cared for.        National Human Genome Research Institute  (NHGRI)  Investments, Progress, and Plans  FY 1999 - 2003       Sequencing the Human Genome  In June 2000 the Human Genome Project completed a working draft of the DNA sequence of the human genome.  A complete description of this scientific tour de force, and the remarkable surprises that were uncovered, was published in February 2001.  This clearly represents one of the most important milestones ever encountered on the never-ending quest to better understand ourselves and the wonder of life.  Because of the increased funding provided to NHGRI, the draft sequence was achieved much faster than previously predicted.  Over 30 genes for human diseases, including various types of cancer, deafness, and birth defects, have been identified using this working draft.  Researchers are now using that information to go to the next step of developing better diagnostics and therapeutics.  Had the sequencing not been done so quickly, or not made immediately available in public databases, those diseases would still be mysteries.  Researchers are now working to fill any gaps in the draft and finish the sequence to high quality, final form no later than 2003.    Mouse Genome Sequence  The effort to sequence the genome of the laboratory mouse was launched by NIH under NHGRI leadership in October 1999.  The mouse sequence is critical information needed to interpret the human genome. In October 2000 the effort was accelerated by creation of  the Mouse Sequencing Consortium (MSC) — comprising three private companies, six Institutes of the NIH and the Wellcome Trust.  Without the additional funds provided to the NIH institutes, mouse sequencing would have started much later and the current goal of finishing the mouse sequence by 2005 would not be possible.  Already researchers are using the mouse sequence to speed the process of decoding the human genome.  As an example,  researchers at Merck recently utilized the mouse sequence to trim more than a year off of their research program to  develop a new drug for schizophrenia.     Human Genetic Variation  The DNA sequence of any two people is 99.9 percent identical.  The 0.1 percent difference includes genetic variations that have no effect at all, as well as variations that are associated with differences in the risk of getting various diseases or having an adverse drug reaction.  Now that nearly 3 million of these variants have been discovered and placed in public databases, researchers working on the genetics of heart disease, diabetes, cancer, mental illness, and a host of other medical problems are empowered to move forward much more swiftly than previously possible.  The additional funds have moved this area of research along very rapidly and the goals set for 2003 have already been achieved.   Human genetic variation studies are also being expanded to focus more specifically on how information generated by genetic variation research is likely to affect the ways in which culturally and socioeconomically diverse individuals and groups understand, access and use genetic information and health services.    Advanced Development Program  This program, initiated in FY 1999 with the increased funding, is designed to speed the transition of Human Genome Project critical technologies from developers to users and support intensive collaboration between technology developers and the laboratories that would use the technology for high-throughput sequencing.  These projects will disseminate cost-effective sequencing and genomics capabilities more broadly throughout the research community, to the benefit of scientific progress in many areas.  Examples under development include a sequencing machine that can run 4 times the number of samples without increasing instrument size, and liquid handling that can reduce sample volumes (and thus reagent costs which currently represents over 50 percent of sequencing costs) by 10-fold.    Education Kit  NHGRI has designed and produced a kit to educate, engage, and excite users about the human genome and genetics.  The primary target audience is high school students, though a much broader use with college students, voluntary health organizations and the general public is anticipated.  The kit includes a multimedia CD-ROM, wall poster of the genome, an informational brochure and a video documentary.  The kit was released concurrently with the publication of the human sequence in February 2001.  Without increased funding, this project would not have been possible.      Future Initiatives       Centers of Excellence in Genomic Science  This program has just been initiated to stimulate the development of new genomics approaches and integrate them with biomedical research.  Now that the human draft sequence is in hand, there are unprecedented opportunities to bring together interdisciplinary high throughput approaches to understanding health and disease.   The program also provides important training opportunities for a new generation of research scientists and bioinformaticians.  The response from the research community has far exceeded the ability of NHGRI to support all of the exciting high-quality proposals in FY 2001.   Increases in FY 2002 and beyond would be used to support additional centers, focusing on new approaches to genome-wide analysis in areas such as: regulation of gene expression; protein expression and interaction;  gene and protein networks; human genetic variation related to health and disease.  Other centers will focus on the storage, analysis, and distribution of comprehensive data sets; and the collection of high quality data to support these scientific analyses in the most cost-effective manner possible.    Databases of Genomic Information  The large amount of genetic information being produced is most accessible and useful to researchers when it is in public databases.  A critical need is to expand and improve current databases and create new ones as the need arises.  In FY 2002, NHGRI will increase its support of databases on model organisms, especially mouse, fly, worm, and yeast; expand the development of standard database modules that can be adapted for use by any organism community; and evaluate and expand databases containing protein information.     Genetic Variation Research and Health Disparities  An on-going initiative in NHGRI is to explore how socioeconomic factors, gender, and concepts of race and ethnicity influence the use, understanding, and interpretation of genetic information, the use of genetic services, and the development of policy.   In FY 2002, NHGRI will initiate a new program of studies to address these topics as they relate to health disparities.  The program will seek to evaluate how increased public awareness and understanding of genetic variation and its role in health and disease can help to reduce existing health disparities.     Model Organisms, and Comparative Sequencing  Now that most of the human genome sequence is available, much work is needed to interpret the function of all the parts.  Several approaches to doing this will be developed, but a key will be having the genome sequence of other organisms for comparison.  Because functionally important sequences are conserved, comparison between human and other organisms will help to identify many important features, including genes, gene structure, and regulatory and other non-coding functional elements.  The mouse sequence is already well underway and sequencing of the rat genome has begun.  However, many more sequences will be needed.  NHGRI is developing a process for prioritizing additional organisms to sequence beyond mouse and rat.  Already another species of the fruit fly and a tunicate have been identified for sequencing in FY 2002.  A workshop to develop criteria for choosing additional organisms will be held in July 2001.    Training and Research Career Development Initiatives  NHGRI continues to support the development of the next generation of genomic researchers.  New programs being planned for FY 2002 are a training initiative in genomics research targeted to under represented minority undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral fellows; a career development initiative in genomics research related to health disparities targeted to postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty; and an interdisciplinary ELSI/genetics training initiative.        National Center for Research Resources  (NCRR)  Investments, Progress, and Plans  FY 1999 - 2003       Development of Mutant Mouse Regional Resource Centers (MMRRCs)  The MMRRCs are regional facilities coordinated to maintain animals, cryopreserve embryos and gametes, phenotypically characterize animals, assure genetic quality control, and maintain a centralized resource database.  Through the Centers, NCRR will provide mutant mouse resources in response to the rapidly increasing numbers of genetically modified mice created and used by the biomedical research community. Parallel efforts with rats are also envisioned.   Four Centers have been established as well as an Informatics Coordinating Center responsible for electronically linking the MMRRCs and maintaining the database. The extensive planning phase has been completed and operations have begun on a limited basis with a goal of future expansion. This effort will grow markedly over the next few years to meet NIH needs.    Synchrotron Radiation, an Essential Tool for Macromolecular Crystallographers  Synchrotrons are an essential source of x-rays for determining crystallographic structures of biological macromolecules needed to understand the function of proteins and to assist in identifying new targets for therapeutic drug design.  In the post-genomic era, the demand for structures is increasing exponentially.  Through this initiative, the number of synchrotron x-ray stations for collecting biological crystallography data will be doubled by 2003 and, because of rapidly advancing technologies applied to the production of pure proteins, data collection and processing, and structure solution, the capacity of these beamlines to produce new structures is expected to increase by a factor of 10 or more.   The NIH, through NIGMS, NCI and NCRR, ramped up efforts in FY 1999 and FY 2000 to meet these demands by supporting the construction, upgrade of detectors, and operation of state-of-the-art synchrotron beamlines that are accessible and approachable by the user community.    Clinical Research Career Development  This initiative is an effort to increase the number of physicians in a program of mentored patient-oriented research career development (MPORCD).  This should result in an increase in the number of well-trained clinical investigators.  In FY 2000, NCRR reached a new high in the total number of physicians being supported for MPORCD by continuing support for previously funded CAPs (87) and MCAPs (5), and beginning a new program to support K23 awards (42).    Centers of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE)  The COBRE program augments and strengthens the institutional biomedical research capabilities in Institutional Development Award (IDeA) states by supporting multi-disciplinary centers, led by peer-reviewed, NIH-funded investigators with expertise central to the grant proposal and who mentor promising junior investigators.  This initiative will facilitate the development of new disease specific research Centers and will augment the capability of existing Centers.  Twenty-one Centers of Biomedical Research Excellence have been established at a cost of $36.72 million for the first year.    Future Initiatives       Establish Integrative Biomedical Technology Centers  NCRR plans to support development of technologies to quantitate spatiotemporal differences in the levels of gene expression, assess post-translational modifications of proteins, and characterize intracellular protein-protein interactions in both healthy and diseased states. Initial efforts will concentrate on proteomics.    Establish Regional Genotyping and Phenotyping Centers  With the sequencing of the human genome, technologies for high-throughput approaches to genotyping need to be developed to identify genetic polymorphisms for disease variants.  NCRR will support workshops in bioinformatics, and develop and implement a web-based bioinformatics toolbox for investigators.  Phenotyping resources also need to be established for human and animal studies.  Genotyping and phenotyping data will be included in a common database to reduce unnecessary research duplication.    Instrumentation Exceeding $0.5 Million  Biomedical research depends increasingly on advanced instrumentation that often costs in excess of $0.5 million. Therefore,  NCRR plans to provide support for competitive awards to acquire high-end instrumentation, including very high-field NMR spectrometers, synchrotron beamlines for macromolecular structure studies, high-resolution mass spectrometers, and cryoelectron microscopes.    Establish Islet Cell Resource Centers  A recent study reported that patients with Type I diabetes who received human islet cell transplants attained long-term independence from insulin injections.  To extend and reproduce these observations, NCRR and its partners will establish up to six Islet Cell Resource Centers (ICRCs) for the isolation, purification, characterization, and transplantation of human pancreatic islet cells. The ICRCs will optimize the number of islet cells harvested from pancreatic tissue and optimize conditions for maintaining peak islet cell function.    Construct and Improve Chimpanzee Facilities  Chimpanzees originally bred for AIDS research have thus far not been useful models for studies of AIDS-virus pathogenesis. Thus, a plan was devised to consolidate the animals supported by NIH in a more cost-effective configuration.  To do this, funds to construct or renovate appropriate housing to consolidate the  chimpanzee research sites and separately support the construction of a sanctuary system in order  to assure the well-being and safety of research chimpanzees and their caretakers.    Enhance the Biomedical Research Capacities of Institutions within the IDeA States  The NIH Institutional Development Award (IDeA) program provides support to build the biomedical research capacities of institutions in states that have not previously fully participated in biomedical research through a new component entitled Biomedical Research Infrastructure Networks (BRIN).  BRIN requires activities at community colleges or undergraduate institutions to enhance the quality of undergraduate science faculty.  BRIN will prepare outstanding students for graduate schools in their states where they may pursue biomedical research careers to help upgrade the technical expertise of the state's workforce and improve the local economy.        National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine  (NCCAM)  Investments, Progress, and Plans  FY 1999 - 2003        Chelation Therapy for CAD  This initiative, co-funded by NHLBI, facilitates the study a popular but controversial alternative medical therapy for the treatment of coronary artery disease.  NCCAM's goal is to determine the safety and efficacy of  ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) chelation therapy through the first large, well-controlled, multi-center clinical trial using validated outcome measures.  Formal solicitation for applications is expected this year.    Specialty Research Centers in Cancer  This initiative enhances greatly our research on popular CAM treatments for cancer and its complications.  The long-term goal of the initiative is to expand options for safe and effective cancer therapies.  Grants have been awarded to two leading academic centers.  The Johns Hopkins Center is studying CAM treatments for breast cancer and running the first controlled trial of PC-SPES, a Chinese herbal mixture, in African-American and Chinese men with prostate cancer.  The University of Pennsylvania Center is studying hyperbaric oxygen (oxygen at greater than-atmospheric pressures) for the treatment of head and neck cancers.    Magnesium Therapy for Asthma  This initiative, co-funded by NHLBI,  supports a study of the safety and efficacy of intravenous magnesium supplementation as a treatment for acute asthma attacks in various age and racial/ethnic groups.  The study is part of an effort to develop new treatment options for severe asthma attacks.  Applications are now being solicited.    Epidemiology of CAM use in Minority Populations  This initiative supports  epidemiological surveys of CAM use in minority and underserved populations, emphasizing the use of traditional and folk medicine among immigrant populations and the rural poor.  NCCAM will use the survey data to help prioritize specific CAM studies in under-served populations.  In collaboration with the CDC, a survey instrument is under development and will be used in the field in 2002.    CAM at the End of Life  NCCAM's activities include the support of exploratory studies of novel approaches to prevent and manage symptoms and side effects associated with cancer and AIDS and their treatment.  The goal is to expand the end-of life options, preserve the dignity, reduce intractable pain and improve the quality of life of terminal cancer and HIV/AIDS patients.  We are currently receiving applications.      Future Initiatives       Botanical Interactions with HIV/AIDS Drugs  NCCAM will investigate interactions between popular herbal supplements and important prescription drugs for HIV/AIDS using animal models and exploratory clinical studies.  The goal is to develop reliable research-based data to guide consumers and practitioners about the potential risks and benefits of simultaneously using botanical products and potentially life-saving medications for HIV/AIDS.     Chromium to treat diabetes  NCCAM expects to solicit applications for clinical studies to explore the safety and efficacy of chromium for treating diabetes in populations at high risk for the disease.    Immunomodulatory effects of CAM  NCCAP plans to support new studies of how various CAM practices such as acupuncture and herbal medicines alter the body's immune responses so as to help prevent or treat infections, arthritis, cancer, or HIV/AIDS.        Fogarty International Center  (FIC)  Investments, Progress, and Plans  FY 1999 - 2003     HIV/AIDS  The AIDS International Training and Research Program (AITRP) led by FIC and in partnership with nine NIH institutes, supports research training that is critical to advancing the AIDS research agenda abroad.  For example, with FIC support, investigators at the University of Nairobi collaborating with the University of Washington have evaluated the rates of HIV transmission to infants through breastfeeding.  In the new study, pregnant HIV-infected women joined groups that would either breastfeed or formula feed their infants.  Among infants born to mothers in the breast feeding group the risk of becoming HIV infected in association with breast feeding increased by 76% in contrast to the formula fed group.  Overall, 44 percent of the HIV infections in infants born to mothers in the breastfeeding group were due to breast milk.  This study clearly shows the need to prevent breast milk transmission of HIV and has major implications for development and deployment of public health interventions in resource-poor settings.  Additional studies are now underway to address the related and complex social and economic implications of infant feeding.     Emerging Infectious Diseases  Tuberculosis accounts for one-quarter of all avoidable adult deaths in the developing world.  A major problem in developing countries is their limited capacity to use conventional diagnostic tests because of high costs and equipment demands.  As a result, drug susceptibility testing is rarely performed despite the rapidly rising rates of multiple drug resistant TB strains that can spread, undetected, from person to person s well as across borders.  With FIC support under the ITREID program, U.S. and Peruvian scientists developed a rapid and reliable method for detecting tuberculosis for use by health officers in developing countries. The test, called ""microscopic observation broth-drug susceptibility assay"" (MODS), detects tiny amounts of TB bacteria in patient sputum samples using a simple light microscope within 9 days, compared with 3-4 weeks for traditional culture methods.  This rapid, inexpensive, and sensitive method can also be used to determine drug resistance.  Use of MODS should improve the capability to detect and properly treat tuberculosis including drug resistant mutants in developing country health facilities, thus blocking the spread of this killer infection.    Fogarty International Research Collaboration Award (FIRCA)  Improving the health status of populations at home and abroad requires a continuing commitment to basic science.  The FIRCA provides small research grants to foster international research partnerships between NIH-supported U.S. scientists and their collaborators in regions of the developing world.  Selected FIRCA accomplishments are as follows:       Genetics:  With FIC support, scientists at the University of Washington are collaborating with colleagues at Tel Aviv University in Israel and Bethlehem University in the Palestinian Authority to map and clone the genes responsible for different types of inherited deafness. The incidence of preverbal deafness is high in the Middle East region, and may be due to environmental factors or to mutations in any one of more than 100 genes, each of which codes for a protein involved in the development, structure or function of the inner ear.  This science, pursued through novel studies conducted through novel mechanisms will lead to a better understanding of the biology of hearing and the potential for new interventions to reduce deafness.  Despite political tensions in the region, the U.S.-Israeli-Palestinian cooperation continues undeterred.     Asthma:  An increasingly worrisome trend in the burden of childhood disease is the striking rise in asthma incidence in both industrialized and developing nations, due in part to sensitizing agents in the environment. In efforts to elucidate the physiological conditions that lead to asthma and to develop potential interventions, FIC-supported scientists at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center and the National Autonomous University of Mexico City are defining the pathways in the chain of events that lead to allergic reactions or asthma.  By studying the pathways from allergen binding to the allergic reaction, researchers hope to understand mechanisms that control these events in order to interrupt them.  The team has described a new approach to isolate the allergic reaction-signaling pathway that engages the immune system via mast cells.  Scientists have pinpointed specific target enzymes that act as key players in transmitting the signal to release inflammatory substances that mediate the symptoms of an allergic response.  This knowledge will provide tangible leads for the development of new drugs to block the action of these enzymes and mute or prevent severe and sometimes lethal allergic reactions involved in asthma.         National Library of Medicine  (NLM)  Investments, Progress, and Plans  FY 1999 - 2003      Health Information for the Public  The National Library of Medicine formally embarked on a program of providing health information services to the general public beginning in FY 1999.  This change in direction for an institution that traditionally emphasized service to the health professions was made possible by the convergence of two factors: increased access to the Web by consumers and increased resources for the Library available through the effort to double the NIH budget.  MEDLINE, NLM's immense database of science-based medical literature, was made free and easily accessible on the Web in 1997.  The enthusiastic response of the medical community to this valuable resource was predictable; what was not predictable was the heavy use of MEDLINE made by the general public.  This, along with the encouragement of the Congress, prompted the NLM to create MEDLINEplus in FY 1999. MEDLINEplus provides easy access to a wealth of reliable health information written for the public, much of it from the NIH.  The new service has information about more than 400 diseases and health conditions, extensive data on over-the-counter and prescription drugs, medical dictionaries and encyclopedias, and directories of hospitals and providers.  One of the most important services of MEDLINEplus is providing the public and their health care providers with information about more than 5,000 clinical trials sponsored by NIH and others through ClinicalTrials.gov.  Users of MEDLINEplus are ensured total privacy, and usage has climbed to 5 million page hits a month.      Next Generation Internet  With resources made available through Congressional support, over the last two years, the NLM has assumed a key role in ensuring that the health sciences are prepared to take fullest advantage of the benefits of the rapidly expanding global information infrastructure, including telemedicine and the Next Generation Internet.  One aspect of this is NLM's involvement with medical informatics research and training.  A recent report, ""Biomedical Information Science and Technology Initiative,"" recommends that NIH invest heavily in computer and information technology so as to be able to manage data and model biological processes, and to train the needed specialists.  The BISTI initiative falls within the scope of the NLM's medical informatics training program under which the Library supports 12 training programs at universities across the nation for the express purpose of training experts to carry out research in general informatics and in the genome-related specialty of bioinformatics.  In FY 2000 the NLM was able to augment each of the 12 training programs with a BISTI supplement of $200,000 to strengthen or initiate bioinformatics training within the program.  These awards will allow the training programs to turn the advantages they already enjoy experienced faculty, curricula, sanctioned university status, and ready access to potential candidates to bioinformatics. As part of the NIH BISTI Program, NLM is prepared to fund in FY 2001 several planning grants in this arena.    Genomics  The continuing voyage of discovery into our DNA is one of science's great adventures.  The Library's extensive and rapidly expanding program in medical genomics, the development of tools and approaches to assay gene function, is centered at NLM's National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).  A new ""Human Gene Map"" was announced in FY 1999 that,  to date, has assisted scientists in identifying more than 100 disease-causing genes. In FY 2000 there was the widely publicized announcement of the completion of a ""working draft"" of the human genome.  Substantial increases in budget and staff for the NCBI have made it possible to keep pace with the enormous amount of data coming out of genome research laboratories around the world and to offer to the public on the Web an assembly of the DNA sequence into an organized and easily accessible resource.  In all, the Center supports and distributes more than 30 databases and research tools for the medical and scientific communities.     Future Initiatives     Permanent Access to a Changing Medical Literature  The basic function of the National Library of Medicine is to collect, organize, and preserve the literature of the health sciences. That literature is published not only on paper, but, increasingly, in various electronic forms.  National institutions with archival responsibilities, such as the NLM, are expected to handle all such material, and to take steps so that it will be available to future generations.  The Library assigns the very highest priority to collecting and preserving information in all forms and to working closely with organizations like the Library of Congress in developing techniques to ensure that today's knowledge — both that which is ""born digital"" and that which is converted from paper to digital form — will not be lost.  With future increases, NLM expects that PubMed Central, a new electronic full-text journal archive available on the Web, will be expanded greatly beginning in FY 2002.  PubMed Central is so-named because of its integration with the existing PubMed retrieval system that was developed by the NLM for biomedical literature databases.   PubMed Central provides permanent free access to full-text articles from journals indexed by one or more of the major abstracting and indexing services.  This is viewed as the initial site in an international system. A PubMed Central advisory committee is headed by Nobelist Joshua Lederberg.    Centers of Excellence Grants/BISTI  Expanded resources are making it possible for the NLM, in FY 2002, to participate with the NIH Biomedical Information Science and Technology Initiative (BISTI) in funding what are called National Programs of Excellence in Biomedical Computing.  NLM is funding several planning grants in FY 2001 that will make implementing these so-called ""Centers of Excellence"" possible the following year assuming appropriate funding.  The Centers will provide a venue for interdisciplinary research, tool-building, training and education requiring the cooperative efforts of biologists and bioinformaticians.  The Centers are expected to be important sites for training of informatics-literate biologists and of domain-literate informaticians.  We expect that health providers will use in their own clinical setting the new electronic access methods developed and the improved informatics tools devised as a result of work at the Centers of Excellence.    Health Disparities  The NLM has had several programs over the past decade that targeted the need to improve health information services for selected underserved populations. Two examples are improving access to environmental health services information in minority communities and to HIV/AIDS information in communities at risk for that disease.  The Library recently published a Strategic Plan to Reduce Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities, 20002005.  This, plus increased resources, are making it possible for NLM to broaden substantially its assistance for minority populations in the coming years.  Among the areas of special emphasis: implementing a plan, the feasibility of which has already been demonstrated, to install a malaria research network in sub-Saharan Africa; working with institutions around the country (Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital in New York City, Children's Hospital in Los Angeles, Medical University of South Carolina) to use new information technologies to enable medically underserved diabetes patients to manage their disease and avoid complications; working with Community Health Centers to bring the potential benefits of ClinicalTrials.gov to minority populations; and building on the lessons learned in a pilot project to support Indian reservations and villages in various parts of the U.S. that are currently underserved with regard to Internet connectivity and access to health information."
GX070-24-12319302	"Home News & Announcements Archives (1999-2001) National Institutes of Health Guidelines for Research Using Human Pluripotent Stem Cells                           National Institutes of Health Guidelines for Research Using Human Pluripotent Stem Cells        (Effective August 25, 2000, 65 FR 51976)   (Corrected November 21, 2000, 65 FR 69951)         This Federal Register Announcement has been superceded as it pertains to    human embryonic stem cell research. Please refer to the  Federal    Register Announcement .            SUMMARY : The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is hereby publishing final    ""National Institutes of Health Guidelines for Research Using Human Pluripotent    Stem Cells."" The Guidelines establish procedures to help ensure that NIH-funded    research in this area is conducted in an ethical and legal manner.     EFFECTIVE  DATE : These Guidelines are effective on August 25, 2000. The moratorium on research    using human pluripotent stem cells derived from human embryos and fetal tissue    put in place by the Director, NIH, in January 1999, was lifted on August 25,    2000.     SUMMARY OF PUBLIC COMMENTS ON DRAFT GUIDELINES :  On December 2, 1999, the    NIH published Draft Guidelines for research involving human pluripotent stem    cells (hPSCs) in the  Federal Register  for public comment. The comment period    ended on February 22, 2000.    The NIH received approximately 50,000 comments from    members of Congress, patient advocacy groups, scientific societies, religious    organizations, and private citizens. This Notice presents the final Guidelines    together with NIH's response to the substantive public comments that addressed    provisions of the Guidelines.     Scope of Guidelines and General Issues      Respondents    asked for clarification of terminology used in the Guidelines and some commented    that the language was not appropriate or was too technical, particularly the    informed consent sections . The NIH agrees that these Guidelines should be clear    and understandable. Changes, including some reorganization of the sections,    were made to this end. The Guidelines are written primarily for the purpose    of informing investigators of the conditions that must be met in order to receive    NIH funding for research using hPSCs and, therefore, some technical language    is required. The Guidelines do not define the precise language that should appear    in informed consent documents because these should be developed by the investigator/clinician    specifically for a particular study protocol or procedure for which the consent    is being sought. Existing regulatory provisions require (45 CFR  46.116) that    the language in informed consent documents be understandable to prospective    participants in the study.     Respondents suggested that NIH funding for research    using hPSCs would be in violation of the DHHS appropriations law and that derivation    of hPSCs cannot be distinguished from their use. For this reason, a number of    respondents asked that the NIH withdraw the draft Guidelines . The NIH sought    the opinion of the DHHS General Counsel, who determined that ""federally funded    research that utilizes hPSCs would not be prohibited by the HHS appropriations    law prohibiting human embryo research, because such cells are not human embryos.""    Comments questioning this conclusion did not present information or arguments    that justify reconsideration of the conclusion.     Respondents commented that the    Guidelines are too restrictive or that there is no need for Federal Guidelines    for this arena of research. Comments asserted that federally funded research    using hPSCs should go forward without formal requirements, in the same manner    as in the private sector . In order to help ensure that the NIH-funded research    using hPSCs is conducted in an ethical and legal manner, the NIH felt it was    advisable to develop and implement guidelines. To this end, the NIH Director    convened a Working Group of the Advisory Committee to the Director, NIH (ACD),    to advise the ACD on the development of guidelines and an oversight process    for research involving hPSCs. The NIH Director charged the Working Group with    developing appropriate guidelines to govern research involving the derivation    and use of hPSCs from fetal tissue and research involving the use of hPSCs derived    from human embryos that are in excess of clinical need.     Respondents commented    regarding the sources of stem cells. Some respondents stated that research on    hPSCs was unnecessary because stem cells from adults, umbilical cords, and placentas    could be used instead. Other respondents asked the NIH to restrict Federal funding    for hPSC research to those cells derived from fetal and adult tissue but not    embryos. Other respondents asked that the Guidelines encompass research using    stem cells from adult tissues . As stated under Section I. Scope of Guidelines,    the Guidelines apply to the use of NIH funds for research using hPSCs derived    from human embryos or human fetal tissue. The Guidelines do not impose requirements    on Federal funding of research involving stem cells from human adults, umbilical    cords, or placentas.   Given the enormous potential of stem cells to the development    of new therapies for the most devastating diseases, it is important to simultaneously    pursue all lines of promising research. It is possible that no single source    of stem cells is best or even suitable/usable for all therapies. Different types    or sources of stem cells may be optimal for treatment of specific conditions.    In order to determine the very best source of many of the specialized cells    and tissues of the body for new treatments and even cures, it is vitally important    to study the potential of adult stem cells for comparison to that of hPSCs derived    from embryos and fetuses. Unless all stem cell types are studied, the differences    between adult stem cells and embryo and fetal-derived hPSCs will not be known.      Moreover, there is evidence that adult stem cells may have more limited potential    than hPSCs. First, stem cells for all cell and tissue types have not yet been    found in the adult human. Significantly, cardiac stem cells or pancreatic islet    stem cells have not been identified in adult humans. Second, stem cells in adults    are often present in only minute quantities, are difficult to isolate and purify,    and their numbers may decrease with age. For example, brain cells from adults    that may be neural stem cells have been obtained only by removing a portion    of the brain of an adult with epilepsy, a complex and invasive procedure that    carries the added risk of further neurological damage. Any attempt to use stem    cells from a patient's own body for treatment would require that stem cells    would first have to be isolated from the patient and then grown in culture in    sufficient numbers to obtain adequate quantities for treatment. This would mean    that for some rapidly progressing disorders, there may not be sufficient time    to grow enough cells to use for treatment. Third, in disorders that are caused    by a genetic defect, the genetic error likely would be present in the patient's    stem cells, making cells from such a patient inappropriate for transplantation.    In addition, adult stem cells may contain more DNA abnormalities caused by exposure    to daily living, including sunlight, toxins, and errors made during DNA replication    than will be found in fetal or embryonic hPSCs. Fourth, there is evidence that    stem cells from adults may not have the same capacity to multiply as do younger    cells. These potential weaknesses may limit the usefulness of adult stem cells.       Respondents were concerned that these are guidelines and not requirements or    regulations . Although these are guidelines and not regulations, they prescribe    the documentation and assurances that must accompany requests for NIH funding    for research utilizing hPSCs. If the funding requests do not contain the prescribed    information, funding for hPSC research will not be provided. Compliance with    the Guidelines will be imposed as a condition of grant award.     Respondents commented    that there had not been enough widespread public disclosure/discussion of this    research or the Guidelines . Prior to the development of draft Guidelines, there    were two Congressional hearings on hPSCs. In a further effort to ensure substantial    discussion and comment, the NIH convened a Working Group of the Advisory Committee    to the Director, NIH (ACD), to advise the ACD on the development of these Guidelines.    The Working Group was composed of scientists, patients and patient advocates,    ethicists, clinicians, and lawyers. The Working Group met in public session    on April 8, 1999, and heard from members of the public, as well as professional    associations and Congress. In developing the draft Guidelines, the NIH also    considered advice from the National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC). Draft    Guidelines were published for public comment in the  Federal Register  on December    2, 1999, for 60 days, and, in response to public interest, the comment period    was extended an additional 28 days. Approximately 50,000 comments were received.    NIH issued a national press release announcing the  Federal Register  notice and    many of the Nation's newspapers carried articles on this area of research and    on the Guidelines. Patient groups, scientific societies, and religious organizations    convened meetings and discussion groups and disseminated materials about this    area of research and about the Guidelines.     Comment was received about whether    the Guidelines apply to hPSC lines developed outside of the United States . The    Guidelines make no distinction based upon the country in which an hPSC line    is developed. All lines to be used in hPSC cell research funded by NIH must    meet the same requirements.     Derivation and Use of hPSCs From Fetal Tissue      Respondents    made the point that the NIH has specified certain requirements for the use of    human fetal tissue to derive hPSCs in addition to those imposed on other areas    of human fetal tissue research. These respondents suggested that the section    of the Guidelines pertaining to fetal tissue sources be omitted . In order to    ensure uniformity in NIH's oversight of research using hPSCs, the Guidelines    were extended to govern hPSCs derived from both human embryos and fetal tissue.       Use of hPSCs Derived From Human Embryos      Respondents suggested that the Guidelines    refer to ""fertility treatment"" rather than to ""infertility treatment"" in order    to clarify that they allow the use of human embryos from treatments that employ    assisted reproductive technologies to facilitate reproduction in fertile, as    well as in infertile, individuals . The Guidelines have been changed accordingly.      Respondents suggested dropping the word ""early"" throughout the document or more    clearly defining ""early.""  The word ""early"" in reference to human embryos has    been deleted; the Guidelines make it clear that NIH funding of research using    hPSCs derived in the private sector from human embryos can involve only embryos    that have not reached the stage at which the mesoderm is formed.     Some respondents    were concerned that embryos might be created for research purposes. Other respondents    stated there should be no distinction between embryos created for research purposes    and those created for fertility treatment . Investigators seeking NIH funds for    research using hPSCs are required to provide documentation, prior to the award    of any NIH funds, that embryos were created for the purposes of fertility treatment.    President Clinton, many members of Congress, the NIH Human Embryo Research Panel,    and the NBAC have all embraced the distinction between embryos created for research    purposes and those created for reproductive purposes.     Respondents were concerned    about the creation of a ""black market"" for human embryos, and expressed concerns    that individuals will be coerced into donating embryos . The Guidelines state    that there can be no incentives for donation and that a decision to donate must    be made free of coercion. In addition, the Guidelines set forth conditions that    will help ensure all donations are voluntary. For example, with regard to hPSCs    derived from embryos, research using Federal funds may only be conducted if    the cells were derived from frozen embryos that were created for the purpose    of fertility treatment and that were in excess of clinical need.     Respondents    commented on the requirement that human embryos be frozen in order to qualify    for derivation of hPSCs to be used in NIH-funded research. Respondents suggested    that the freezing requirement would preclude the use of hPSCs derived from embryos    that are genetically and chromosomally abnormal, since such embryos are usually    not frozen for reproductive purposes . While the NIH acknowledges that research    on hPSCs derived from such embryos could yield important scientific information,    limiting research to hPSCs derived from frozen human embryos will help ensure    that the decision to donate the embryo for hPSC research is distinct and separate    from the fertility treatment.     Financial Issues      Respondents expressed concern    regarding the sale of fetal tissue for profit and whether hPSC research would    encourage such activity. Respondents also were concerned about whether clinics    or doctors would profit from the derivation of hPSCs and/or their sale . Section    498B of the Public Health Service Act prohibits any individual from knowingly    acquiring or selling human fetal tissue for ""valuable consideration."" In addition,    the Guidelines prohibit any inducement for the donation of human embryos for    research purposes. The Guidelines also call for an assurance that the hPSCs    to be used in NIH-funded research were obtained through a donation or through    a payment that does not exceed the reasonable costs associated with the transportation,    processing, preservation, quality control and storage of the hPSCs. All grantees    must sign an assurance that they are in compliance with all applicable Federal,    State, and local laws. Each funded research institution is responsible for monitoring    compliance by individual investigators with any such applicable laws.     Respondents    questioned the prohibition against embryo donors benefitting financially from    their donation . This clause was retained in the final Guidelines to help ensure    that the donating individuals are offered no inducements to donate and that    all donations are voluntary.     Respondents suggested that the Guidelines be strengthened    to include a waiver of intellectual property rights . This proposed change would    be inconsistent with 45 CFR  46.116 of the regulation for the protection of    human subjects of research, which provides that no informed consent may include    language through which the subject waives or appears to waive any of the subject's    legal rights.     Respondents questioned the reference in the requirements for informed    consent related to the commercial potential of donated material . The paragraphs    providing for disclosure in the informed consent of the possibility that the    donated material could have commercial potential were modified. The reference    in these paragraphs to ""donated material"" did not accurately reflect the intent    of the provision. The Guidelines now make clear that the ""results of research    on the human pluripotent stem cells may have commercial potential.""     Ineligible Research      Respondents objected to the areas of research that the NIH has deemed    ineligible, particularly research that is not restricted by statute or regulation,    such as research utilizing hPSCs that were derived using somatic cell nuclear    transfer, i.e., the transfer of a human somatic cell nucleus into a human egg .    The NIH determined that, at this time, research using hPSCs derived from such    sources has not received adequate discussion and consideration by the public    and is, therefore, ineligible for NIH funding.     Separation of Fertility Treatment   and Abortion From Research     Respondents were concerned that hPSC research would    encourage abortion . The law and the Guidelines guard against encouraging abortion    by requiring that the decision to have an abortion be made apart from and prior    to the decision to donate tissue.     Respondents objected to the condition in the    Guidelines that the fertility physician could not be the same person as the    researcher deriving stem cells. Some respondents stated that the Institutional    Review Board (IRB) or an independent physician would be able to guard against    this conflict of interest . The restriction was designed so that the person treating    the individuals seeking fertility treatment, who is involved in decisions such    as how many embryos to produce, is not the person seeking to derive hPSCs. This    separation will help ensure that embryos will not be created in numbers greater    than necessary for fertility treatment    Respondents suggested that the clauses    regarding donation of fetal tissue or human embryos for derivation of stem cells    for eventual use in transplantation be changed explicitly to prevent directed    donation . This change has been made.     Identifiers      Respondents were concerned    about removing identifiers. There was concern that the investigator would not    be able to document compliance with the Guidelines requirements without identifiers,    or that the removal of identifiers would make it impossible to conduct certain    genetic studies or develop therapeutic materials . The Guidelines have been modified    to clarify that the term ""identifier"" refers to any information from which the    donor(s) can be identified, directly or through identifiers linked to the donors.    However, since information identifying the donor(s) may be necessary if the    tissue or cells are to be used in transplantation, the Guidelines have also    been modified to state that the informed consent should notify donor(s) whether    or not identifiers will be retained.    Respondents commented that DNA is an identifier    and that all donors of human embryos or fetal tissue should be told that identifiers    such as DNA will be retained with the samples . Although DNA can be used to determine    the individual from whom a tissue sample was taken, this can be done only when    one has a sample from both the tissue in question and the putative donor; it    cannot be used to identify an individual out of a population. Moreover, it is    difficult to identify a donor using tissue derived from a fetus or embryo, since    the tissue is not genetically identical to the donor.     Informed Consent and IRB  Review      Respondents asked why investigators were expected to provide documentation    of IRB review of derivation from human embryos, but not for derivation from    fetal tissue. Respondents suggested that the requirements be changed so that    protocols for both sources of hPSCs must be approved by an IRB . The Guidelines    have been changed to make clear that the IRB review requirements regarding the    derivation of cells from fetal tissue and human embryos are the same.     Comment    was received expressing concern that the informed consent explicitly state that    the donor will have no dispositional authority over derived pluripotent stem    cells . The Guidelines state that donation of human embryos should have been    made without any restriction regarding the individual(s) who may be the recipient    of the cells derived from the hPSCs for transplantation. Such a statement is    consistent with the statutory provision applicable to the donor informed consent    for the use of fetal tissue for transplantation. The Guidelines now provide    for the inclusion of a statement to this effect in the informed consent.     Respondents    urged that the Guidelines be revised to remove the prohibition on potential    donors receiving information regarding subsequent testing of donated tissue    in the situation when physicians deem disclosure to be in the donors' best interest .    This change has been made.     Respondents requested clarification regarding the    persons from whom consent for donation of embryos for research must be obtained .    The Guidelines call for informed consent from individual(s) who have sought    fertility treatment. Only the individual(s) who were part of the decision to    create the embryo for reproductive purposes should have been part of the decision    to donate for the derivation of hPSCs.     Respondents urged that fertility clinics    should be able to discuss with patients the option of donating embryos for research    at the beginning of the IVF process . The Guidelines do not delineate the timeframe    during which the general option of donating embryos for research can be discussed.    However, according to the Guidelines, obtaining consent for donation of embryos    for the purpose of deriving hPSCs should not occur until after the embryos are    determined to be in ""excess of clinical need.""     Oversight      Respondents stated    that the NIH's oversight in this area of research was very important to the    legal and ethical conduct of this research, and asked for more information regarding    the oversight process . Information about the operations of the Human Pluripotent    Stem Cell Review Group (HPSCRG) can be found in the final Guidelines and on    the NIH Web page.     Respondents were concerned about whether and how NIH would    monitor research after a researcher receives NIH funds . Compliance with the    Guidelines will be largely determined prior to the award of funds. Follow-up    to ensure continued compliance with the Guidelines will be conducted in the    same manner as for all other conditions of all other NIH grant awards. It is    the responsibility of the investigator to file progress reports, and it is the    responsibility of the funded institution to ensure compliance with the NIH Guidelines.    NIH staff will also monitor the progress of these investigators as part of their    regular duties.     Respondents asked about penalties for not following the Guidelines .    The following actions may be taken by the NIH when there is a failure to comply    with the terms and conditions of any award: 1) Under 45 CFR  74.14, the NIH    can impose special conditions on an award, including increased oversight/monitoring/reporting    requirements for an institution, project or investigator; 2) Under 45 CFR     74.62, if a grantee materially fails to comply with the terms and conditions    of the award, the NIH may withhold funds pending correction of the problem or,    pending more severe enforcement action, disallow all or part of the costs of    the activity that was not in compliance, withhold further awards for the project,    or suspend or terminate all or part of the funding for the project. Individuals    and institutions may be debarred from eligibility for all Federal financial    assistance and contracts under 45 CFR Part 76 and 48 CFR Subpart 9.4, respectively.    Because these sanctions pertain to all conditions of grant award, the NIH did    not reiterate them in the Guidelines.     Respondents suggested that the HPSCRG    hold periodic Stem Cell Policy Conferences (similar to the Gene Therapy Policy    Conferences conducted by the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC)) in order    to solicit and consider public comment from interested parties on the scientific,    medical, legal, and ethical issues arising from stem cell research . Members    of the HPSCRG will serve as a resource for recommending to the NIH any need    for Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Policy Conferences.     Other Changes    Because compliance    materials may be made public prior to funding decisions, we have added a sentence    requiring the principal investigator's written consent to the disclosure of    such material necessary to carry out public review and other oversight procedures.      The draft Guidelines required HPSCRG review of proposals from investigators    planning to derive hPSCs from fetal tissue. Because the Guidelines address proposals    for NIH funding for the use of hPSCs, this requirement has been removed from    the Guidelines.    The text of the Guidelines follows.     National Institutes of Health  Guidelines for Research Using Human Pluripotent Stem Cells     I. Scope of Guidelines       These Guidelines apply to the expenditure of National Institutes of Health (NIH)    funds for research using human pluripotent stem cells derived from human embryos    (technically known as human embryonic stem cells) or human fetal tissue (technically    known as human embryonic germ cells). For purposes of these Guidelines, ""human    pluripotent stem cells"" are cells that are self-replicating, are derived from    human embryos or human fetal tissue, and are known to develop into cells and    tissues of the three primary germ layers. Although human pluripotent stem cells    may be derived from embryos or fetal tissue, such stem cells are not themselves    embryos. NIH research funded under these Guidelines will involve human pluripotent    stem cells derived 1) from human fetal tissue; or 2) from human embryos that    are the result of  in vitro  fertilization, are in excess of clinical need, and    have not reached the stage at which the mesoderm is formed.   In accordance with    42 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)  52.4, these Guidelines prescribe the    documentation and assurances that must accompany requests for NIH funding for    research using human pluripotent stem cells from: (1) awardees who want to use    existing funds; (2) awardees requesting an administrative or competing supplement;    and (3) applicants or intramural researchers submitting applications or proposals.    NIH funds may be used to derive human pluripotent stem cells from fetal tissue.    NIH funds may not be used to derive human pluripotent stem cells from human    embryos. These Guidelines also designate certain areas of human pluripotent    stem cell research as ineligible for NIH funding.     II. Guidelines for Research Using Human Pluripotent Stem Cells that is Eligible for NIH Funding       A. Utilization  of Human Pluripotent Stem Cells Derived from Human Embryos     1. Submission to  NIH    Intramural or extramural investigators who are intending to use existing    funds, are requesting an administrative supplement, or are applying for new    NIH funding for research using human pluripotent stem cells derived from human    embryos must submit to NIH the following:     a. An assurance signed by the responsible    institutional official that the pluripotent stem cells were derived from human    embryos in accordance with the conditions set forth in Section II.A.2 of these    Guidelines and that the institution will maintain documentation in support of    the assurance;    b. A sample informed consent document (with patient identifier    information removed) and a description of the informed consent process that    meet the criteria for informed consent set forth in Section II.A.2.e of these    Guidelines;    c. An abstract of the scientific protocol used to derive human pluripotent    stem cells from an embryo;   d. Documentation of Institutional Review Board (IRB)    approval of the derivation protocol;    e. An assurance that the stem cells to    be used in the research were or will be obtained through a donation or through    a payment that does not exceed the reasonable costs associated with the transportation,    processing, preservation, quality control and storage of the stem cells;    f.  The title of the research proposal or specific subproject that proposes the    use of human pluripotent stem cells;   g. An assurance that the proposed research    using human pluripotent stem cells is not a class of research that is ineligible    for NIH funding as set forth in Section III of these Guidelines; and   h. The    Principal Investigator's written consent to the disclosure of all material submitted    under Paragraph A.1 of this Section, as necessary to carry out the public review    and other oversight procedures set forth in Section IV of these Guidelines.       2. Conditions for the Utilization of Human Pluripotent Stem Cells Derived From    Human Embryos    Studies utilizing pluripotent stem cells derived from human embryos    may be conducted using NIH funds only if the cells were derived (without Federal    funds) from human embryos that were created for the purposes of fertility treatment    and were in excess of the clinical need of the individuals seeking such treatment.       a. To ensure that the donation of human embryos in excess of the clinical need    is voluntary, no inducements, monetary or otherwise, should have been offered    for the donation of human embryos for research purposes. Fertility clinics and/or    their affiliated laboratories should have implemented specific written policies    and practices to ensure that no such inducements are made available.    b. There    should have been a clear separation between the decision to create embryos for    fertility treatment and the decision to donate human embryos in excess of clinical    need for research purposes to derive pluripotent stem cells. Decisions related    to the creation of embryos for fertility treatment should have been made free    from the influence of researchers or investigators proposing to derive or utilize    human pluripotent stem cells in research. To this end, the attending physician    responsible for the fertility treatment and the researcher or investigator deriving    and/or proposing to utilize human pluripotent stem cells should not have been    one and the same person.    c. To ensure that human embryos donated for research    were in excess of the clinical need of the individuals seeking fertility treatment    and to allow potential donors time between the creation of the embryos for fertility    treatment and the decision to donate for research purposes, only frozen human    embryos should have been used to derive human pluripotent stem cells. In addition,    individuals undergoing fertility treatment should have been approached about    consent for donation of human embryos to derive pluripotent stem cells only    at the time of deciding the disposition of embryos in excess of the clinical    need.    d. Donation of human embryos should have been made without any restriction    or direction regarding the individual(s) who may be the recipients of transplantation    of the cells derived from the embryo.    e. Informed Consent Informed consent should    have been obtained from individuals who have sought fertility treatment and    who elect to donate human embryos in excess of clinical need for human pluripotent    stem cell research purposes. The informed consent process should have included    discussion of the following information with potential donors, pertinent to    making the decision whether or not to donate their embryos for research purposes.      Informed consent should have included:    (i) A statement that the embryos will    be used to derive human pluripotent stem cells for research that may include    human transplantation research;    (ii) A statement that the donation is made without    any restriction or direction regarding the individual(s) who may be the recipient(s)    of transplantation of the cells derived from the embryo;    (iii) A statement as    to whether or not information that could identify the donors of the embryos,    directly or through identifiers linked to the donors, will be removed prior    to the derivation or the use of human pluripotent stem cells;    (iv) A statement    that derived cells and/or cell lines may be kept for many years;    (v) Disclosure    of the possibility that the results of research on the human pluripotent stem    cells may have commercial potential, and a statement that the donor will not    receive financial or any other benefits from any such future commercial development;      (vi) A statement that the research is not intended to provide direct medical    benefit to the donor; and    (vii) A statement that embryos donated will not be    transferred to a woman's uterus and will not survive the human pluripotent stem    cell derivation process.    f. Derivation protocols should have been approved by    an IRB established in accord with 45 CFR  46.107 and  46.108 or FDA regulations    at 21 CFR  56.107 and  56.108.    B. Utilization of Human Pluripotent Stem Cells  Derived From Human Fetal Tissue     1. Submission to NIH    Intramural or extramural    investigators who are intending to use existing funds, are requesting an administrative    supplement, or are applying for new NIH funding for research using human pluripotent    stem cells derived from fetal tissue must submit to NIH the following:     a. An    assurance signed by the responsible institutional official that the pluripotent    stem cells were derived from human fetal tissue in accordance with the conditions    set forth in Section II.B.2 of these Guidelines and that the institution will    maintain documentation in support of the assurance;    b. A sample informed consent    document (with patient identifier information removed) and a description of    the informed consent process that meet the criteria for informed consent set    forth in Section II.B.2.b of these Guidelines;    c. An abstract of the scientific    protocol used to derive human pluripotent stem cells from fetal tissue;    d. Documentation    of IRB approval of the derivation protocol;    e. An assurance that the stem cells    to be used in the research were or will be obtained through a donation or through    a payment that does not exceed the reasonable costs associated with the transportation,    processing, preservation, quality control and storage of the stem cells;    f.  The title of the research proposal or specific subproject that proposes the    use of human pluripotent stem cells;   g. An assurance that the proposed research    using human pluripotent stem cells is not a class of research that is ineligible    for NIH funding as set forth in Section III of these Guidelines; and    h. The    Principal Investigator's written consent to the disclosure of all material submitted    under Paragraph B.1 of this Section, as necessary to carry out the public review    and other oversight procedures set forth in Section IV of these Guidelines.       2. Conditions for the Utilization of Human Pluripotent Stem Cells Derived From    Fetal Tissue     a. Unlike pluripotent stem cells derived from human embryos, DHHS    funds may be used to support research to derive pluripotent stem cells from    fetal tissue, as well as for research utilizing such cells. Such research is    governed by Federal statutory restrictions regarding fetal tissue research at     42 U.S.C.  289g-2(a)  and the Federal regulations at  45 CFR  46.210 . In addition,    because cells derived from fetal tissue at the early stages of investigation    may, at a later date, be used in human fetal tissue transplantation research,    it is the policy of NIH to require that all NIH-funded research involving the    derivation or utilization of pluripotent stem cells from human fetal tissue    also comply with the fetal tissue transplantation research statute at  42 U.S.C.     289g-1  and with  42 U.S.C.  289g-2(b) .    b. Informed Consent    As a policy matter,    NIH-funded research deriving or utilizing human pluripotent stem cells from    fetal tissue should comply with the informed consent law applicable to fetal    tissue transplantation research (42 U.S.C.  289g-1) and the following conditions.    The informed consent process should have included discussion of the following    information with potential donors, pertinent to making the decision whether    to donate fetal tissue for research purposes.    Informed consent should have included:       (i) A statement that fetal tissue will be used to derive human pluripotent stem    cells for research that may include human transplantation research;    (ii) A statement    that the donation is made without any restriction or direction regarding the    individual(s) who may be the recipient(s) of transplantation of the cells derived    from the fetal tissue;    (iii) A statement as to whether or not information that    could identify the donors of the fetal tissue, directly or through identifiers    linked to the donors, will be removed prior to the derivation or the use of    human pluripotent stem cells;    (iv) A statement that derived cells and/or cell    lines may be kept for many years;    (v) Disclosure of the possibility that the    results of research on the human pluripotent stem cells may have commercial    potential, and a statement that the donor will not receive financial or any    other benefits from any such future commercial development; and    (vi) A statement    that the research is not intended to provide direct medical benefit to the donor.         c. Derivation protocols should have been approved by an IRB established in accord    with 45 CFR  46.107 and  46.108 or FDA regulations at 21 CFR  56.107 and     56.108      III. Areas of Research Involving Human Pluripotent Stem Cells that    are Ineligible for NIH Funding     Areas of research ineligible for NIH funding    include:     A. The derivation of pluripotent stem cells from human embryos;    B.  Research in which human pluripotent stem cells are utilized to create or contribute    to a human embryo;    C. Research utilizing pluripotent stem cells that were derived    from human embryos created for research purposes, rather than for fertility    treatment;    D. Research in which human pluripotent stem cells are derived using    somatic cell nuclear transfer, i.e., the transfer of a human somatic cell nucleus    into a human or animal egg;    E. Research utilizing human pluripotent stem cells    that were derived using somatic cell nuclear transfer, i.e., the transfer of    a human somatic cell nucleus into a human or animal egg;    F. Research in which    human pluripotent stem cells are combined with an animal embryo; and    G. Research    in which human pluripotent stem cells are used in combination with somatic cell    nuclear transfer for the purposes of reproductive cloning of a human.       IV. Oversight        A. The NIH Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Review Group (HPSCRG) will review documentation    of compliance with the Guidelines for funding requests that propose the use    of human pluripotent stem cells. This working group will hold public meetings    when a funding request proposes the use of a line of human pluripotent stem    cells that has not been previously reviewed and approved by the HPSCRG.    B. In    the case of new or competing continuation (renewal) or competing supplement    applications, all documentation of compliance with the Guidelines will be reviewed    by HPSCRG and all applications will be reviewed for scientific merit by a Scientific    Review Group. In the case of requests to use existing funds or applications    for an administrative supplement or in the case of intramural proposals, Institute    or Center staff should forward material to the HPSCRG for review and determination    of compliance with the Guidelines prior to allowing the research to proceed.      C. The NIH will compile a yearly report that will include the number of applications    and proposals reviewed and the titles of all awarded applications, supplements    or administrative approvals for the use of existing funds, and intramural projects.

At the same time, reports of previously unknown and unexpected                multipotent or stem cells in various tissues of children and adults                has produced enormous interest also in so-called adult stem cells,                with similar promise, and to be frank, also more than a little hype.                              By almost all accounts we stand today in the infancy, not to say                embryonic, stage of these researches, and it is surely too early                to answer the questions that the layman wants answered.  How soon,                for which of our diseases, from what sort of cells, at what cost,                and at what risk will the cure be available?                  Yet it is not too early to learn where we are in fact in this                rapidly growing field, to try to separate fact from fiction, true                promise from hype.  And to do this we have gone to the experts,                commissioning review essays, essays that would review for us the                published literature over the past two years since the August 2001                decision, covering work in five areas according to the origin of                the cells.  ""Human Embryonic Stem Cells,"" a paper by Tenneille                Ludwig and James Thomson, ""Human Embryonic Germinal Cells,""                a paper from John Gearhart, a paper on cloned embryonic stem cells,                a paper by Rudolph Jaenisch, a review of the adult stem cell research,                a paper from David Prentice, and an update on the work with her                own multipotent adult progenitor cells from Catherine Verfaillie.                 The papers have been sent out with the briefing books, and I assume                that they've been read.  We are thinking about another paper                on mesenchymal stem cells.                  We're very fortunate and grateful to have with us this afternoon                three of the authors, Dr. John Gearhart, Dr. Rudolph Jaenisch, and                Dr. David Prentice, who will, in brief presentations, highlight                their own papers, after which we will have questions and discussion.                               I would remind Council members that the purpose of this session                is wholly scientific.  We want to learn as much as we can about                the current and projected state of this research.  This isn't                the time for ongoing ethical arguments about the moral status of                the embryo, the research imperative, or equal access for the current                funding policy, important though these issues are.  And I will simply                say I'll use the authority of the Chair to see to it that we                try to stay on the topic.                 Dr. Gearhart has kindly agreed, by the way, to field questions                pertinent to the review essay submitted by Drs. Ludwig and Thomson.                 Gentlemen, welcome to you all.  Thank you for your papers, your                presence, and in advance for your presentation and participation.                 And we will proceed in alphabetical order with John Gearhart first.                               DR. GEARHART:   Well, I can't say I'm delighted                to be back, but I'm happy to be back.  And to not really dwell                on the research that's going on specifically in our laboratory,                but to give you a bit of a general overview of where the work is                in this field, and I think there will be ample opportunity from                some of the things that I say that you can ask questions about it.                              I think the first question, and judging from some of the morning                topics, that I would like to address is the one before you now,                which is, why study these cells?  And what we have heard most frequently                are the issues, well, this is going to be the most versatile source                of cells for promised cell-based interventions for various therapies.                               But I came at this at a different angle.  I am an embryologist                by training.  I've been a student of human embryology for 28                years.  And I'm extremely interested in knowing how we are put                together.  What are the events, what are the mechanisms that lead                to the formation of the human being?                And over time, as you can imagine, we've studied fruit flies,                we've studied mice, we've studied rhesus monkeys.  And I                think one of the major, and perhaps the most important bit of information                that we're going to get out of embryonic stem cells are going                to be the issue of how we are formed.  And this is going to involve                cell biology, genetics, on and on and on.  But this is what is going                to enable us.  And I think with this information, which at the moment                is under the heading of Fundamental Science, or Fundamental Discovery                in Basic Science, this, I think, is going to be the lasting contribution                of studies from embryonic stem cells.                 They're going to have applications, obviously, with that information,                and the sources of cells.  And we're going to apply those to                birth defects.  We're going to apply it to injuries and disease,                because many of the processes are similar.  And we're going                to be able to draw on that information in trying to correct diseases                and injuries.                 True, I think out of this we're going to get sources of cells                which, in the short term, are going to be used directly for the                cell-based interventions.  And I think through the use of these                cells, we're going to discover other important things about                these cells, and some in our research we've learned, which we                can apply in therapies.                 But I want to emphasize one point, and this is my belief, that                this period of time that we're going through in studying embryonic                stem cells is going to be transient.  And I want to emphasize that                I believe it's the information we're going to get out of                these cells that are going to be used in the longer term to restore                function, to regenerate tissues within the bodies of patients, without                the use of these cells.  And that to me, as I look downstream, is                going to be the most important outcome of this research.                 Now I realize that this quote is taken out of context for these                essays that were written, and what was being questioned here.  But                I want to make some comments which are important when we consider                the use of human embryonic stem cells directly.  And that is, we                are finding enormous differences between mouse embryonic stem cells                and human embryonic stem cells, not only in practical issues within                the laboratory from the standpoint of cell cycle times, et cetera,                but also, as we begin to differentiate these cells in a dish, we                find some very subtle and some very not so subtle differences between                the mouse cells and the human cells to get us to the differentiated                functional tissue that we need.                 So I do believe it's time that we work directly on the human                embryonic stem cells if we want to gain this information on embryogenesis,                and if we want to move forward with developing cell-based interventions.                              So, the sources that we're going to talk about in general                deal with this very early stage here derived from the IVF-donated                embryos, and from tissues collected within the early stage of fetal                development, the germ cells.  These cells have many things in common,                and we've published on this.  You've seen this, probably.                 And so we look at them as a group.                  There's a third member of this group, which is embryonal carcinoma                cell, depicted here on the right, which has very similar properties                to these two other cell types.  In fact, it's the only cell                type from which any cell has been derived that's being used                in a pre-clinical trial.  And this is on stroke patients at the                University of Pittsburgh.                 I want to spend time now, or my brief time, on three slides to                give you an indication of where the human work is on this class                of cells.  What are the questions that are being asked, where are                we on some of this stuff, et cetera?                So here now are issues around human embryonic stem cells, or embryonic                germ cells.  One of the first questions that's being asked about                the stem cell itself is what is meant by ""stemness""?                 And obviously this, at the molecular level, gets us into genomics,                proteomics.  And so there is a major effort around the world at                trying to determine the genetic basis of a stem cell.  And the human                cells are being used extensively for this purpose.  How many genes                are involved, what genes are involved, what signaling pathways,                on and on and on.  So stemness is an important issue within this                research.                 Now, it's a comparative thing.  We can do it also with mouse                cells.  We can do it with adult cells as well, trying to find commonality.                 What is it that makes a cell a stem cell?  That information will                be vital, I believe, in the future, in converting virtually any                cell to a stem cell, if we want to go that route.                 The second major issue currently are characterizations of existing                lines.  As you may know, there's no standardization within the                field as to what constitutes a human embryonic stem cell.  We talk                about developmental potential.  We talk about molecular markers,                biochemical/antigenic markers, this is now being taken up by an                international committee under the auspices of the MRC in London                to try to get an agreement on these issues from stem cells around                the world, human embryonic stem cells around the world.                 There's also the issue now of whether or not we should be                deriving new stem cell lines.  And in many countries, this is indeed                happening.  There are a number of new cell lines coming online.                 And what is the importance of this?  Now, many of you have heard                at least from what the Europeans refer to as the presidential cell                lines, those that are eligible for funding in this country.  Should                we have cells that are only grown on human feeder layers?  Most                of the cell lines that have been derived are on mouse feeder layers,                and there is a concern about infectious agents passing into the                human cells.                  I think there's a misconception out there that these lines                will be ineligible for any kind of therapeutic use.  I think the                FDA has made it very clear that they're certainly willing to                consider those grown on mouse feeder layers if they meet certain                criteria to also be eligible for use in the clinic.                  But there are a number of lines now that have been derived on                human feeder layers, and there are lines being derived that are                feeder layer independent, which means it makes it much easier to                work with in the laboratory.  You don't have to worry about                these other cells that are present in your cultures.                  And there's an attempt now being made to derive these lines                in defined media, which means there are no other animal products,                no serum, that you can control very carefully the differentiation                of these cells by adding specific growth factors in a sequential                fashion.                 The most important element to this, though, is this top line here.                 Many of you may not realize it, but when we say that routinely three                or four different mouse embryonic stem cell lines have been used                for the last 20-some years, what's the problem here, why can't                we use just a few of the human.  Those lines have been selected                from a hundred and some cell lines that were made as to being the                best cell lines to use for those purposes.  And so I think we're                still in this phase of trying to determine what are really the good                cell lines, human embryonic stem cell lines that are available.                 And thus the issue of generating more.                 For the use of these lines, emphasis in the lab now is in the                following area.  We're trying to work up high-efficiency differentiation                protocols that result in homogenous cell populations of functional                cell types.  That is, can we in the laboratory come up with protocols,                growth conditions, that are going to get us 10 million dopaminergic                neurons, and only dopaminergic neurons?  Most of the protocols we                have now result in a mixture of cell types within a dish, and we                go in and select out the ones we want.                 So there's concern about the heterogeneity of the cells, and                the fact that we can't at this point have a high efficiency                in getting the cell types we need.  We manipulate the growth environments,                and we manipulate the cells genetically to accomplish this goal.                              Once we differentiate these cells, and we've had some success                in certain pathways which we can talk about, we are very concerned                about what we refer to as the authenticity of the derived cells.                 That is, is the dopaminergic neuron you've formed, the insulin-producing                cell you've formed, the cholinergic neuron, the cardiac muscle,                are these actually functional cells that are the equivalent of those                that you normally find in the adult?                  So a great deal of effort, both in the dish,  in vitro ,                is being made in different parameters to measure whether or not                these are authentic cells.  There are many protocols, as you can                imagine, that lead to cells that look like something, but they're                not functional.  And this is a major concern.  The other side of                this is, the golden test is can you transplant these cells into                an animal model of some kind and see that they assume the function                that you're hoping that they would.                  But again, these are human cells going into rodents, primarily.                 Do we have every reason to believe that they're going to function                appropriately?  We don't know that yet.  We're also putting                cells into non-human primates to get that kind of a measure as well.                              We are in the laboratory contrasting and comparing among various                sources of stem cells.  In our laboratory, we work on human ES,                human EG, umbilical cord blood, et cetera.  And the importance of                this is that you are able to compare and contrast in the same paradigms                the sources of these cells to see which ones are going to be appropriate                for which tasks.  And I think this is extremely important.                 We're also very concerned, as you know, if these cells are                going to be continuously grown in the laboratory, there's a                finite possibility that you're going to get genetic mutations.                 We're interested in the frequencies of this, and the types of                the mutations that occur in these cells.  It's a safety issue.                 But with our genomic and proteomic studies, we can get a good handle                on this at this point in time.                 When we get into the grafting issues, which is obviously a desirable                endpoint, both in the basic science side, to say you have a functional                cell, and then transitioning into any use of these cells in cell-based                therapy, we have a number of issues here.                 The first, and I think you have to realize this.  There is virtually                no appropriate animal model for any human condition.  That's                the fact.  We approximate it.  We do the best we can.  But under                those limitations, we do the best we can.  And you have to be aware                of this.  There's a concern about what animal models you're                using for what test.                 The issue of what stage of cell differentiation in any of these                cells do you use for a specific graft?  We are finding that many                things within the central nervous system, you want to use something                that is fairly undifferentiated so that the cells can interestingly                migrate to where they're supposed to go, set up the appropriate                connectivity.  And so if you are working with a motor neuron, you'd                like to use a motor neuron precursor.  If you put in a fully differentiated                motor neuron, nothing works.  I mean, when you think about the nervous                system, it's not surprising.                 With insulin-producing cells, we find that you want the terminal                cell, at least in the experiments that we are doing.  But for each                of the cell types you're working with, we've got to determine                this, as well as how do you want to deliver it to those animal models.                              The last two are extremely important.  What are the fates of these                cells that you've grown in a dish, selected for in a dish, once                you graft it into an animal paradigm?  We know these cells like                to migrate.  Do they differentiate appropriately?  Do they form                tumors?  I remember a few years ago when I was all puffed up that                our cells were working so wonderfully, and I went to the FDA for                this meeting I thought was going to be one-on-one with members of                that group.  And it turned out that there were 40 of them and one                of me.  All their questions were about safety issues.  We now spend                as much time on these safety issues as we do at looking at differentiations                of these cells in a dish.                  Why?  Well, what have we found?  Indeed, in the early mouse work                with embryonic stem cells the rates of tumors were extremely high.                 Formation of teratocarcinomas, mixed germ cell tumors.  We have                at this point, though, grafted well over 3,000 animals with our                human cells, and we haven't seen a tumor yet.  And maybe we're                just lucky, maybe there's a difference between mouse and human                cells.  We don't know that.                  But these experiments are extremely expensive because you've                got to serial section through the whole central nervous system if                you're putting cells in there.  You're putting them in IP,                et cetera.  It's a lot of work.  The FDA, ideally, would like                to know if you're putting 300,000 cells into an animal, they                want to know where all 300,000 cells went.  This has gotten us into                extremely expensive experiments in labeling cells, developing labels                for cells that you could follow for a year or more later.  You could                go back and find those cells.  So we've employed radiologists,                and chemists, et cetera, to help us with these kinds of things.                 So it is a major issue.  And in all of our experiments, we look                at this.                 The last issue, on immune response graft rejection, is obviously                to some extent the Achilles' heel of this work.  If we can't                provide tissue that's going to be accepted in a graft, then                all this work has gone for naught.  So there are issues of active                experiments now going on in tolerance, in genetic alterations of                cells, the consideration of cell banks, how many different stem                cell lines would you need to cover certain populations of people,                and something you'll hear about probably from Rudy on nuclear                and cell reprogramming, so-called therapeutic cloning.  Is this                one of the avenues that we can approach?  So all of these are very                active research elements going on with respect to the human embryonic                germ cells and stem cells.  We can't divorce them.                 Now, in this cartoon, what I've depicted here is one of the                more difficult scientific aspects of the research.  And that is                that you have in a dish — now this is a bit of a repeat, but it's                important to mention — you have in a dish these cells that are capable                of forming any cell type that's present in the body.  The major                problem here is how do you get them only to form hepatocytes, dopaminergic                neurons, heart muscle, blood cells, pancreatic islet cells, solely.                 How do you do that?  This is where the real issues are within the                laboratory.                  And we try to recapitulate, as I showed you this before — oh,                and finally, the issue of — I put this little thing down here to                remind me.  Some of you have seen this report earlier this year                from Hans Schuler's lab at Penn, that he's been able to                find oocytes within embryonic stem cells derived from the mouse.                 Now, he did not — now keep this in mind, he did not purposefully                differentiate these cells into oocytes.  He came up with a neat                little trick of identifying them once they were present in the plate.                 Okay, so it's not that he's worked up a condition to differentiate                them only to oocytes, it's that they're there.  You can                use that technology to pull the cells out, and then further try                to mature them, see if they are actually functional oocytes, et                cetera.                 So we rely in the lab on trying to recapitulate what has occurred                to some extent in the embryo by providing growth factors that these                cells normally see to get them to enhance, or try to direct their                differentiation into the product that we want.                 We use selection techniques in the laboratory after getting these                mixtures of cell types by different avenues in the dish.  We then                come back using genetically selected markers, different growth media,                cell sorting, which is a fancy way of sending cells through a beam                of light, and if they have a certain antigen on the surface, you                tag it in a way that will put them into different pots.  And this                works fairly effectively for a number of cell types.  But it's                highly inefficient, and we've got to improve this technology.                              So what have we done?  What have we been able to do?  We've                been able to identify many, many different cell types in a dish.                 We've been able to expand many different cell types, whether                they're insulin-producing cells, dopaminergic neurons, heart                muscle cells, smooth muscle cells, hepatocytes, we're able to                do that.  Human.  And we've been able, in many cases, to show                that they are functional within the parameters that we like.  And                in a few cases we've studied extensively we've been able                to graft them into animal models to show that they will work, and                can ameliorate a condition in the animal, whether it's, to some                degree, whether it's a diabetic animal, or one with motor neuron                loss, mouse models of Parkinson's disease, we can do that at                this point.                 To reiterate, we are concerned about safety issues.  They go hand                in hand with all that we do in the laboratory.  It adds, again,                expense and time, but we want to make sure we get it right.                 Here's another issue of safety.  We find that in many of these                cell lines, if you're not careful — now human embryonic stem                cells are much more difficult to grow in the laboratory than mouse,                and if you're not careful, this can overwhelm your cultures                very quickly.  This is an example of a tetrasomy 12p, and also of                a trisomy 17, which appear to be fairly common coming out of the                human cell lines for whatever reason.  We don't know.   But                you have to constantly monitor these cell lines to make sure that                they are remaining normal as far as the karyotype is concerned.                 Not an unusual circumstance.                 Rudy, I'm sure, will deal with this.  But we got highly involved                with the issue of somatic cell nuclear transfer, mainly coming in                from the desire to have matched tissue for a patient.  But I want                to point out two other issues here that I think, in my way of thinking,                are perhaps more important.  Rudy will probably disagree.                 Number two on this list, to increase the diversity of stem cell                lines.  Number three, to facilitate the study of inherited genetic                diseases and somatic mutations.  Now, there's been a lot of                talk about, with the justice issues, of diversity of cell lines.                 We now know how many cell lines we need to cover the population                of the United States.  How are we going to get these lines?  We're                not going to get them, if we wanted them, by going out and matching                up people to get embryos, okay, or even assaying embryos in banks.                 The easiest way to do it is you identify a person that has the haplotypes                of class I and class II genes, and take a nucleus out of their cell.                 And generate stem cells through somatic cell nuclear transfer.                 No question about it, easiest fast way of doing it.                 The issue of the studying of inherited genetic mutations and somatic                mutations.  It means that we can take cells from a patient with                a disease, some of them not expressing very much from the standpoint                of the pathogenesis of the disease, to others that are full-blown,                to try to figure out why some patients have one form of the disease,                another has the mild form of the disease.  We can take this directly,                and generate stem cells for those studies.  Somatic mutations, breast                cancer mutations.  We can generate cell lines — it's the only                way we can do it — through somatic cell nuclear transfer.                 And then the issue of being able to determine mechanisms of nuclear                reprogramming.  We would hope that they would approach normalcy                from the standpoint that we may be able to use that information                to convert somatic cells into stem cells at some point downstream.                 This is why I think somatic cell nuclear transfer into a human are                reasons that are quite important.                 Well, I think with the issue of the human embryonic stem cells,                I think they have uniqueness in certain areas, and I think that                what we're going to learn out of these studies is going to be                extremely important in the future, not only for deriving cell-based                therapies, but in getting information that we're going to be                able to begin to instruct our own genes.                 And this is something which hasn't been paid a lot of attention,                but I think even within this Council, it may be a good idea, that                we're on the verge, I believe, of being able to instruct our                own cells.  And I think the ramifications of this are enormous.                 I mean, talk about enhancement.  One could go on the Internet and                get a kit for enhancing any part of your body to a certain degree.                 And this is all going to be done, I think, from information that                we get out of learning about cell differentiation, how these cells                function.  So I think we've got to keep our eye on this for                the future as well.                 Just in closing, the greatest impetus that I can think of for                making advancement in this field is funding through the National                Institutes of Health.  This is the only information that I could                get my hands on.  It's available.  It's for the fiscal year                2002.  You see how much money is being spent on stem cell research                in toto, how much on human adult stem cell research, how much on                animal adult.  And up to this point, $11 million.  On the human                embryonic stem cell research, I think this year it's going to                be more, and we would hope in the future, as the bottleneck for                cell lines and more applications come in to the NIH, that these                numbers will become robust.                  And I think this will be the key to the dreams that we have, anyway,                of learning more about how humans are built, and cell differentiation                of human cells on their way to therapy.  So I hope I've given                you enough to think about.  Thanks.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you very much.  Why don't we                simply proceed in order.  Dr. Jaenisch.                  DR. JAENISCH:   Well, thank you very much for inviting me                here.  And I will right away get to the cont roversy. I'm not                going to agree with much you said.                 So I want to try to develop two arguments.  One is reproductive                cloning faces principle biological problems that may not be solvable                for the foreseeable future.  And the other one is therapeutic cloning                poses no principle biological obstacles, only technical problems.                 And this, I think, in my opinion has implications for the status                of the fertilized and the cloned embryo.                 So you need one piece of data.  When we do nuclear transfer, then                it's clear that the donor cell, the donor matters.  So if we                use a somatic donor nucleus, cumulus cells, fibroblasts, Sertoli                cells, the result to get cloned adults is really low, a few percent.                 If you use B or T cells, or neurons, it is very low.  Only with                tricks we were able to get animals.  However, when one uses embryonic                stem cells as donors, it's an order of magnitude more efficient.                 So the conclusion is an embryonic cell is easier to reprogram to                support life than a somatic one.  I will come back to this later                when I make an argument.                 So, let me first come to cloned animals.  If you have an animal                born, if you looked at this carefully, you find that approximately                four to five percent of all genes, as done in percentile, are not                correctly expressed.  Still, the animal develops to birth.  If you                look at imprinted genes, it's even worse.  Thirty to fifty percent                are not correctly expressed, regardless what the donor cell nucleus                is.  So from this we would argue that it's amazing that these                defective embryos can develop to birth and beyond.  But you pay                for that.  You pay with abnormalities.                  So my argument would be, and I will develop this more, that there                may be no normal clones.  Of course, we have the problem to define                what we mean with ""normal"".   But let me then say that                faulty reprogramming seems to me is a biological barrier that may                preclude the generation of normal cloned individuals, at least for                the foreseeable future.                 Let me come to therapeutic cloning.  So, as we heard, cloning                would involve taking from a patient a somatic nucleus and derive                an isogenic embryonic stem cell by nuclear transfer.  This could                be used, then, to correct the genetic defect if it was present.                 One has to differentiate these cells  in vitro , and then transplant                it back into the individual and see whether it could improve the                condition.                 So we have made such an experiment.  I just want to briefly outline                the steps we went through.  As a patient we used a mouse, which                was totally immune-incompetent.  Due to the Rag2 defect, it did                not have any B and T cells.  So that was our patient.                 From this, skin cells were removed from this animal.  They were                transferred.  A blastocyst was derived.  And from this blastocyst,                an embryonic stem cell, which of course is mutant, as the donor.                 And then we used just simple homologous recombination to repair                one or two alleles to make a functional Rag2 gene, and then differentiate                these cells which had problems into hematopoietic stem cells, put                them back into the animal, and the result was that these cells could                colonize the embryo and repair, in part, the defect.                  So some have argued that this experiment really didn't work.                 It really only showed that when you have — I think Dr. Prentice                argued that it only showed that one has to use a cloned newborn                as a source.  And this, of course, is not therapeutic cloning.                 I think that is a misrepresentation of those data.                 I would argue that from this experiment we know that somatic nuclear                transfer and therapeutic cloning will work because it has worked                in the mouse.  So only technical, not principle, barriers exist                to adapt it to human use, although these technical ones may be daunting.                 Technical, in contrast to principle ones, which we see in reproductive                cloning.                 So, if I look at the two ways we can think about cell therapy,                then we have the nuclear cloning approach as I just outlined, which                in the mouse we know works, at least for hematopoietic cells, and                I believe will work for other cells.  The alternative is somatic                adult stem cells.  We'll hear later from this.                 And I believe here there are many, many question marks.  It is                a very young field, very interesting, but we really don't understand                how to really handle these stem cells, how to propagate those.                 And there's really, with the exception of bone marrow stem cells,                not really any proof of therapeutic potential at this point.  So                I think we need much more to learn here, but this we know will work.                              So I want to come to really two key questions.  One is can reproductive                cloning be made as safe as  in vitro  fertilization?  And the                other one: Does faulty reprogramming after nuclear transfer, does                it pose a problem for the therapeutic application of this technology?                 I think these are the key questions in my mind.                 So, can reproductive cloning be made safe?  I believe in addition                to the technical problems, which are solvable, there are serious                biological barriers.  And the main one is this one.  The two parental                genomes in all of our cells are differentially modified depending                on where the genome came through the egg or through the sperm.                 They're epigenetically distinct in the adult.  If you want to                recreate that situation, you would have to physically separate the                two genomes and treat them independently in an oocyte- or sperm-specific                way.                 So let me point that out in this very complicated-appearing diagram,                but it's very simple.  So let me just go through briefly what's                happening during normal fertilization.  In normal fertilization,                the egg genome and the oocyte genome are combined.  And they are                differentially modified during gametogenesis.  And this is what                these lollipops here show.  So they're different in the zygote.                 But now something very curious happens.  Within hours of fertilization,                the sperm genome is stripped of all methylation.  The oocyte is                resistant to this not-well-understood demethylation activity because                the oocyte genome has been, of course, together with this activity                throughout oogenesis.                 So then cleavage proceeds.  And the point I'm making now is                that the cells of the genomes in the adult are different, different                because of their history.  It's not only for imprinted genes,                but also for non-imprinted genes.  Now what happens in cloning?                 In cloning, one removes, of course, the egg nucleus and replaces                it now with one of the somatic nuclei.                  Now, both of these genomes are now exposed to the egg cytoplasm.                 So both become really — they're in identical chromatin state.                 So they'll be both modified, and the difference will be equalized.                 So the difference you see in a normal adult cell will be equalized,                tends to be equalized in cloning.  I think that is a problem among                those which we call epigenetic problems.                 So in order to solve that, I think one would have to separate                the two genomes physically and treat one in an egg-specific appropriate                manner, and the other one in a sperm-specific manner.  I think if                we could do that, then I think we would have a way to solve that                problem.                 So the phenotypes of clones, I would argue, is a continuum without                defined stages.  So we know the most important stages are implantation                and birth, and indeed, most clones are lost at implantation, and                then at birth again many are lost.  You end up with very few which                develop to late age.  And we know from most experiments, even animals                which are one year of age, 80 percent of those die very early with                major problems.  These experiments could only be done so far in                the mouse because the mouse is the only organism we have old cloned                animals.                 So I think the problem here is, yes, you might get — because our                criteria are not very good here — you might get quasi-normal or                maybe a normal individual with a certain frequency.  It's very                difficult in animals to test, really, because our tests are limited.                 But we cannot predict ever at any of these stages who will be among                those outliers, and who will not be.  There's no way to select                good healthy from non-healthy clones.  I think that's very important                to emphasize.  There's no way we can think of to do that.  So                there's no predictability whatsoever.  So from my point of view,                this doesn't matter, really, whether one or two percent of potentially                normal animals which survive for a long time.  You can't predict                who this will be.                 So, therapeutic cloning.  So, as I said, cloned animals are abnormal                due to faulty reprogramming.  Why is normalcy of differentiated                cells derived from ES cells not affected by this problem?  There                are two reasons.  One is that we don't involve a generation                of a fetus.  And the other one is that the embryonic stem cells                lose what I'm going to call epigenetic memory of the nucleus                they came from.  So let me develop these two ideas.                 So first, it's simple.  In contrast to reproductive cloning,                there's no embryogenesis required to derive functional cells                 in vitro .  So it's totally irrelevant, for example, whether                imprinted genes are reprogrammed or not.  Imprinted genes have a                function only during fetal development, not in the adult.  So it                doesn't matter.  There is one or two exceptions, and those would                have to look at.                 Very importantly is the cells themselves select themselves  in                vitro  for the cell type you are selecting for.  There's                no selection possible  in vivo  after implantation in a cloned                animal.  And then we know that cloned ES cells form normal chimeras,                as do any other ES cells.  So biologically there is no difference.                              Let me come to the memory question on this slide here.  So we                know we can make blastocysts from a zygote from a fertilized egg,                or by nuclear transfer from these various donor cells.  Now I would                argue the blastocyst remembers exactly where it came from.  And                we know that because we implant this blastocyst, derived from a                zygote, into the uterus, it will with a high efficiency develop                to birth, and will make a normal animal.                 If you derive - take a blastocyst derived from an ES cell, and                implant it, it will develop with a high efficiency to the newborn                stage, but it will make an abnormal animal.  If it came from a cumulus                cell, it would be very low efficiency - I showed you this on the                second slide - low efficiency to the newborn stage.  It will be                abnormal.  If the nucleus comes from B-, T-cells, or neurons, it                will be very low.  And it will be, of course, abnormal, if you get                it.                 So these blastocysts know exactly where they came from.  And we                know this, actually, when we look at gene expression patterns in                clones derived from ES cells, or from human cells, they're different.                 So they remember at birth where they came from.  That's why                cloning doesn't work.  That's why these cloned ones develop                abnormally, too, in the great majority.                 So what about ES cells?  In ES cells, it's a very different                thing.  I would argue you erase the epigenetic memory of your donor                nucleus.  And the argument is the following.  We know that if you                take such a blastocyst, the ES cells are derived from the inner                cell mast cells.  These inner cell mast cells express certain set                of genes, one of those called the Oct-4 gene, one of the key genes,                but another 70.  You put this blastocyst in culture.  All these                genes, all these cells array - silence, Oct-4.  This has been published.                 And they don't divide.  They sit there.                 But over the next days or week or so, some of these cells, one                or the other, begins to re-express Oct-4 and another set of 70 genes.                 And these are the cells which would proliferate.  And we call them                ES cells.  It's a total tissue culture artifact of those cells                which can survive under the harsh tissue culture conditions.  So                I would argue ES cells have no counterpart in the normal animal                model.  They are a real tissue culture artifact, although a very                useful one.                 Now the same occurs, of course, with these blastocysts.  The efficiency                is lower.  But once you go to the selection for the survivors, they're                exactly - I think in order to survive, they have to express the                set of 70 genes which we call the embryonic genes, which are important                for the early developmental stages.  So the point of this slide                is really that this selection process, which selects just for the                fastest growing cell, erases the memory to where the ES cell came                from.  And indeed, when you transplant these cells derived from                a B- or T-cell or from a neuron or from a zygote, they have identical                properties.  They form normal chimeras, and they  in vitro                 differentiate indistinguishably.                 I want to summarize this.  An ES cell derivation selects for survivors.                 And I would argue survival depends on an ES default epigenetic state                which needs these Oct-4 like genes being on.  Selection process                erases the epigenetic memory of the donor nucleus, and the cloned                and the fertilized cells form normal chimeras.  So the potential                of ES cells derived from an  in vitro  fertilized embryo and                from a cloned embryo is identical by all measures we can do.                 So I would conclude, then, it's unlikely, if not impossible,                to create a normal individual by nuclear cloning.  The problem of                reprogramming may not be solvable for the foreseeable future because                of these principle barriers, but ES cells derived from clone embryos                have the same potential for tissue repair as those from the fertilized                embryo.                  So I think one of the key concerns I can see of this committee                is that the derivation of embryonic stem cells by nuclear cloning                necessitates the destruction of potential human life.  I think that's                a major concern.  And if I just compare now, to my opinion, the                difference between a fertilized and a cloned embryo.  The fertilized                embryo is created by conception.  It's genetically unique.                 There's a high potential it will develop to a normal baby.                 The cloned embryo of course has no conception, no new genetic combination.                 It is really the product of a laboratory-assisted technique.  Sloppily,                we could say it's a laboratory artifact.  But most importantly,                it has little or no potential to ever develop to a normal baby.                              So I think the embryo, the cloned embryo, lacks essential qualities                of the normal embryo, which on this sort of maybe summarizing my                thoughts is on this slide where I think there are really three possible                fates for a cloned or for fertilized embryo.  We fertilize one of                these leftover embryos, hundreds of thousands in the clinics.  They                can be disposed of, they can be implanted to form a normal baby                with a high probability, or they can generate normal ES cells.                 The cloned embryo, three fates.  It can be disposed of.  It can                make normal ES cells, as I have argued, but it cannot make with                any acceptability efficiency a baby, not even a normal one.                 So if this is accepted, instead of disposing these leftover embryos                and use them for normal ES cells, which could be used for research,                as we heard.  This, of course, to my opinion generates an ethical                problem because you destroy potential human life.  I think this                - so if this is acceptable to some, I think it should be ethically                less problematic, because in this case I think you don't have                the potential to form, within acceptable possibility, a normal baby.                              So from the biological point of view, I think the derivation of                embryonic stem cells by nuclear cloning develops the structure of                an embryo that lacks the potential to develop into a normal being                with any acceptable efficiency or predictability.                  I was asked - and I want to close with my final slide, which really                follows what John said - what are the potential applications of                cloned embryonic stem cells derived from a cloned embryo.  I think                we talked about therapy.  Clearly, I don't have to dwell on                this.  I'm not sure whether this will be really generally available                technology.  It maybe too expensive.  I don't know.  And I don't                know how fast we could solve the technical problems of adapting                this to human medicine.                  However, I think this is the more important point, which I think                John emphasized.  I think it allows us to derive genetically identical                cells from patients with multigenic diseases, such as Parkinson's,                Alzheimer's, ALS, diabetes.  And we can now use this system                 in vitro  to validate the cellular defects of these complex                diseases.  So compare ES cells derived from a healthy individual                with those from such a patient.  I think there's enormous potential                here if we find a difference, to find out why that is so, and is                it a screen for potential therapeutics, just in the culture dish.                 And as John emphasized, such diseases cannot be studied in animal                models, because there are no animal models for those diseases.                 But you can really make those in the culture if you just use a cell                of the patients.                 So I think this is a very important, maybe the most important                driving issue, to my opinion, to use this technology.  Thank you.                               CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you very much.  Dr. Prentice. While                we're waiting, Dr. Jaenisch, would you mind just taking one                question of just factual information so that we don't lose a                lot of time.  This last point about the models for multigenetic                diseases.  If someone were to say the same kind of models might                be available through, for example, the multipotent progenitor cells                that Dr. Verfaillie has, where you could go into the patient and                get out progenitor cells.  You might not get all the tissues, but                if those cells could reliably be differentiated into islet cells,                couldn't you do the studies on the pathogenesis of - in other                words, couldn't one, if one had stable and reliable adult stem                cell populations, wouldn't you have the same access to the cells                from the multigenetic diseases?                  DR. JAENISCH:   Yes.  I think if this would work, if this                would efficiently work, I think absolutely I agree with you.  I                think the problem as I see it now is that, indeed, working with                adult stem cells is very difficult.  And the major problem is that                we lack the ability in most cases to, for example, propagate them                in the undifferentiated state.  For example, with bone marrow stem                cells, although they're known for 30 years, this has not been                accomplished.  They are very useful for therapeutic applications                because they select themselves in the patient, but not easily for                this type of research, what you want to do.                 So I think there might, at some point, if we learn that in this                young field, I agree with you.  Then I think these cells would,                if you could differentiate them to dopaminergic neurons in a way                that we can do for now from ES cells, as Ron McKay has shown, yes                I think that would be useful.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you.  Dr. Prentice, you're all                right?                  DR. PRENTICE:   Yes.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:  Good.                  DR. PRENTICE:  I think we're ready to roll.  Thank you,                Mr. Chairman.  I apologize for the delay up here.  I was fighting                off a fever from a respiratory virus, so I probably was in a time                warp.                 One of the main goals of stem cell research, as you're all                aware, is the idea of regenerative medicine with stem cells, the                idea that you might be able to take a stem cell from some source,                for example here from bone marrow, inject that into an area of damaged                tissue in the patient and regenerate or replace the damaged tissue.                               Now, the interesting, confusing thing about adult stem cells has                been that it defies what for years we have thought of as the normal                developmental paradigm, that as we develop from the blastocyst stage                here, that cells follow one of these main developmental trees.                 And as a cell would become more and more developed and more and                more differentiated, they would end up out here on the tip of a                branch and not be able to back away from that particular tip; not                be able to back down and take a separate branch, whether it were                a nearby branch or one of these main branches.                 A lot of evidence now suggests, however, that adult stem cells,                at least some of them, can actually move from branch to branch.                 Now exactly how they're doing that, the mechanism involved in                these types of differentiation or different branches of tissues,                is still unknown.                  There's several questions related to adult stem cells, and                in fact many of these have to do with the same questions related                to embryonic cells.  What is their actual identity?  How could you                identify a particular adult stem cell?  What is their actual tissue                source?  How do they form these other cell and tissue types?  Do                they form actual functional cell and tissue types, as we look at                these organs and tissues?  And what's the specific mechanism                of differentiation?                 They do seem to have some unique characteristics, such as a homing                phenomenon, where they tend to home in on damaged tissue.  And most                of the results that have been seen in terms of an adult stem cell                differentiating into another cell type or tissue type seem to be                tied primarily with injury to a tissue or organ.  Usually you do                not see these types of changes in the experiments taking place unless                there is some sort of damage.  The other thing would be what type                of cellular interactions and signalling within the target tissue                might trigger some of these differentiative events.                  Now, one way to try and identify a stem cell is with various markers,                and I discuss this at some length in the paper.  Typically what                people have tried to do is eliminate what are termed ""lineage                markers"" for particular blood cells.  Some people pick a particular                marker called CD34, which has been associated with bone marrow.                 But others tend to eschew that type of marker.  And I mentioned                other markers in the paper that might indicate that an adult cell                is a stem cell.  The CD133 marker, or the c-kit marker.                 Several people have begun to undertake studies of the gene expression                within adult stem cells, and compare them to embryonic cells to                see if there is a commonality in terms of all of the various genes                that might be expressed that identify a cell as a stem cell.  One                of the problems that's been faced, though, is that these markers                tend to change over time.  This has been seen in several studies                where actually a marker such as CD34, that might have been a chosen                marker to identify a stem cell, actually might not be expressed                at a later time with that cell.  And then expression of that gene                would re-occur, even within the same cell.                 So it may be difficult to actually identify one particular stem                cell based on some of these markers, simply because of changes in                gene expressions as the cells undergo changes in environment, as                they may undergo changes in their isolation conditions, and what                Theise and Krause simply have called the uncertainty principle,                equivalent to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.  You might at                one point be able to isolate a cell with a particular set of markers                or milieu of gene expression and say this is a stem cell, but then                as you would try to put it into different conditions, or isolate                it from different tissues, those particular markers might change,                or might be different.                  So it may actually be very difficult with adult stem cells to                particularly isolate a particular cell and say, yes, this is an                adult stem cell.  It may be more a matter of the particular context                of the cell: the tissue they're derived from, the isolation                conditions used, or the tissues that they're put back into that                may determine their functionality.                 In terms of differentiation mechanisms, cell fusion appears to                be one particular mechanism by which an adult stem cell may change                into another tissue type.  Now there were some  in vitro  experiments                done approximately a year and a half ago that indicated this possibility,                but the  in vitro  experiments were unable to verify whether                this was actually a particular mechanism that might be used by an                adult stem cell.  More recently, two papers have verified in mouse                systems that bone marrow stem cells, at least in these experiments,                did fuse with hepatocytes and take on that differentiated morphology                and function, even in terms of repairing liver damage.  So this                is obviously one possible mechanism with some experimental evidence.                              Another possibility might be that a cell would de-differentiate,                actually back down one of those branches and go up another branch.                 This would involve changes in gene expression to an earlier state,                or more primitive type of cell, and then re-expressing specific                genes particular to the tissue into which the cell was placed.                 Another possibility is what's termed ""trans-differentiation""                in which the cell apparently is not backing down a branch, but instead                simply changing its gene expression so that it now conforms to whatever                tissue or cell population that it's within.                  In terms of sources of adult stem cells, not just tissues, but                how did they get there?  How did an adult stem cell get into bone                marrow, or brain, or liver?  One theory is that some of these cells                may be leftover primitive stem cells, perhaps embryonic stem cells,                a few that are kept around, maintained in a state so that then they                can differentiate into various types of tissues.                  Another proposal is that there may be a universal stem cell, an                adult stem cell, not a primitive cell, but one more geared towards                maintenance and repair functions in the adult body.  It may arise                in one or more tissues, and then may disperse into other tissues.                               Other possibilities are that there are particular tissue stem                cells, multipotent, not able to perhaps form all tissues of the                adult body, but a limited subset, and that they would be resident                within a few of these tissues.                  And then I mentioned here transient stem cells, cells that are                just sort of passing through.  And there is the possibility that,                especially if we're looking at this idea of a universal stem                cell, or even a tissue stem cell that can migrate in some cases,                that it may end up passing through a tissue, so you will isolate                what appears to be a stem cell from a particular tissue.  But it                didn't arise there.  It just happened to be passing through                via the circulatory system.                 I might mention, too, that some of the other challenges for adult                stem cells are very similar to some of the challenges for embryonic                cells.  For example, standardization.  There essentially is no standardization                in terms of adult stem cell isolation, propagation, differentiation                into other tissues at this point.  Long term culture, with a few                exceptions, has not been attained.  Catherine Verfaillie's MAPC                cells from bone marrow do appear capable of long-term proliferation                in culture.  And there are a few other examples, very limited, that                I point out in the paper.  But being able to keep these cells growing                in culture for a long period of time has been difficult up to this                point.                 The idea of safety, of course, is always an issue when we're                going to be dealing with patients.  Do these cells form tumors?                 Do they differentiate abnormally so that you don't get the correct                differentiation in the place, in the time, in the tissue that you                need?  So all of these need to be faced.                 Now this idea of a potential universal or at least tissue stem                cell that can migrate primarily has been put forth by Helen Blau                of Stanford, the idea being that perhaps the cell is in the bone                marrow, but then can go into the circulation and then exit the circulation                into another tissue.  Again, most of the studies have seen this                type of phenomenon in response to an injury, not in response to                the normal physiological systems.                 How would we then define a stem cell, especially an adult stem                cell, if we have all of this problem with changeability of markers,                and lack of standardization?  Moore and Quesenberry have proposed                a couple of simple guidelines.  Now obviously, any stem cell has                the ability to continue to replicate and maintain a population of                cells.  And then in response to some signal, to differentiate into                one or more potential tissue types.                  An initial first cut at how to identify a stem cell in the adult                would be, can it take on a different morphology in a tissue in which                you place it?  Can it take on some of the differentiated cell markers                that you would see in that tissue?  Now this is a bare minimum,                and it doesn't really mean necessarily that the cell is functional,                that it can participate in tissue repair, or perhaps even that it                has truly differentiated into that specific cell type.                 Supplementing that, if you could demonstrate functional activity,                and actual integration into a tissue, this would be a much better                marker of a cell as a stem cell.  And certainly, if in an injury                situation, in animal model or even in human, you could demonstrate                a physiological improvement.  That would be a good indication that                you were seeing this sort of stem cell differentiation and repair.                              Now, the next set of slides, what I've tried to do is just                condense from that rather difficult mass to read of all of these                various tissue sources, and cell types that they can turn into,                and so on.  I won't spend a great deal of time on these.  I'll                just try and point out some particular points on each slide.                 With mesenchymal or stromal stem cells from the bone marrow, we                need to keep in mind that bone marrow is a mixed population.  We've                known about hematopoietic stem cells from bone marrow since the                1960s.  These are well-studied and used clinically.  The hematopoietic                stem cell is differentiating primarily, at least, into blood cells.                               Another stem cell that's in the bone marrow is this mesenchymal,                or stromal, cell.  As I mentioned in the paper, one way that this                type of cell is actually isolated is perhaps first by markers, but                then also simply by its ability to form attached adherent layers                in the culture dish, once you're putting them into the dish                in the lab.                  Now, there have been various studies, and I've just tried                to collect a number of them here, showing potential differentiation                into different tissue types, either in the lab dish, or in the animal.                 Again, the way they're following this in the animal is primarily                to use a genetic or a fluorescent marker, follow the cell, see what                tissue it ends up in, and look at its morphology, and then also                potentially try to analyze functionality and integration into the                tissue.                 In various disease models, some of these cells have been used.                 For example, in models of stroke.  And I want to point out again                what Dr. Gearhart said.  Animal models are only an approximation.                 This does not tell us the actual situation that we might encounter                in human beings.  But at this point, it's the best we can do.                 We can see if these cells might participate in cell and tissue repair.                 Using rat or human cells, there has been some therapeutic benefit                in some of these disease models in stroke with animals.  With demyelinated                spinal cord.                 Intravenous injection, interestingly enough, of mesenchymal stem                cells in the mouse has shown some remyelinization in spinal cord                injury.  Adult stem cells are not alone in terms of this ability.                 Other cell types have shown this.  And this does not necessarily                mean that you've totally corrected the condition.  It simply                means that you're able to provide some sort of functional recovering                of a bare nerve.                 Another interesting point about this particular study was that                they did not see a large incorporation of these cells into the spinal                cord tissue.  So what benefit they did see did not appear to be                due primarily to the adult stem cells actually differentiating into                the myelinating cells here.  Instead, what appeared to be happening                was the presence of those cells caused a signal for the endogenous                cells to start to re-grow and repair the damage.                  In fact, Dr. Gearhart's lab just recently published a paper                showing that embryonic germ cells showed in a particular mouse model                the same type of repair phenomena.  The mice did show therapeutic                benefit.  But what they found was that the cells did not, to a large                extent, integrate in and participate in the repair.  Instead, it                seemed to be a signalling phenomenon.  And I'll point this out                in a couple of other examples along the way.                 There has been one clinical trial that I could find in the literature                where 11 patients were treated for Hurler syndrome, or metachromatic                leukodystrophy using allogeneic, and not from the original patient,                but from donor mesenchymal cells.  Now, the study noted that four                out of those eleven patients showed a small increase in nerve conductance.                 One of the problems with these diseases is a decrease in nerve conductance.                 There are other neurological effects, and so on.  So small increase.                              And in terms of loss of bone mass, all 11 patients seemed to maintain,                at least for a certain time.  But in terms of any of the other symptoms                in these patients, there was no effect of the adult stem cells.                 Very early study.                 Using mixed population of bone marrow stem cells.  So in this                case, and again, this lack of identifiability for a particular adult                stem cell.  What many people have done is simply take raw bone marrow                and either in culture try to get various differentiations, or putting                back into the animal in various disease models.  And they've                been tried in quite a number of disease models showing some therapeutic                benefit.  In this particular case, again in stroke, intravenous                injection of this mixed population of cells.  Again, no attempt                to purify the cells, or identify the particular cell that's                being used for the treatment of the animal model.  But the cells                in this case did home in on the damage.  Again, this interesting                phenomenon that we've seen.                 Various other conditions.  There was an interesting study relating                to cardiac damage, where cells from mice were actually put into                rats.  And what they noticed was over a fairly extended period of                time there did not appear to be immune rejection of these transplanted                cells, even though they were even from a different species.                  Now, it's only one study.  Does that mean that these particular                cells might be immune privileged and not subject to rejection?                 Only more experiments will tell.  Recent study indicated that with                diabetes, in a mouse model again, where the pancreas was damaged                to induce loss of insulin secretion, bone marrow stem cells injected                into the animal could regenerate insulin-secreting cells.  As in                the other example I mentioned before, there was very low incorporation                of the actual bone marrow stem cells identified as forming insulin-secreting                cells.  Instead, what they seemed to be doing in this instance was                again secreting particular growth or stimulatory factors to stimulate                the endogenous cells to re-form insulin-secreting cells.                 And there have been several clinical trials and publications,                peer reviewed publications, from those trials, primarily with cardiac                damage.  There have been several groups in Germany and a group in                Japan that have published their results.  Again, very, very limited                numbers of patients, we must keep in mind.  And what they're                seeing, though, is some physiological improvement in the ejection                fraction from the heart, and when they actually examine some of                the damage that seems to be being repaired.  One Japanese group                has reported growth of blood vessels in limbs that were threatened                to be lost by gangrene.                  Peripheral blood.  Probably we should just skip this category,                in a sense, because they seem to be very similar to the bone marrow                stem cells.  And it makes a lot of sense that bone marrow stem cells                could actually enter the circulation.  The interesting thing is                that two groups recently have isolated peripheral blood stem cells                from human blood.  One group in particular noticed that the cells                that they isolated showed high levels of Oct-4 expression, this                gene that's associated with pluripotent status of a stem cell.                              In a couple of animal disease models for stroke and cardiac damage,                and I put this under peripheral blood because what the workers did                was not remove adult stem cells and then re-implant them in the                animal.  They injected growth factors to stimulate mobilization                of the stem cells, most likely from bone marrow.  And these cells                appeared to provide a therapeutic benefit in these conditions.                 And we'll come back and talk a little bit more about mobilization                later.                  Neural stem cells.  I certainly was taught in graduate school                that you start with as many brain cells as you're ever going                to have and it's downhill from there.  And on my campus, it's                downhill even faster on a good Friday or Saturday night.  But within                the last decade or so, the discovery that there are these stem cells                within neural tissue that can at least regenerate all three main                neuronal types, and perhaps some other tissue types as well.                  Interestingly enough, they have been used in some animal disease                models to show some therapeutic benefit.  And there have been some                clinical trials, very early.  There is one Parkinson's patient                who was treated with his own neuronal stem cells.  The cells were                removed, grown in culture for awhile, and placed back just into                one side of the brain.  He did see a benefit.  He did see improvement.                              In terms of spinal cord injury, there are no peer reviewed publications                in terms of actual human treatment.  But there have been reports                that at least one group in Portugal are beginning these types of                treatments on patients for spinal cord injury.                  Dr. Gearhart mentioned the embryonic carcinoma cells.  And there's                one group of this cell termed usually ""hNT"" that you might                say has been tamed in culture.  This particular line that they've                come across primarily forms neuronal-type cells in culture, and,                as he mentioned, it's being used in a beginning clinical trial                on stroke.                  Muscle stem cell can regenerate itself.  It has its own stem cell,                primarily dedicated to forming more muscle.  But there's indication                that it does have, perhaps, another stem cell present in that population.                 Debate as to whether those cells can actually form blood, or if                that was one of these so-called transient cells moving through.                 The potential though, perhaps, to form bone from this type of cell,                and these muscle stem cells have been used in some disease models,                primarily directed back towards muscle.  Very interesting one that                I came across was to re-form bladder muscle, or at least reinforce                bladder muscle, in a rat model of incontinence.  And there's                been one published paper regarding a clinical trial using muscle                stem cells, one patient, in France, where the patient did seem to                receive some therapeutic benefit from the muscle stem cells.                 Liver stem cells and pancreatic stem cells.  Pancreas and the                liver derive from the same embryonic primordia.  And so it might                not be surprising that you tend to see liver able to form pancreas,                or pancreas able to form liver.  The interesting thing here is that                genetically engineered liver stem cells, simply by adding and activating                a gene, have helped an animal model induce diabetes in these animals.                 The pancreatic stem cells, likewise, have shown the similar ability.                              Corneal limbal stem cells are a very limited subset.  And what                we might in one sense call a unipotent stem cell, at least for the                most part, other than one or two little reports, so that they would                re-form only the tissue in which they're located.  They have                been used, however, in corneal transplants in a number of countries.                 And there are several published reports on this.   In vitro ,                one group was able to get them to form neuronal cells in culture,                or what looked like neuronal cells.                 Cartilage, again, a very limited sort of application, but clinical                trials for articular cartilage transplants.  And one group has used                them in an attempt to treat children with osteogenesis imperfecta.                               Umbilical cord blood, not a great deal of research has been done,                but there are a growing number of publications.  The interesting                thing here is, in terms of the disease models, stroke, spinal cord                injury, and one particular model of ALS, the cells are delivered                intravenously.  So again, this potential to home in on areas of                damage.                 And then just a list of a number of other tissues here where some                type of adult stem cell has been identified, or potentially identified.                 And I want to point out the adipose, or fat-derived stem cells.                 And I use ""derived"" because it's very likely this                is one of those transient stem cells moving through via the circulatory                system.  Interestingly enough, though, it provides a reliable, readily                available source, you might say, from liposuction fat.  And one                group has been able to see neuronal differentiation in the lab;                not in any animal models yet.                 Now, in terms of activation and mobilizing these adult stem cells,                this may be actually one of the best directions to go in terms of                potential clinical treatments.  Simply because it may not be the                stem cells themselves that participate in the repair of the damage.                 And in that case, maybe what we need to do is simply activate the                cells so that they can deliver the signal to the damaged tissue.                 And again, there may be various states within the bone marrow as                an example of a tissue where you might activate, where the cell                could be activated and then mobilized into the circulatory system,                and then reach the particular tissue to differentiate.                 Again, there were two animal models that had been used, one for                cardiac damage, and one for stroke, where there was an indication                that this might be a potential avenue of research.  Rather than                removing the cells, having to culture them, isolate them, identify                them, put them back, simply being able to mobilize the cells within                the body.                  Another possibility is genetic engineering.  And in terms of actual                animal models of disease, genetically engineered adult stem cells                have been used in a few examples in the publications.  In lung,                that one particular reference indicated that there was a large contribution                of the adult cells to lung tissue.  Again, a damaged tissue system.                              Clinical trials, not directly, you might say, repairing a damaged                tissue.  But in Severe Combined Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome, bubble                boy syndrome, several infants have been treated using genetically                modified bone marrow stem cells from the patient.  They seem to                have been, quote, ""cured,"" and I use that word advisedly,                of the disease.  There have been reports that at least two, and                potentially a third infant, has come down with leukemia as a result                of that treatment, most likely due to the viral vector that was                used to insert the gene into those cells.  Because the gene is not                targeted in those instances.  Instead, it may go into an area where                it can activate oncogenic genes within the cells.                  In terms of delivering the signal, this might be an even better                use of genetic engineering in adult stem cells.  And there have                been a few published examples, potentially for use in animal models                with tumor therapy, to alleviate some of the symptoms in the model                of Niemann-Pick disease for increasing bone healing, and in a Parkinson's                model, where the cells were not participating to any great extent                in repair of the tissue.  Instead, they're delivering a signal                to the endogenous cells there, and stimulating them.                 And in terms of that then, perhaps the best avenue eventually                to pursue might be trying to isolate what these factors are, so                that no stem cells would be needed at all.  Instead, if you can                identify those factors to stimulate regeneration within the tissue,                they could be delivered directly.                  And there are a few published examples of this, one in which there                was some axon regrowth, some, in a rat spinal cord injury model                by injecting a couple of different factors.  One mouse Parkinson's                model study infused directly a factor into the brain of the mouse                model and saw a therapeutic benefit.  Another publication lists                a different factor in terms of a model of chronic kidney damage.                 And one clinical trial where five patients, five Parkinson's                patients were treated with infusion of this glial-derived neurotrophic                factor, they did see some improvement.  Not a cure, and it may be                that that's not the sole signal that's needed, or the correct                signal.  But it did seem to stimulate some physiological improvement                in the patients.                 Thank you.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   For a young field, there's a lot going                on.  And we have also talked our way late into the hour.  Let me                make a suggestion, if I might.  Technically, this session was to                run till 3:30, with the next to start at a quarter of 4:00.  I'm                going to take the liberty of suggesting we spend a half an hour                here at least with our visitors to get some of our questions asked.                 And if Lori Andrews will forgive us, we'll be pushing back the                start of the next session, just so we can get the questions asked.                              Michael Sandel, then Jim Wilson.                 DR. SANDEL:  I learned a great deal from all of these presentations,                as I suspect we all did.  I was especially struck by one feature                of Dr. Jaenisch's presentation, and I'd like to put this                as an observation which actually will end with a question.                 The subtitle of the paper and of the talk, Dr. Jaenisch, and my                Council colleagues will appreciate this perhaps more than our visitors.                 The subtitle could well have been, ""The Vindication of Paul                McHugh.""  Because when we were discussing the biology of cloning,                almost everyone here shared an assumption, regardless of the positions                that we took on the ethical issues.  Almost everyone took it for                granted that biologically the fertilized embryos and cloned embryos                were essentially the same, and the moral argument proceeded from                that assumption.  With the exception of one person, Paul McHugh.                               And he introduced a distinction, a distinction, as he put it,                between a zygote and a ""clonote"", by which he meant the                cloned embryo, the product of cloning.  And for insisting on this                distinction, poor Paul suffered heaps of ridicule and abuse, and,                at best, a kind of bemused chuckling, by those of us around the                table.  And he argued that there's a difference, a biological                difference, with a possible ethical significance between a zygote                and a clonote, between a fertilized embryo and an artifact created                in the lab.  And he was told that this is an eccentric position.                 He was told that this is an off the wall distinction, that it had                no basis in biology or science.                  And in a memorable exchange with our colleague Charles, who unfortunately                isn't here for the benefit of this discussion, he was asked,                ""Well, but what if a cloned embryo actually came to term?                 Isn't Dolly a sheep?""  And Paul's answer was, ""Well,                a sick sheep.""                 And then we read, Dr. Jaenisch, in your paper that a cloned human                embryo would have little, if any, potential to develop into a normal                human being, that it lacks essential attributes that characterize                the beginning of normal human life.  And you explained that it has                to do with faulty reprogramming after nuclear transfer.                 Now, I don't know whether that's true, whether it's                generally accepted, or controversial in the scientific community.                 But whatever the case, it seems that what we regarded here as an                eccentric, off the wall suggestion, that there is a biologically                significant difference between a fertilized embryo and a cloned                embryo, now, if I understand you correctly and here's my question,                now, you're telling us that far from being eccentric or off                the wall, Paul's position may be true.                  DR. JAENISCH:   Well, I think that was the whole purpose                of going through these arguments for me.  To argue from a biological                point of view, it is a continuum.  We have to struggle with that.                 And we have, for the early, most abnormal stage, we have good markers.                 Death is a terrific marker.  Then we have molecular markers after                birth, or we have aging as another marker.                 So these are concrete markers, and we know these animals are not                normal.  So when it is claimed that cows on the field are normal,                which has been published by ACT.  They looked at their one- to four-year-old                cows sit on the fields and eat and give milk.  They argued, well,                they must be normal.  So they checked that.  And they checked it                by checking if it had a heart.  Yes, it had a heart.  A liver, yes                they had a liver, and that serum, even.  So they concluded they                must be normal and publish this in ""Science"".                 Now, this of course is a very superficial way of looking at it.                 And very interesting.  Once this paper came out, six months later,                two of these healthy cows, one got multiple tumors, the other one                generalized seizures.  Now this is not normal.  You wait, and these                things come out.                 The point I was trying to make is that these are stochastic problems.                 There is not a key master gene which, if this is right then the                embryo's right.  No.  The whole genome is stochastically, correctly                reprogrammed or not.  And what's amazing to me is that mammalian                development is so regulative that it can tolerate so much gene disregulation                and still get an animal to birth and beyond.  But you pay for that.                 You pay with subtle or less subtle, more or less subtle problems.                               And of course, because it's stochastic, you will arrive at                the end at some animals which live a normal life span.  And by all                our available tests they might be normal, or you might not see it.                 If you look at the primate, or in the human, we might see this because                we could look at some much more subtle phenotypes.                  So I think the point I was trying to make is if you want to use                this as a technique to generate human beings, there's no predictability.                 You cannot do this.  And for me, it doesn't matter with one                percent or two maybe something normal, because you can't predict                it before.                 So I totally agree with what your thought was.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Jim Wilson.                  PROF. WILSON:   Michael asked the same question I was going                to ask using virtually the same words.  I guess it's the Harvard                affliction.                 But I want to just press a bit more.  An oocyte is not potential                human life because it's an unfertilized egg.  You can enucleate                it and put in a new nucleus, and now it is a clone.  But according                to your account, a cloned embryo has little, if any, potential to                ever develop into a normal human being.                 If you would step back, then, from your biological role and adopt                a somewhat more philosophical role, would you say that a clone,                therefore, is not potential human life?                  DR. JAENISCH:   I would argue it's not potential normal                human life.                  PROF. WILSON:   Thank you.                  DR. JAENISCH:   I think that's the only thing I can                say.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   And Dolly still is a sheep?                  DR. JAENISCH:   Still was a sick sheep, was a very sick                sheep, and which died, of course, predictably very early.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Janet Rowley.                  DR. ROWLEY:   Well, I, too, learned a great deal this afternoon.                 I want to make two comments, and then I have a question for Rudy.                              The first comment is that I think it is most unfortunate that                we're prevented from asking our experts, and particularly John                Gearhart, about the status of funding that supports this very critical                area of science.                  The second comment is also directed to John.  And I was struck                by the specific chromosome abnormalities that you identified in                your human embryonic cells, because you probably know that an isochromosome                for 12p is the most common abnormality in human testicular carcinoma.                               So it's astonishing that this is the abnormality that you                see in these cells, and I'm sure it is extraordinarily important.                              The question that I have for Rudy — I was surprised when you said                that imprinted genes are only important in embryogenesis, because                clearly there are a number of human conditions.                 Now, you could say, well, human condition and the malformations                occur because of embryogenesis, but there is also this whole question                of imprinting and its relationship to carcinogenesis.  So I'd                like you to expand on that.                  DR. JAENISCH:   This is a very important point you're                bringing up, so I was probably a little bit generalized.  So I think                most imprinting, as we know, have — so that could be among these                things that could be the most interesting, because it's IGF-2,                which is a loose cannon.                  IGF-2 is a tumor, an oncogene essentially, so this would be available                for cloning, because IGF-2 is very easily dysregulated.  And I would                worry if you have both copies active, because that's pretumor                status.  So you want to screen for this.                 But the other genes — for all of the other genes, for example,                an Angelman Syndrome probably really is — there are really problems                of fetal development.  So these genes and fetal development — I                could go further into this, because it's really growth of the                fetus, where these genes appear to play the most important role.                              And there's really no evidence, with the exception of IGF-2,                maybe KIP-257, which is a tumor suppressor gene, those are the ones                you would worry about.  So I think we know only two of those, and                those you would test for I think.                  So I agree, which makes this a little bit more restrictive when                I say it.                  DR. ROWLEY:   Right.  And there probably are others that                we don't know about, but —                  DR. JAENISCH:   There might be others which we don't                know —                  DR. ROWLEY:   — you're saying that they would —                  DR. JAENISCH:   Yes.                  DR. ROWLEY:   — just all be tested for.                  DR. JAENISCH:   Those two we know for sure, but others we                know they don't play a role.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   I have myself next, if I might.  A question                for Dr. Prentice, and then for the group as a whole.  In Dr. Gearhart's                presentation, he gave a great deal of emphasis to the importance                of the characterization of these cells, the reproducibility, all                of these various things.                 You had to cover an enormous amount of material in the number                of papers, and you also in your presentation alluded to the problem                of characterization, though I gather many of these studies seem                to be one-shot efforts of throwing some things in and trying to                see what their clinical effect might be.                 And as I've read the debates, a lot of people wonder, are                these really stem cells?  How well characterized are they?  So could                you say something about what criteria should be used for these stem                cell preparations?                  What criteria would they have to meet before you could satisfy                the critics that these are, in fact, fit to be called human stem                cells, and fit, therefore, for controlled studies on the kinds of                things that you're talking about here?                 And kind of a subordinate question, what's the best characterized                of, and the most versatile of, these adult stem cell preparations?                 Are there any that at the moment meet the criteria that you yourself                would advance?                  DR. PRENTICE:   In answer to your first question, it's                difficult, obviously, because as you point out many of these studies                have been sort of one-shot, especially if you look at the mixed                bone marrow population studies where they are simply taking a preparation,                putting it back into a diseased animal or a diseased model, and                trying to come up with some therapeutic benefit.                 You know, obviously, what you'd like to be able to do is to                isolate the cell or the population, keeping in mind that caveat                that the population dynamics may be an important facet of this.                               But let's say there's one particular stem cell that you're                after.  Supposedly, if you saw that sort of therapeutic benefit                from the mixed population, you should be able to go in and simply                take cuts and eventually isolate that one cell, and then be able                to grow it in culture.                 In terms of the overall markers, that's been very difficult,                and there have been a few studies looking at the gene expression                common to neural stem cells, bone marrow stem cells, embryonic stem                cells.  And there are a subset of those genes that are common to                all of those cells.                 Now, what you would hope to be able to do, then, is to go look                at each of those genes and start using those as guides to come up                with a marker for any stem cell that would be targeted for the types                of differentiation models that we'd like to see, and eventually                clinical applications.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   And with respect to the second question,                what is the best characterized and most versatile adult stem cell                preparation at the moment?  I mean, can you — is there —                  DR. PRENTICE:   Probably Dr. Verfaillie's MAPC cells,                and I can't speak for her, but those do show many of these characteristics                that ideally you would like — long-term growth in culture, clonogenic                growth, and then differentiation.  They've been used in a couple                of different animal models of disease to see some sort of benefit.                              One of the mesenchymal cell — stem cell lines, if I remember correctly                — and there are a lot of things to sort back through there — had                been kept in culture, I believe, for about two years.  There was                another cell line that — I think it was also a bone marrow derived                cell line, but it had been genetically engineered to contain telomerase                or additional telomerase gene.  And that had been kept in long-term                culture.                 I believe also one of the neural stem cell lines has been kept                in long-term culture, and actually Dr. Gearhart might be able to                comment more on that.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Okay.  Thank you.                 And I have a general question to all of you, if I might.  Since                we sent you some general questions that we were hoping to get some                help on, to go from where we are now to actually having reliable                tissue grafting therapeutic applications in humans, since there's                a fair amount of speculation out there — and, Dr. Gearhart, you                did emphasize how early we are in the process and the emphasis,                really, on learning of the basic biology.                 But the public out there is more — much more interested in, you                know, where are the cures?  Could you address that particular question                of the various sort of stages, and where we are, and what kind of                — how one should talk about these things responsibly in relation                to the widespread hopes for remedies for which the patient groups                are, quite understandably, clamoring?                  DR. GEARHART:   The answer to that question is a very complex                one for me.  I could run through a number of cell lineages with                respect to the human embryonic and stem cell and germ cell lines,                where we are in the process, but it's the other end that I want                to address.                 The most difficult talks that I give anymore are those before                patient-based groups where the hopes are high.  They come with expectations                that far exceed, I think, where we are.  And this is the result                that I think that early on in the field, as you mentioned, the hype                was there when circumspection should have been there.  And I don't                think circumspection is a retreat from promise.                 The reality is when you get into the laboratory, and you are working                on cell lines, it seems the more progress you make, the further                away the goal is as we learn.  And we can show I think remarkable                things in our animal models of putting in cells, and these are almost                — they bear some resemblance to the adult stem cell story where                you try a lot of things empirically, you get a response of some                kind, and you're trying to figure out what it is, why.                 But when you superimpose on top of the biology issues of trying                to control these cells in a dish, and trying to expand them in a                dish to characterize them, to show that they're authentic, that                they do work, the issues of safety, which I think we all are in                agreement have to be foremost in this, that the time frame is years                away before I think any of this will be realized in a clinic.                 I think there's misunderstanding, that if all of a sudden                you have an insulin-producing cell in a laboratory, which we do,                and we're — as other labs have as well — that most people think                this is the answer.  You just put insulin-producing cells into a                diabetic.  And as you know, this doesn't solve the underlying                problem.                 We can — so I don't know how to answer the question that you                ask.  I mean, I'm certainly optimistic.  I think it's going                to be a direct function, and I'll come back to Janet's question                that she can't ask or isn't supposed to ask, and that is                that obviously more funding into this area — and I know that this                isn't a congressional committee of any kind, where we're                seeking funding, but obviously the progress is directly proportional                to the number of good investigators you have working on projects.                              And in this field, we've had a bottleneck, first from the                number of lines that could be used, now the NIH funding I'm                sure is going to be more robust over time, but this remains not                only I think a financial issue but also almost a psychological one                — for students getting involved, for post-docs getting involved,                for young faculty getting involved in the field, where we don't                know what the future will be, to be honest with you, in this country.                              We see our colleagues around the world in different laboratories                I think making really substantial progress here.  And so I'll                get off this part of it, but I think this is an important issue,                at least with the embryonic and fetal sources of cells.  And I hope                we'd get over that.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you.                 I have Gil Meilaender, Bill Hurlbut, Janet.  Gil.                  PROF. MEILAENDER:   Yes.  Dr. Jaenisch, I want to come back to                where Michael Sandel started us, because I'm just not certain                that I'm clear on something.  And what I want to know is, you                know, it's always hard to know when one's speaking as a                scientist and when one's speaking as something else.                 But as a scientist, there are various kinds of chromosomal or                genetic defects that a fetus might have, the result of which would                be that it might die immediately after birth or very soon after                that.  How would you scientifically describe those fetuses?  Would                you say that they have — that they also do not have the potential                to be a normal human being?                  I'm trying to get away from the stem cell issue for a moment.                 Would the same characterization be the appropriate one there?                  DR. JAENISCH:   This a really a question which is not a                scientific question, then, right?  An embryo which has a trisomy                number, whatever, large chromosomes will die very early, maybe before                implantation.  So that has this embryo which is afflicted with this                genetic alteration.                  Has that a normal potential development to a human being?  No.                               PROF. MEILAENDER:   So it falls into the same — so, in other words,                this is a rather large category of embryos and fetuses that — about                which we would say this.  We're not only talking about cloned                embryos.                  DR. JAENISCH:   Well, I think that —                  PROF. MEILAENDER:   The same characterization —                  DR. JAENISCH:   Yes, I —                  PROF. MEILAENDER:   — would fit.                  DR. JAENISCH:   I think the difference, from my point of                view, if a chromosomal abnormality occurs after normal fertilization,                something which is totally unpredictable and is assessed, that is                what fate is to genetic game.  With cloning, I think it's predictable,                and that's the difference.  It is predictable to a large extent,                so I think that would make the difference.                 One is spontaneous, unpredictable, it's a risk of normal reproduction.                 The other one is predictable.  Otherwise, I really can't — I                think this for me is a major difference.  You predictably generate                a human being which has no chance to become normal with any acceptable                efficiency.                  PROF. MEILAENDER:   I think I'll stop there.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Bill Hurlbut, and then Janet.                  DR. HURLBUT:   Did I hear you correctly say you find destruction                of IVF embryos morally troubling, but cloned embryos for embryonic                stem cell use less troubling?                  DR. JAENISCH:   No.  Well, I said that if you accept that                instead of throwing away an  in vitro  fertilized embryo which                cannot be implanted because nobody wants it, instead of throwing                this embryo away generating to an embryonic stem cell, I mean, people                accept this.  I find this acceptable.  But it does pose an ethical                problem, because you do destroy potential normal human life.  There's                no talking around it.                 So if you accept that, then I would argue that a cloned embryo                is less of an ethical problem.  That's all that I want to say.                 So the potential is not there.                  DR. HURLBUT:   And from hearing you and talking with you                at lunch, I had the sense that you feel like nuclear transfer actually                offers us more versatility and more promise than using IVF embryos,                because we can use the genotypes we want and control various things.                 Is this fair?                  DR. JAENISCH:   Yes, I would think so.                  DR. HURLBUT:   So I have to admit I'm troubled by your                comment, and not convinced by Michael Sandel's comment.  As                much as I like my colleague Paul McHugh, I'm not — I'm troubled                by the notion that what you called not potentially normal human                life does not have a moral standing.                 And the reason I'm troubled by that is — was just alluded                to by Gil, that I would not say that a potentially abnormal trajectory                of embryogenesis is not a human life necessarily.                  Now, I have a handicapped child myself, and she does not have                a problem of development, but she had brain damage at birth.  But                she's not what you would call a normal human life in that specifically                all-healthy sense.  But she's very human, as human as I am.                              I'll let somebody make the joke on that one, if you want.                              But the question is this.  I feel for what you're saying.                 I feel for what Michael said, and I feel — have been with Paul to                some extent on this all along.                  But if we say that natural — the natural meaning of the definition                of a human life is not normal, but some meaningful process of integrated                — of integration of identity, of continuity, then it seems to me                that the clones that have been produced at least with animal studies                have to qualify as entities of their species.                 So even though, as you said to me even a year ago, a cow standing                on a green hill chewing its cud isn't — doesn't make it                a normal cow.  I agree.  But I think it's still a cow.                 And likewise, the human trajectory of whatever the clone could                be is troublingly human-like.  I personally wouldn't feel comfortable                saying, for example, as was implied by John Gearhart in his talk,                that we could use it to harvest out later tissues for more difficult                differentiations.                 Well, let me back that up.  All of my colleagues, and my own reading                on this, confirms to me that going from embryonic stem cells to                useful cells, tissues, and organs, is a long journey, maybe short                for Parkinson's Disease, but longer for more complex tissues,                and very long for — what we really want is organs and — for transplant,                like kidneys, and so forth.                 I think there will be a temptation in our civilization to move                the trajectory of something that's designated non-human on to                further stages of gestation.  Now maybe not gestation in a human                womb.  Maybe it'll be in an artificial endometrium or something                that can coax it just 30, 60 days longer for good use.  It starts                to be troubling, even if you accept your premises.                 Let me back it up, then.  I think in principle what you're                saying has something to it, and Paul and I have been trying to talk                about this, and I've had dialogues with my colleagues on this.                               I put forward in my personal statement on the President's                Council Report on Cloning what I called a speculative proposal,                where I suggested that — drawing on what Paul had said, that this                is an artifact, not a human being, a clonal artifact.                  Why don't we go to the bottom of the problem?  Why don't                we say that something that does not have a human potential in any                meaningful way, not an abnormal human potential, but no meaningful                human potential, might supply us with the essential way to get around                the moral problem, at least to get us to stem cells?  And we can                deal with the next issues later.                 And I want to stay two things before I conclude.  One is in making                this proposal, I was very aware that the first issue of what you                might call the inviolability of the human life is only the beginning                of the questions about the moral use of human process or human tissues                or anything.                 But what I had in mind was this — that just as we've come                to see that a cell does not define the locus of human dignity, nor                does a gene, of course — let's start at the smallest.  A gene                — a human gene can be put into a bacterium, grown, used to make                insulin.  A cell — we do blood cell transplants.  Tissues — we do                skin transplants.  Organs — we do transplants and even organ systems.                 None of those are the locus of human dignity, human moral standing.                              Likewise, in this age of developmental biology, we will learn                that partial generative potentials are not the locus of human moral                standing.  We will harness these partial generative potentials in                such a way that we can do wonderful things with them without violating                the integrity, identity, and continuity of human life.                 So this is my question to you.  Could we find a scientific way                to meet the challenge of our President and our nation and the imperative                of our civilization to go forward with the science?  Could we define                the danger as we never want to interrupt a normal human life in                process, or even one that is remotely normal?                 Could we meet that moral objection while at the same time opening                the positive future of our science?  And here the suggestion I would                have is using something so fundamental, like short, interfering                RNA, to preclude the very possibility of anything but the most minimal                and genetic mammalian process to the blastocysts from which we could                then take embryonic stem cells.                 What do you think?                  DR. JAENISCH:   Yes.  I think we talked about this before.                 I think it's a really interesting possibility.  So what we need                to — for a human being to develop two major lineages, which is a                trophoblast lineage and the epiblast lineage.  The trophoblast lineage                will support the embryo from the placenta.                 So certainly there are genes which are only needed, as far as                we know from experiments, that are only needed for placental development.                 They are not needed for the epiblast lineage or for the embryo.                 So one would modify a donor cell — let's say a skin cell that                you want to transplant — with inactivating such a gene — I can give                you examples of those — and expressing, for example, using the SI                RNA technology, which now really becomes — seems to become a routine                procedure to inactive genes.                 And, indeed, an embryo — a cloned embryo derived from such a nucleus                would not be able to form a trophoblast lineage which would be functional.                 So, therefore, if this embryo would be implanted, it would definitely                fail.  You could predict it would fail much earlier than this continuum,                which I outlined for the cloned embryos which are not modified.                              So I think, in principle, this is a doable — potentially doable                manipulation which would prevent what you are interested in and                what you are raising, prevent the development very far in utero.                               DR. HURLBUT:   In your opinion, could we reasonably call                that not in any sense a human life in process, abnormal or normal,                but call it a clonal artifact, a laboratory production for the procurement                of cells with a potential for something, but not what we would have                to call embryonic cells?                  DR. JAENISCH:   Yes, because you would argue this embryo                — I mean, the definition of an early embryonic cell, like a two-cell                or a four-cell embryo, the blastomere, is totipotent.  These cells                can make the placental lineage and the epiblast lineage.                 This embryo would not be able to make the trophoblast lineage,                so, therefore, it would not be totipotent.  So I think you could                argue this would be a real biological difference.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   We do want to go to the next session shortly,                but I've got Janet and Elizabeth, and then I'm going to                call a halt for this session.                  DR. ROWLEY:   I come back to John Gearhart.  And, first,                I want to take you to task for comments at the very end of your                talk, and then I have a question.  And what I want to take you to                task for are your comments, all related to enhancement and how easy                it's going to be to just get genetic enhancement of all sorts                of features.                 And I think — well, you could expand on that or explain what you                meant by that.  But this has been such a critical issue for this                particular Council — the likelihood of enhancement — that I think                that it shouldn't just be left unchallenged.                 And the question that I have is, with regard to characterization                of current lines, you indicated that that's under the auspices                of the MRC in London.  And I'm just curious, are they looking                at both so-called presidential lines as well as lines available                elsewhere?  Or are they only lines available elsewhere?  And what                kinds of characterization are they proceeding with?                  DR. GEARHART:   Let me answer the non-controversial question                first.  This is a relatively — this panel — there has been, over                the last nine months or so, an international consortium that has                been meeting on human embryonic stem cells.                 The outcome of this was the appointment of a panel headed by Peter                Andrews at Sheffield University, who will be — that panel will be                setting up the standardizations, if you will, or the criteria for                the embryonic stem cell lines.                 They will — I think some of this work will be done in the equivalent                of what's the FDA in the United Kingdom.  But they will take                any cell line that's submitted to them, whether it's a presidential                one or one from anywhere else.  They are not a — they are not distributing                cells.  They are just testing them for these different parameters.                              And, obviously, there will be a number of transcription factors,                a number of surface antigens.  This kind of thing will be in that                mix.                  DR. ROWLEY:   Will they do karyotypes?                  DR. GEARHART:   Oh, yes, karyotype is — yes, it's absolutely                essential to have a normal karyotype, and one that's stable                over a number of cell passages is critical.                 The comment I made about enhancements, I just — it may have been                out of order here, but I am concerned, I mean, as a biologist I'm                concerned.  I'm concerned about a number of issues.  It makes                it sound as if most of the time that scientists aren't concerned,                that we're just going along in a fashion that, you know, science                for science sake.                 And I only have to remind you over the last few months to see                the use of human embryonic stem cells in mouse chimeras, the use                of chimeric human embryos that has been done, that you say there's                no reason that these things should have been done.  I mean, there's                no scientific basis for this.                 And we have to have some degree — and I'm not going to call                it regulation, I don't like that term, obviously, but there                has to be some consensus as to what should be permitted and shouldn't                be permitted in almost a global way.  And I realize that this is                very, very difficult.                 I've been to two G-6/G-7 meetings in which we have tried to                get some kind of consensus even on human cloning among countries.                 I mean, let alone the use of embryos for research, and things like                this.  And as you can imagine, nothing much happens.  Everyone has                their own opinions, and we go away.                 When we have the capability — if this work is successful — I'll                be frank with you.  If this work is successful, and by success that                we are learning mechanisms around differentiation and the development                of cell types, we are going to have an awful power that we can instruct                ourselves.                 Now, we're not necessarily going to be talking about germ                line cells or germ line modifications.  Maybe.  Because, obviously,                if we can grow oocytes from these cells — there are reports that                we can grow spermatogonia and sperm cells out of these — maybe the                possibility exists for that at this point.                 But I'm just hoping that people are thinking ahead a bit,                that, you know, this is something that's going to be on the                table in a number of years, and that we should give it some thought                — where we're going to go with this.  That's all.                 And so I made a comment about, you know, getting it off the internet                or something to do it.  Maybe that's an overstatement.  Maybe                that's just crying wolf, and I apologize for that.                 But I think it's something that we have to be aware is out                there.  It's going to be out there.  Not out there now, but                will be out there, and we should be thinking ahead.  So I apologize                to the Council for making that kind of a comment.                  DR. ROWLEY:   Well, I don't think an apology is necessary.                 I think what I'm trying to say is — my own personal view is                that the Council should be especially concerned about things that                are relatively near term.  And by ""near term,"" in such                a rapidly-moving field I think a few years is near term.  And if                you're saying, well, in 10 years' time we'll be able                to do this, we can't see that far ahead.                  DR. GEARHART:   Right.  Right.                  DR. ROWLEY:   And so that — so what kind of terms are you                talking about in terms of time?                  DR. GEARHART:   Oh, I'm talking not about 10 years.                 I'm talking about a shorter time interval.                  DR. ROWLEY:   Okay.                  DR. GEARHART:   You know, Janet, I think to be honest with                you, the number of federal Blue Ribbon Panels that have been set                up, at the NIH level, the National Academy, to discuss issues that                seem to be 10 years away, recommendations were made by our leading                scientists, our leading scholars, only to be ignored.  And then,                we find ourselves in a pot once these things happen.                 And it's just, I mean, frustrating as a scientist.  It's                frustrating almost as a citizen to do this, where it seems that                the scientific community, to a certain degree, is marginalized when                it comes to making recommendations as to how we should proceed.                              And we are left, then, every time something comes up in this area                everything is thrown up in the area as to where we're going,                etcetera.  So that's the nature of the comment.  Or, I'm                sorry, that's the basis of the comment that I made.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Last comment.  Elizabeth, if you — did                you still want to say something?  You were on the queue.                 PROF. BLACKBURN:  I'll return to the science, and I don't                know who would like to answer this question.  But it was picking                up on the point that I think Leon did raise about asking about the                sources of adult stem cells.  And you mentioned that there's                really only one good one, or the best one, is that right.  Dr. Verfaillie's.                 And —                  DR. PRENTICE:   I think Dr. Verfaillie's is the best                characterized —                 PROF. BLACKBURN:  Yes, best characterized.                  DR. PRENTICE:   — in terms of all of these various traits.                              PROF. BLACKBURN:  Yes.  So, you know, we're struck — and I                think Leon pointed this out, too — by the fact that there's                a great deal of research that's been ongoing in the last, you                know, couple of years —                  DR. PRENTICE:   Yes.                 PROF. BLACKBURN:  — on adults.  And yet it seems to me there's                a real problem.  And, you know, what's the problem?  Why is                there so little known?  To put it bluntly.                  You know, here's 192 publications that you cite, and why is                it so difficult?  Are these just inherently really difficult things                to work with?  Is this what it comes down to, that people who work                with adult stem cells don't really like to say that, or — sorry                to cut to the point, but I know time is of the essence.                  DR. PRENTICE:   I think one of the reasons comes back to                this difficulty in identifying which one is actually the stem cell,                how to actually purify it, isolate it.  Some of the cells seem rather                easy to isolate.  Certainly, peripheral blood is quite easier, or                the adipose-derived cells would be easy to isolate.                 But then, how do you really know that one is the stem cell?  And,                again, most of the results — the best results seem to come primarily                from these mixed populations of the bone marrow stem cells, where                they have not intentionally in many cases isolated the particular                stem cell.  Instead, they've been geared towards some sort of                physiological endpoint.                 My assumption would be, then, working back from that, once they                could achieve that end point, then they might be able to derive                the particular cell.                 But I think it also brings up a point I tried to raise before                in that it may not be possible, or it may not be preferable, to                try to get a particular cell.  It may be the context of these cells                with the population and their interactions, exchanging growth factors,                altering their own gene expression, and then — in the tissue milieu                — that really gives them this ability to somehow cause the repair.                               And I use that term because, again, I think in many of the instances                the research is showing that it's not direct integration and                taking on the function.  It's somehow stimulating endogenous                cells.                 PROF. BLACKBURN:  So it may — are you hinting that it might be                qualitatively different from what is going on with embryonic stem                cells, when those were tried to be used?                   DR. PRENTICE:   Well, I —                 PROF. BLACKBURN:  I don't want to get too much into this,                but I'm just trying to understand the science here.                  DR. PRENTICE:   Yes, I think that might be a good way to                put it.  It may be qualitatively different.  You know, it's                interesting Dr. Jaenisch mentioned that embryonic stem cells, in                a sense, are a tissue culture artifact.  He might just as well,                by the same definition, call Dr. Verfaillie's MAPC cells a tissue                culture artifact.                 And it may be that putting these cells into culture, now changing                their context, gives them some of these characteristics that are                so sought after.  Our target might be better put in terms of, what                is the physiological endpoint that we want?  Not a particular starting                cell, but how do we achieve the repair of the tissue damage?                 And, again, as I mentioned in the talk and in the paper, it may                be that it's not a particular cell that we really need.  Short                term, cellular regeneration may be our best goal.  But long term,                figuring out the particular molecular and cellular signals — and,                again, it may be a context-type signal — cell-cell context or cell-matrix                context — that actually can give us that physiological endpoint,                and so eventually going to a non-cell-based system, but a signal-based                system if you will.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Paul McHugh insists on a very brief comment,                and then we're —                  DR. McHUGH:   I have just two —                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   — going to break.                  DR. McHUGH:   — little tiny scientific questions, but because                they are important science that we're discussed here.  The first                one really relates to Dr. Jaenisch, and that is, I wanted to know,                sir, now whether you could say that the genetic alterations and                the problematic genetic status of the fully cloned animal, whether                those genetic abnormalities would then pass on to their offspring,                and so, therefore, be a contaminant to the whole human genome legacy                from then on?  That's the one question.                  DR. JAENISCH:   Let me first clarify there are no genetic                alterations which are important.  They are all epigenetic.                  DR. McHUGH:   Right, yes.                  DR. JAENISCH:   So the experiment has been done.  You can                take two animals afflicted with large offspring syndrome and mate                them.  The offspring will be all (risk?) normal, because you send                the genome through the process of gametogenesis, which reprograms                everything in a normal way, everything is reset.                 Of course, there might be some genetic alterations which are acquired                during somatic life.                  DR. McHUGH:   Right.                  DR. JAENISCH:   Those would not be — they cannot explain                the phenotype.  They would be recessive, and so they haven't                shown up yet.                  DR. McHUGH:   Right.                  DR. JAENISCH:   So we don't know if they would show                up.                  DR. McHUGH:   They might show up later.                  DR. JAENISCH:   Right.                  DR. McHUGH:   And secondly, to John Gearhart — John, you                whine a lot about how troublesome it is to be a scientist nowadays.                 I just want to know this.  The President made a very good Solomonic                decision and produced the cell lines for you scientists to work,                putting the ball in your court.                 Are you saying to us now you've used up all of the potential                in those cell lines, and now, because of the President's decision,                are restricted in your progress?                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   You don't have to answer, and he's                over time.  But if you'd like to —                  DR. GEARHART:   I have to answer Paul.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   — 15 seconds.                  DR. GEARHART:   Being a scientist is the greatest thing                in the world, and I wouldn't trade it for anything, Paul.  And                so I don't —                  DR. McHUGH:   I know that, John.  Me, too.                  DR. GEARHART:   Okay.  And I'm not here to whine.  The                funding issues are improving, and they are improving nicely here.                 Okay?  And, clearly, we can learn a lot through the lines that are                approved.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Gentlemen, thank you very much.                 Look, we have a guest we've kept waiting for quite a long                time.  Would the Council, please, 10 minutes.                 Thank you all very much.                 (Applause.)

Rachel Dudley                  When most teenagers visit Washington, they make the rounds of the monuments, line up for the White House tour and marvel at the wonders of the Smithsonian.  But 15 year old Rachel Dudley is different than most kids her age.  The Michigan teen has been coping with juvenile diabetes for 11 years and had come to Washington in hopes that her own experience could help a congressional subcommittee I chair better understand the need to find a cure for this terrible disease.            In clear and courageous testimony, Rachel told the members of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations what her life has been like since being diagnosed with juvenile diabetes at the age of four.  She talked about the more than 12,000 insulin injections she's received.  And she described being rushed to a hospital intensive care unit two years ago after her kidneys shut down when, as she described, she pretended she was a ""normal"" kid and neglected to manage her diabetes properly.  And she urged us to do ""whatever it takes"" to find a cure for the disease that stands between her and the""normal"" life she yearns to live.     It was a message that was echoed by many others who testified before us that day, including the actress Mary Tyler Moore, who suffers from diabetes, some of the nation's top medical researchers, and the families and physicians of some of the 16 million Americans who live everyday with this debilitating and deadly disease.        Our best medical scientists now believe that doing ""whatever it takes"" to find a cure for diabetes and a host of other life-threatening diseases means providing federal support for stem cell research.     Embryonic stem cell research involves using cells from embryos that have the ability to divide indefinitely and to develop into specialized cells.  Researchers believe these cells have the potential to grow into any type of cell in the human body, and may therefore provide cures for many diseases.  For example, scientists believe that one day embryonic stem cells may be able to grow into new heart cells that could be replaced in a person who has a failing heart.  The potential for giving and prolonging life that these embryonic stem cells possess is enormous.      The issue of federal funding for stem cell research has come into focus in Washington because President Bush decided to set aside guidelines implemented by the Clinton administration last year while he reviews the issue.  The Clinton administration guidelines had allowed federal funding of embryonic stem cell research within strict safeguards.  For example, federal funds cannot be used to actually create embryos, and federal funds can only be used to conduct research on stem cells from eggs discarded from in vitro fertilization, which would otherwise be destroyed by  fertility clinics across the country.     Support for stem cell research has come from many quarters, such as patient advocacy groups, the business community, and scientists - including the more than 75  Nobel Laureates who recently wrote to the President on this issue.   Support for this research also crosses party lines and unites those on opposite sides of the debate over abortion rights.  Senator Bill Frist (R-Tennessee), who is the only physician serving in the Senate, as well as Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and former First Lady Nancy Reagan have expressed their strong support of federal funding for embryonic stem cell research.     As President Bush considers what course to take on this critical issue, I hope he will consider the words of Rachel Dudley and the countless millions of Americans who struggle with diseases that might be cured through stem cell research.                # # #                  Carl's Bio *   Photo Gallery *   Michigan Services *   Senate Activity        Press Page *   Federal Links *   Student Info *    Contact Carl"
GX035-64-4801704	"STEM CELLS IN DEVELOPMENT/REPAIR OF OROFACIAL STRUCTURES  RELEASE DATE:  February 5, 2002   RFA:  RFA-DE-02-006  PARTICIPATING INSTITUTES AND CENTERS (ICs):   National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR)  ( http://www.nidr.nih.gov/ )   LETTER OF INTENT RECEIPT DATE:  March 18, 2002  APPLICATION RECEIPT DATE:  April 18, 2002  THIS RFA CONTAINS THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION  o Purpose of the RFA o Research Objectives o Mechanism(s) of Support o Eligible Institutions o Individuals Eligible to Become Principal Investigators o Where to send Inquiries o Submitting an Application o Peer Review Process o Review Criteria o Award Criteria o Required Federal Citations  PURPOSE  The purpose of this RFA is to foster research on embryonic and adult  stem cell biology that could facilitate the understanding of the  complex events that occur during oral, dental, and craniofacial  development.  It is envisioned that such knowledge will aid in the  development of safe and effective stem cell-based treatments for the  repair and regeneration of orofacial structures that have been  compromised by congenital disorders, diseases, and injuries.  RESEARCH OBJECTIVES  Brief Background  Recent scientific discoveries concerning the ability of human embryonic  stem cells (ES) to proliferate in an undifferentiated state and to be  directed to develop into a wide array of cell types present  opportunities for research that aim to repair or replace cells and  restore vital functions. Exploration of these opportunities is now  possible with the release of the NIH Guidelines for Human ES Cell  Research and the availability of human cell lines through the NIH Human  ES Cell Registry.   Adult stem cells are present in many tissues of adult organisms and are  important in tissue repair and homeostasis. These cells have the  ability to self-renew (give rise to a replacement cell at each cell  division with no apparent limitation) as well as generate another cell  that is committed to differentiation in a particular tissue.  Understanding the mechanisms of stem cell renewal could provide  fundamental insights not only into the origin of multicellular  organisms, but also into regeneration of specific tissues and  elucidation of complex events such as tumorigenesis, whereby a ""cancer  stem cell"" with a similar capacity for self-renewal drives disease progression.   ES cells that are derived from embryos at the blastocyst stage may have  a broader natural potential since, during development, they normally  produce all the cells of an organism. These pluripotent cells are  characterized by nearly an unlimited self-renewal and differentiation  capacity which can give rise to many differentiated cell types  including neurons, glia, skeletal myocytes, adipocytes and haemopoietic  cells. The main difference between the embryo-derived pluripotent cells  and the so-called multipotent adult stem cells is in the number of  differentiated cell types that they can produce. This may reflect the  different origins of these cells; pluripotent stem cells are derived  from blastocyst cells, while adult stem cells are derived from somatic  cells that no longer possess the capacity to develop into the full  spectrum of cell types. The stem and precursor cells can be used for  examining mechanisms of progenitor cell differentiation and identifying  environmental signals that are specific for cell maintenance, cell  renewal and activation of differentiation pathways.   Research Objectives and Scope  In order to develop safe and effective stem cell-based treatments, it  is essential to understand the signals or cues that regulate the stem  cell capacity for self-renewal, cell fate determination, and  maintenance of orofacial tissue homeostasis throughout life. Therefore  the objectives of this RFA are to encourage research on:   o  the use of human embryonic stem cell lines listed in the NIH Human  Embryonic Stem Cell Registry. These cell lines can be used for  examining mechanisms of progenitor cell differentiation and may also  have characteristics that make them potentially useful for stem cell- based therapy;   o  progenitor cells of the orofacial ectoderm and the cranial neural  crest-derived mesenchyme, whose interaction during embryonic  development gives rise to the craniofacial tissues including teeth,  salivary glands, cartilage, bone, peripheral nerves, oral epithelium  and smooth muscle; and  o  adult stem cells in the orofacial and other body tissues (e.g., bone  marrow, fat, blood) that have the ability to give rise to oral, dental,  and craniofacial tissues and organs.  Topic areas of emphasis might include but are not limited to:   o  identification and characterization of the stem cell population(s)  in terms of molecular markers and cell lineage in oral, dental and  craniofacial tissues and organs;    o  design of conditions for maintenance, ex vivo, of cell populations  that retain their pluripotency or their multipotency;    o  use of stem cells to understand the genetic mechanisms that regulate  development of orofacial structures, the maintenance of tissues in  health and the repair or regeneration of tissues following trauma and disease;  o  development of markers that distinguish stem and progenitor  populations and gene profiles that characterize all stages of differentiation;    o  investigation of the mechanisms that regulate self-renewal of stem  cells in the oral epithelium, salivary gland, tooth structures and  other craniofacial structures (e.g., bone, cartilage, muscles and nerves);  o  use of stem cell lines to identify the environmental cues and  conditions that are required for a human embryonic stem cell to give  rise to cells that make up the different tissues of the orofacial complex;  o  identification of signals, signaling pathways components, and  transcriptional factors that regulate the fate(s) of transplanted human  stem cells and their derivatives;  o  identification, characterization, and reproduction of the  microenvironment (""niches"") of stem and progenitor cells;  o  identification of the optimal type of stem cell or stem cell  derivative for specific assays and cell therapy for orofacial diseases  and disorders;   o  use of animal model systems of oral, dental and craniofacial  diseases and disorders for screening and comparing the functional  capabilities of implanted human stem cells and their progeny.

If an  application is received after that date, it will be returned to the  applicant without review.   The Center for Scientific Review (CSR) will not accept any application  in response to this RFA that is essentially the same as one currently  pending initial review, unless the applicant withdraws the pending  application.  The CSR will not accept any application that is  essentially the same as one already reviewed. This does not preclude  the submission of substantial revisions of applications already  reviewed, but such applications must include an Introduction addressing  the previous critique.  PEER REVIEW PROCESS     Upon receipt, applications will be reviewed for completeness by the CSR  and responsiveness by the NIDCR.  Incomplete and/or non-responsive  applications will be returned to the applicant without further consideration.  Applications that are complete and responsive to the RFA will be  evaluated for scientific and technical merit by an appropriate peer  review group convened by the NIDCR in accordance with the review  criteria stated below.  As part of the initial merit review, all  applications will:  o  Undergo a process in which only those applications deemed to have  the highest scientific merit, generally the top half of the applications  under review, will be discussed and assigned a priority score o  Receive a written critique o  Receive a second level review by the NIDCR National Advisory Council.    REVIEW CRITERIA  The goals of NIH-supported research are to advance our understanding of  biological systems, improve the control of disease, and enhance health.   In the written comments, reviewers will be asked to discuss the  following aspects of your application in order to judge the likelihood  that the proposed research will have a substantial impact on the  pursuit of these goals:  o  Significance o  Approach o  Innovation o  Investigator o  Environment     The scientific review group will address and consider each of these  criteria in assigning your application's overall score, weighting them  as appropriate for each application.  Your application does not need to  be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major  scientific impact and thus deserve a high priority score.  For example,  you may propose to carry out important work that, by its nature, is not  innovative but is essential to move a field forward.  (1) SIGNIFICANCE:  Does your study address an important problem? If the  aims of your application are achieved, how do they advance scientific  knowledge?  What will be the effect of these studies on the concepts or  methods that drive this field?  (2) APPROACH:  Are the conceptual framework, design, methods, and  analyses adequately developed, well integrated, and appropriate to the  aims of the project?  Do you acknowledge potential problem areas and  consider alternative tactics?  (3) INNOVATION:  Does your project employ novel concepts, approaches or  methods? Are the aims original and innovative?  Does your project  challenge existing paradigms or develop new methodologies or technologies?  (4) INVESTIGATOR: Are you appropriately trained and well suited to  carry out this work?  Is the work proposed appropriate to your  experience level as the principal investigator and to that of the other  researchers (if any)?  (5) ENVIRONMENT:  Does the scientific environment in which your work  will be done contribute to the probability of success?  Do the proposed  experiments take advantage of unique features of the scientific  environment or employ useful collaborative arrangements?  Is there  evidence of institutional support?  ADDITIONAL REVIEW CRITERIA: In addition to the above criteria, your  application will also be reviewed with respect to the following:  o  PROTECTIONS:  The adequacy of the proposed protection for humans,  animals, or the environment, to the extent they may be adversely  affected by the project proposed in the application.  o  INCLUSION:  The adequacy of plans to include subjects from both  genders, all racial and ethnic groups (and subgroups), and children as  appropriate for the scientific goals of the research.  Plans for the  recruitment and retention of subjects will also be evaluated. (See  Inclusion Criteria included in the section on Federal Citations, below)  o  BUDGET:  The reasonableness of the proposed budget and the requested  period of support in relation to the proposed research.  RECEIPT AND REVIEW SCHEDULE  Letter of Intent Receipt Date:    March 18, 2002 Application Receipt Date:         April 18, 2002 Peer Review Date:                 June, 2002 Council Review:                   August, 2002 Earliest Anticipated Start Date:  September, 2002  AWARD CRITERIA  Criteria that will be used to make award decisions include:  o  Scientific merit (as determined by peer review) o  Availability of funds o  Programmatic priorities.   REQUIRED FEDERAL CITATIONS  INCLUSION OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES IN CLINICAL RESEARCH: It is the policy  of the NIH that women and members of minority groups and their sub- populations must be included in all NIH-supported clinical research  projects unless a clear and compelling justification is provided  indicating that inclusion is inappropriate with respect to the health of  the subjects or the purpose of the research. This policy results from  the NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 (Section 492B of Public Law 103-43).  All investigators proposing clinical research should read the AMENDMENT  ""NIH Guidelines for Inclusion of Women and Minorities as Subjects in  Clinical Research - Amended, October, 2001,"" published in the NIH Guide  for Grants and Contracts on October 9, 2001  ( http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-02-001.html );  a complete copy of the updated Guidelines are available at   http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/women_min/guidelines_amended_10_2001.htm .   The amended policy incorporates: the use of an NIH  definition of clinical research; updated racial and ethnic categories  in compliance with the new OMB standards; clarification of language  governing NIH-defined Phase III clinical trials consistent with the new  PHS Form 398; and updated roles and responsibilities of NIH staff and  the extramural community.  The policy continues to require for all NIH- defined Phase III clinical trials that: a) all applications or  proposals and/or protocols must provide a description of plans to  conduct analyses, as appropriate, to address differences by sex/gender  and/or racial/ethnic groups, including subgroups if applicable; and b)  investigators must report annual accrual and progress in conducting  analyses, as appropriate, by sex/gender and/or racial/ethnic  group differences.  INCLUSION OF CHILDREN AS PARTICIPANTS IN RESEARCH INVOLVING HUMAN  SUBJECTS: The NIH maintains a policy that children (i.e., individuals  under the age of 21) must be included in all human subjects research,  conducted or supported by the NIH, unless there are scientific and  ethical reasons not to include them. This policy applies to all initial  (Type 1) applications submitted for receipt dates after October 1, 1998.  All investigators proposing research involving human subjects should  read the ""NIH Policy and Guidelines"" on the inclusion of children as  participants in research involving human subjects that is available at   http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/children/children.htm .  REQUIRED EDUCATION ON THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECT PARTICIPANTS: NIH  policy requires education on the protection of human subject  participants for all investigators submitting NIH proposals for  research involving human subjects.

DRAFT               the Ethics of Stem Cell Research               Paul Lauritzen                Professor, Department of Religious Studies                Director, Program in Applied Ethics                John Carroll University,                 University Heights, Ohio                                 JuLY 2003                                                  . . . the final stage is come when man by eugenics, by prenatal                  conditioning, and by an education and propaganda based on perfect                  applied psychology, has obtained full control over himself. Human                  nature will be the last part of nature to surrender to man. (Lewis,                  1947)                 This sudden shift from a belief in Nurture, in the form of social                  conditioning, to Nature, in the form of genetics and brain physiology                  is the great intellectual event, to borrow Nietzsche’s term,                  of the late twentieth century. (Wolfe, 2001)                             I begin with passages from an unlikely pair of authors because                although C. S. Lewis and Tom Wolfe are somewhat distant in time,                certainly different in temperament, and extravagantly different                in personal style, they share an imaginative capacity to envision                the possible consequences of modern technology. The technology that                occasioned Lewis’s reflections?“the aeroplane, the wireless,                and the contraceptive” may now seem quaint, but his warning                about turning humans into artifacts, that accompanied the passage                quoted above, is eerily prescient. Similarly, although he does not                directly take up stem cell research, Tom Wolfe’s reflections                on brain imaging technology, neuropharmacology, and genomics are                worth noting in relation to the future of stem cell research. In                his inimitable way, Wolfe summarizes his view of the implications                of this technology in the title of the essay from which the above                passage comes. “Sorry,” he says, “but your soul                just died.”                The point of beginning with Lewis and Wolfe, then, is not that I                share their dire predictions about the fate to which they believe                technology propels us; instead, I begin with these writers because                they invite us to take an expansive view of technology. I believe                that such a perspective is needed and is in fact emerging in recent                work on stem cell research. This is not to say that the sort of                traditional analysis that has framed much of the debate on stem                cells, analysis that involves issues of embryo status, autonomy,                and informed consent, for example, is unhelpful; far from it. Nevertheless,                traditional moral analysis of stem cell research is nicely complemented                by a consideration of the “big picture” questions that                Lewis and Wolfe both wish to press. This report will therefore seek                to draw attention to the literature on stem cell research that attends                both to the narrow and to the expansive bioethical issues raised                by this research.                                The Moral Status of the Embryo                  There is little doubt that public reflection on stem cell research                  in the United States has been affected by the extraordinarily                  volatile cross-currents of the abortion debate. Although I will                  indicate below several reasons why framing the stem cell debate                  as a subset of that on abortion is problematic, nevertheless,                  in its current form, stem cell research is debated in terms dictated                  by the abortion controversy, and that has meant that questions                  about the status of the embryo have been particularly prominent. 1                   For example, the National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC)                  described the ethical issues raised by stem cell research as “principally                  related to the current sources and/or methods of deriving these                  cells” (NBAC, 1999, 45). A policy brief from the American                  Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) begins its discussion                  of the ethical dispute over stem cell research by citing the disagreement                  over the status of the embryo as the decisive variable leading                  to fundamentally different views on this research (AAAS, 1999,                  11). The National Academy of Sciences’s report on stem cell                  research claims that “the most basic [ethical] objection                  to embryonic stem cell research is rooted in the fact that such                  research deprives a human embryo of any further potential to develop                  into a complete human being” (National Academy of Sciences,                  2002, 44). The Ethics Advisory Board of the Geron Corporation                  lists the moral status question as the first moral consideration                  relevant to deciding the acceptability of stem cell research (Geron                  Corporation Ethics Advisory Board, 1999, 32). The list could go                  on.                                    Despite the fact that these statements all insist on the importance                  of the status question, they also recognize that the debate about                  the status of the early embryo is not new and that the controversy                  over stem cell research does not, strictly speaking, raise novel                  issues in this regard. Indeed, it is probably best to place the                  initial skirmishes over stem cell research in the context of moral                  debates about human embryo research generally. In fact, it is                  worth noting that the report of the NIH Human Embryo Research                  Panel (HERP), published in 1994, explicitly identified the isolation                  of human embryonic stem cells as one of thirteen areas of research                  with preimplantation embryos that might yield significant scientific                  benefit and that should be considered for federal funding (See                  NIH HERP, 1994, ch. 2).                                    Although the recommendations of the HERP were never implemented,                  the fact that a high-profile panel reviewed  ex utero                   preimplantation human embryo research and explicitly endorsed                  stem cell research, meant that the panel report would affect the                  policy debate about stem cell research, even though its recommendation                  that the derivation and use of stem cells be federally funded                  was not adopted. For one thing, the panel’s anticipatory                  support for stem cell research assured that when human stem cells                  were actually derived several years later, the debate that ensued                  would be tied to the abortion controversy. As members of the HERP                  panel have made clear, from the start, the work of the panel was                  embroiled in controversy. For example, shortly after the HERP                  was impaneled, thirty-two members of Congress wrote to Harold                  Varmus, the director of NIH, to complain about the composition                  of the panel. A lawsuit was filed in an attempt to prevent the                  panel from meeting, and members of the panel received threatening                  letters and phone calls (Green, 1994; Tauer, 1995; Hall, 2003).                                    Given the pro-life opposition to the HERP panel and its recommendations,                  it is no real surprise that initial reactions to the prospect                  of human stem cell research fell out along the fault lines of                  abortion politics in the country. By and large, individuals and                  groups opposed to abortion tended to be opposed to stem cell research,                  and individuals and groups supportive of legalized abortion tended                  to support stem cell research.  2                   For example, the testimony that Richard Doerflinger, the principal                  spokesperson for the U.S. Catholic bishops on pro-life matters,                  offered before the Senate Appropriation Subcommittee on Labor,                  Health, and Education in 1998 was substantially the same as that                  he offered before the HERP in 1994 on stem cell research (Doerflinger,                  1998, 1994). In both cases, the fundamental issue was the status                  of the embryo. Given Catholic teaching that the embryo must be                  treated as a person from conception, no experimentation on the                  embryo can be allowed that would not also be allowed on infants                  or children. Hence, the Catholic church treats stem cell research                  as it has treated previous issues involving the destruction of                  human embryos; it is condemned as morally abhorrent.                                     In similar fashion, the arguments reviewed by the HERP panel that                  supported embryo research generally in 1994, were mobilized again                  four years later when stem cell research was the specific point                  of contention; and again the focal point was embryo status. Consequently,                  just as the HERP report opted for a “pluralistic”                  view of the embryo that emphasized its developmental potential,                  so, too, did the NBAC endorse the idea that the early embryo deserves                  respect, but is not to be treated fully as a person. 3                                     Moreover, the fact that the HERP defended its support of stem                  cell research by stressing the developmental capacity of the embryo                  also shaped the trajectory of much subsequent support for this                  work, because insisting on respect for the embryo but denying                  its personhood meant explaining how one could respect the embryo                  while nevertheless destroying it. Daniel Callahan, for example,                  posed this problem very strongly in response to the HERP report.                  If “profound respect” for the embryo is compatible                  with destroying it, he asked, “What in the world can that                  kind of respect mean?” It is, he says, “an odd form                  of esteem?at once high-minded and altogether lethal” (Callahan,                  1995). Callahan was not alone in raising this issue and attempts                  to answer his question continue to appear in the literature (See                  Lebacqz, 2001; Meyer and Nelson, 2001; Ryan, “Creating Embryos,”                  2001; Steinbock, 2001, 2000).                                    In retrospect, then, it seems that the HERP report served almost                  as choreography for the initial debates about stem cell research,                  and, as a result, the steps in the debate closely followed those                  that are familiar from the abortion controversy (On this point,                  see Hall 2003). The upshot, in my view, is that much of the debate                  has been too narrowly focused and has a kind of repetitive and                  rigid quality to it. As I noted above, for example, the Catholic                  church has repeatedly claimed that the central issue raised by                  stem cell research is that it involves the destruction of human                  embryos, embryos it believes should be treated as persons. 4                   For that reason, the rhetoric with which the Catholic church condemns                  embryonic stem cell research closely parallels that used to condemn                  abortion. Yet, because the American bishops do not want to be                  perceived as anti-science, they have also repeatedly and uncritically                  praised adult stem cell research, even though there are good reasons,                  given Catholic concerns about social justice, to be concerned                  about the pursuit of adult stem cell research. I will return to                  this point below, but for now I wish simply to note that much                  of the opposition to embryonic stem cell work has resembled Catholic                  opposition in being circumscribed by questions of embryo status,                  narrowly construed.                                     A similar constriction, however, is also apparent in the preoccupations                  of supporters of stem cell research. Just as opponents of this                  research have ritualistically condemned the destruction of early                  embryos but uncritically celebrated adult stem cell work, supporters                  of embryonic stem cell research have typically insisted on using                  embryos left over from IVF procedures, while repudiating the use                  of embryos created solely for research. Indeed, insisting on the                  distinction between so-called “spare” embryos and                  “research” embryos and endorsing only the use of spare                  embryos has been one way that supporters of embryo research have                  tried to demonstrate their “respect” for the embryo.                  Yet, it is worth asking whether the spare embryo/research embryo                  distinction does not, to borrow Daniel Callahan’s image,                  provide a kind of “wafting incense” to mask what supporters                  still find a disquieting smell (Callahan, 1995). 5                                                       Although the debate about stem cell research might have been framed                  in terms of the abortion controversy in any event, the HERP report                  insured that the initial debate over stem cell work that followed                  in aftermath of the public announcement of the work of John Gearhart                  (Shamblott et al., 1998) and James Thomson in 1998 (Thomson et                  al.) would be navigated in the wake of the conflict over abortion.                  As I indicated, the upshot is that the discussion about stem cell                  research has been more cramped than it might otherwise have been.                  The discussion has been too focused on the details of embryological                  development; too focused on the differences between those who                  view the early embryo as a person and those who do not; and far                  too individualistically oriented. Before turning to ways that                  the debate might be become less cramped, let me focus more concretely                  on these difficulties.                                    The point about the debate being framed too individualistically                  is nicely illustrated in an article on abortion by Lisa Sowle                  Cahill entitled “Abortion, Autonomy, and Community”                  (Cahill, 1996). Cahill begins this article by claiming that, in                  discussing the morality of abortion, there is no way to avoid                  the question of the status of the fetus. Nevertheless, she says,                  the debate about fetal status is almost always conducted with                  the goal of determining the rights involved, where rights are                  understood very individualistically. To the degree that the fetus                  is acknowledged to have rights, those rights are pitted against                  the rights of the pregnant women. Although Cahill doubts that                  we can jettison the use of rights language altogether, if we are                  going to use rights language, she says, we must “remove                  that language from the context of moral and political liberalism”                  (361). If we do so, we might be able to see that we have duties                  and obligations to which we do not explicitly consent. As Cahill                  puts it, “such obligations originate simply in the sorts                  of reciprocal relatedness that constitutes being a human”                  (361). 6  For example, moving                  away from an individualistic liberal view of the pregnant woman                  as primarily or exclusively an autonomous moral agent might lead                  us to recognize the obligations that individuals and communities                  have to support her during and after a burdensome pregnancy (363).                                    We do not need to accept Cahill’s commitment to the Catholic                  common good tradition to recognize the truth in her conclusion                  that pitting the rights of the fetus against the rights of the                  pregnant woman individualistically construed leads us to overlook                  important social dimensions of the problem of abortion. It seems                  to me that much the same dynamic is evident in the stem cell research                  debate.                                    Consider again the central argument that the Catholic church has                  made against stem cell research. The Pontifical Academy for Life                  suggests that the fundamental ethical issue is whether it is morally                  licit to produce or use human embryos to derive embryonic stem                  cells. The reasoning the Academy provides for concluding it is                  not licit is worth reproducing in full. The Academy lists five                  points:                  1. On the basis of a complete biological analysis, the living                  human embryo is — from the moment of the union of the gametes                  — a  human subject  with a well defined identity,                  which from that point begins its own  coordinated, continuous                  and gradual development , such that at no later stage can                  it be considered as a simple mass of cells.                                     2. From this it follows that as a “ human individual ”                  it has the  right  to its own life; and therefore every                  intervention which is not in favor of the embryo is an act which                  violates that right. . . .                                    3. Therefore, the ablation of the inner cell mass (ICM) of the                  blastocyst, which critically and irremediably damages the human                  embryo, curtailing its development, is a  gravely immoral                   act and consequently is  gravely illicit .                                     4.  No end believed to be good,  such as the use of stem                  cells for the preparation of other differentiated cells to be                  used in what look to be promising therapeutic procedures,  can                  justify an intervention of this kind . A good end does not                  make right an action which in itself is wrong.                                     5. For Catholics, this position is explicitly confirmed by the                  Magisterium of the Church which, in the Encyclical  Evangelium                  Vitae , with reference to the Instruction  Donum Vitae                   of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, affirms: “The                  Church has always taught and continues to teach that the result                  of human procreation, from the first moment of its existence,                  must be guaranteed that unconditional respect which is morally                  due to the human being in his or her totality and unity in body                  and spirit: The human being is to be respected and treated as                  a person from the moment of conception; and therefore from that                  same moment his rights as a person must be recognized, among which                  in the first place is the inviolable right of every innocent human                  being to life’”(No. 60). (Pontifical Academy for Life,                  2000; emphasis in original)                              Notice that the core of the argument, namely points one and two,                is framed in terms of the rights of the individual embryo. We have                seen this emphasis already in noting Richard Doerflinger’s                various statements on stem cell research. Yet, notice also the claim                that we know the embryo to be an individual with rights on the basis                of “a complete biological analysis.” This is not, of                course, the first time that the Catholic church has made this claim.                In the Declaration on Procured Abortion, the Congregation for the                Doctrine of the Faith claimed that “modern genetic science”                confirms the view that “from the first instant, the programme                is fixed as to what this living being will be: a man, this individual-man                with his characteristic aspects already well determined” ( Congregation ,                “Declaration on Procured Abortion,”1974, 13). The Instruction                on reproductive technology,   Donum Vitae , also                makes this claim. “The conditions of science regarding the                human embryo provide a valuable indication for discerning by the                use of reason a personal presence at the moment of the first appearance                of a human life: how could a human individual not be a human person?”                ( Donum Vitae , 13).                                 One reason the Catholic church has played such a major role in framing                the stem cell debate is that, in defending its position, it combines                the two claims we have just noted, neither of which is explicitly                religious. First, the early embryo is an individual person with                rights and, second, the fact that the embryo is an individual person                is confirmed by modern science. Indeed, a fair amount of the literature                that supports embryo research generally can be read as an attempt                to answer the question posed in  Donum Vitae : How                can a human individual not be a human person?                                Certainly Catholic writers who reject the church’s teaching                on the status of the embryo have responded directly to that question                (See Cahill, 1993; Farley, 2001; McCormick, 1994; Shannon, 2001;                Shannon and Walter, 1990), but so too have non-Catholics. For example,                in a statement issued by their ethics committee, what was then called                the American Fertility Society rejected the claim in  Donum Vitae                 that science supports the personhood of the embryo. According to                the ethics committee “. . . it remains fundamentally inconsistent                to assign the status of human individual to the human zygote or                early pre-embryo when compelling biological evidence demonstrates                that individuation, even in a primitive biologic sense, is not yet                established. Thus, homologues (identical) twins may result from                spontaneous cleavage of the pre-embryo at some point after fertilization                but prior to the completion of implantation. Furthermore, during                very early development, an embryo is not clearly established and                awaits the differentiation between the trophoblast and the embryoblast”                (American Fertility Society, 1988, 3S).                                Arguably, writers like Mary Anne Warren and Bonnie Steinbock, who                distinguish between biological or genetic humanity and moral humanity,                are also at least indirectly answering the question posed in  Donum                Vitae  (Warren, 1997; Steinbock 2001, 1992). Yet, whether writers                are responding more or less directly to Catholic discourse, or not                at all, the important point is that the stem cell debate has been                remarkably preoccupied with the question of whether the early embryo                is an individual person and whether and how the minute details of                embryological development help us to answer this question. This                is one reason why a fair amount of the ethics literature on the                topic reads like a textbook on embryology.                                I want to be clear here: I am not suggesting that the details of                embryological development are unimportant. The maxim from the field                of research ethics applies here as well: bad science is bad ethics.                My point is rather that the preoccupation with the details of early                embryogenesis may lock us even more rigidly into an individualistic                human rights framework than we are in debates about abortion. It                also leads us to frame the debate as fundamentally about one question,                and, indeed, it tempts us to treat the question as if there is one                and only one answer. In this frame of mind, once we have that answer,                there is not a lot more to talk about. Either the early embryo is                a person with the right to life, in which case embryonic stem cell                research is wrong, or the early embryo is not a person with rights,                and then there is no moral reason to object to stem cell work. Gene                Outka has made a similar point in his assessment of stem cell literature.                As Outka puts it, in its starkest form, the crystallizing question                is whether it is cogent to claim that embryonic stem cell research                is morally indistinguishable from murder (Outka, 184). The problem                with framing the question this way, he says, is that it “encourages                an unfortunate tendency to restrict evaluative possibilities to                a single either/or. Either one judges abortion and the destruction                of embryos to be  transparent  instances of treating fetuses                and embryos as mere means to other’s ends, or one judges abortion                and embryonic stem cell research to be,  in themselves ,                morally  indifferent  actions that should be evaluated  solely                 in terms of the benefit they bring to others.” (Outka, 2002,                184).                                The frame of human rights reinforces this either/or because, as                I noted, a being is either a rights-bearing entity or it is not.                I have argued elsewhere, that this either/or tends to drive people                to the extremes. Either the embryo is a person or it is essentially                a kind of property (Lauritzen, 2001). Although I will not rehearse                the argument for rejecting the two extremes here, it is worth noting                that the rhetoric associated with each extreme does not appear to                match the practice of those who adopt the rhetoric or in fact to                match the considered moral judgments of most Americans on these                issues.                                I can illustrate my point in relation to the view that the early                embryo is a person with the right to life by describing a cartoon                that hangs on my office door (See appendix A). The cartoon depicts                protestors in front of a stem cell research lab condemning those                who work there as being anti-life. Down the street at the abortion                clinic, the workers are noting how quiet things have gotten at their                facility since the stem cell lab opened. The point of the cartoon,                of course, is that we may soon see protests and demonstrations of                the sort that are common at abortion clinics at facilities that                conduct stem cell research and that there is an irony in the fact                that pro-life advocates would be demonstrating against research                being done to find treatments for Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s,                and other devastating illnesses. This is not entirely fair to the                pro-life community, but it makes a point.                                In fact, I do not have trouble imaging protestors picketing stem                cell research facilities for, as we just noted, when stem cell research                and abortion are evaluated together and when the evaluative option                is a single either/or, then abortion and stem cell research may                appear indistinguishable from murder. Certainly the rhetoric of                someone like Richard Doerflinger has been consistent in condemning                both abortion and stem cell research as equivalent to murder. The                cartoon draws attention to this consistency, even while it questions                the commitment of pro-life advocates to scientific research designed                to promote the quality of life.                                In one sense, then, the cartoon probes whether there is an inconsistency                between being pro-life and opposed to research an Alzheimer’s                disease, Parkinson’s disease, and other devastating illnesses.                I do not myself think that there is any inconsistency in being pro-life                and opposed to stem cell research, but the cartoon does point in                the direction of a fairly significant disconnect between the rhetoric                and the reality of those opposed to stem cell research because they                believe the early embryo is a person. To see this point, imagine                that, instead of a stem cell clinic, the cartoon depicted on IVF                clinic down the block from the abortion clinic and that the workers                at the abortion clinic are noting how quiet things have gotten since                the IVF clinic opened. The dramatic tension that made the original                cartoon funny would be missing from our revised cartoon precisely                because it is hard to imagine protestors disrupting the work at                IVF clinics. To be sure, the Catholic church and others have argued                that IVF is morally wrong, but the rhetoric condemning IVF is exceptionally                muted compared to that condemning abortion or stem cell research.                Nor has there been a concerted effort to put an end to IVF practice                in this country as there has been in the case of abortion and stem                cell research. Yet, if the embryo is a person from conception, then                participating in IVF as it is practiced in this country, when early                embryos are routinely frozen or discarded or both, is to be complicit                with murder. Why, then, are there no organized efforts to shut down                IVF clinics in this country?  7                                Indeed, opponents of stem cell research and cloning often write                as if these technologies raise the haunting specter of human embryo                research for the first time. The reality, of course, is that the                existence of in vitro fertilization depended entirely on embryo                research and that every variation or innovation in IVF protocols                involves experimentation on human embryos. Carol Tauer is one of                the few scholars who has pressed this point. As Tauer sees it:                                              . . . the entire history of the research leading to the first                  successful IVF is the history of attempts to fertilize oocytes                  in the laboratory. Eventually these attempts succeeded, and the                  first IVF baby was born, followed by thousands of others in the                  ensuing decades.                              The ethics literature contains scholarly discussions as to whether              it is ethically permissible to make use of medical advances that result              from unethical research. This discussion sometimes focuses on medical              research conducted by the Nazis in concentration camps and institutions              for retarded, mentally ill, and handicapped persons. Yet I have never              seen reference to reproductive technologies in this context. If the              fertilization of embryos in research is a practice that is abhorrent              to many or most people, then would it not be logical to question the              continuing use of the results of such research? (Even the Catholic              Church, which opposes the use of IVF and most other forms of assisted              reproduction, does not invoke this argument to support its opposition.)              (Tauer, 2001, 153)               If the embryo research associated with IVF points to a problem                of consistency for those who oppose stem cell research because it                involves destroying persons, it is no less problematic for those                who support stem cell research but insist on respecting the embryo                and embrace the distinction between “research” and “spare”                embryos. For as Tauer points out, Robert Edwards, the scientist                involved in the first successful IVF procedure, began studying fertilization                nearly thirty years before Louise Brown was born in 1978, and the                first successful laboratory fertilization of human eggs took place                a full ten years before she was born. Tauer quotes Edwards’                report on this work: “We fertilized many more eggs and were                able to make detailed examinations of the successive stages of fertilization.                We also took care to photograph everything because we would have                to persuade colleagues of the truth of our discoveries” (Tauer,                154). 8  Nor was the creation of                these “research” embryos done secretly: Edwards and                Steptoe published their work in the journal,  Nature  in                1970 (Edwards, Steptoe, and Purdy, 1970).                                At the very least, then, there is something of an irony in the fact                that so much attention has been devoted to developing and defending                the distinctions between embryos created solely for research and                embryos left over from IVF procedures, because there would be no                embryos left over from IVF procedures had there not been embryos                created solely for research purposes to develop IVF in the first                place. Given this fact, and given that this fact is no great secret?even                though it has not been discussed very much?it appears disingenuous                to endorse the distinction between “research” and “spare”                embryos as a way of demonstrating respect for the early embryo while                nevertheless encouraging its destruction.                                I have suggested that the fact that so much of the stem cell debate                has been framed in terms of whether the embryo is a person with                rights has been unfortunate because it has cast the debate in sharply                individualistic terms and has led to a preoccupation with embryological                development narrowly construed. In addition, however, framing the                debate in terms of embryo status and embryo rights tends to exaggerate                the differences among commentators in contrast to their similarities.                Consider, for example, the response of conservative Judaism in the                United States to this issue. Rabbi Elliot Dorff has prepared a responsum                on stem cell research for the Rabbinical Assembly Committee on Jewish                Law and Standards, and his responsum is instructive. 9                                                 As responsa are, it is structured in terms of relevant questions:                in this case, two questions frame Dorff’s discussion. First,                “may embryonic stem cells from frozen embryos originally created                for purposes of procreation or embryonic germ cells from aborted                fetuses be used for research?” (Dorff, 2002, 1). Second, “may                embryonic stem cells from embryos created specifically for research,                either by combining donated sperm and eggs in a petri dish or by                cloning be used for research?” (1) I think it is noteworthy                that the very questions that frame Dorff’s analysis both reflect                and perpetuate a certain construction of the issue, but at this                juncture, my point is different: given the way the debate has been                framed, what most (non-Jewish) readers of Dorff’s analysis                are likely to focus on is the difference between his treatment of                the early embryo and that of others in the literature. Indeed, even                where you might expect to find?and do in fact find on closer inspection?similarities                between this Jewish analysis and Catholic reflection on this issue,                the first impression will be that of difference. The reason, of                course, is that our attention is drawn to Dorff’s analysis                of the early embryo, and Jewish views are sharply different about                embryo status than those of the Catholic church and other pro-life                opponents of stem cell work. 10                                For example, Dorff points out that, according to the Talmud, during                the first forty days of gestation, the embryo and the fetus are                considered as simply water. From the forty-first day until birth,                Jewish tradition considers the fetus as “the thigh of its                mother.” Moreover, says Dorff:                              As it happens, modern science provides good evidence to support                the Rabbis’ understanding. As Rabbi Immanuel Jakobovits noted                long ago, the Rabbis’ “forty days” is, by our                obstetrical count, approximately fifty-six days, for the Rabbis                counted from the woman’s first missed menstrual flow, while                doctors today count from the point of conception, which is usually                about two weeks earlier. By 56 days of gestation by obstetrical                count the basic organs have already appeared in the fetus. Moreover,                we now know that it is exactly at eight weeks of gestation that                the fetus begins to get bone structure and therefore looks like                something other than liquid. Indeed, the Rabbis probably came to                their conclusion about the stages of development of the fetus because                early miscarriages indeed looked like “merely water,”                while those from 56 days on looks like a thigh with flesh and bones.                (16)                            The contrast with Catholic teaching could hardly be more striking.              Not only are Jewish views of the status of the early embryo notably              different, but Jewish tradition claims scientific validation for its              view of the embryo, just as Catholic tradition does. Not surprisingly,              therefore, where Dorff answers both questions posed by the responsum              in the affirmative, Catholic tradition would answer both negatively.                            These differences are significant and must be attended to, but it              is worth asking whether focusing on these differences does not obscure              important similarities. Consider some of the similarities. In sketching              the Jewish view of stem cell research, Dorff notes that certain theological              commitments are central. He lists at least three that would be strikingly              similar to Catholic and other Christian theological commitments.                               Our bodies are not ours; they belong to God and God commands                  that we seek to preserve life and health.                                 All human beings, regardless of ability or disability are created                  in the image of God and are therefore to be valued as such.                                  Humans are not God. We are finite and fallible and this fact                  ought to promote humility and urge caution.                            Now if we focused merely on questions of embryo status, we would miss              entirely these similarities between Catholic and Jewish views. More              importantly, we would miss the fact that these similarities may underwrite              significant moral reflection on stem cell research that is not rooted              in concerns about the early embryo.                            For example, Dorff notes that, given Jewish theological and legal              commitments, the provision of health care must be understood as a              communal responsibility. Thus, access to therapies developed through              stem cell research is a crucial issue of justice for the Jewish community.              This theme is echoed in Laurie Zoloth’s work on stem cell research.              As Zoloth puts it:                             Research done always will mean research foregone. Will this research              help or avoid the problem of access to health, given that poverty              and poor health are so desperately intertwined in this country? .              . . How can difficult issues of global justice and fair distribution              be handled in research involving private enterprise? (Zoloth, 2001,              238)                            Surely these are questions that any Catholic moral theologian would              gladly press.                            Indeed, attending to the similarities between Zoloth’s work              and Catholic reflection on stem cell research brings us back to Lisa              Cahill’s observation about debates on abortion: they tend to              be too focused on questions of rights individually construed. When              one shifts the frame of analysis, new and different issues and new              and different ways to approach the same issues come into view. Notice,              for example, how close Zoloth and Cahill are on the issue of rights.              According to Zoloth, Jewish tradition foregrounds questions of “obligations,              duties, and just relationships to the other, rather than the protection              of rights, privacy, or ownership of the autonomous self” (96).              This leads Zoloth to ask: “Can the interests of the vulnerable              be heard in our debate?” (105). To be sure, the American bishops              have wanted to emphasize the vulnerability of the early embryo when              they have asked this question, but Catholic tradition, like Jewish              tradition, requires that we ask this question in a way that is not              captured when moral emphasis is merely about individual rights and              personal autonomy.                            Or consider another shared sensibility that emerges if we move away              from questions of embryo status, namely a wariness about the human              tendency to hubris and overreaching. Zoloth put this point eloquently              in relation to the biblical story of the Tower of Babel. She notes              a rabbinic midrash on this text: “when a worker was killed,              no one wept, but when a brick fell, all wept.” Zoloth comments              on this midrash as follows:                               It was this decentering of the human and reification of the thing                that was the catastrophe that felled the enterprise . . . It is                not just that they breached a limit between what is appropriate                to create and what is not, the process of the creation must be carefully                mediated, with deep respect for persons over the temptations of                the enterprise. Such a text elaborates on the tension between repairing                the world . . . and acts that claim that the world is ours to control                utterly (Zoloth, 2001, 106-107).               Beyond Questions of Embryo Status              This passage from Zoloth helps to illustrate the point I wish to make              in arguing that the stem cell debate has been too focused on questions              of embryo status and that we must move beyond status questions if              we are fully to do justice to the moral questions raised by technological              developments associated with stem cell work. For concern about human              efforts utterly to control the world is not a moral worry narrowly              tied to status questions.                            Let me put this point in the form of a question that has not typically              been asked in the stem cell debate: Is adult stem cell work as unproblematic              as it is often assumed to be? That this is a productive question is              suggested by testimony of Francis Collins before the President’s              Council on Bioethics in December 2002. Collins was asked to speak              about the topic, “genetic enhancements: current and future prospects”              and he specifically addressed the issue of pre-implantation genetic              diagnosis (PGD). Although PGD is usually understood to involve screening              IVF embryos and discarding unwanted ones, it is also possible to screen              gametes. Because gamete screening may not have broad utility, Collins              did not discuss the issue at length. He did, however, offer an interesting              observation about gamete selection. Focusing on gametes, he says,              is useful because it “isolates you away from some of the other              compelling arguments about moral status of the embryo and allows a              sort of cleaner discussion about what are the social goods or evils              associated with broad alterations in the sex ratio and inequities              in access to that technology” (Collins, 2002, 7). In other words,              if in the future we could screen gametes in the same way that we can              now screen embryos, most of the moral issues raised by PGD would apply              to gamete screening, even though gametes are not embryos. Might we              not make a similar claim about embryonic and adult stem cell research?              Do not many of the most pressing issues raised by embryonic stem cell              technology remain when our focus is adult stem cell work rather than              embryonic stem cell research?                            The fact that we do not immediately answer yes to this question, is              testament to how decisively the debate about abortion has structured              the stem cell debate. Nevertheless, we need to see that the answer              to this question is yes and we need to see why.                             Although I will not try to address all of the issues raised jointly              by embryonic and adult stem cell research, it is worth highlighting              several that I think require fuller discussion?particularly with respect              to adult stem cell work?than they have yet received.                             Commodification Issues              Moral concerns about the commodification of gametes and embryos have              been discussed extensively in the bioethics literature both in relation              to reproductive technology and in connection with embryonic stem cell              work (See Andrews and Nelkin, 2001; Annas, 1998; Corea, 1986; Radin,              1996; Resnik, 2002; Ryan,  Ethics and Economics , 2001). Suzanne              Holland, for example, has discussed the growing commodification of              the human body in the biotech age. She cites a series of articles              published in the Orange County Register that documents a vast for-profit              market in human body tissue (Holland, 2001, 266). The  Register’s               investigative reporters documented that most nonprofit tissue              banks obtain tissue from cadavers donated by family members of the              deceased for altruistic reasons. Most relatives are not told, and              in fact have no idea, that donated body parts will be sold for profit.              As Holland puts it:                               The “gift of life” is big business in America. For a                nonprofit tissue bank, one typical donation can yield between $14,000                and $34,000 in downstream sales, sometimes far more than that. “Skins,                tendons, heart valves, veins, and corneas are listed at about $110,000.                Add bone from the same body, and one cadaver can be worth about                $220,000.” Four of the largest nonprofit tissue banks told                the Orange County Register that together they expected to produce                sales totaling $261 million in 2000. (226)                              Nor is the issue of downstream commodification restricted to the                sale of donated cadaveric tissue; it arises in relation to IVF embryos                donated for research. As Dorothy Nelkin and Lori Andrews point out                in their book,  Body Bazaar,  IVF patients are not generally                told what the research involving their donated embryos will include.                Many will be unaware that their embryos will be used to develop                commercial stem cell lines (Nelkin and Andrews, 2001, 35).                                 It is significant that even the most vocal advocates of procreative                liberty and laissez-faire arrangements in reproductive matters recoil                from the prospect of selling human embryos. Yet, although the commodification                of tissue may be particularly troubling when it involves embryos,                if there is a problem with commodifying and commercializing human                tissue, it is a problem we confront with adult stem cell research                as well as with hES cell work. Lori Knowles has made a similar point                about being consistent in our moral judgments about commodifying                embryos. She notes that fears about commodifying reproduction have                led many to oppose the sale of embryos and to reject the idea that                couples who donate embryos have any proprietary interest in the                result of the research done with their embryos. As Knowles puts                it, “if it is wrong to commercialize embryos because of their                nature, then it is wrong for everyone. It is simply inconsistent                to argue that couples should act altruistically because commercializing                embryos is wrong, while permitting corporations and scientists to                profit financially from cells derived by destroying those embryos”                (Knowles, 1999, 40).                                Knowles draws attention here to the fact that there is a tension                between our moral and legal traditions as they apply to developments                brought about by cloning, stem cell research, and the existence                of ex utero human embryos, among other technological breakthroughs.                For example, we patent embryonic stem cell lines, thereby insuring                massive profits for patent holders, while decrying the commodification                of embryonic life. Knowles is correct that there is a tension between                our profit-based medical research model and our commitment to altruism                and the access to health care that a commitment to justice demands.                Adult stem cell research, of course, raises very similar issues,                because the same tension exists between the need for proprietary                control of technology and the need for affordable access. For example,                patents have been sought and granted for human adult stem cells                work as well as for embryonic stem cell technologies. According                to a study on the patenting of inventions related to stem cell research                commissioned by the European Group on Ethics in Science and New                Technologies, as of October 2001, two thousand twenty-nine patents                were applied or granted for stem cells and 512 patents were applied                or granted for embryonic stem cell work (Van Overwalle, 2002, 23;                see also McGee and Banger, 2002). As a result, access to therapies                developed from adult stem cell research is likely to be as serious                an issue as access to embryonic stem cell therapies.                                Indeed, issues arising from commodification of both adult and embryonic                stem cells are likely to dominate the next phase of the debate,                if only because corporate interest in this work, both nationally                and internationally, is so strong (Hill, 2003). Noting that, as                of 2002, “a dozen biotech companies have entered the stem                cell industry and have invested millions of dollars,” David                Resnik suggests that the next stage of the stem cell debate will                involve a battle over property rights relating to stem cells (Resnik,                2002, 130-31).                                To be sure, the battle over property rights raises important legal                and policy question, but it also raises ethical questions as well.                For example, Resnik provides the following table of possible ethical                objections to patenting stem cells.                                                                               Deontological Objections to Property                      Rights in ES cells                   Consequentialist Objections to Property                      Rights in ES cells                                                                        ES cells (and their products) should not be                      treated as property; they should be viewed as having inherent                      dignity or respect.   ES cells should not                      be treated as private property; they are  res communis                       or common property.                                        Treating ES cells as property will have dire social consequences,                      such as exploitation, destruction of altruism, and loss of                      respect for the value of human life.   Treating ES cells                      as property will undermine scientific discovery and technological                      innovation in the field of regenerative medicine. (Resnik,                      2002, 139)                                              Although the ethical objections to commodifying stem cell work                can not be sorted out as neatly as this table suggests, Resnik correctly                identifies a variety of such objections. I will not try to defend                it here, but my own view is that the problem is not just that stem                cells and their products may be commodified, but that market rhetoric                may come to dominate the discussion (and practice) of regenerative                medicine in a way that is dehumanizing. That is, market-rhetoric                may lead us ultimately to think of humans as artifacts. In short,                I take very seriously Margaret Radin’s argument that the rhetoric                in which we conceive our world affects who and what we are (Radin,                1996, 82). 11  At the same time,                however, stem cell research is most likely to bear therapeutic fruit,                if there is a market in stem cells and their products. The pressing                moral question, then, is how do we promote the benefits that stem                cell research may yield without succumbing to a market rhetoric                that reduces humans to commodities?                                Several writers have suggested that one answer may be to promote                greater governmental regulation. For example, Holland argues for                moving beyond a policy of restricting federal funding of stem cell                research but allowing an unregulated private market in this field                to active regulation to curb the private sector’s work on                stem cells. Lori Knowles suggests that the United States might adopt                a body like Canada’s Patented Medicine Prices Review Board                as a way to allow a market to function, but with oversight that                would provide access to potential cells for further research and                price controls of products to insure widespread access (Knowles,                1990, 40). George Annas has suggested that we need to establish                a federal Human Experimentation Agency to regulate in the area of                human experimentation. (Annas, 1998, 18). As Annas puts it:                                Virtually all those who have studied the matter have concluded that                a broad-based public panel is needed to oversee human experimentation                in the areas of genetic engineering, human reproduction, xenografts,                artificial organs, and other boundary-crossing experiments. (19)              Francis Fukuyama has argued that a new agency with a mandate to regulate              biotechnology on broad grounds and in both the public and private              sector may be needed (Fukuyama, 2002, 215). Vanessa Kuhn argues that              “it is time to put in place legislation that will deter stakeholders              from licensing their technology to one exclusive distributor and thus              creating a monopoly market, which would set artificially-high prices              and lead to less access for the sick especially for the uninsured,              the poor, and the elderly” (Kuhn, 2002). To that end, Kuhn identifies              four possibilities:               Development of a new kind of patent.               Set limits on exclusive licensing through compulsory licensing.                 Lower the lifespan of hES cell patents                  Set stricter guidelines for hES patent utility (2)              I do not have the expertise to make policy recommendations, but let              me stress two points. First, the policy issues with regard to commodifiying              adult stem cell work will be as vexing as those confronting regulation              of embryonic stem cells. Second, although these questions may at first              appear to be strictly legal or largely political matters, they involve              serious value judgments about the common good that are every bit as              morally vital as questions about the status of the embryo. I thus              agree with Gene Outka, that not to confront directly questions about              how stem cell research will be organized, financed, and overseen is              a kind of ethical failure (Outka, 2002, 177). Obviously, for example,              the institutional arrangements for conducting stem cell research have              implications for the questions of justice we previously noted. The              fact that so much stem cell research is being done by private corporations              insures future conflict. On the one hand, corporations have fiduciary              obligations to their shareholders and will therefore seek to control              access to stem cell lines or therapies developed from those lines              through patent protection and licensing agreements. On the other hand,              such a system is likely to further widen the gap between the health              care haves and have-nots (See Lebacqz 2001; McLean 2001).                             Moreover, as Karen Lebacqz notes, if justice is an important consideration              in deliberations about stem cell work, then it ought to shape the              research agenda. The example she gives to make this point is worth              noting. Just as with organ transplants, tissue rejection may be a              major problem for stem cell therapies. This is one reason that the              prospect of combining stem cell work with somatic cell nuclear transfer              (SCNT) has been so enticing. With this combination, you could in theory              develop tissue that would be completely histocompatible. Nevertheless,              according to Lebacqz, developing stem cell therapies with SCNT is              “highly questionable,” if justice is a primary consideration.              The reason is that unique cell lines would need to be created for              each patient, and that is likely to be very expensive and thus unaffordable              for many. Although it would certainly be less expensive, the same              would likely be true for adult stem work. For that reason, rather              than pursuing an individualized approach to stem cell research, concerns              about affordable access to new therapies might urge the pursuit of              universal donor cell lines.                             Embodiment, Boundary Issues, and Human Nature              In discussing the debate about embryo status, I focused primarily              on the contested question of whether the early embryo is a person              with the right to life. We saw that this question tends to lead to              the mobilization of minute details of embryological development to              support one’s view of the embryo. Yet, if attention to embryo              status tends to focus us on the microscopic, viewing stem cell research              through the lens of embryological development can also have a kind              of telescopic function through which larger issues come into view. 12               For example, Catherine Waldby and Susan Squier argue in a forthcoming              issue of the journal  Configurations  that focusing on stem              cells and embryonic life leads us fundamentally to question what it              means to be human. According to Waldby and Squier:                               Stem cell technologies have profound temporal implications for the                human life course, because they can potentially utilize the earliest                moments of ontogenesis to produce therapeutic tissues to augment                deficiencies in aging bodies. Hence they may effect a major redistribution                of tissue vitality from the first moments of life to the end of                life. In doing so however they demonstrate the perfect contingency                of any relationship between embryo and person, the non-teleological                nature of the embryo’s developmental pathways. They show that                the embryo’s life is not proto-human, and that the biology                and biography of human life cannot be read backwards into its moment                of origin. (Waldby and Squier, forthcoming)              The claim that there is a perfect contingency in the relationship              between embryo and person may at first appear to be just another “microscopic”              claim about embryo status, but it is clear that Waldby and Squier              mean to imply much more in asserting that the embryo’s development              is non-teleological. In effect, they reject the notion that there              is a meaningful trajectory to human life. What was killed, they say,              when stem cells were first derived from the inner cell mass of a blastocyte              was not a person, but a “biographical idea of human life, where              the narrative arc that describes identity across time has been extended              to include the earliest moments of ontogeny” (Waldby and Squier,              forthcoming).                             That much more is at stake here than the question of whether the embryo              is a person is clear if we attend to the notion of a trajectory of              a human life. Gilbert Meilaender, for example, has argued that our              attitudes toward death and dying are importantly shaped by our conception              of what it means to have a life (Meilaender 1993). Indeed, according              to Meilaender, two views of what it means to have a life?of what it              means to be a person?have been at war with each other within the field              of bioethics over the past thirty years and these views underwrite              sharply different views not just about the issues of abortion or euthanasia              that are implicated here but with regard to practically every moral              issue we might confront in the field of bioethics.                            On Meilaender’s view, having a life means precisely that there              is a trajectory that traces a “natural pattern” in embodied              life that “moves through youth and adulthood toward old age              and, finally, decline and death” (29). As he puts it elsewhere              in this essay, “to have a life is to be  terra animata,               a living body whose natural history has a trajectory” (31).              Although Meilaender develops the notion of a natural trajectory of              bodily life primarily to address the issue of euthanasia and not stem              cell research, his talk of “natural history,” “natural              pattern,” and “natural trajectory” draws attention              to one of the most significant issues raised by stem cell research              and related technologies. Does stem cell research undermine the very              notion of a human life constrained by natural bodily existence? The              example on which Meilaender focuses here is instructive for thinking              about the broad implications of stem cell research in this regard.              If stem cell therapies fundamentally alter our sense of a natural              pattern to aging would they not also fundamentally alter our sense              of what it means to be human? Meilaender’s answer is that such              a change would fundamentally affect what it means to be human precisely              because we are embodied creatures and for that reason our identity              is tied to the body and the body’s history.                            Leon Kass has made a similar point recently in reflecting on the prospect              that regenerative medicine might significantly lengthen the human              life span (Kass, 2003). He, too, invokes the notion of a natural trajectory,              one that stem cell research may undermine. Although it is possible              to approach the prospect of extending the human life-span in an abstract              way, he says, to think of what such a change would mean experientially              is to recognize that “the ‘lived time’ of our natural              lives has a trajectory and a shape, its meaning derived in part from              the fact that we live as links in the chain of generations”              (13). Indeed, says Kass, without something like the natural trajectory              of bodily life that currently exists, the relationship between the              generations would be decidedly different, and probably not better.              “A world of longevity,” writes Kass, “is increasingly              a world hostile to children” (13). Walter Glannon has argued              that, at the very least, increased longevity would increase competition              for scarce resources between older and younger generations. According              to Glannon, “it is at least intuitively plausible that an over              populated world with substantially extended human lives and scarce              resources could adversely affect the survival and reproductive prospects              of the young and harm them by thwarting their interest in being healthy              enough so that they could survive and procreate” (Glannon, “Extending,”              347).  13                            Francis Fukuyama has also suggested some of the reasons why increased              longevity may imperil children, but he also notes that our relationship              to death may change as well (See 2002, ch. 4). “Death,”              he says, “may come to be seen not as a natural and inevitable              aspect of life, but a preventable evil like polio or measles. If so,              then accepting death will appear to be a foolish choice, not something              to be faced with dignity or nobility” (Fukuyama, 2002, 71).                            Sometimes the question of the transformative possibilities that come              with stem cell research is raised even more starkly when the question              asked is not how may stem cell work affect what it means to be human,              but instead: Does stem cell research open the door to a post human              future? This is a point Waldby and Squier raise explicitly when they              discuss the combination of genetic engineering and stem cell therapy.              They suggest, for example, that xenotransplantation forces us to confront              the prospect of transgressing species boundaries. 14               The conclusion of their paper is worth quoting in full:                               Thus the ontological status of the embryo is not the                only thing in question. The ontological status of the graft recipient                must be negotiated, when the graft involves genetically-engineered                stem cells from another species. And the ontological status of the                illnesses to which biomedical technology responds is equally challenged,                in an endless regression, as the division between veterinary and                human medicine, or between zoonoses (diseases humans can catch from                animals) and what has recently been dubbed humanooses, is called                into question. This increasingly permeable, increasingly constructed                barrier between human and animal presents us with another form of                life to negotiate, whose boundary lies not between silicon and carbon,                but rather between steps in the evolutionary ladder?or the branching                development tree?of phylogenetic lifeforms. Stem cell technologies                thus challenge both the temporal and spatial boundaries of human                life, both our biography and our biological niche, giving a much                broader meaning to the questioning of embryonic  personhood .                (Waldby and Squier, forthcoming)                            Regrettably, with some notable exceptions, the ethical debate about              stem cell research has not taken up in a sustained way what it would              mean to pursue stem cell therapies that might significantly undermine              the notion of a natural human life or erode the boundary between human              and non-human species. When the issue is framed in terms of the status              of the embryo, the question tends to be whether the research should              be conducted at all. By contrast, when the issue is framed in terms              of adult stem cell work, the question is not whether, but how and              with what consequences. Yet, that is a question we have not systematically              answered. Given the potential for good embedded in the prospects of              adult stem cell research, it is not surprising that there appears              to be widespread and largely uncritical acceptance of adult stem cell              research. But, if the promise of stem research is as revolutionary              as is often claimed, we are going to need a much more expansive discussion              of stem cell research?both embryonic and adult?than we have had heretofore.              Obviously, I cannot explore this more expansive horizon in any detail              in this report, but let me in closing suggest one direction we need              to explore.                             To signal the decisive break that I think we may need from the usual              bioethics frame, I want to draw attention to Martha Nussbaum’s              recent article in the journal  Daedalus  entitled, “Compassion              & Terror” (Nussbaum, 2003). Discussing Euripides’              play,  Trojan Women , Nussbaum reflects on the fact that the              Greek poets returned obsessively to the sacking of Troy and the acts              of the “rapacious and murderous Greeks.” She explores              the poets’ compassionate imagining of the fate of Trojan women              and children to reflect on the conditions and limits of a compassionate              vision. Although Nussbaum is ultimately concerned about engendering              a compassionate vision for Americans in the face of terror?and particularly              compassion for innocent women and children far from our shores, her              analysis of compassion is thought-provoking in relation to stem cell              research.                            Nussbaum notes that compassion is a complex emotion requiring a series              of judgments involving another person’s suffering or lack of              well-being. We must judge that someone has been harmed, that the harm              is serious, and that it was not deserved. Moreover, says Nussbaum,              Western tradition has stressed what could be called the “judgment              of similar possibilities.” In other words, “we have compassion              only insofar or we believe that the suffering person shares vulnerabilities              and possibilities with us” (Nussbaum, 2003, 15).                            Now surely in just about everyone’s catalogue of human vulnerabilities              are illness, old age, and death. Yet, as we have just seen, stem cell              research might significantly transform the “human” experience              of illness and death, at least for some. If stem cell therapies were              to erode the notion of human nature or species membership, might they              not also erode some basic moral sensibilities? Mary Midgley, for example,              has argued that both the notion of human nature and that of human              rights are importantly tied to membership in our species because rights              are “supposed to guarantee the kind of life that all specimens              of  Homo sapiens  need” (Midgley, 2000, 9).                            Although Nussbaum avoids the language of human nature, it is precisely              this sort of point that she highlights when she argues that compassion              requires the belief that others share vulnerabilities and possibilities              with us. Indeed, like Midgley, Nussbaum ties the notion of universal              human rights to important human functions and capabilities. The basic              idea, she says, is to ask what constitutes the characteristic activities              of human beings. In other words:                               ‘What does the human being do, characteristically,                as such?and not, say, as a member of a particular group, or a particular                local community?’ To put it another way, what are the forms                of activity, of doing and being, that constitute the human form                of life and distinguish it from other actual or imaginable forms                of life, such as the lives of animals and plants, or, on the other                hand, of immortal gods as imagined in myths and legends (which frequently                have precisely the function of delimiting the human)? (Nussbaum,                1995, 72)                 Nussbaum notes that this inquiry proceeds by examining a wide variety                of self-interpretations and that comparing characteristic human                activities with non-human activities and, through myths and stories,                comparing humans and the gods is particularly helpful. For one thing,                such an inquiry helps us to define limits that derive from membership                in the world of nature.                                 Indeed, although Nussbaum is particularly attentive to the wide                variety of cultural interpretations of what it means to be human,                she insists that to ground any essentialist or universal notion                of human rights, one must attend to human biology. Although her                account of the human is neither ahistorical nor a priori, it is                linked to an “empirical study of a species-specific form of                life” (1995, 75). When she develops her account of central                human capabilities, she begins with the body. She writes:               We live all our lives in bodies of a certain sort, whose                possibilities and vulnerabilities do not as such belong to one human                society rather than another. These bodies, similar far more than                dissimilar (given the enormous range of possibilities) are our homes,                so to speak, opening certain options and denying others, giving                us certain needs and also certain possibilities for excellence.                The fact that any given human being might have lived anywhere and                belonged to any culture is a great part of what grounds our mutual                recognitions; this fact, in turn, has a great deal to do with the                general humanness of the body, its great distinctness from other                bodies. The experience of the body is culturally shaped, to be sure;                the importance we ascribe to its various functions is also culturally                shaped. But the body itself, not culturally variant in its nutritional                and other related requirements, sets limits on what can be experienced                and valued, ensuring a great deal of overlap. (Nussbaum, 1995, 76)                              Nussbaum’s work both in identifying the judgments that underwrite                compassion and in tying an account of rights to human function and                capabilities that are presumably universal highlights what is at                stake, not merely with stem cell research but with a growing list                of biotechnological developments which appear to destabilize the                concept of human nature and which require that we think carefully                and hard about what it might mean for some humans to have access                to these technologies while other humans do not. 15                 At the very least, the combination of what Rabinow describes as                the biologicalization of identity around genetics rather than gender                and race with the possibility of manipulating that genetic identity                for those with the money or power to do so does not bode well for                securing wide-spread compassion across economic or technological                divides. Even more important, however, is the recognition that the                very notion of human rights may ultimately rest on the idea (and                what, until recently has always been the reality) of a natural human                condition that is relatively stable.                                I believe that Nussbaum is correct when she claims that inquiring                into characteristic human activities and comparing these to non-human                activities helps us to define limits and thereby to promote human                flourishing. Unfortunately, what Susan Squier calls the “pluripotent                rhetoric” of stem cell research is that of limitless possibilities                (Squier, Liminal Lives). The ultimate limit, of course, is death                and yet even this limit appears illusory in some visions of our                biotech future.                                It is worth noting in closing that William Safire’s New Year’s                Day column at the dawn of the twenty-first century, in January 2000,                was entitled “Why Die?” The longing behind this question                is neither new nor unfamiliar. What is new is that this longing                to escape the vulnerabilities and limitations of the body is united                with a technology that holds out the prospect of fundamentally changing                that body. Yet, I agree with Gerald McKenny that we need to ask                whether we wish to accept and promote a view of bodily vulnerability                as merely an obstacle to human flourishing, which ought to be overcome                at any cost (McKenny, 1998, 223).                                Although a longing for invulnerability is perhaps a quintessentially                human trait, and although the quest to reduce the human suffering                wrought by illness and disease is morally admirable, there is no                mistaking the hubris behind the question, Why Die? Opponents of                stem cell research have, from the start, argued that there is a                kind of idolatry in a science that would reduce the human embryo                to just so much biological material. What I have tried to show in                this report is that such concerns need not be limited to those who                think that the early embryo is fully a person. Nor should this kind                of concern be limited to those who oppose stem cell research. I                do not think the early embryo is a person and I believe that both                embryonic and adult stem cell research should go forward under a                system of strict regulation. Nevertheless, I confess to being haunted                by the passages with which I began and I believe that future debates                on stem cell research must take very seriously the worries about                commodification and the possibility of fundamentally changing the                trajectory of a human life. 16                                                                        Appendix A                                 Jimmy Margulies, Editorial Cartoonist                The Record, Hackensack, New Jersey                Cartoon used with permission of the artist.                                          _____________________                 notes                                                Given the current status of technology, deriving                  human embryonic stem cells requires destroying embryos. If the                  cells could be derived without the destruction of embryos or if                  parthenogenetically stimulated eggs produced stem cells, issue                  of status would almost certainly fade. Nevertheless, serious ethical                  issues would still remain. This is one reason I believe it is                  a mistake to focus narrowly on embryo status.                                     Gene Outka has argued that there is an “internal                  coherence” to views of the embryo, issues of complicity,                  and views on adult stem cell research (Outka, 2002).                                       Although the HERP report claimed that “it                  is not the role of those who help form public policy to decide                  which of these views [of the embryo] is correct, there is little                  doubt that the panel adopted the pluralistic view. For that reason,                  most commentators found the above claim disingenuous.                   Compare, for example,                  the various statements that Richard M. Doerflinger has made on                  the U. S. bishops’ behalf. See Doerflinger, 1988, 1998,                  1999, 2001. Margaret Farley has argued that the Catholic preoccupation                  with abortion has eroded its credibility on other important social                  issues, including stem cell research. (See Farley, 2000).                   Another debate that is                  at least partly shaped by focusing on embryo status revolves around                  the question of complicity. For example, supporters of stem cell                  research may harbor a residual uneasiness about endorsing the                  destruction of human embryos, at least if the number of articles                  in the literature explaining the concept of complicity with wrongdoing                  is any indication. John Robertson, Ronald Green, and Thomas Shannon,                  have all written on the issue of cooperation with evil in relation                  to stem cell research. (Robertson, 1999; Green, 2002; Shannon,                  2001; see also Kaveny, 2000; and Gilliam, 1997). To be sure, the                  issue of complicity or cooperation with wrongdoing is a very traditional                  one in moral philosophy and theological ethics. Still, if the                  early embryo does not deserve the respect accorded persons and                  if destroying the embryo is compatible with respecting it, then                  deriving stem cells is not an act of wrongdoing and issues of                  complicity do not arise. Cahill also emphasizes the way a liberal                  individualist view of the person discounts the significance of                  embodiment. I will return to this point below.                  Cahill also emphasizes                  the way a liberal individualist view of the person discounts the                  significance of embodiment. I will return to this point below.                                   That both                  those who view the embryo as a person and those who do not but                  who insist on respect for the embryo, have been remarkably cavalier                  with regard to the use of embryos in IVF programs can be seen                  by the fact that there are currently over 400,000 embryos frozen                  in the United States, a number we did not even know until quite                  recently (Hoffman et al. in association with The Society for Assisted                  Reproductive Technology and RAND, 2003).                   In a commentary                  published in Nature, in September 2001, Edwards writes: “On                  the verge of clinical application, stem cells offer a startlingly                  fundamental approach to alleviating severe incurable human maladies.                  Fondly believed to be a recent development, they have in fact                  been part and parcel of human in-vitro fertilization (IVF) from                  as long ago as 1962.”                  Dorff’s                  responsum was accepted by the Committee on Law and Standards by                  a vote of twenty-two to one in March 2002. On the basis of Dorff’s                  responsum the Rabbinical Assembly passed a resolution in April                  2003 supporting stem cell research for therapeutic purposes. (Resolution                  in Support of Stem Cell Research and Education, April 2003: available                  at www.rabassembly.org.)                   Alpers                  and Lo draw the distinction between commodification and commercialization                  as follows: “The issue of commodification involves treating                  either human beings or symbols of human life as merchandise or                  vendible goods. . . . Commercialization refers to the practice                  of realizing large profits from the development and sale of techniques                  or products that involve distinctive human material, such as embryos,                  eggs, or tissue” (Alpers and Lo, 1995).                  Radin                  quotes Georg Lukács on the reification of commodities and                  the effects on human consciousness. Lukács writes: “The                  transformation of the commodity relation into a thing of ‘ghostly                  objectivity’ cannot therefore content itself with reduction                  of all objects for the gratification of human needs to commodities.                  It stamps its imprint upon the whole consciousness of man; his                  qualities and abilities are no longer an organic part of his personality,                  they are things which he can ‘own’ or ‘dispose                  of’ like the various objects of the external world”                  (Radin, 1996, 82). When we think about genes for enhancing memory                  or muscle mass, it is worth keeping in mind Lukács’s                  claim that human qualities and abilities may come to be thought                  of as objects for sale in the external world.                    Erik                  Parens has noted the importance of attending to the big picture                  raised by stem cell work and how the politics of abortion has                  obscured that picture. See Parens, 2000.                   In another                  essay, Glannon argues that substantially increasing the human                  life span would profoundly affect issues of personal identity                  and thus a sense of personal responsibility for one’s action.                  He ties his argument in interesting ways to the biology of memory                  function (Glannon, “Identity”). For a classic philosophical                  discussion of the problems associated with immortality, see Williams,                  1973.                  Although                  he is not discussing stem cell research explicitly, Paul Rabinow’s                  discussion of technological change wrought during the last two                  decades is worth noting. He writes: “In the United States,                  for example, in the last two decades, while the most passionate                  value conflicts have raged around abortion, a general reshaping                  of the sites of production of knowledge has been occurring. To                  cite the biotechnology industry, the growing stock of genomic                  information, and the simple but versatile and potent manipulative                  tools (exemplified by the polymerase chain reaction) is to name                  a few key elements; a more complete list would include the reshaping                  of American universities, the incessant acceleration in the computer                  domains, and the rise of ‘biosociality’ as a prime                  locus of identity?a biologicalization of identity different from                  the older biological categories of the West (gender, age, race)                  in that it is understood as inherently manipulable and re-formable”                  (Rabinow, 1999, 13). A couple of pages later, he writes: “My                  analysis points to the fact that the basic understanding and practices                  of ‘bare life’ have been altered. The genome projects                  (human, plant, animal, microorganismic) are demonstrating a powerful                  approach to life’s constituent matter. It is now known that                  DNA is universal among living beings. It is now known that DNA                  is extremely manipulable. One consequence among many others is                  that the boundaries between species need to be rethought; transgenic                  animals made neither by God nor by the long-term processes of                  evolution now exist (16).

Our fourth session of the day is on stem cells, moving research                from the bench to the bedside, the role of non-governmental activity.                              Progress in stem cell research proceeds not only with government                support, important though such support surely is.  Biotech companies                are vigorously active in the field both with embryonic and non-embryonic                cells, and disease related and other philanthropic foundations are                actively supporting such research.                 Our monitoring of stem cell research would not be complete without                some review of what is going on under these auspices.  This afternoon                we are fortunate to have with us representatives from two leading                biotech companies very active in stem cell research and from two                leading private philanthropic research foundations who will tell                us something about the strategies they are pursuing to develop stem                cell based experimental therapies, how close they are to developing                such therapies, and what obstacles currently stand in the way.                 As they have all been asked to avoid commercial pitches, criticisms                of competitors, or advocacy for or against legislation currently                pending before Congress, I would ask Council members to refrain                from prodding them to do otherwise or to ask them for investment                tips or other privileged information.                 (Laughter.)                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Our guests in order of presentation are                Dr. Thomas Okarma, who is the President and CEO of Geron Corporation,                a company that emphasizes embryonic stem cell research and formerly                supported the work, among others, of John Gearhart and James Thomson,                and that has solid patent positions in this field.                 Second, Dr. Theo Palmer, who is an assistant professor in the                Department of Neurosurgery at Stanford, a stem cell researcher working                on nervous system applications, and today representing the Michael                J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson Research on whose scientific advisory                board he serves.                 Third, William Pursley, President and CEO of Osiris Therapeutics,                Inc., a company in the forefront especially of mesenchymal stem                cell research, with many strong patents in this area and exploring                clinical applications for cardiac therapy, immunomodulation, among                others.                 Finally Dr. Robert Goldstein, who is the Chief Scientific Officer                of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International, an organization                with extensive activities, including a recently announced program                of training grants to draw top young researchers into the stem cell                field.                 Gentlemen, thank you very much for taking time from your busy                lives to travel here and to give us the benefit of your knowledge.                              We'll start with Dr. Okarma.                  DR. OKARMA:   Thank you, Dr. Kass, for the opportunity to                spend some time with you today.  It's a visit that's probably                overdue.                 You asked me to address three topics:  our progress in the development                of products based on embryonic stem cells; our thoughts about immune                tolerance and immune rejection of the transplanted cells; and, lastly,                impacts of various policies on our progress in the private sector                in 15 minutes.  So I will be terse and not do justice to either                question, but try to give you an overall picture.                 By way of background and the take-home point, clearly human embryonic                stem cells are a special case, and this Council has certainly debated                the issue of the moral status element of that specialness.  But                I would argue that there are two other elements to its specialness.                              First, the biology which is unique amongst all the cells in the                universe and its promise for medical therapeutics.                 And thirdly and not well understood, this paradigm is in the industrial                sector, not in the academic sector, and that has some very important                implications to the development of this technology, and I'll                try to make those points as I go through.                 Geron, as you may know, has been at the forefront of human embryonic                stem cell research since 1995 when we first entered the field.                 We funded the work done in Jamie Thomson's lab, John Gearhart's                lab, and Dr. Pedersen's lab at UC-San Francisco, and as such,                we're the movers technically, technologically and proprietarily                in this entire field.                 We have spent over $70 million on this technology, most of it                since 1999 after the cells were derived.  That's a number against                which the NIH disbursements pale by both absolute and relative terms,                and there are some reasons for that that I will touch on.                 So let me move first then into our development plans and our developmental                progress.  First, let me talk a bit about some of the infrastructure                basic science components that we've established.                 You've heard a lot of discussion about how these cells are                grown on mouse feeder cells.  We've established a scalable way                to grow these cells not only off of feeder cells, but now with a                fully qualified set of reagents.  These can be scaled virtually                limitlessly.                 We've established ways to scalably produce seven different                differentiated cell types from each of the lines that we have.                 So one line now makes seven different kinds of cells that we'll                describe in a moment.                 We have verified the stability of the embryonic stem cell line                in culture.  Some of the lines have been grown continuously for                over three years, more than 600 population doublings, and there's                a manuscript in press now describing four lines studied over that                period of time that demonstrates that the karyotype, surface marker,                differentiation potential, and gene expression level, the stability                of these undifferentiated cell lines grown under our culture conditions.                              We have had a preliminary meeting with FDA, and we have now qualified                two of our cell lines for human use.  They have passed every assay                the FDA has asked us to submit them to, even though they are appropriately                classified as xenogeneic.  I will return to that later.                 In collaboration with Celera, we've established an annotated                genomic database of undifferentiated embryonic stem cells.  One                hundred fifty thousand EST sequences have been sequenced, and the                physical clones are deposited in Menlo Park.                 This is fully annotated.  We can query this database.  We understand                what the gene expression pattern of stemness really is and what                genes are up and down-regulated as these cells differentiate.  That                has been a crucial foundation for our ability to learn how to produce                differentiated cell types.                 And lastly, we, too, have developed methods to genetically modify                these cells.                 Now, the cells that we have learned how to make are characterized                by their normalcy.  Virtually every cell that we have made, without                exception, expresses completely normal cell biology.  So the islet                cells we have derived express insulin, and they express insulin                in a dose-dependent fashion as a function of glucose concentration                in the media.                 The oligodendrocytes we have made myelinate spinal cord cells                in animals.                 The dopaminergic neurons we have made secrete dopamine.                 The cardiomyocytes that we have made express all of the molecular                markers consistent with their being human cardiomyocytes.  They                respond in appropriate dose response fashion to cardioactive drugs.                              The bone cells that we have made in  Roslin have absolutely normal                biology.  The techniques to look at the bone formation these cells                make  in vitro  by X-ray diffraction are absolutely spot-on                normal.                 We are close, but have not yet derived chondrocytes.  That is                also a project funded at the Roslin Institute.                 And lastly, bone marrow cells, hematopoietic progenitors, which                again are absolutely normal in their cell biology, producing all                three cell lines normally.                 Now, some of these cells have progressed into animal studies,                and I'll detail those in a moment.  The first take-home point                to make is that we have never ever seen in any single animal the                formation of a tumor.  That is because we only put in differentiated                cells.                 The issue about growing the cells in the undifferentiated state                is to keep them from differentiating.  So when we remove them from                the undifferentiated culture conditions, these cells want to differentiate,                and we have molecular markers to prove that they are differentiated.                              We also have cytotoxic technology capable of detecting one out                of ten million cells that are undifferentiated should we need to                apply that later on in scale-up.                 So which cells are in animal models?  Well, first the hematopoietic                cells are in Canada, and we've demonstrated now engraftment                of these human embryonic stem cell derived hematopoietic cells in                the appropriate nude mouse model, which repopulates the animal's                peripheral blood.  That has important implications not only for                an alternative source of cells for bone marrow transplantation,                but for the second question regarding immune rejection.                 We've made dopaminergic cells which are engrafting robustly                in animal models of Parkinson's disease.  This is a huge tissue                engineering challenge where these cells must penetrate to the cortex                of the animal to completely correct the Parkinsonian defect.                 We have not yet demonstrated significant behavioral improvement                in the animals.  We are still working on that, but the cells engraft                robustly and, again, without tumors.                 The cell type that is most advanced is the oligodendrocyte, and                there will be a very exciting manuscript later this year from our                collaborator at UC-Irvine, Hans Keirsted, in which we have transplanted                the human oligodendrocytes into a model of spinal cord injury and                not only show statistically significant functional improvement of                the animal, but we have shown at the histologic level that the animal                cells are remyelinated by the cells that we have injected.                 Lastly, we are now in animal studies in three different labs with                cardiomyocytes injected into animal models of heart failure and                myocardial infarction.  Again, no tumors; again, the cells engraft,                and we have histologic evidence that these cells begin now to communicate                 with the animal cell  in situ  in the heart.                 So the work is early.  There is much more to do, but we are quite                pleased with the progress that we've made thus far and would                predict that the oligodendrocyte will be the first cell to enter                the clinical environment, and that an IND, if all goes well, could                be submitted in late '04 or early '05, which is quite a                bit ahead of most people's expectations.                 At this point our second cell type into the clinic would probably                be cardiomyocytes, based on the data set we have today.                 As part of that first question, you asked about obstacles.  There                are clearly many, many technical and scale-up obstacles that we                yet have to traverse, but those we think are fungible.  Our major                problem is funding.  We have done two reductions in force in the                company since a year ago.  We are one third of our former size.                              The political uncertainty of this field not only turns off investors,                but also turns off the other source of funding for biotech, which                are pharmaceutical partners, who at this point in time are completely                uninterested in this field.                 Turning to the issue of immune rejection, first, there are a number                of very exciting, new immunosuppressive drugs in clinical development.                 So I think the field of immune suppression through pharmacology                 will dramatically advance, and we hope to take advantage of that.                              Secondly, it's now known that pure effector cell transplants,                in other words, not organs that are contaminated by the donor's                immune system, are much less immunogenic in animal models and in                a few cases in human than is an entire organ transplant, again,                auguring well for the size of the problem of immune tolerance.                 Thirdly, there is some very exciting work that we are doing not                yet published, so I can only hint at it, that establishes the human                embryonic stem cell as being unusually unique in its immunologic                properties.  It has inherited some of the immunosuppressive properties                that are existent in the blastocyst.                 Why is it that the mothers never immunologically reject what is                an allograft, the blastocyst?  Well, there are specific reasons                for that, and those reasons are, in fact, inherent in the undifferentiated                embryonic stem cell.                 But in terms of our strategy, notwithstanding the prior points                of how to control immune rejection, we have one that makes a lot                of sense, and that is hematopoietic chimerism.  We know from the                bone marrow transplantation work that if a patient who gets a bone                marrow donation from me will be completely tolerant to receiving                a kidney allograft or a heart allograft from me.  The prior bone                marrow transplant has tolerized the patient to the antigens in my                tissues.                 We also know now from work done at Stanford that patients who                are status post whole organ transplant patients can be completely                weaned off of immunosuppressive drugs by giving them a mini bone                marrow transplant taken from a donor with the same tissue type as                the prior kidney donor.                 This is the strategy we plan to use out of the box in our clinical                program, having now established that we can derive hematopoietic                progenitors from one of the lines.   A dose of those cells should                tolerize the patient to any effector cell transplanted into that                individual derived from the same stem cell line.  So that is my                answer to Question  2.                 Lastly, you asked me to address issues of policy that affect our                ability to develop the programs.  Certainly the fact that this is                primarily an industrial paradigm helps with regard to FDA.  I've                worked with Kathryn Zoon and Phil Noguchi since the mid-'80s                in my prior company in cell therapies.  Many of the points to consider                that are now published came from our mutual collaboration in the                early work in the '80s and '90s in cell transplantation.                              The pathway to regulatory testing and commercialization with this                technology is clear.  There are some idiosyncracies, it is true,                but we understand the pathway, and we have thus far been very pleased                with our early interactions with the agency.                 The NIH has a different issue:  to recognize the primary role                in this field that has been played by industry.  That is not their                fault.  They were prohibited by law from funding this arena.  That                is how we got into it.  That is how we got ahead of everyone.                 But that has some special implications.  For us, as I manage Geron,                we have two platforms:  the stem cells that we're talking about                today and a cancer program based on telomerase.  And the management                and depth of technology in both of those platforms is hugely different                with, I think, important consequences both for patients and for                policy makers.                 On the cancer side, we have sent the telomerase gene to hundreds                of laboratories all around the world.  We have many, many collaborators.                 Many people have worked independently of us on telomerase.  So as                we move into the clinic with our anti-cancer platform, our scientific                understanding of how to use telomerase as a vaccine, how to develop                drugs that inhibit telomerase, how to use the promoter of telomerase                to drive oncolytic viruses is very, very deep.                 That reduces risks to patients and increases the likelihood that                our first entré into the clinics will be successful, as we                are, in fact, seeing with our telomerase vaccine program in the                clinic at Duke.                 That is to be contrasted with our program in embryonic stem cells,                where we have a small number of collaborators, the bulk of which                are frankly either in California funded by us and the State of California,                or in other countries, the U.K. and in Canada.                 So there's no question that when we think we are ready to                move into the clinic expeditiously and cautiously, having checked                all of the appropriate boxes the FDA wants us to check, we will                still be skating on relative thin ice in terms of the science behind                the product that we are testing in people.                 So the narrower science base in embryonic stem cell research increases                risk of technical failure and exposes patients to greater risk from                the experiment.                 The second point under policy I would make sort of illustrates                a problem that's about to happen.  We've heard a lot about                the issue of are the old existing lines okay.  What about new lines?                 Will they be different?  Will they be better?                 Well, the existing lines, as you've heard today, can be used                in human clinical trials, but they will not last forever, we don't                think.  There's no reason to assume that.  And these current                lines, all of them, were derived on mouse embryonic layers and,                as such, are appropriately classified as xenogeneic transplants                with increased risk to patients and a much increased burden on the                sponsor to follow these patients for life after they receive these                cells.  That's appropriate.                 So the FDA is urging us appropriately to derive new lines that                not only have not seen mouse feeders, but whose entire pedigree                is from reagents that are qualified for human use and that the entire                process of derivation be under GMP, good manufacturing practices.                              We will be successful in doing this.  We will generate such a                line very quickly, very soon, and then the implication of the current                policy, however, is that arguably this would be the best line to                use and to qualify and to share, but because it was derived after                2001 in August, the NIH will be prohibited from studying it.                 And what are the implications for when we take that cell line                into the clinic?  Will we be unable to share that cell line either                from a funding or a technology perspective with the NIH?                 So those are my brief comments on the three questions.  We are                unquestionably the leader in the field because of circumstances                that enabled us the freedom to operate, and in some ways, particularly                with regard to FDA and scale-up and GMP, that's good for the                field.                 But in terms of getting this technology embedded rapidly in the                most sophisticated biomedical community in the world, we are amiss.                              Thank you.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you very much.                 I think we should hear from all four people together and then                have questions.                 Dr. Palmer, please.                  DR. PALMER:   Thank you, Chairman Kass, members of the Council.                              I'm here on behalf of the Michael J. Fox Foundation, and I                was asked by the foundation and by the Council to give a little                bit of an overview of the foundation's efforts in targeting                Parkinson's disease.  So I'll talk to you a little bit about                Parkinson's disease, or PD, and then also the role of stem cells                in our portfolio; finally, a little bit about what we've learned                in three years of trying to use stem cells in this very targeted                application.                 The foundation is relatively new.  As you know, it started in                late winter of 2000.  The goal of the foundation is to match funding                to scientists who are pursuing every avenue of research to find                a cure for Parkinson's disease.                 Our secondary goal and my primary goal as an advisory board member                is to make sure that this funding reaches the investigator with                speed, and one of the things that we've found that has really                speeded the research is to short circuit some of the delay in an                investigator coming up with a good idea and then getting the funding                to that research.                 So we're targeting Parkinson's disease, and our efforts                in stem cells are quite narrow compared to many of the applications                that you'll hear today.  But Parkinson's disease is the                accelerated loss of a dopamine neuron in the adult brain.  These                neurons control movement, and the loss of the neuron does not allow                the brain to initiate movement.                 So one of the strategies, of course, is to replace those neurons                with a stem cell derived dopamine neuron population.  This is part                of our research effort.                 The other part, and in fact, a larger part, is to understand the                disease itself and then prevent or augment the remaining system,                prevent degeneration.                 So the brain doesn't replace these neurons, and the stem cell                biology really comes into play when you've got a patient who's                missing a substantial portion and is now dysfunctional in terms                of their ability to move.                 It's a slow disease.  It progresses over years, often decades.                 There's a declining quality of life, and the disease is lethal.                 It affects more than a million people in the U.S. alone, and there's                no cure.                 In the context of PD, stem cell technology has promised two significant                advances that are not available in any other context or form.  A                single culture can create enough dopamine neurons to cure the entire                population of PD patients if we can get the technology to work.                              This may not necessarily be true in practice, and we heard one                reason why this might not be true, if there are limits to the ability                to expand the culture.  But a second reason and perhaps one that's                not very well explored by the Council is the ability to use ES cell                lines as a tool for research and particularly as a way of making                authentic human dopamine neuron for drug screening or high throughput                assays of some sort or another.                 Now, this is a very important point I'll come back to later.                              I'd like to go over the portfolio of the Fox Foundation and                just give you a picture of the research that's being funded                in PD by a private sponsor of research.  To date the foundation                has funded 28 million in Parkinson's related research overall.                 This is since our inception in late 2000.                 Twenty percent of that fund has gone to stem cell research of                one sort or another, and it's a carefully chosen array of stem                cell strategies in mouse, non-human primate, and human embryonic                stem cell systems.                 At the time the grants were funded, so beginning in 2000, very                few investigators had either the ability or access to human lines,                and by default rather than by design, at this point except for one                study, all of the studies that we fund use approved lines.                 Now, this will change in the near future, and we anticipate in                the next rounds that we may see a significant increase in the request                for funding on non-approved lines.  And in part, we feel this is                driven by the FDA and the requirement for lack of adventitious agents                and just the ease at getting a cell line product through the approval                process if it has been isolated without the use of the animal cell                lines or animal products that were not characterized.                 So we have seen in the past several years a significant increase                in requests for stem cell funding in the review of our funding portfolio                and our upcoming funding efforts so that we're attracting new                scientists, people who have not really used stem cell technology                in their research into the area of Parkinson's disease.                 So as a tool, it's an attractive tool for a scientist who                knows Parkinson's as a model, but now wants to expand their                repertoire to use a tool that seems to have much higher promise                than the current strategies they're using.  So we're seeing                an increase in new researchers in the field.                  In our annual fast track funding, this is an independent, investigator-initiated                pilot study where investigators send in unsolicited proposals.                 In 2001, we had roughly 200 applications in Parkinson's in general.                 Ten of these were stem cell applications.  The total request at                that point was just a little over a million dollars.                 In 2002, we had a similar number of total applications, and our                requests went up.  We had 12 requests.  Two and a half million dollars                would have funded all of those stem cell requests.                 And in our pending round in 2003, we have over 200 total applications                that we're anticipating, and more than 20 of these are stem                cell related.  And over time, we're seeing a significant increase                in both the application of stem cells to cell replacement in Parkinson's,                but more interestingly, a recognition of their utility as an  in                vitro  source of authentic human neurons, where people can study                drug effects or the genetics of Parkinson's disease itself.                 And these are studies that are not necessarily targeted at replacement,                but more at understanding the disease and then coming up with a                non-stem cell basis for treatment.                 So the foundation's experience has given us some insights                into what a moratorium would mean in terms of research on stem cells                and also what the current policy on federal funding is.  We have                a diverse portfolio.  We have studies on embryonic stem cells as                well as fetal stem cells and adult stem cells.  Many of these projects                were funded early in our round because the advisory board felt that                stem cell strategies had very high merit, and one of our first efforts                was in creating cell lines that could be used for transplantation.                              So we have now and unusual point of view where we can actually                compare the preliminary results from a variety of efforts.  After                two years of focused research, we can see that if this was a foot                race and we were comparing adult stem cells to fetal stem cells,                there's no competition.  There really is no race involved at                all.                 We have data generated from our funded research that shows that                the adult tissues are not presently a robust source of cells, particularly                when it comes to creating dopamine neurons in our focused effort                to treat Parkinson's disease.                 Optimists would say that there's still potential, and there                is still potential in leveraging the adult stem cell to our goals                as a Parkinson's research foundation.                 But to contrast the progress made in the same time frame with                embryonic stem cells, it's a fragile hope at best to say that                in the immediate future the adult cells hold the promise that we                had hoped two or three years ago that we would see in the research.                              So it is now clearly demonstrated  in vitro , and when we                started this was still an unknown, but now quite well established                in several of our funded laboratories that the human embryonic stem                cells can make authentic dopamine neurons.  What's left now                is the practical application of making this work in a transplant,                and these are ongoing studies.                 So I mentioned a moment ago the proliferative potential provides                a means to treat many individuals from a single isolate.  Unfortunately                our research experience is now encompassing a number of cell transplant                strategies.  The farthest along of these is fetal tissue transplantation                where you harvest from the fetal tissue an authentic dopamine neuron                and transplant that into a Parkinson's patient.                 One of the key observations now that we have had blinded clinical                trials tell us that there may be additional problems that were unforeseen,                a key point is the presence of a fairly robust immune response in                many of these patients, and this is something that cannot really                be ignored.                 I have to take my hat off right now and put on my own personal                hat so that I'm no longer a foundation representative here.                 I work in adult stem cell biology, and it's my hope that we                can make endogenous neural progenitors do the job of an embryonic                stem cell, but in studying the behavior of newborn neurons from                endogenous precursors, we have just run into a very serious impediment                that involves the immune system.                 The immune system, if activated in the context of a developing                neuron, essentially shuts off this early progenitor's ability                to make a functioning neuron, and if we're looking at cell transplantation                as a way to cure Parkinson's disease and the cell transplants                are not well matched to the host or if there isn't a strategy                for making the host tolerant, then having just a few lines is going                to be a very serious impediment to applying the existing lines to                clinical research.                 So getting back to the foundation portfolio, there is another                benefit to looking at additional lines of ES cells.  Putting cell                replacement aside and now looking at the technology that stem cells                in the culture dish provides, there's a body of research that                has been going on for nearly 20 years or more, and that's the                technology of transgenic animals and, more recently, the use of                embryonic stem cells in creating mice that carry very discrete genetic                mutations.                 Now, one of the strategies that we as a foundation trying to cure                Parkinson's disease contemplate is the value of having embryonic                stem cells that actually carry the genetic profile of a Parkinson's                patient, and although we're not talking today necessarily about                nuclear transfer technologies, this clearly pops into mind as a                strategy for making an  in vitro  authentic dopamine neuron                population that is identical to a class of patients that are presenting                a certain disease phenotype.                 So the disease is diverse.  It presents early and progresses rapidly                or it can present very late in life when a tottering gait is really                 commonplace in that age bracket and, therefore, it's not as                big of an effect.                 But this variability is really as variable as human life itself,                and so having 11 or 12 lines from normal individuals does not allow                us to access to that technology, and the creation of drugs that                would more readily target a type of dopamine neuron depletion or                a disease context.                 So the targeted manipulation of genes in an embryonic stem cell                is another aspect of this that is now just entering science, and                the ability to introduce genes into human ES cells or to target                mutations to an individual cell population obviously gives you a                potential way around this, but this is a technology that's novel.                              Nuclear transfer technology would circumvent that.  It gives us                the baseline from which to understand how to create ES cells through                a non-embryonic process, but there has to be a way to get from Point                A to Point B, and this is where the additional lines and the exploration                of new technologies comes into play.                 I'd like to finalize or just summarize here with an overview                of current research concerns.  In the near term, human ES cells                are already undergoing efficacy trials in preclinical models.  So                human ES cells, as we heard earlier, are in animals, and there's                great hope that we'll see that they're at least as effective,                if not more so, if the immune complications can be overcome than                the fetal tissue transplants that are so commonplace now.                 To move forward with these lines, there are several limitations                with current policy that seem to inhibit our progress as a foundation                that's trying to promote cure or intervention in stem cells.                 The first is what I've targeted mostly in my presentation, and                that's the heterogeneity of these current cell lines and limited                numbers.                 So if you start with a few lines and the cell lines are heterogeneous,                some will make, in our experience, a lot of dopamine neurons, and                others really seem to be impeded in their ability to respond to                the same cues provided in the same dish.                 So in this preliminary data that we see presented in summarizing                our funded work, we're observing that one line will work beautifully                well in a paradigm.  Another line is basically eliminated from the                study because it has an inability to make enough dopamine neurons                to be useful.                 So heterogeneity in the performance of an individual line may                limit what can be done with the existing lines, and of course, the                absence of genetic diversity within the existing lines, the absence                of a representation of disease genotype is limiting in what can                be done at the research bench in understanding the disease process,                and of course, heterogeneity in HLA matching may be a very serious                concern, and it will require additional complexity and treatment                if we don't have a matched donor and host or fairly stringent                strategies for tolerizing the host to the incoming cells.                 Finally, I think there is this question that's been touched                upon quite broadly today, and that's the presence of adventitious                agents in the existing lines and whether or not the foundation's                research can transition quickly to clinic really depends on how                well an existing line can meet FDA requirements.                 And I've heard that this is possible, but it also places an                extreme burden of follow-up on a funded project that makes it difficult                for a private foundation to fund.                 So in the absence of federal funding, is private support really                up to the task?  And I think really to summarize this, the private                foundation's focus is to pilot research, to find very good strategies                or promising strategies, and that's where our funding really                runs out.  The NIH has typically stepped in at that point, after                the pilot study stage, and proceeded with the larger experiments,                the validation, the expansion.                 If the foundation funds unapproved lines, that has nowhere to                go at this point.  So there is a serious concern that though we                may be able to use private funding to our benefit, that there will                be a stall or serious delay in getting this to clinic.                 So these burdens loom particularly large to us as a foundation                as the Baby Boomers age, and the number of Parkinson's patients                increases.  The social and economic costs go well beyond just the                Parkinson's community, and I think the economic costs in terms                of the cost of clinical care is just one part of it.  The economic                cost in delayed development of drugs because we cannot use in the                public sector privately funded ES lines for drug screening or nuclear                transfer lines for screening, lines that carry a disease phenotype.                              I think this is an economic burden that our society has to face                and one that should be very carefully weighed in the Council's                discussion.                 I think the foundation very much appreciates the ability and the                invitation here to give our experiences, and we understand that                you have a very difficult task ahead of you as counsel to the President,                and we thank you for this opportunity.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you very much, Dr. Palmer.                 Mr. Pursley, please.                   MR. PURSLEY:   Yes.  Thank you.                 Thank you for having Osiris here.  We've been involved in                mesenchymal stem cell, adult stem cell research for about 11 years                now.  Our technology came out of Arnie Kaplan's lab and was                acquired from Case Western at that time, and we've been solely                focused in that area since on several applications.                 Our development strategy is very straightforward.  It's tissue                engraftment and regeneration without immune suppression.                  Let me back up a moment, too, to set the record straight.  In                some of the earlier media documents, it has me as a Ph.D.  I'm                not a scientist or a physician.  I'm a businessman, and if my                technical explanations aren't satisfactory, most of what I'm                going to report on is published or we believe will be published                in acceptable peer review journals, and in fact, correct me if I'm                wrong.  This panel should have been provided privately an embargoed                manuscript that will be submitted.                 Okay.  Our technology is the universal application, and I'll                explain that term in a moment, of adult MSCs, or mesenchymal stem                cells, with no  in vitro  manipulation.  In other words, if                you will, these very smart cells do what they do  in vivo .                 We simply put them in there and let them go, so to speak.  And I'll                define that in some of our programs.                 What I mean by universal application, we started out as an autologous                cell company and later found out that we can provide from any donor,                unrelated, HLA unmatched, any donor these cells to any recipient                without immune rejection.                 And in fact, what you'll see in our first program, we found                them to be immune selective, T cell-suppressive in some instances.                 So we are now working on what would be literally an off-the-shelf                product for whatever the indication may be.                 The process we use under anappropriate IRB protocol, again, we                take an unrelated, unmatched, volunteer adult donor.  We take a                bone marrow aspirate, a whole marrow aspirate from the iliac crest,                bring that back to our manufacturing, and then we will culture and                expand that currently to about 1,000 doses from one donor.                 We are going through an expansion now that's not a change                in process.  It's an expansion of process.  We will ultimately                get that to about 10,000 doses per single donor.                 A very nice advantage of this is that we don't have to expand                cells indefinitely.  We can go back to new donors.  Currently one                donor can provide bone marrow six times in their lifetime.  These                are usually younger people because the younger you are, the more                MSCs you have.                 We will then cryopreserve the finished product in liquid nitrogen,                and at that point it is ready to go to clinic for use.  We also                now have done stability and potency testing to have that stored                at a lesser temperature over X period of time in certain containers                so that it's easier for the hospitals to use.                 The safety of these cells in the universal application has been                proven now.  Allogenic MSCs have been given to 56 human beings.                 Thousands of various animals models have been used, rats, mice,                goats, dogs, pigs, and baboons.                 This has been done in conjunction with the NIH, Hopkins, Cedar-Sinai,                Texas Heart, et cetera.  And at this point, over several years now,                there has been no possibly or probably related serious adverse events                associated with MSCs.  This includes no infusion or direct administrative                toxicity.  There's no ectopic tissue formation.  In other words,                they aren't differentiating in cartilage  in the heart, on the                knee, et cetera, and there is no tumor formation at this time.                 And, in fact, we have two lead programs in Phase 2, which by definition                from the agency standards, the FDA, means we have met their safety                standards for biologic in order to move into Phase 2.  So we are                very happy to report we see and now the agency sees these cells                as safe, allowing us to move into Phase 2.                 Now, the precise mechanism of action regarding this universal                application is not known.  All we do know is apparently there are                certain cell surface characteristics of the MSC that do not elicit                an immune response, and in fact, as I said, as you'll see in                our first indication, are actually immune suppressive.                 As far as how close are we to developing therapies, our first                two programs are in Phase 2.  The first is peripheral blood stem                cell transplant support for patients with hematologic malignancies,                and again, forgive me if you're very familiar with this pathology,                but basically if you have a leukemia, a myeloma, a lymphoma, et                cetera, a blood cancer, you receive total body irradiation and/or                chemotherapy, with the goal of obliterating the bone marrow because                that's the source of the cancered blood.                 These patients then need to receive a transplant.  They receive                a peripheral blood transplant of hematopoietic stem cells so they                can produce enough platelets to clot and white cells to fight infection                and red blood cells for volume, and gain a natural state of hematopoiesis.                              And those cells usually come from a sibling or a parent.  The                problem is for these patients who have no choice but to go through                this, ten percent and up to 20 percent can actually die from this                procedure, with the vast majority of graft versus host disease,                and that means the hematopoietic stem cells are rejecting the recipient.                              And so what we did in a Phase 1, in a multi-center Phase 1, is                provide MSCs, mesenchymal stem cells approximately four hours prior                to the transplantation with, first of all, in a Phase 1, the primary                goal for a biologic is always safety, and you look for secondary                efficacy trends, which are great if you reach them, and we did in                a very big way.                 What we did is reduce significantly graft versus host disease.                 So we believe there was a T cell suppressive effect in working with                the patient or with the hematopoietic stem cells not to reject the                patient, if you will.                 Now, the reason we say selective T cells suppressive, these Phase                1 patients are now out three years.  They have also had a significant                reduction in return of the cancer, which means we did not suppress                the T cells fighting GVL, graft versus leukemia.                 This was a very big concern.  If these are immune suppressive,                are we going to hurt the patient's own ability to fight the                cancer coming back?  And what we've seen at three years out                is this is not only not the case.  They have a less incidence of                return of the cancer.                 So with those data we are in Phase 2. This is an IV preparation.                 The status is we should have Phase 2 data reportable in time Q3                of '04.                 If that goes well, we will go into a Phase 3, and this should                be available to the hematologic malignancy population if things                go as planned, and Murphy has a way of raising his head in this                business and always will, but even with some of those considerations,                we would hope to be commercially available to humans by 2007 with                this.                 Just after that program, a very similar situation but a different                mechanism of action, which is the amazing thing about these cells.                 That was a T cell suppression effect to reduced GVHD.  In a similar                sense there are infants to adolescents primarily who don't have                matched donors who will receive cord blood transplants, and their                problem is not GVHD because there are so few hematopoietic stem                cells in the  cord blood transplants.  Their problem is establishing                a natural hematopoiesis.                 So some of these kids will lay in the hospital an average of about                90 days.  It's fairly replete in the literature, and they aren't                released from the hospital until they produce enough platelets to                get out, and so they can sit for 90 days in a subacute state with                bleeds and infections, et cetera.                 This is a tiny population.  It's an orphan indication, but                there's nothing that can be done for these, and in  a Phase                1 study with an admittedly retrospective comparison to that database.                 All of these kids are in a single database in the U.S.                 Our primary goal was to decrease the time to platelet engraftment,                to get these kids out of the hospital and establish a natural hematopoiesis,                and the kids that received MSCs got out in an average of about 38                days compared to retrospective control, historical control of 90.                              And so that program is in Phase 2, and we hope it would be available                also to humans in the '07 time frame.                 The very large and much more talked about program, our cardiac                program for acute MI, will be in humans this December in conjunction                with Boston Scientific.  Most of this preclinical work was done                in swine models at Cedar-Sinai and Hopkins, and the primary goal                here is for these cells to reshape the baseline morphology, the                heart, and regain the baseline function of the heart pre-MI.                 It is fantastic preclinical data, and I say that with humility                after looking at preclinical data for 24 years in this business.                 After you see so many pig hearts grow back and get back to normal                function, you start to believe it.                 And the IND has been filed, and the FDA will allow us to go into                clinic at the NIH and Duke this December.                 The idea here, too, in this indication, something we just found                out in '99 in rats, this will be an IV administration.  It is                not a direct injection or catheter application to the heart.  Apparently                these very smart cells — and I can call them that because I'm                not a scientist — find their way to an inflammatory site.                  And an acute MI is a very strong inflammatory event, and an inflammatory                cascade that probably lasts in a strong manner for seven or eight                days.  And basically these are given IV.  They swim to the heart.                 They regenerate the infarcted area of the heart, which the heart                doesn't then respond with a compensatory thickening like normal,                and that happens in about four to six weeks, and in about six months                the heart gets very close back to pre-MI function.                 And if that gets in the clinic in December as planned, and it                should, these are going to be much larger trials because of acute                MI.  We would like to think that this product could be available                to the public commercially in 2009 or 2010.                 The next product which we have an IND filed for and will be in                humans before the end of '04 is meniscal repair in the knee.                 This is the most common knee injury at least in this country.  There's                about 850,000 meniscal tears, from the Weekend Warriors.  This will                be a high regulatory bar.  It should be.  These are healthy young                people normally, and so the safety is going to be critical.                 Preclinical work has been done in 72 goats, and basically what                we do is do a partial to full meniscectomy as is done with the patients.                 There's nothing you can do for this today but take out part                or all of the meniscectomy to ease the pain.  After whole or partial                meniscectomy, it is replete in the literature that one goes on to                develop osteoarthritis.                And what we do is give about 150 million cells directly into the                knee, and it grows back the meniscus in about six weeks time, and                hopefully then it will obviate any progression to osteoarthritis,                and we hope to be in the clinic with that as well in, again, '04                and, again, should be commercially available to humans in a similar                time as the acute MI product in '09 or '10.                 The last advanced program, also in concert with Boston Scientific,                is maybe the largest unmet definitive therapy  in terms of societal                cost, and that's congestive heart failure or, maybe more appropriately,                chronic ischemia leading to congestive heart failure.  At Texas                Heart, in the canine model, we put an amaroid occluder in place                in these dogs to mimic chronic ischemia.  Basically you do that                for about 30 days until you create an ischemic model.                 About 30 days later you give the MSCs.  The ejection fraction                in the amaroid occluded non-treated dogs, once it drops below 17                percent, they die.  The ejection fraction in the treated dogs with                the occluded, LAD still in place, the occlusion remaining in place,                goes back to normal function in about six months.                 So basically we've restored the heart morphology and the baseline                heart function pre-ischemic model with the amaroid occluder in place,                and there is possibly some form of angiogenesis going on here.                 So those are the advanced programs, and in all of these programs                and all of the animal models to this date, there have been no serious                adverse events associated with MSCs, again, neither infusional toxicity,                ectopic foci, or tumor formation.                 Finally, we have many, many orthopedic models in a preclinical                area where we will or will not use a scaffolding or a matrix for                these cells in some of those applications.                 And finally, we are involved in grants from DARPA and NIST looking                at wound healing and CNS repair, respectively.                 As far as what obstacles stand in the way, the usual.  One is                enough money, especially in today's very tight private equity                market, and it's probably going to stay that way until the IPO                lid comes off.                 Cell biology talent.  We will be forever understanding what goes                on with these, which leads to another point I'll get to in a                moment.                 And then one, to put into an equal bag where we can all take an                equal share of guilt, and that's politics, corporate greed,                and academic ego, which is a bane always in the development of any                of these, and I don't say this lightly.  Again, as a personal                comment after being involved in this 24 years and being fortunate                enough to be at Genentech when they grew up and then at Genzyme                when they grew up and at TKT with maybe the most elegant protein                technology I've ever seen.  Have never seen anything like this.                              The hardest thing about managing this company is keeping it focused.                 There is no application that can't be brought up that we can                deny the possibility of the use of these cells or cells like this.                               Bill Krivits up at Minnesota has given these to kids with lysosomal                storage diseases and they are not transduced.  They just start secreting                the enzyme they're missing.                 The immune modulation possibility now that we found out almost                serendipitously with our first program, that's a whole new area                of arthritis, et cetera.  It literally is limited by our imagination,                and it's bigger than any of those entities I mentioned by far.                 It is the closest thing — and I'm sorry for the drama — of a                human health care miracle that I've seen in a quarter century.                              And I just hope somehow those entities can synergize to bring                this as quickly as possible and as safely as possible to the millions                and millions of people.                 As far as approaches to overcome immune reaction, we don't                have any.  We have found that there is no immune reaction against                these cells, and not only that.  We have found them to be immune                suppressive selectively in appropriate situations.                 As far as the federal policy impact, depending on what your patent                portfolio is, that drives your answer on this.  Right now we think                from the Patent Office's perspective it's a very good thing.                 We have had senior scientists that have stuck with this from the                beginning because they believe with this their inventions have been                protected, and it is allowed to go on in a protected manner to develop                those.                 As far as the NIH, again, anything that can be done by that institution                to further synergize itself with commercial endeavors without feeling                it is bastardizing its academic purity, and exactly what that means                and how that is getting done we don't have an answer, and I                don't know who does, but it certainly could help all efforts.                              And the FDA, first of all, I want to say, again, in a long experience                over several technologies, they have been a very good partner with                us in this, and we appreciate that.  We're a tiny company.                 We need a lot of guidance, and it hasn't been an adversarial                situation.   It has been a partnership situation, and anything to                continue to increase that.                 We are in the good fortune of being by far the most advanced company                in the world in adult stem cell research, and so it has got to be                in partnership with the FDA that we understand how these are to                be regulated because I think that will set the bar for how it is                done from this point on.                 I think one of the things that will be looked at, and we have                to understand where we draw the line to accept, is especially in                the technology where everything is happening  in vivo , basically                from a cell that's the same  ex vivo .  Without all of                the black box answers for mechanism of action, why, how, where,                how long known is how that will be weighed against the actual clinical                outcomes of safety and efficacy and how that regulatory guide pole                is looked at is critical.                 Thank you very much.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you very much.                 Dr. Goldstein, please.                  DR. GOLDSTEIN:   Chairman Kass and members of the President's                Council on Bioethics, thank you very much for inviting me to testify                today.                 I'm the Chief Scientific Officer for the Juvenile Diabetes                Research Foundation.                 JDRF was founded in 1970 by parents of children with juvenile                diabetes to find a cure for diabetes and its complications through                the support of research, and this year we expect to fund approximately                $90 million worth of research.                 Since its inception JDRF has funded diabetes research all over                the world, and it turns out it's the world's leading nonprofit,                non-governmental funder of diabetes research.                 At your July 25th meeting, you heard from Charles Queenan, a JDRF                volunteer, who spoke about the advances in islet cell transplantation                that are showing dramatic results in people with Type I diabetes.                 I'd like to briefly summarize.                 As of April 2003, more than 250 patients worldwide had received                islets infusions using the so-called Edmondton protocol.  About                half of these patients received islets alone.  The other half received                islets in conjunction with or after a kidney transplant.                 Most patients have enjoyed insulin independence, reduced hypoglycemic                episodes, and improved quality of life.                 Despite this success, there are too few insulin producing cells                available from organ donors that at its max could help perhaps five,                six, 700 people a year.  JDRF, therefore, believes that embryonic                stem cell research could lead to the discovery of new ways to develop                additional and unlimited supplies of insulin producing beta cells                with the hope that everyone with the disease can be treated and                cured.                 With this background, I want to cover some of the activities that                JDRF is engaged in over the past several years in the United States                and abroad to help advance the embryonic stem cell research agenda.                              In the spring of 2000, we announced our intention to support embryonic                stem cell research.  We began to build a research portfolio that                promoted human and animal stem cell research.                 To insure the ethical conduct of this research we formed a stem                cell oversight committee consisting of leading researchers, policy                makers, ethicists, and lay volunteers who were charged with providing                a second level of review in addition to the usual scientific peer                review for all human stem cell research applications that we received                and considered.                 We recognize that stem cell research may require innovative and                novel public/private partnerships, and we included in our request                or solicitation the notation that we would support the derivation                of human embryonic stem cell lines.                 The scientific principles that form the basis for stem cell research                funding program is as follows.  We recognize the need to support                research using human stem cells from all sources and that  very                basic research is the necessary precursor for the development of                cell based therapies; that adult stem cell research is a complementary                approach.  We have long supported efforts in both adult stem cell                research, as well as more recently human embryonic stem cell research.                              JDRF believes in providing a collaborative environment that will                encourage or maximize the opportunity and promise of this research,                and we work to insure easy and public dissemination  of embryonic                stem cell lines without major restrictions as to the usage, and                we're committed to sharing information and data as they become                available.                 We also participate in forums for public dialogue and dissemination                information.                 JDRF embryonic stem cell research activities today include everything                that I mentioned, cells from all sources.  This year we have applied                approximately $6 million in support of stem cell research with out-year                commitments of about $16 million over the next four years.  Of the                $6 million this year, about three million is for research to direct                the differentiation into glucose-responsive, insulin- producing                cells using human embryonic stem cells as starting material.  About                two million is for research using human stem cells from other sources,                and one million for animal work.                 About one third of JDRF's funding for human embryonic stem                cell research supports work done in the United States.  The rest                supports research outside the United States where in many cases                investigators work in more favorable environments, often with special                government programs that provide extra resources for human embryonic                stem cell research efforts, for example, Sweden, the United Kingdom,                Australia, and Singapore.                 We initially received very few applications from U.S. based investigators,                perhaps related to concerns over policies and restrictions.  We                have received consistent feedback from U.S. investigators that they                are wary of entering this field even with private funding due to                the limitations imposed by the federal policy.                 They, in addition, mentioned a limited number of federally approved                lines, the lack of genetic diversity among the lines, insufficient                characterization, variability in the developmental capacities of                the lines, difficulties in distribution, as well as the ubiquitous                presence of the mass feeder layers which we've been discussing                which make the development of clinically useful cell therapies not                impossible, but more difficult as has been mentioned.                 These barriers we feel need to be removed to increase the value                of using the approved stem cell lines for research and then for                the development of therapies.  We acknowledge and recognize the                efforts of the NIH, particularly the NIH stem cell task force, and                we are working closely with NIH on this.                 But I think that it's our international partnerships that                are pertinent to the conversation this afternoon.                 JDRF's international efforts have continued and been expanded                in the area of stem cell research both through independent funding                of investigators, as well as through partnerships directly with                other governments.  We have established a series of co-funding partnerships                with government research agencies in the United Kingdom, Sweden,                Canada, Australia, France and Singapore, and we have ongoing discussions                with others.                 In some of these partnerships, local foundations within those                countries also provide support.                 In addition, in many of those countries, we have provided funding                for very basic embryonic stem cell research that was not necessarily                connected to diabetes in any particular way since the research was                at the earliest stage.                 Because of our extensive international work and leadership, JDRF                was invited in January 2003 to be a founding member of the International                Stem Cell Forum established by the Medical Research Council of the                United Kingdom under the leadership of Professor Sir George Radda.                              This group currently includes representatives from government                agencies in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Finland, France,                Germany, Israel, Japan, Singapore, Sweden, and the Netherlands,                as well as the NIH.                 The objectives of the forum are to encourage collaborative research                across nations, boundaries, and disciplines; to encourage sharing                of resources and data; to fully capitalize on the existing available                human stem cell lines; to identify key research gaps and address                these by capitalizing on national strength; and to identify funding                schemes that actually facilitate transnational collaborations.                 In specific terms, this group has agreed to develop a set of criteria                that could be adopted globally for optimizing the derivation characterization                and maintenance of human stem cell lines from all sources; identify                a small number of international laboratories that would commit to                using the agreed criteria to characterize existing human embryonic                stem cell lines; and to identify opportunities for sharing resources,                cell lines, data protocols, and guidance documents on an international                basis; to coordinate or make an attempt to coordinate national stem                cell banking activities.                 This group has already convened a working group to characterize                stem cell lines with a series of recommendations.                 The United Kingdom has one of the more progressive environments                for stem cell research as a consequence of the British government                providing strong political, regulatory, and funding support in this                area.  The recent establishment of the U.K. Stem Cell Bank is one                example.  This will provide access to existing and new quality controlled                adult, fetal, and embryonic stem cell lines.  It will have a good                manufacturing practice arm for research leading to clinical applications.                              Academic researchers and companies from the U.K. and elsewhere                will be eligible to deposit and to access lines according to a code                of practice developed by interested parties.                 This bank will serve as an outstanding example of how to foster                and enhance the research needed to develop therapies from stem cells                of all kinds.                 Other countries are working toward the development of similar                resources, and it is envisioned that the International Stem Cell                Forum may serve to coordinate such activities in order to enhance                the exchange of information and to provide complementary efforts                in this burgeoning field of research.                 Examples of activities under consideration include the establishment                of a registry posted on an international Web site that would provide                appropriate scientific information about lines not listed in the                current NIH registry; characterization of non-NIH registry lines,                and comparison with NIH lines; in addition, joint training programs                to assist new investigators.                 Organizing and coordinating these international research activities                in order to better serve research efforts everywhere provides a                model that is highly likely to bring results to the clinic much                sooner.                 Well, this summarizes research activities to date.  I do not want                to provide the impression that these international activities, for                example, can replace the resources which the federal government                and United States could provide for this research.                 The limitations imposed by the current policy raise questions                and provoke uncertainties about the future  of human embryonic stem                cell research in the United States.  We think that one result is                fewer scientists working, fewer graduate students, postdocs, et                cetera, and universities who have less than an active willingness                to invest in facilities, a comment that was made earlier in the                afternoon.                 These resources could make a significant difference to research                progress in the development of insulin producing beta cells for                the cure of diabetes, and in this area, they need to establish and                nurture collaborations between the world's experts in beta cell                biology and the world's experts in stem cell biology so they                can collectively conduct the necessary research.  It remains a critical                event.                 Expanded federal embryonic stem cell policy would make an important                difference in helping promote this research.                 Much of the current knowledge of beta cell development comes from                studies using mass embryonic stem cells that is not always easily                translatable into human work.  Several protocols, however, have                been reported that direct mass embryonic stem cells to becoming                functioning islet cells.  Early studies in human embryonic stem                cells suggest that they could be coached, though at the moment inefficiently                to insulin secreting cells, and this work has gone a little more                slowly than we would like.                 We do continue to support research on the differentiation of adult                precursor cells into beta cells, but that's a severely limited                field in terms of how successful it has been.                 Progress to date does underscore the need for continued investment                in research in this area, including the creation of an environment                in the United States that encourages and supports scientific discovery.                              The potential for this research to have a positive impact on the                maybe 100 million Americans who suffer from a wide variety of diseases                and injuries who might benefit is just too great to be ignored.                              Thank you for your invitation, your time, and your consideration.                               CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you, Dr. Goldstein.                 Thank all of your for your fine presentations.                  Let me just throw the floor open.  Let me, so that everybody knows                where we are, we started late.  We were originally scheduled to                go to 5:15.  Let's go to at least 5:25 and get people's                questions out so that we take advantage of our guests who traveled                so far to be with us.                 So, please, Jim Wilson.                  PROF. WILSON:   Several of you referred to the political                uncertainty of stem cell research in the United States, and in the                course of making these remarks, you listed many possibilities.                 I would like to know from you as briefly as possible what you think                is the chief political uncertainty.                 Is it money?  Is it stem cell lines?  Is it the number of researchers                or what?  What is the political uncertainty that you're concerned                about?                  DR. OKARMA:   Well, the quick answer is all of the above                that you just mentioned.  If I were to prioritize them, it is the                pure political process of taking scientific inquiry out of the hands                and hearts of the scientists and into the halls of Congress.                 Can the environment worsen with a different administration or                with the same administration?  These are exactly the things that                our investors tell us that they are concerned about.                 But the fact that there is a very thin infrastructure to complement                what we are doing at Geron, what other folks that you've heard                are doing here makes the risk higher to achieve a commercialable                and safe and effective product.  They are intimately intertwined.                               PROF. WILSON:   That is true, but Congress has always, since                1938, placed under legislation by its action important therapeutic                regimes that might affect the safety or health of other people.                 Is this supposed to be exempt from that?                  DR. OKARMA:   I'd like to hear an example of that that                compares to the —                  PROF. WILSON:   Well, the FDA constantly regulates.                  DR. OKARMA:   That's not political; that's not congressional.                 This is different.                  PROF. WILSON:   Oh, there's a difference between the                FDA and Congress?  You'll have to explain that to me.                  DR. OKARMA:   I think there certainly is.                  PROF. WILSON:   Anyone else have a response?                  DR. GOLDSTEIN:   The universities during the past two years-plus,                since the administration's policy, have had a variety of information                coming.  As Dr. Zerhouni told you, it has only been since his arrival                that the stem cell task force was created.  So some time was lost.                              The most simplest example that I can give you is the confusion                over the application of federal policy to indirect cost of university                researchers, and it has only been in the past four to six months                where people have accepted the notion that they can do federally                funded research next door to privately funded research without getting                in trouble.                 The clarification of that was painfully slow, and people just                didn't hop on the bandwagon immediately.                 The second part, I think, has to do with what investigators tell                us, is it takes me six to eight months to work through my research                office to get a material transfer agreement to get one cell line                at $5,000.  I'm hardly likely to be interested in studying two,                three, or more at that pace and would prefer some more economical                and more free distribution of more well characterized material.                              So that inherent slowness is not exactly a terrific ingredient                for promoting and expediting research in a new area.  It's one                reason why the international community, for example, has taken a                very strong position to complement the NIH activity and make materials,                information available on a more free exchange environment.                 And you know, it's in a time when budgets for funding research                worldwide seem to be down.  I would point out that the U.K., Japan                have put special extra money at this topic because they view it                as an opportunity.  That coincident with decreases in their regular                research budgets.                 So people see this as a major opportunity.                  PROF. WILSON:   Thank you.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Alfonso.                   DR. FOSTER:   Jim, were you through?                  PROF. WILSON:   Yes.                   DR. FOSTER:   Dr. Okarma, I wanted to ask one question                that I wasn't sure about.  You emphasized the oligodendrocyte                as one of your chief cells that was moving on.  You said you were                working on this in spinal cord injury, but I presume this would                be some myelinating agent in something like MS or multiple sclerosis                or something as well.  I don't know that, but the question would                be if you put in a differentiated cell and let's say you have                a balance between, you know, some autoimmune disease that's                demyelinating and an oligodendrocyte that's myelinating, the                question I was going to ask is that apparently a lot of times there's                a block in the oligodendrocyte capacity to myelinate because there's                a block in the movement from the pre-oligodendrocyte to the oligodendrocyte                by, you know, a jagged notch interaction or something like that.                              So I guess the question I'm asking:  is this differentiated                cell going to be — we've talked about the problem of immune                rejection and things like that — but is there another problem in                certain diseases of differentiated cells that they might not work                because of the primary disease that's present?                  DR. OKARMA:   That's precisely correct, and we have                yet done no work on systemic autoimmune based demyelinating diseases,                although to your point, they could potentially be subject to — we                have only worked on oligodendrocyte precursors in acute spinal cord                injury.                   DR. FOSTER:   Thank you very much.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Alfonso Gomez-Lobo.                  DR. GÓMEZ-LOBO:   I don't know who this question                is going to go to.  Probably Dr. Okarma.                 I understand my charge here in this Council primarily as a duty                to worry about bioethics.  I mean this is a Council on Bioethics,                and that's the way I see my social role in this context.                 And one of the things that worries me is that in these presentations,                in these wonderful presentations you have made, I don't see                that dimension.  For instance, it's one thing for there to be                political problems and perhaps concentrated on Congress, but I think                that there's the larger context of the whole nation and there's                the larger context of our lives and of the respect we owe to each                other, et cetera.                 And then the question arises:   shouldn't we see a problem                in the fact that a blastocyst that we know could be implanted and                continue its journey towards being like one of us, if that's                destroyed to extract the embryonic stem cells, whether we should                not worry at all about that?  Is that a reason why some people may                have serious doubts not about the benefits, but about the means                to obtain these benefits?                  DR. OKARMA:   Well, first, sir, I was specifically asked                not to address those concerns, but let me assure you that they are                very prominent in the culture of our company.  Approximately six                months after I arrived at Geron in December of '97, I formed                an ethics advisory board to discuss precisely those issues both                for my own uncertainties, to more vigorously and rigorously dissect                the issues as viewed by different Western religious traditions,                as well as secular perspectives, and to expose the workers in the                company to this body and have them ask their own questions of it,                which has helped us enormously and has informed us about the issues                of moral status and has comforted us in our position that this is                not an ends justifies the means argument, but that the special circumstances,                the scalability, the biological diversity, the normalness of the                cells that we're able to manufacture from a single stem cell                line made from a single embryo destined for destruction tilts the                moral seesaw in our direction.                 And we are intellectually and emotionally convinced of that point.                               DR. GÓMEZ-LOBO:   May I?                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Do you want to respond?                  DR. GÓMEZ-LOBO:   Fair enough.  Now, that's a                straightforward utilitarian argument, and someone may say that,                you know, even one adult could be sacrificed for many.  So there                are serious problems with that argument.                 Let me leave it at that.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Does someone else want to respond to the                question as put before I call on someone else?                 Dr. Goldstein.                  DR. GOLDSTEIN:   I would like to make a general comment                that we took the issue so seriously that we added an additional                layer of oversight, and the charge to the committee was to provide                and consider and revisit issues as they come up.                 We assumed this was going to be a dynamic field, and this committee                developed guidelines.  It watches over and it considers many aspects                that we don't consider with typical research grants, with typical                research grants that the IRB approves and you have all of the signatures                on.                 So I think it has been taken in extremely serious ways.  I don't                have a specific response about, yes, this is the correct or incorrect                or that kind of thing, but we made this effort because we saw this                as an issue, and we decided we needed a serious way to deal with                it.                 And this committee reports directly to our board.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Janet, Janet Rowley.                  DR. ROWLEY:   I'd like further discussion in two areas,                and I suspect  that maybe it's both Dr. Okarma and Dr. Palmer                who might respond to this.                 First, I was surprised at your discussion of your funding problems                at Geron and the fact that you're only a third of the size of                a year ago because implicit in much of what has been written and                discussed earlier this morning, the assumption was that the federal                funding wasn't going to be important because private funding                was so robust and we could sit back and let the private sector take                care of it.                 And you've raised some question about that more rosy view.                              I have another question though about the role of nonapproved cell                lines.  So in a sense, both of you are counting on these nonapproved                cell lines because they will obviate the need for feeder cell layers                and things of that sort.  But how do you view these being used in                the future or being of benefit or are they only going to be of use                outside of the United States and not be available for use for American                citizens?                  DR. OKARMA:   Well, first, let me clarify the premise of                your question.  There's no uncertainty that the current lines                in Menlo Park that we have qualified for human use can go forward                into early stage human trials.  They are robust.  They are clean.                 They differentiate repeatedly in the directions that we want them                to go.                 But they are xenogeneic, and they will eventually die off, we                think.  We have no evidence for that yet, but we think it's                the conservative and appropriate assumption to make, that these                cells, despite their telomerase expression will not be immortal,                as is a tumor cell.                 So for those two reasons, their natural life span and the desire                to improve by taking advantage of what we've learned from the                existing derivation protocols and improving them, putting those                derivation procedures under GMP with completely qualified and pedigreed                reagents so that even the antibody used to purify the growth factor                has never seen a murine antibody; that's what we're talking                about about GMP cell lines.                 And that is a normal progression within the entire field of cell                therapy, and we think we are ahead of everyone in the restricted                arena of embryonic stem cells.  So stay tuned for that announcement.                              The issue, as you correctly point out, is that those cells by                definition of the current government policy will not be available                for study by U.S. government funded entities, and there's no                question, as you correctly imply, that the international community                will be very anxious to get their hands on those cell lines.                  DR. PALMER:   I'd like to add then to that the idea                of heterogeneity.  If you're a publicly funded entity and would                like to explore the utility of these cells and you find that only                a few will perform the way that you are interested in and then only                a few of those will work in a portion of the patients that you are                interested in treating, then the new lines become absolutely critical;                that you could not cure Parkinson's.  You could treat a few                people.  If the cell lines run out, then you're done.                 So it is a critical aspect of expanding the research to a level                where it's self-sustaining.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Bill Hurlbut.  I'm sorry.  Excuse me.                 Michael and then Bill.                  PROF. SANDEL:   This is a question for Dr. Palmer, and it                goes back to something that Paul McHugh said in this morning's                discussion.  He was giving an interpretation, a sympathetic interpretation,                of the President's current policy allowing the use of private                funds but not public funds for new embryonic stem cell lines and                limiting public funding to the preexisting.                 And the way that Paul interpreted that was as a challenge to scientists                to say, ""All right.  Within this limited area, show us what                you can do.  Show us that there's not just speculative promise,                but that there's genuine progress.  Show us.  Let the burden                be on you scientists to show us not only that, but also that redeeming                that progress depends on going beyond the 12 approved stem lines                that are currently available for distribution, and show us also                that redeeming that genuine progress requires federal funding for                more than the existing approved cell lines.""                 Now, much as I heard your comment, you were speaking in that spirit,                addressing that kind of challenge with respect very concretely to                Parkinson's, but I wonder if you could just, taking that challenge                directly of Paul, address to him in a summary way the answer.                 As I understood your testimony just now, you in effect think you                already now have the answer for Paul, and then I'd be interested                to hear Paul's response.                  DR. PALMER:   Let me speak about data that I have seen,                but it's still proprietary and confidential in a general sense.                 In funding stem cell research, about half of our stem cell effort                is in embryonic stem cells, and the remainder divided between adult                stem cells and fetal stem cells.                 Within the embryonic stem cell projects, several of these proposals,                their specific aim was to contrast and compare cell lines that were                available to them, and what we have seen in the data that they present                is that there is beyond a shadow of a doubt huge potential to create                authentic dopamine neurons from human ES cells.                 That's good.  The problem is that within the limited number                of cell lines that they have tested that potential is hugely variable.                 These are cell lines that are theoretically pluripotent, and they                should be equivalent embryonic lines.  If you look at a picture                of them in the dish, they look strikingly different from line to                line, which has the stamp of their history, which cell lines they                have been exposed to, which sera they had applied to them, which                growth factors were used in their preparation in isolation.                 And this history of experience from these ES cells then imprints                them to behave a certain way when their context is suddenly if they're                asked to produce a dopamine neuron.                 So the heterogeneity tells me as a scientist that we have a problem,                that some of these lines may work some of the time for some of the                applications, but they will not all work for all applications.                 And this is a very strong argument for expanding the variety and                the heterogeneity of the lines that we currently have access to.                 Eleven or 12 is not enough.                  DR. McHUGH:   Yes, thank you very much, Michael, for asking                that question because it was rather what I wanted to ask.  But I                have two responses to that.                 First of all, the heterogeneity that you mentioned may or may                not be so compelling as to not allow you to find, after all, these                are immortal cells, and if you get one or two or three lines from                the 12 and the expansion of things that are going, you may well                be able to tell us that you're already achieving with what we                have in front of us adequate things for the future.  That's                the first thing.                 But more importantly to me, anyway, was what you said about the                issues of the autoimmune problem and how you thought that the autoimmune                problem was going to be the telling one as you have seen the cells                die in the process when they're exposed in this way in a foreign                turf and you looked forward to the opportunity perhaps of using                somatic cell nuclear transplantation to develop dopamine cells that                were, in fact, from the person themselves.                 And I wanted to say that I, of course, have spoken in this conference                that I think that that is going to be the way in which embryonic                cells ultimately will — as one of the ways that will get to this                source of cells in ways that we will have to look more closely at                its ethical basis and I see as distinct from the ethical source                that comes from the zygote and the embryonic stem cells that the                President was talking about in his August 9 speech.                 So, Michael, now to return to you, I just think that we've                seen today from these wonderful four presenters just the kinds of                things that I would like to see to enhance our conversation to get                us to a place where we will talk about the direction science will                go and the promise that it will take.                 And let's just finish off by a very small question that I                wanted to ask you, Dr. Palmer, since I've got the floor, and                that was aspects of the biology of Parkinsonism itself and the concern                that I have that perhaps the disorder — are you sure that the disorder                will not in itself being directed against dopamine cells, might                not kill off the stem cells that are being produced and kill them                more quickly than even the endogenous cells?                 So where is the understanding of the pathogenesis of Parkinsonism                in relationship to this transplantation treatment?                  DR. PALMER:   Let me turn this around maybe and expand your                horizon in thinking about ES cells, embryonic stem cells, and again                stepping one more step into the nuclear transfer arena or into the                area where you can engineer, genetically modify a traditional embryonic                stem cell.                 So there is no guarantee that making a pure population of dopamine                neurons will cure Parkinson's disease.  There is very good evidence                that under some circumstances dopamine neurons from fetal tissue                do help in Parkinson's disease, and what we would be striving                for is a population that is renewable that would not require the                use of fetuses for curing individuals.                 So in that sense, there is a gold standard that is working relatively                well, but has problems to overcome to which ES cell strategies can                aspire to, and that does work.  And so I am optimistic that the                stem cell strategy will also work, if not better, if we can eliminate                the aspects of the fetal tissue transplant that may be giving us                trouble in that particular clinical paradigm.                 Now, flip-flopping this a little bit, you brought up the idea                that Parkinson's disease is a disease, and putting healthy cells                into the diseased brain may be a bad idea and may not make it work.                 How would you understand the complexities of that disease?                 The way one might approach this is to use ES cells that harbor                all of that genetic complexity of that disease and model it in a                tissue culture dish.  Try your drug screening strategies.  See if                you can't find mechanisms that are not possible to even understand                in a whole organism by recreating the system in the dish.                 This is the real power of ES cell technology.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Bill — sorry.  Paul, did you want to just                every quickly?                  DR. McHUGH:   No.  Thank you very much for that.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Bill Hurlbut, the last question and then                we'll stop.                  DR. HURLBUT:   Well, thank you for your presentations and                the very exciting prospects of going forward with the existing cell                lines and the others that you suggest.  The future looks like it                has real possibilities.                 What I want to explore for a second is beyond the therapeutic                potential.  You've mentioned amazing possibilities for scientific                research and drug testing and so forth.  So even if this technology                doesn't end up making its way into the clinics, it obviously                is going to be very, very important for the whole future of biomedical                science.                 So what I want to ask you is this.  Given this amazing foundational,                early stage of this new medicine, kind of a whole new wing on the                mansion of medicine, and yet given the conflict that is going on                within our culture where, depending on who you believe, which survey                you believe, maybe half the population has problems about the moral                grounding of this future of medicine, here's my question.                 I was speaking with a pediatrician recently, and she told me that                it's not uncommon to have parents whose children are going to                be vaccinated ask her was this vaccine grown on fetal tissues.                 So the problem is that even if the individual patient doesn't                choose to employ the therapy that they have an ethical problem with,                the whole foundation of medicine is going to be built on this technology,                and so it's not just a vaccine that somebody can say, ""Well,                I don't want it.""  It's just sort of like everything                will be built on this, right?                 And beyond the question of whether or not the President could                change his policies, there is the Dickey amendment, and I think                we heard this morning that to a very large extent his decision was                an interpretation of the Dickey amendment itself.                 So given half the population roughly has ethical problems, given                that this is going to be the future foundation of medicine, are                there ways in the kind of research you're doing; do you see                any hopeful ways that we can do this in a way that bypasses the                moral problems?                 And as a part of that question, I'd like to ask you:  how                important do you think cloning for biomedical research is, so-called                therapeutic cloning?                 And recently the work of Gurdon at Cambridge suggested that maybe                you can find the cytoplasmic factors that can down-regulate or reprogram                the nucleus of a somatic cell.  Do you see any hopeful ways out                of this?                 And are there ways we could fund this current research such that                the  moral impasse would be temporary if we could just get it launched                with a good deal of support?                  DR. PALMER:   I do agree with the sentiment entirely.  So                the real issue is how.  Let's take two hypotheticals.                 One is that the U.S. is restricted in its ability to pursue these                technologies on ethical grounds, on moral grounds, yet other countries                are not.  The moral question becomes can you then use the information                and technology that was developed offshore morally.  And that's                something that would have to be discussed.                 We would be far behind in our technologies, in our drug development,                in our ability to provide health care to our constituents.  If we                had the ability to temporarily recognize the value of the lines                of research with the full intent that we need to understand what                these cytoplasmic factors are, nuclear transfer technology is the                prototype.  It is the first working example of taking a genome,                which is totipotent.  So a cell's genome has all of the information                that you need to make an individual.                 My cheek cell, if it has all of its genes, is totipotent, given                the right cytoplasmic factors to program it.  How will you circumvent                this moral problem unless there is a decision or an understanding                that the morality is a combination of concepts and beliefs?                 This is a very difficult question, and I don't envy your task                as Council.  If you were to take a fertilized egg and reprogram                a nucleus, create an embryo out of that to make stem cells, that's                not so technically different than just simply programming the nucleus                to go through all of those steps to create stem cells, and it's                one of an intellectual process coming to grips with a moral stance,                a belief.  It's going to be difficult to separate those two,                I think.                 So technically I think there's great hope to program the genome                in a way that would lead to an embryonic stem cell that's pluripotent.                 The prototype of that is nuclear transfer technology, and that is                the technology that's going to give you those steps to get from                Point A to Point B without creating the embryo.                  DR. HURLBUT:   Within the constraints of existing policy,                do you think we could if we funded it properly find a way to do                that?                  DR. PALMER:   It could happen tomorrow or it could be years.                 It will happen offshore regardless.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thanks to our four panelists for your presentations,                your forthcomingness.  Thanks to the Council members for enduring                a long, but very interesting day.

The Caregiver, Vol. 22: No. 1 - 2-   Dietary Factors in Alzheimer's Disease DIETARY FACTORS IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE: TRANSLATION TO PREVENTION AND TREATMENT  Spring 2003  Donald E. Schmechel, M.D. Director and Principal Investigator Joseph and Kathleen Bryan Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (Bryan ADRC) Professor of Medicine (Neurology) Duke University School of Medicine The basic model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias is that the occurrence of disease in a given person is a complex interaction of genetic and environmental factors operating over long periods of time. Like hypertension, diabetes, and atherosclerosis, there are probable long periods of time where silent tissue injury occurs before clinical disease may present due to a catastrophic event or loss of final reserve. These long periods of silent and progressive tissue injury are influenced by genetic factors and environmental factors. The most common genetic risk factor is inheritance of one copy (25% of the population) or two copies (2% of the population) of the AD risk gene apolipoprotein E4. However, even the high risk E4/4 persons (two copies) may vary in onset of clinical AD from age 48 to age 80+ or even escape altogether. There must be other environmental factors or other unknown genetic factors. Current research suggests that diet (an environmental factor) may be the major contributor to the rate of silent tissue injury during aging and age of onset of AD. The Western-style diet of industrialized nations is high in bad fats and cholesterol. The demand for fast food, prepared food, `good tasting food', and big food portions has produced an epidemic of diabetes and obesity, and it is a factor for cancer, atherosclerosis, and now AD as well. At no time in history have so many people lived for so long consuming `bad fuel' for their bodies. Our genetic background is not prepared for the combination of these extremes. DIETARY FACTORS: HIGH FAT AND CHOLESTEROL High levels of dietary fat and cholesterol increase AD pathology in transgenic mice models, in primate models and in preliminary studies in humans. More specifically, current evidence supports the specific effect of high cholesterol, saturated fats or trans fatty acids in generating this risk. In human epidemiological studies, consumption of saturated fat or trans fatty acid increases incident risk of AD by about two times after adjusting for all other factors like gender, age, education, and APOE genotype. Likewise, consumption of healthier fats (polyunsaturated fatty acids, omega-6 or omega-3 fatty acids) is associated with decreased risk of AD. For most people, this is equivalent to eating fish every week. Important studies in African-Americans and Nigerians have suggested that populations on traditional, agrarian diets have much reduced risk of AD (Hendrie et.al, 2001). In animal studies, the risk difference related to type and amount of fat absorption appears to be significant. In a randomized controlled experiment of a high fat, high cholesterol (average American) diet in primates, only those animals on saturated fat diet with low HDL (good cholesterol) manifested AD pathology after five years of the diet (equivalent to humans on 20-30 years of diet). Although much work remains, this dietary effect may well be multi-factorial. Dietary factors may involve peripheral and brain metabolism and damage/injury repair to blood vessels. The modulating effect of HDL in primates would support the role of other genetic factors that affect lipid metabolism. Current trials with statins (drugs that lower cholesterol) are pharmaceutical ways of influencing the role of cholesterol and body lipids on AD risk. Important diet parameters may include: type of fat consumed, levels of good (HDL) and bad (LDL) cholesterol. The diet of many Americans is high in bad fats and cholesterol and constitutes a risk for AD that many be independent of APOE genetic risk factors, but related to genetic risk for low HDL levels. Many persons on American diets (60%) qualify for treatment of high cholesterol levels under current guidelines. The Caregiver, Vol. 22: No. 1 - 3-   Dietary Factors in Alzheimer's Disease DIETARY FACTORS: IRON OVERLOAD  Spring 2003  Average American diets have iron supplementation in many prepared foods. Most persons have increasing body iron stores over time with men increasing from birth and most women blunted at low levels until after menopause (due to menstruation and childbirth). These levels approach 300-600 ppm of iron in liver (young persons with iron stores adequate for red cell formation average about 100-200 ppm). The average American diet is supplemented to roughly five to ten times more than the minimal daily requirement of 2 mg per day, primarily through addition of iron to bread, cereals and processed food. In addition, the combination of high fat, high cholesterol diets result in increased iron stores. The common hemochromatosis gene (Hfe), which is usually clinically silent just like apolipoprotein E4, may be a genetic risk factor for AD. The Hfe effect may be to decrease age of onset by five years, a more modest effect than the APOE4 allele, which decreases age of onset by roughly ten years per allele. Like APOE4, the `carrier' state or person with a single risk gene copy out of two possible is common: Hfe gene 10% of population are carriers of C282Y polymorphism; APOE gene, 2030% of population are carriers of APOE4 polymorphism. This Hfe gene is associated with risk of dietary iron overload on common American diets and it is also affected by common hepatitis C infection (1% of population) and alcoholism. Although the Hfe gene is a `Caucasian' gene from Western Europe, many persons presenting with AD have abnormal indices of iron metabolism (roughly 40-50%) consistent with tendency to tissue overload and too much circulating free iron. Reducing iron intake to levels sufficient for red cell formation and/or getting rid of excess body iron by blood donation may be important factors in decreasing risk attributable to iron overload. CDC guidelines call for consideration of therapeutic phlebotomy for persons with serum ferritin levels of greater than 200 ng/ml at younger age ranges or with clinical disease. The diet of many Americans is high in iron and/or fat and this produces high body stores of iron and probably increased risk of AD. DIETARY FACTORS: HOMOCYSTEINE LEVELS An important outcome of the Framingham Heart Study was the identification of increased plasma homocysteine levels as an eventual risk factor for AD. Homocysteine is a normal metabolite of liver and cellular metabolism involved in recycling of sulfur and high-energy compounds used by the body for synthesis. Vitamins such as folic acid (folate), vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin), and vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) are cofactors for some of the enzymes affecting homocysteine metabolism. Low folic acid may contribute to elevations of homocysteine, which can damage blood vessels at higher levels. Folic acid replacement of 400 mcg to 2 mg per day can reverse these elevated levels in most cases (sometimes B6 and B12 supplements are also used). A very common polymorphism in the MTHFR gene (methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase enzyme) may contribute to higher levels of homocysteine. Recent papers have suggested that elevated homocysteine in patients presenting with apparent AD may be associated with white matter injury on MRI and a `vascular' component to dementia even in the absence of clinically recognized stroke-like events. Thus, many cases of AD (up to 30-40%) may be accompanied by significant white matter disease or vascular dementia component. Elevated homocysteine may be one marker for this type of AD and is apparently preventable if identified and treated in the decades prior to AD onset. Trials are underway to understand the utility of treating this abnormality once the clinically evident part of the disease process has commenced. The diet of many Americans results in higher levels of homocysteine. The addition of folic acid (and sometimes B6 and B12) can control this risk for vascular injury and AD [Women in childbearing age are already encouraged to supplement folic acid to reduce risk of birth defects].  The Caregiver, Vol. 22: No. 1 - 4-   Dietary Factors in Alzheimer's Disease  Spring 2003  DIETARY FACTORS: PLASMA THIAMINE, ALCOHOL, GLYCEMIC FOODS Intermediate metabolism may be a significant risk factor for vascular dementia and AD. Plasma thiamine levels and thiamine supply to the brain can be endangered classically by starvation, foods such as shelled rice without vitamin supplements, in diabetic persons with high blood sugars during a phase of insulin adjustment, or alcoholism. Glycemic foods (those foods high in simple carbohydrates) produce quick rises in blood sugar and insulin resistance over time. In addition, a number of persons not in the above categories come to Duke's Memory Disorders Clinic with low thiamine indices. Some of these people have mild gait ataxia, but lack the full symptoms of severe thiamine deficiency like confusion, ataxia, problems with eye movements, or heart failure. Our current practice is to supplement these persons with additional oral thiamine (vitamin b1) above MDA levels of 1.5 mg/day until a normal range of plasma thiamine levels are reached (usually 25-100 mg/day). SUMMARY: THE CHALLENGE OF LIFESTYLE CHANGES A number of dietary factors may affect risk of AD. These factors include dietary fat and cholesterol, particularly the bad fatty acids (saturated fat and trans-fatty acid), dietary iron overload, elevated homocysteine levels, and thiamine deficiency. All of these factors are independent sources of risk with some modulation by genetic factors (e.g., fat intake and HDL levels, dietary iron intake and Hfe gene). These dietary factors represent environmental risk of AD and vascular dementia whose modulation either before or during disease may alter disease risk and course of illness. Even with incompletely altered diet, dietary modification may decrease need for medication (e.g., lower dose of statins needed with dietary changes and exercise). Environmental modification is possible through lifestyle changes, whereas genetic risk factors are not modifiable. I. What is average American bad diet? A. High in calories B. High in simple, refined carbohydrates (sugar, corn syrup, fructose) C. High in saturated fats and trans-fatty acid and low in fish/vegetables D. High in supplemented iron, other food additives and preservatives Issues: Speed, convenience, social or emotional eating, larger portions Downside: Crash diets to recover, production of diabetes, hyperinsulinism, metabolic syndrome or syndrome X, obesity, atherosclerosis and heart disease risk, increased cancer risk, subclinical inflammation, increased risk of AD (saturated or trans-fatty acids) Genetics vs. Environmental: Even persons with potentially low genetic risk may be `pushed' into AD on these diets; statins or similar drugs might counteract such bad diets. are current directions for improving the American diet? Reduction of calories  a variety of diets Increasing portions of fruits and vegetables  complex, non- glycemic carbohydrates Reduction of saturated fats and trans-fatty acids Increase intake of vegetables or fish high in unsaturated fatty acids, particularly omega-3 Reduction of unneeded supplements such as iron (men), food additives, and preservatives Issues: Slower food preparation, harder to eat out in restaurants, spoilage Downside: Many potential diets, difficulties in sticking to a diet, dieting in face of pressure from social customs, friends and family. Genetics vs. Environmental: Current evidence suggests that such diets will decrease incidence of AD and related disorders (e.g., vascular dementia) with relatively modest changes or alterations to diet; might result in decreased need for medications  II. What A. B. C. D. E.  The Caregiver, Vol. 22: No. 1 - 5-   Dietary Factors in Alzheimer's Disease III. What types of diets might radically minimize risk of Alzheimer's disease?  Spring 2003  A. Traditional diets: Okinawa Diet, Mediterranean Diet, basic regional diets using moderation and natural food stocks B. Reduction of saturated fat and trans-fatty acid intake  dramatically less intake of butter, marbled meats, hydrogenated vegetable oils, and pastries may decrease risk of AD. The risk for people with increased intake of these foods is roughly two times those of people on traditional diets. C. Reduction of Homocysteine  leafy vegetables, greens and folic acid supplementation. The risk for increased homocysteine to cause AD is roughly two times more for persons with high homocysteine levels. D. Increased use of fish oil or omega-3 in vegetables (e.g., flax seed) or supplements. The decreased risk for persons eating fish or using omega-3 supplements is roughly two times less than those who don't eat fish or use supplements. E. Caloric restriction; avoidance of simple carbohydrates  avoiding hyperinsulinism, syndrome X or metabolic syndrome, vascular risk Issues: Same as II. on last page. Downside: Same as II. on last page. Genetics vs. Environmental: Relatively uncharted territory, may well markedly decrease incidence of AD and related disorders (e.g., vascular dementia) with significant changes or alterations to diet or reduced need for medications. Only persons at highest genetic risk might still be untouched by such dietary modifications and still need medication or therapy (for example, rare cases of genetic autosomal dominant AD or E4/4 persons with other environmental factors such as head injury). IV: WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOUR HEART IS GOOD FOR YOUR BRAIN Basic Diet: Discuss with your health care provider and your family. Key: Can you stick to the diet over time? Can you afford it? Does it meet your specific health and medication needs? V. What about Supplements?  Multiple vitamin probably recommended as one ages  Folate supplementation 400 mcg or more  Thiamine supplementation (in my opinion, 25 mg or more)  Total reduction of iron intake to no supplements after age 50 unless there is specific need (e.g., iron deficiency anemia) Are       VI.  there special recommendations for those at risk of dementia or stroke? Use of antiplatelet agent such as coated aspirin 81-162 mg/day (check with physician) Fish oil supplement (omega-3) through reputable source or diet high in fatty fish Folate supplement at 1 mg/day or check of homocysteine level Thiamine replacement at 25 mg/day or check of thiamine level Vitamin E supplementation at 400 1200 IU per day (probably `healthy' diet low in saturated fats mitigates this need) References: www.navigator.tufts.edu good source of nutritional information Seshadri S.

The Caregiver, Vol. 22: No. 1 - 8-   Wait a Minute! When Anger Gets too Much  Spring 2003  ""WAIT A MINUTE!"" When Anger Gets too Much Wait a Minute! ""In the last few days even something little sets me off. I find myself yelling all the time. Then of course I end up feeling guilty. Poor Jim. He doesn't deserve this."" You may be exhausted. When you are rested and fit, you feel good about yourself, you're more tolerant of common irritants, more accepting of annoying behaviors, and you tend to see more options for solving problems. Try to get some rest or a break from the caregiving routine. Wait a Minute! ""Last night I actually broke three of my best wine goblets. I just needed to hit or break something. This morning I feel so foolish. I'm also mad at my husband. I know that's unreasonable. Why do I need somebody to blame?"" Sometimes when we feel helpless or at a loss to control a situation, we feel better if we blame someone or something. You have a right to be angry at the situation but remember your husband is not the problem. Blame the disease. Healthy ways to express and work off anger: Go for a walk, bake or cook something that takes time and attention, call a friend, pray, clean a closet or whatever works for you. Wait a Minute! ""More and more I feel empty inside, like I have no feelings, no pleasure in anything. I also have this fear that one day I am going to explode, and all these feelings are going to come from somewhere deep inside. It is frightening because I am afraid that something dreadful will happen."" When we are running on empty, all emotions are dulled. We are just too tired to feel anything. It does not mean that anger, fear, and sadness are not there. Reach out. Get help. You can feel better. If family help is not available, look for paid services in your community. Wait a Minute ! ""There are things he does that set me off. `He's doing this to spite me.' I see them coming and yet, I respond the same way every time."" Wait a minute. Count to ten before you respond. This really works. Maybe he needs reassurance, more structure (or less structure) a job or an activity that he can do without the expectation of perfection or standards that he can no longer attain, and appreciation for things he can still do. He also needs affection though it may be hard to be affectionate when you are mad. What are those things that always make you mad? Can these be changed in any way so they are less upsetting to you? The only option may be to change your attitude about these triggers. Wait a Minute! ""I know that life is not fair but it still makes me so mad! Almost every day, I ask: `Why us?' `Why her?' And then there's that awful answer from out of somewhere, `Why not you?' `Why not her?'"" Alzheimer's robs so much from the person who has it and from those who love and care for him or her. Keeping journals is one small way of responding: Write down all the good things you want to remember--some may be funny, some painful, some totally new information to other members of the family. In a separate journal write about the problems, losses, challenges, the anger and the triumphs of the caregiving journey. This may help maintain your perspective and sense of control. Families report that these journals become treasures later.  The Caregiver, Vol. 22: No. 1 - 9-   Wait a Minute! When Anger Gets too Much  Spring 2003  Wait a Minute! ""I am furious at the nursing home but I am afraid to say anything. If I have to move dad again, I don't know what I'll do. Today was the last straw. I walked in to see him and they had cut off all of his hair. It was as if someone had decided that this was one way not to have to give him another haircut. I wanted to cry. He was always so particular about his hair."" Always speak up when there is a problem or concern about your family member's care. The trick is knowing how. First, wait until you have calmed down, if you are angry. It may help to write down all of the issues to help you focus clearly. Focus only on the current concern, not everything that has been bothering you the whole year. Go to the right person first. If you are upset with the nursing assistant, talk first to him or her. Let her tell her side and LISTEN. You may be unaware of extenuating circumstances. If you are still not satisfied, talk to her supervisor, then the administrator, then the ombudsman-- an ideal advocate for your family member. You may even want to start with the ombudsman if you are afraid of rocking the boat in the nursing home. Wait a Minute ! ""I am so tired of cleaning up behind him and everything else I have to do over and over and over. It's never ending and I'm past the boiling point."" Decide what's worth doing and what you can give up. Delegate what you can and do only what's necessary. Lower your standards. Get rid of everything you don't use or need. Order brings a sense of control but should not be at the cost of drudgery. Wait a Minute! ""I have to do everything myself. My mother has five children--my four brothers don't think Mom has a problem. The only good thing about this disease is that she's not aware of their terrible behavior. Their only concern seems to be whether or not I am spending her money frivolously on her care."" You cannot make your brothers share in your mother's care. You ask and then emotionally let it go when they refuse. You can only learn to make the job as easy for you as possible. For now, get a durable power-of-attorney for health care, and plan for facility care if that becomes necessary. Keep meticulous records of spending for her and show them to your brothers. Try a to-do calendar: taking Mom to the doctor one Tuesday a month, picking her up from the Adult Day Center at 3 p.m. each day. If she lives alone, assign maintenance chores such as cutting grass or picking up groceries. Let each of your brothers choose what he will be responsible for. Wait a Minute! ""I'm trying. Nobody seems to appreciate that. My children and everybody just tell me what I'm doing wrong. Taking care of Amy is a full time job. Sure I've yelled at her a few times. Last night I shook her really hard. I took her to the toilet and when I went back to check on her she had made a mess everywhere except in the toilet. Like lightening I lost it. My kids talk psychology, but not one of them wipes butts. All of us need information or help if we care. It's not always easy even when you know HOW to do a job--to bathe the person, how to get her to eat, to use the toilet ..... The experts tell us that giving care is hard because we not only care for the person ( like helping with bathing or taking to the toilet) but we care about the person (like loving a wife and hurting when we see what's happening to her). We forget that the first and maybe even the most important job is keeping ME, the caregiver, well so that anger doesn't take over as easily when the going gets rough. Wait a Minute! ""You tell me to take care of myself. How do I do that and what good would that do?"" Go to support groups where others in the same boat have good ideas. Take mini vacations even if they are planned, regular ""daydream excursions."" Laugh. Get real breaks by actually getting away for a while. Think of your body as a machine and make a special effort to take care of it. It's not unlike taking care of your car. How far would you get without gas or water in your car? Eat regular meals for the energy you need. Sleep to repair the wear and tear of the day. Exercise regularly--this is a great way to build strength and work off anger. Finally, learn to accept things that you cannot change. Learn how to triumph, even in small ways, despite what you can't change.  The Caregiver, Vol. 22: No. 1 - 10-   Wait a Minute! When Anger Gets too Much  Spring 2003  Wait a Minute! Write the name and number of one or two people you can call on to listen without giving advice or comment. Most people don't know how to just listen. Make a contract, explaining to your friend that you just need someone to listen and understand what you are going through at the moment. One wife called this her ""bitching partner"" a woman she could call anytime when she needed to rant and rave and hang up once she calmed down. _____________________________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________________________ ____________________________________________ __ From the: Duke Family Support Program and the Joseph and Kathleen Bryan Alzheimer's Disease Research Center Box 3600 DUMC Durham, North Carolina 27710 (919) 660-7510 Toll-free in NC ONLY: (800) 672-4213 Editor's Note : "" Wait a Minute!"" is a draft of a 2003 two-sided, laminated refrigerator magnet for overwhelmed family caregivers.

He visited time and time again Sneaking soundlessly into our house and stealing our treasure, Taking a piece of you on each stealthy visit Robbing you of your cognition, emotions, and memories In essence, he stole your core. I felt angry cheated and robbed How dare this thief steal you from me! You were taken from me too soon. You were gone before I was able to acknowledge your wisdom, strengths and gifts. The thief committed his crimes before I was mature enough to appreciate all that you were. I feel guilty. I have lived with that guilt for a long time But I am in a different place now Our family was robbed But not really You were stolen However, you do still exist You exist in your children I see you every day in my brothers, my sisters and in myself. When I lend a hand to a neighbor When I give a difficult person the benefit of the doubt When I actively participate in the political process When I find the strength in myself to get through one more difficult day When I speak up for those who cannot find their voices And When I fight for equal rights for ALL people. That is you, Mom On one hand, you are gone Yet, you still live on You lit the fire in my soul with creativity, compassion, strength and fearlessness And for that I thank you and I will love you forever. Anonymous North Carolina Daughter Submitted by a proud father The Caregiver, Vol. 22: No. 1 - 12-   Facts: About Depression and AD  Spring 2003  Facts:  About depression and Alzheimer's disease  Prepared by the Clinical Issues and Interventions Work Group of the Alzheimer's Association. February 10, 2003.  Experts estimate that clinically significant depression occurs in about 20 to 40 percent of people with Alzheimer's disease. Individuals with Alzheimer's have the same right to adequate diagnosis and treatment of depression as any other person who develops the disorder. Treatment of depression in Alzheimer's disease can improve sense of well-being, quality of life, and individual function, even in the presence of ongoing decline in memory and thinking. There are many potentially effective non-drug and drug therapies available and the benefits of treatment justify the cost. Features of depression in Alzheimer's disease Identifying depression in Alzheimer's disease can be difficult. There is no single test or questionnaire to detect the condition and diagnosis requires careful evaluation of a variety of possible symptoms. Dementia itself can lead to certain symptoms commonly associated with depression, including apathy, loss of interest in activities and hobbies, and social withdrawal and isolation. The cognitive impairment experienced by people with Alzheimer's often makes it difficult for them to articulate their sadness, hopelessness, guilt, and other feelings associated with depression. Although depression in Alzheimer's is often similar in its severity and duration to the disorder in people without dementia, in some cases it may be less severe, not last as long, or not recur as often. Depressive symptoms in Alzheimer's may come and go, in contrast to memory and thinking problems that worsen steadily over time. People with Alzheimer's and depression may be less likely to talk openly about wanting to kill themselves and they are less likely to attempt suicide than depressed individuals without dementia. Men and women with Alzheimer's experience depression with about equal frequency. Diagnosis and proposed diagnostic criteria for ""depression of Alzheimer's disease"" The first step in diagnosis is a thorough professional evaluation. Side effects of medications or an unrecognized medical condition can sometimes produce symptoms of depression. Key elements of the evaluation will include a review of the person's medical history, a physical and mental examination, and interviews with family members who know the person well. Because of the complexities involved in diagnosing depression in someone with Alzheimer's, it may be helpful to consult a geriatric psychiatrist who specializes in recognizing and treating depression in older adults. A group of investigators with extensive experience in studying and treating both late life The Caregiver, Vol. 22: No. 1 - 13-   Facts: About Depression and AD  Spring 2003  depression and dementia, working under the sponsorship of the U. S . National Institute of Mental Health, has proposed diagnostic criteria for a specific disorder called ""depression of Alzheimer's disease."" These criteria are designed to provide a consistent basis for research as well as to aid in identifying people with Alzheimer's who are also depressed. Although the criteria are similar to general diagnostic standards for major depression, they reduce emphasis on verbal expression and include irritability and social isolation. To meet these criteria, someone must have, in addition to an Alzheimer's diagnosis, a change in functioning characterized by three or more of the following symptoms during the same two-week period. The symptoms must include at least one of the first two on the list--depressed mood or decreased pleasure in usual activities.            Significantly depressed mood--sad, hopeless, discouraged, tearful. Decreased positive feelings or reduced pleasure in response to social contacts and usual activities. Social isolation or withdrawal. Disruption in appetite that is not related to another medical condition. Disruption in sleep (a fact sheet about sleep changes in Alzheimer's disease is also available from the Alzheimer's Association). Agitation or slowed behavior (a fact sheet about agitation and Alzheimer's disease is also available from the Association). Irritability. Fatigue or loss of energy. Feelings of worthlessness or hopelessness, or inappropriate or excessive guilt. Recurrent thoughts of death, suicide plans, or a suicide attempt.  Treating depression in Alzheimer's disease The most common treatment for depression in Alzheimer's involves a combination of medicine, support, and gradual reconnection of the person to activities and people he or she finds pleasurable. Simply telling the person with Alzheimer's to ""cheer up,"" "" snap out of it,"" or ""try harder"" is seldom helpful. Depressed people with or without Alzheimer's are rarely able to make themselves better by sheer will or without lots of support, reassurance, and professional help. The following sections suggest non-drug strategies and medications that often prove helpful in treating depression in Alzheimer's. Non-drug approaches       Schedule a predictable daily routine, taking advantage of the person's best time of day to undertake difficult tasks, such as bathing. Make a list of activities, people, or places that the person enjoys now and schedule these things more frequently. Help the person exercise regularly, particularly in the morning. Acknowledge the person's frustration or sadness, while continuing to express hope that he or she will feel better soon. Celebrate small successes and occasions.  The Caregiver, Vol. 22: No. 1 - 14-   Facts: About Depression and AD   Spring 2003      Find ways that the person can contribute to family life and be sure to recognize his or her contributions. At the same time, provide reassurance that the person is loved, respected, and appreciated as part of the family, and not just for what she or he can do now. Nurture the person with offers of favorite foods or soothing or inspirational activities. Reassure the person that he or she will not be abandoned. Consider supportive psychotherapy and/or a support group, especially an early-stage group for people with Alzheimer's who are aware of their diagnosis and prefer to take an active role in seeking help or helping others.  Pharmaceutical approaches Physicians often prescribe antidepressants for treatment of depressive symptoms in Alzheimer's. The most commonly used medications are in a class of drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). These include citalopram (Celexa), sertraline (Zoloft), paroxetine (Paxil) and fluoxetine (Prozac). Physicians may also prescribe antidepressants that inhibit the reuptake of brain chemicals other than serotonin, including venlafaxine (sold as Effexor and Effexor-SR), mirtazapine ( Remeron) and bupropion (Wellbutrin0 ). Antidepressants in a class called the tricyclics, which includes nortnptyline (Pamelor) and desipramine (Norpramine ), are no longer used as first-choice treatments, but are sometimes used when individuals do not benefit from other medications Where can I get more information? The proposed diagnostic criteria for ""depression of Alzheimer's disease"" are described in: Olin, J.T.; Schneider, L.S.; Katz, I.R.; et al.

No matter how much we understand that Alzheimer's steals names and short-circuits the wires that connect head and heart to tongue we still slip into using names and wanting the words, I am gifted with how well my head and heart can connect and build words into bridges that can carry us over the gulfs that separate us from understanding the gifts revealed in a moment, an experience, another, My gift with words opens me even more to the tragedy of Alzheimer's when no matter how well I build my bridge from my side there's no firm ground across the chasm I can reach, my heart can get across, and I have to shut up to words and just be there with Mother, smile to her eyes, kiss her cheek, act to do so that she can be, when we are moved as deep as we can fathom we build what bridges we can without words: cakes and casseroles after a death or during an illness, a hug and a kiss on the cheek after being separated or after a wedding, a tear if we can let ourselves, a laugh when it's just so right, or just so absurd, and sometimes all that we can do is inside with no discernible bridge, no ready clue to others as to where our heart and head are taking us, maybe Alzheimer's can help us all grow larger in how we feel and larger in appreciating how varied the ways to span the gulf between us and all that's out there.

CALL TO ORDER  Dr. Hodes introduced Dr. Myron Weisfeldt and Dr. Rose Dobrof, new members of the National Advisory Council on Aging (NACA). Dr. Weisfeldt is Chairman, Department of Medicine, and Professor at Columbia University, New York and a cardiologist. Dr. Dobrof is a Brookdale Professor of Gerontology, Brookdale Center on Aging, Hunter College, New York.  Dr. Hodes announced that Ms. June McCann, NIA Committee Management Officer and Executive Secretary of the Council, is retiring after 22 years with NIA. He and the entire Council expressed their appreciation and good wishes. Future Meeting Dates September 23-24, 1999 (Thursday-Friday) February 8-9, 2000 (Tuesday-Wednesday) May 25-26, 2000 (Thursday-Friday) September 27-28, 2000 (Wednesday-Thursday) February 6-7, 2001 (Tuesday-Wednesday) May 22-23, 2001 (Tuesday-Wednesday) September 25-26, 2001 (Tuesday-Wednesday) Consideration of Minutes of Last Meeting The minutes of the September 23-24, 1998 meeting were approved as submitted.  3   Director's Status Report Dr. Hodes reviewed NIA's FY99 budget and the FY 2000 budget requested by the President. Specific budget information is appended to these Minutes. He noted the instability of budget increases, so that a year with a higher budget allocation often is followed by a year with a much smaller increase. This instability makes budgetary planning difficult. In FY 1999, the NIA budget for Research Centers increased by 10%, the first increase in many years. Since the projected budget for FY 2000 is for no increase in Research Centers, NIA will make an effort to assure an equivalent funding level will become available for Centers that compete in FY 2000. Although the success rate for grant applications fluctuates, it is more stable from year to year than are budget increments. A substantial increase is allocated to the intramural research program for opening a clinical research unit at the Bayview campus in Baltimore in collaboration with Johns Hopkins University. Overall, Dr. Hodes expressed confidence that the research community is submitting high quality applications that have the potential to make excellent use of budgetary increases. In discussion, Council pointed out that it was anticipated that NIH budget increases would continue for several years. Now, with the FY 2000 budget increase projected to be approximately 2%, the research community is faced with little prospect of support for the increased number of applications that it was encouraged to submit. It was also observed that even with a likely budget increase of 17% over 2 years, the research community has generated so many applications or applications that are so costly that the success rate has not changed. In discussion of whether NIA and NIH are able to manage a major single year budget increase appropriately, the sense of Council was that there are sufficient meritorious applications awaiting funding and that there is an opportunity to respond to equipment and other infrastructure needs. II. APPLICABILITY OF THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT TO GRANT RECIPIENTS  Ms. Diana Jaeger, Acting Director, Office of Policy for Extramural Research Administration (OPERA) briefed the Council on implications of an extension of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to grantees' research data. The 1999 Omnibus Appropriations bill included a provision that directed the Office of Management and Budget to amend OMB Circular A-110 (Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Other Agreements with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals and Other Non-Profit Organizations) to extend the FOIA to require that Federal awarding agencies assure that all data produced under an award will be made available to the public. Further, if the agency obtaining the data does so at the request of a private party, a reasonable user fee may be charged. Ms. Jaeger noted that NIH supports the sharing of research data but feels it is essential that concepts be clarified to assure data integrity, confidentiality for research participants, the intellectual and the financial investments of the researchers, and the continuation of research.  4   Ms. Jaeger told Council that an NIH Working Group is developing a response to the proposed legislation, and that when a Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) is issued, NIH will comment through DHHS and to OMB directly. She emphasized that NIH perceives this amendment as a major science policy issue. Therefore, NIH is informing the research community of the change and is encouraging organizations and individuals to keep informed and to comment to OMB. In discussion, Council members could foresee many implications of the legislative change. For example, the Health Care Financing Administration and other organizations might be reluctant to share data with researchers. If those doing secondary analyses of existing data sets were required to pay fees, where would the funds come from? Other members wondered about whether biological materials constitute data, and the value of data as intellectual property. Drs. Hazzard and Blau agreed to draft a statement for Council to forward to OMB and to the Deputy Director for Extramural Research, NIH. III. INTRAMURAL PROGRAM REVIEW  Dr. Dan Longo, Scientific Director, reminded Council that the Intramural Research Program is reviewed by the Board of Scientific Counselors. Each review encompasses two laboratories, so that each program is reviewed about every four years. Individual NACA members serve as ad hoc reviewers for the Board. He reported that the program overall was reviewed favorably by a Blue Ribbon Panel appointed by the Director, NIH, and that the report of that review was sent to Council members. Two laboratories reported to Council, the Laboratory of Molecular Genetics and the Laboratory of Personality and Cognition. The Laboratory of Molecular Genetics (LMG) is investigating the molecular basis for aging and age-dependent diseases. Studies are focused on DNA-related mechanisms such as DNA repair, replication and transcription, and genomic instability. The increased occurrence of DNA damage that has been observed with increasing age in many biological systems may be due to changes in DNA repair. LMG has a special interest in the fine structure of DNA repair which includes the study of the DNA repair processes in individual genes. Dr. Vilhelm Bohr, the Chief of LMG, noted that premature aging syndromes such as Werner's and Cockayne's are excellent biological model systems for the molecular study of aging. Researchers in the laboratory have found defects in DNA repair and in basal transcription in cells from patients with Cockayne syndrome. They have purified the Werner protein and biochemically characterized its activity, which involves the unwinding of DNA (helicase). Dr. Bohr also discussed work on DNA damage in Alzheimer's disease; on the role of the P21 protein; on possible changes in ribosomal DNA in humans; and on the process of somatic hypermutation. He described clinical longitudinal research in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging exploring whether the genome becomes less stable with increasing age. Finally, he indicated that Dr. Seidman has joined the lab and has started a program studying triplex oligonucleotide structures. These can be used to target specific genes in DNA and to provide  5   a mechanism for targeted knockout of particular genes that are implicated in aging, thus allowing their role in the aging process to be addressed. The Laboratory of Personality and Cognition conducts basic and clinical research on individual differences in cognitive and personality processes and traits. The laboratory investigates the influence of age on these variables and their reciprocal influence on health, well-being, and adaptation. It employs longitudinal, experimental, and epidemiological methods in the analysis of psychological and psychosocial issues of aging, including health and illness, predictors of intellectual competence and decline, models of adult personality, and correlates of disease risk factors. Dr. Paul Costa, Chief of the Laboratory of Personality and Cognition, reported that the Personality, Stress and Coping Section has conducted systematic basic research in personality guided by the Five Factor Model (FFM) which asserts that personality traits can be understood as aspects of 5 factors: Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness to Experience, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness. He reported that the model is now the prevailing conception of personality in psychological research. He described work using the model that indicates that some changes in personality may be early indicators of Alzheimer's disease. He also described a large cross-cultural study showing consistency of factor structure in the model across cultures. However, the study did show some consistent changes in personality in adulthood in some cultures other than the U.S. In the cognition section, performance of Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging (BLSA) participants on the Benton Visual Retention Test has led to the test's identification as a potential early marker for Alzheimer's disease. That finding is being followed up using neuroimaging techniques. Finally, he described ongoing work investigating whether estrogen provides a protective effect on memory. IV. NIH DIRECTOR'S AFTERNOON LECTURE  James P. Smith, Ph.D., Senior Economist at RAND and an NIA MERIT Awardee, delivered a lecture on the results from the pilot study for the New Immigrant Survey (NIS-P) on February 3, 1999 as part of the NIH Director's Wednesday Afternoon Lecture series. The NIS-P is the first step in a plan to carry out a comprehensive, multi-cohort longitudinal survey of new legal immigrants to the U.S. and their children. Dr. Smith, the Principal Investigator of this project which is funded by three Federal agencies including NIH, presented the goal of the study: to advance understanding of the socioeconomic status of immigrants from a wide range of countries and their effects on the U.S., including on public health and on a number of health conditions of interest to the NIH. The longitudinal data collected will permit tracking the mobility and adaptation of the immigrants and their children to the U.S. Dr. Smith presented some results from the NIS-P on the health, schooling, language skills, and earnings of legal immigrants, and discussed challenges in conducting a survey of this kind.  6   V.  REVIEW OF APPLICATIONS  This portion of the meeting was closed to the public in accordance with the determination that it was concerned with matters exempt from mandatory disclosure under Sections 552b(c)(4) and 552b(c)(6), Title 5, U.S. Code and Section 10(d) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. Appendix).2 A total of 793 applications requesting $646,138,782 for all years was reviewed. Council recommended 586 for a total of $489,797,485 for all years. The actual funding of the awards recommended is determined by the availability of funds, percentile ranks, priority scores, and program relevance. VI. TASK FORCE ON TRAINING  Dr. Blau introduced the recommendations of the Task Force on Training by describing the reasons for the formation of the Task Force and its membership. She presented the recommendations for approval by Council. After discussion of the appropriate benchmark with which to compare National Research Service Award (NRSA) stipends; of the best means to support junior scientists who are beyond the immediate postdoctoral years; of salary restrictions on career awards; and of the relative merits of training on training grants and training on research grants, Council approved the following recommendations: 1. The Task Force (NACA) recognizes that the recent substantial increase in NRSA stipends for predoctoral and postdoctoral students has significantly addressed the need for adequate stipends for research trainees. At the same time, the Task Force (NACA) recommends continuing diligence in ensuring that stipends remain adequate in future years. At the postdoctoral level, parity with NIH intramural stipends is recommended as an appropriate standard. 2. The NIA should broaden the definition of appropriate training for aging research to include training in the late-life diseases and conditions that affect older people, and biological, psychosocial, neuroscientific, and behavioral perspectives on these diseases. 3. The NIA should issue program announcement(s) clarifying the issue of what is appropriate training in aging research, and seeking applications for training in focused areas that recognize the important interdependence of aging research and basic research in biological, clinical, neuroscientific, and psychosocial fields. 4. The NIA should issue guidelines to review committees that encompass an expanded definition of aging research in the context of review of training applications. Where necessary, membership should be expanded to provide appropriate review. 2  For the record, it is noted that members absented themselves from the meeting when the Council discussed applications (a) from their respective institutions or (b) in which a conflict of interest may have occurred. This procedure only applied to applications that were discussed individually, not to ""en bloc"" actions.  7   5. NIA is urged to develop additional materials (such as a web page) highlighting key information that will make Training Directors aware of existing flexibility in the NIA and NIH administration of these programs. 6. NIA should adapt and expand the existing mentored career award mechanism (K01) to allow a track for research scientists and staff scientists as well as faculty. 7. The Task Force (NACA) strongly supports the current broad availability of opportunities for research experience available to predoctoral and postdoctoral students on NIA and NIH research grants. VII. GERIATRICS PROGRAM REVIEW  Dr. Hazzard reported on the review of the Geriatrics Program. He complimented the staff, particularly for the degree to which they have formed collaborations both within the extramural programs at NIA and across the NIH. Geriatrics is a broad and multidisciplinary subject area and without these collaborations, he noted, the program would risk becoming superficial, isolated, or redundant. He then reported on the four sections of the program that had been reviewed. Cancer. Reviewers recommended that the program develop a formal arrangement with NCI in which NCI commits resources to the study of cancer and aging. Also panel members suggested that NIA resume collaboration with the Veterans' Administration to focus on tumors that have a high incidence in older men. Regarding initiative development, reviewers recommended both a broad announcement focused on treatment in the elderly across a wide variety of tumor types, and more focused announcements on use of adjuvant therapies; on the biology associated with cancer in the elderly (with the Biology of Aging Program), and on the uses of radiation therapy. Reviewers also recommended additional funding for the program area. Osteoporosis. Reviewers commented on the breadth of the portfolio in osteoporosis and endocrinology. They said that the portfolio is too broad for a single individual to lead and urged that the osteoporosis and endocrinology portfolios each be assigned a program administrator. They identified research challenges in the field, including better definition of the roles of calcium, Vitamin D, and estrogen, and of the mechanisms of accelerated bone loss in old age. They identified needs for further study of the role of nutrition in osteoporosis; of the nature of gender differences in bone biology, pathogenesis, and treatment of osteoporosis; of improved methods of diagnosis and screening; and of new methods to measure the expression of local factors that regulate bone turnover and strength. They recommended small-scale studies and analyses of existing data sets to address these opportunities. They also suggested a cost-benefit analysis of interventions in elderly post-fracture patients. They recommended that a small advisory group be formed to provide multidisciplinary input on future directions including basic science developments that are ready for clinical investigation, and urged that the links between basic biology and the geriatric osteoporosis program be strengthened. They suggested expanding the workshop on Selective Estrogen 8   Receptor Modulators (SERMs) to include SARMs (androgen) and the use of these drugs in both sexes. Musculoskeletal. Given the prevalence of frailty and weakness as contributors to health care needs in the elderly, the program area's focus on sarcopenia is well-founded. However, reviewers suggested a more focused portfolio of research than was offered at the program review meeting. Among areas needing development, reviewers identified exploration of the basic mechanisms, including neural changes, that generate sarcopenia; development of anabolic agents that counteract sarcopenia and minimize harmful effects of testosterone; and analysis of the integrative mechanisms that give rise to the substantial gains achieved by short term training programs on strength and performance. It was pointed out that the Geriatric Program's focus should be chosen in relation to, and in collaboration with, the efforts of the Neuroscience and Biology of Aging programs at NIA and related programs at NIAMS. Reviewers praised the concept and operation of the musculoskeletal working group. They praised the recent workshop on muscle blood flow and saw opportunities for further research in the area, perhaps in collaboration with NHLBI. Reviewers supported the NIA publication: Handbook on Exercise Advice for the Elderly (produced by the NIA Public Information Office with the technical assistance of GP staff). Pepper Centers. The Pepper Center (Older American Independence Centers) program was acknowledged to have created a national focus on Geriatric Medicine and to have contributed substantively to the growth of the field through the success of the Centers' emphasis on career development of promising clinical investigators. Their clinical trial portfolio has focused on important issues related to independence in the elderly, helped by the core resources which have guided research along thematic lines. Reviewers urged that consideration be given to the future development of new directions, with investigators encouraged to propose novel cores, resources and research. Further, reviewers urged that the centers be broadened from their predominantly clinical base to include basic as well as behavioral and social science. The flat budget was considered detrimental to the Program. Reviewers recommended a rate of growth of about one center every three years. Dr. Hazzard concluded his review by noting that the reviewers consider that the program on geriatrics has provided the Institute with an excellent return on investment and should be continued with modest growth and no major change in strategy. In discussion, Council members raised several topics including pharmacokinetics, excessive disability, obesity, the role of poverty, and the provision of home care. Dr. Hazzard indicated that the wealth of possible topics underlines the need for the program to focus its agenda. VIII. NACA TASK FORCE ON MINORITY AGING RESEARCH Dr. Jackson reported that the NACA Task Force on Minority Aging Research had discussed three topics: Monitoring the inclusion of women and minorities in clinical research; the Resource Centers for Minority Aging Research; and the forthcoming review of minority aging research planned for the Council meeting in September 1999. NIA staff provided updates on NIA outreach activities. 9   Monitoring the inclusion of women and minorities in clinical research. Council members were provided figures showing by ethnicity and gender the numbers of participants in clinical research supported by NIA. Dr. Jackson reported concerns with the data that limit its usefulness. For example, the system tracks cumulative data from the point of recruitment although there is no indication whether subjects who were initially recruited completed the study; the data are skewed by very large population based studies; and data entry as well as decisions about which studies to include are made by many different people, probably resulting in inconsistent data. Discussion focused on what response is appropriate. One proposal was to share the concerns with the NIH Office of Research on Women's Health (ORWH) who designed the system for entering and monitoring the data. Dr. Jackson proposed working with a small group of NIA staff who would coordinate with ORWH to suggest specific improvements to the system. Resource Centers for Minority Aging Research (RCMARs). In a progress report on these Centers, Dr. Jackson described their goals as fostering the development of minority investigators trained in aging research; fostering the growth of research on minority aging; and increasing the participation of minority individuals as participants in clinical research on aging. He described early success in supporting a substantially larger than expected number of promising minority researchers in their early careers; in a large number of publications, including several in leading journals, on minority aging topics; in collaboration with the Pepper Centers that may help to increase participation in clinical research; and in planning conferences on measurement issues relevant to working with ethnically diverse groups. He also mentioned a related initiative on networks to increase the cultural diversity of the research workforce on aging. The funded grants are collaborating closely with the RCMARs to identify promising students and faculty from a broad array of colleges and universities. The efforts of both Dr. Harden and Dr. Stahl in fostering these initiatives were acknowledged. Planned review of minority aging research. Dr. Jackson reported on the results of a conference call with the group charged to review the minority aging research portfolio at NIA. The review will be conducted at the September Council meeting. Reviewers expressed an interest in gathering data on initiatives conducted prior to 1993  the proposed starting date for data collection. However, planning has focused primarily on the intellectual basis for the upcoming review. Reviewers shared the perception that the review seeks to enhance NIA's efforts in going beyond describing differences by ethnic groups to probing what it is about minority status that is scientifically important. Nevertheless, reviewers differed sharply on the extent to which they considered ethnic and minority status to be explanatory concepts, intermediate variables, or marker variables that reflect underlying differences in socioeconomic status and similar variables. Dr. Jackson identified a need to develop a working paper on this subject prior to the review. He noted that NIA and NACA are addressing what is likely to be an important issue across NIH. NIA outreach activities. Dr. Harden described a recent Technical Assistance Workshop held in conjunction with the 1998 meeting of the Gerontological Society of America and cosponsored by the NIH Office of Research on Minority Health. She also described the forthcoming Summer Institute on Aging Research, cosponsored by the Brookdale Foundation, and to be 10   held in July 1999, and a regional meeting to be held at the University of Arizona in Tucson. In planning the latter meeting, NIA worked with Dr. Carol Barnes at the University of Arizona, a former Council member, to increase outreach to local Native American communities. IX. WORKING GROUP ON PROGRAM  Dr. Gage reported on the meeting of the Working Group on Program. Eight topics were discussed. The first issue addressed was the purpose of Council review of programs, how the review is used, and whether the review should be of past performance or focus on prospective change. The nature and amount of information that is needed by Council reviewers in advance of the review was addressed, as was the need for commonality across different program reviews, and whether reviewers should make recommendations to the Institute. In discussion it was pointed out that Council reviews of programs have moved from being presentations to becoming more interactive and evaluative, in which reviewers assess entire programs or selected areas and make recommendations to the Institute. Recommendations that emerge in conjunction with one review become incorporated into the review process. For example, all programs have been asked to include reviewers who are independent of the program and/or Institute, to include at least one representative of another program so that interaction within the NIA can be addressed, and to apply a panel of objective outcome measures along with more subjective ones. Discussion followed about composition of review groups, timing of reviews, and nature and depth of discussion that the review format afforded. The sizable cost to staff of collecting data for program reviews was noted. It was pointed out that changes in the programs over time reflect both responsiveness to reviews and changes in science. Council was asked to consider whether a common guideline for program reviews would be useful or whether Council members should develop its own preferred format for each program review. The sense of Council was that indices would be helpful, particularly since Council membership changes. Since a round of program reviews will be completed at the May Council meeting, it would be useful to consider assessment criteria at the September meeting. One suggestion was that NIA consider that each program's subsequent review might address their response to the previous review's recommendations. It was recognized that when Council review of program takes place in conjunction with the Council meeting and related activities, there is time pressure that limits the extent of time to consider and prepare a thoughtful report. An effort will be made to schedule the next program review well in advance of the Council meeting so that the report on the review can be further developed. Other members pointed out that such scheduling would increase the number of meetings they would attend, and that the benefits of the increased time commitment would need to be balanced against the benefits of the separate program review and Council discussion. Dr. Hodes emphasized that how Council conducts review of programs has been an evolving process during the past 5 years, and that Institute staff would continue to work to make both the process and product informative.  11   Dr. Gage reported that the Working Group addressed issues to be brought up in the Geriatrics Program review and in the planned review of NIA's minority programs. Both items were discussed earlier in the Council meeting. Council review of special actions was discussed. This discussion ensued from the previous meeting when applications submitted on behalf of Council members were the subject of Special Actions. Concern was expressed by some members about real or apparent conflict-of-interest. Staff were asked to examine options about how other Councils handle similar circumstances. After considering several options, the Working Group recommended a change to the Statement of Understanding that is described below. Dr. Gage reported that the Working Group was informed that each Institute is required to prepare and submit a strategic plan by December 1999. The Working Group considered how best to get public input to/comment on the plan. Suggestions included public hearings in conjunction with scientific meetings, posting a draft on a website, holding special meetings at NIH, and contacting defined groups with a known commitment to aging and requesting feedback. The WGoP believed that it would be most fruitful to present a draft and solicit comment. Council members suggested that e-mail notification of interested persons, including grantees, might elicit useful comments. The Working Group discussed the fact that comment from the scientific community on science policy issues that impact on investigators often is solicited, but generally response is meagre. There have been a number of such issues lately, including support for training of investigators, proposed amendments to OMB Circular A-110 already referred to, and draft reports issued by the National Bioethics Advisory Commission. Institute staff disseminate information to Council members and ask that they enlist the expertise and assistance of their colleagues and of the societies to which they belong. Council members acknowledged the importance of participation in such matters and were encouraged to respond to such invitations as individuals. Dr. Gage summarized the WGoP's discussion about whether NIA should reconsider its decision not to participate financially in support of the Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR). CIDR is an infrastructure resource for high throughput genotyping that was developed to serve organizations that do not themselves have such capability. The basis for a prior recommendation of Council that NIA not participate was doubt of the need for such a facility for aging research. During discussion, Council members raised questions about the cost-benefit ratio of participating and about whether such analyses would be more cost effective to NIA grantees if NIA participated, particularly since experience has shown that Alzheimer's disease analyses are the ones most frequently conducted. Council believed additional information about relative cost would be helpful in making a recommendation. Also discussed was the extent to which CIDR is able to provide the scope of services anticipated. Council requested that Dr. Nussbaum, the NIH representative to CIDR, be invited to the May 1999 meeting of Council to make a presentation and answer questions to help guide an NIA decision. In the meantime, the CIDR Board of Governors has been asked to estimate the financial investment requested of NIA should the Institute decide to enter an  12   agreement. Dr. Hodes asked that members of Council submit questions and issues for Dr. Nussbaum to address. The WGoP approved and recommended that Council adopt the proposed amendments to the Statement of Understanding: 1. ""NIA staff may expedite award of applications within the 20th percentile that request up to $250,000 direct costs per year, provided that they raise no policy or scientific concerns. The second level of review will be either electronically or by fax before the council meets."" 2. ""If an application involving a Council member as principal investigator is identified for an individual action, in order to avoid the appearance of conflict of interest, a group which may include former members of NACA will be appointed by the Director to provide advice or act on the application, as appropriate."" Both changes were approved. New Business: Council members voted to reopen discussion of FOIA and OMB Circular A110 to act on a comment to be forwarded to OMB. After discussion, the following statement was unanimously approved. The National Advisory Council on Aging expresses concern over the potential implications of the extension of the Freedom of Information Act under the 1999 Omnibus Appropriations bill in its direction to OMB to amend Circular A-110 as related to its agreement with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals and Other Non-Profit Organizations. As currently drafted and undergoing review and comment from the public, the proposed revision may negatively impact the conduct of research by such institutions for a broad array of reasons. These range from concerns over privacy of individuals who voluntarily participate in clinical and other research studies, to inappropriate access to and potential misuse of all details of research at every stage of its conception, execution, and timely dissemination of results, all of which may diminish the productivity and, perversely, even serve to discourage the spirit of openness in communication and collaboration that has been a hallmark of the remarkable American biomedical and social science research enterprise. Council accepted the draft and asked that it be forwarded in their behalf. X. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS  Dr. Hadley, Associate Director of the Geriatrics Program, described recent advances in the assessment of bone structure. He indicated that the risk of fracture associated with osteoporosis is a function of both bone density and bone quality. Recent improvements in high resolution imaging combined with techniques of fractal geometry now allow bone quality to be assessed noninvasively. Much bone consists of trabeculae with space between them. A characteristic of osteoporosis is that these trabeculae become fragmented. Fractal analysis divides an area into a series of grids and counts how often a segment from one grid extends into another grid. Applied to images of bone, it is a measure of how fragmented the trabeculae are  a measure of bone quality.  13   Dr. Hadley described the work of an NIA grantee, Dr. S. Majumdar, who has applied these techniques in a case-control study of patients with hip-fractures and matched controls. Majumdar (Link et al., J Bone Miner.Res. 1998;13:1175-1182) found that the structural deficits assessed by fractal analysis of high resolution images were more highly correlated with fractures than were bone density measures. Though the study is small scale and needs to be confirmed, it offers promise of identifying individuals who are at high risk for fracture and the possibility of providing an intermediate end point (as opposed to fracture) for assessment of treatments for osteoporosis. Dr. Bellino, Acting Associate Director of the Biology of Aging Program, introduced Dr. Lee Sweeney from the University of Pennsylvania who described work conducted in collaboration with Dr. Nadia Rosenthal on loss of muscle mass and strength with increasing age (BartonDavis et al. 1998, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 95, 15603-15607). Dr. Sweeney noted that in all mammals, including humans, muscle loses mass and strength, slows down, and loses its most powerful fiber types with increasing age. His research team believes that the problem is a decline in the ability of muscle to repair itself. Muscle is continuously injured during use. It maintains satellite cells within the basal lamina of muscle fibers. Upon injury, muscle signals the proliferation of these satellite cells by releasing a variety of growth factors. The cells proliferate and repair the muscle. Dr. Sweeney further specified the source of the age-related loss as a deficit in muscle's ability to signal the satellite cells to proliferate. Using mice, Dr. Sweeney's group tested this hypothesis by using an adeno-associated virus to insert a synthetic gene into skeletal muscle. The gene allows only skeletal muscle to produce insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), one of the growth factors secreted by muscle during repair processes. The approach also allowed the group to limit the intervention to skeletal muscle in one rear leg of mice. The other leg was used as a control. If the investigators are correct, inserting the gene should stop the muscle loss associated with increasing age. When aging mice who had had the gene inserted into skeletal muscle were examined at a very old age, the injected muscle showed mass, force, and fast muscle fibers similar to a young mouse. The non-injected leg showed characteristic age-associated losses. Before considering an intervention in humans, the research team is attempting to reproduce the result in larger animals. However, the result does offer promise of an intervention to combat loss of muscle function in the elderly. Questions concerned whether there are similar effects in young animals (there are smaller effects); clarification that the effects did not change distribution of fiber types but prevented loss of fibers; whether very old animals with apparent muscle loss have been treated (a small number, only partial recovery); whether there were changes in systemic levels of IGF-1 (no); whether there were consequent changes in vascularity in the injected animals (not scored in that way); and whether endurance tests had been given to explore the vascularity hypothesis (only in vitro testing). Dr. Morrison-Bogorad, Associate Director of the Neuroscience and Neuropsychology of Aging Program, introduced Dr. Selkoe, a Council member, who spoke of new work related to the amyloid-beta (A) peptide (Wolfe et al. 1999, Nature, 398, 513-517). Dr. Selkoe 14   described the characteristic plaques and tangles in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease and indicated that the plaques are composed of aggregates of 40-42 residue A peptides. Dr. Selkoe indicated that these peptides are cut out from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) following the stepwise action of a series of protease enzymes and result in a small fragment of APP, the A peptide, being released. As the accumulation of the A peptide is believed to be important in the cascade of events leading to Alzheimer's disease, much work has been conducted to characterize the events leading to its release. Work to date indicates that the release is the result of a two-step process. First, a protease enzyme, known operationally as beta-secretase, cleaves APP leaving a 99 amino acid fragment that is still embedded in the membrane. Second, another enzyme, the so-called gamma-secretase, cleaves within this transmembrane segment of APP and releases the A peptide fragment. Neither of these enzymes has been identified. Dr. Selkoe then described the Presenilin-1 and 2 genes. Mutations in these genes are the most common autosomal dominant cause of early onset Alzheimer's. Although rare, the autosomal dominant form of early onset Alzheimer's is instructive regarding possible mechanisms in the much more prevalent late onset form. The presenilin genes have been wellstudied but to date their precise functions are not known. Normally the presenilin protein, a transmembrane protein, is cleaved into two fragments. In examining the amino acid chain of this protein as it winds its way through the membrane, Dr. Selkoe's group identified two aspartic acid residues in the middle of two transmembrane domains. Several lines of evidence suggested that these aspartates might be crucial for the cleavage of the presenilin protein as well as for the gamma secretase cutting of APP which releases the A peptide. To test that hypothesis, his team mutated the aspartates to alanine residues making them nonreactive. His team found that mutating either aspartate was sufficient to stop the presenilin from being cut. More importantly, the same mutation resulted in a dramatic decrease in the production of the A peptide. The group established a quantitative relationship such that as the amount of the nonreactive mutant presenilin increased, the amount of A declined. Given the hypothesized role of A in Alzheimer's disease, the result, if confirmed, is highly encouraging for identifying new ways to decrease A production. Dr. Selkoe concluded by describing his group's model of the mechanism. They believe that the two aspartates within the membrane portion of the presenilin constitute the active site of the gamma-secretase enzyme involved in the final stage of production of the A peptide. He believes that the presenilin 1 protein is the elusive gamma-secretase, or at least is essential for its function. They are now examining predictions of the model that would support their conclusions. Questions concerned what would be the strongest experimental confirmation of the model; whether naturally occurring mutations can be identified that are protective against production of  by gamma secretase; and the role of inflammation in the cascade towards Alzheimer's disease. Dr. Selkoe indicated that being able to take purified presenilin and purified APP and put them together in an environment where they can fold into the membrane should result in A production and would be the strongest test of the model. He indicated that mutations 15   protecting against production of gamma secretase might be found in populations that never develop Alzheimer's disease. He also indicated that inflammation is widely believed to result from the formation of plaques, a downstream event from the production of the A peptide. Dr. Richard Suzman, Associate Director of the Behavioral and Social Research Program, introduced Dr. David Wise, a Council member, who described cross-national research on the association between the structure of social security plans and the retirement age (Gruber and Wise, 1998; American Economic Review, 88(2), 158-163). Dr. Wise pointed out that older adults are now participating in far fewer numbers than previously in the workforce both in the U.S. and internationally. This change has occurred despite improvements in health, gains in longevity, and declines in disability. He pointed out that many national plans are structured so that the gains of income (wage earnings) in continuing to work after a certain age are offset by losses to retirement benefits. His research team calculated the replacement rate for Social Security Benefits at ages over 60 in different countries. The replacement rate is defined as the size of the retirement benefit in proportion to earnings in the last year. The replacement rate is 80 to 90 percent of wage earnings in many countries. They also calculated the change in Social Security Benefits as a proportion of wage earnings as a result of an additional year's work. They found that, in many countries, the change is negative after age 60. Social Security benefits are reduced as a result of working an extra year. Plotting the size of this ""tax"" on benefits as a function of the proportion of men aged 55 to 65 who are not working in different nations' labor forces, the group found a strong linear relationship between the probability of not working at these ages and the size of the tax on retirement benefits generated by an additional year of work. Council members, while noting the strong association and likely causality of the relationship, questioned how it is possible to determine causality when randomized trials cannot be run. Dr. Wise discussed several approaches to addressing the question. These include detailed analysis of particular patterns of retirement behavior before and after changes in retirement incentives were introduced, and a historical analysis of the reasons why the changes were introduced. Dr. Hodes thanked the presenters and called for any items of new business prior to adjournment. Dr. Harper, speaking for Council members, indicated their strong appreciation for Ms. McCann's services to Council. Dr. Hodes echoed that sentiment.  16   XI.

Con. Res. 17, H.R. 2747, and H.R. 4011                          Background     In November 1998, two different groups of scientists reported the successful isolation and culturing of human pluripotent stem cells. Such cells have the ability to develop into most of the specialized cells or tissues in the human body and can divide for indefinite periods in culture. Because these cells can give rise to many different types of cells, such as muscle cells, nerve cells, heart cells, blood cells, and others, they are enormously important to science and hold great promise for advances in health care. The regenerative capacity of pluripotent stem cells means a single culture of human pluripotent stem cells could potentially supply numerous researchers.     The establishment of human pluripotent stem cell lines represents a major step forward in human biology. This advance has generated interest among scientists, the public, and patients and their advocates, especially with regard to the ethical issues related to this research.    A provision included in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Appropriation Act currently prohibits DHHS from funding research in which human embryos are created for research purposes or are destroyed, discarded, or subjected to greater than minimal risk. Accordingly, the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) is permitted to fund research using human pluripotent stem cells derived from human embryos but is prohibited from funding the derivation of such stem cells.     The Clinton Administration published guidelines governing the use of human pluripotent stem cells in the Federal Register on August 23, 2000. On April 25, 2001, a scheduled review of pending grant applications was postponed to provide President Bush and his new Administration an opportunity to review the issue. On August 9, 2001, President Bush issued a long-awaited decision on stem cell research. He authorized funding of stem cell research using existing pluripotent stem cell lines that were derived from human embryos before August 9. Such research is eligible for Federal funding if the following criteria are met: 1) there must have been informed consent of the donors, 2) the embryos must have been created for reproductive purposes and in excess of clinical need, 3) there must not have been any financial inducements to the donors, and 4) the embryos must not have been created for research purposes. On November 7, 2001,  NIH  published a stem cell registry listing all of the eligible stem cell lines.  NIH  is now poised to begin funding this research. It is expected that  NIH  will award funds for this purpose during fiscal year (FY) 2002.    During the 106th Congress, the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services (HHS), Education, and Related Agencies (Senator Arlen Specter [R-PA], Chairman) held seven hearings to discuss various issues related to human pluripotent stem cell research. The issue has continued to receive interest in the 107th Congress.     The Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, HHS, Education (Senator Tom Harkin [D-IA], Chairman) has held three hearings on the issue since the 107th Congress convened—July 18, August 1, and October 31, 2001. The July 18 hearing focused on the release of a comprehensive report prepared by  NIH  that described the current state of the science on stem cells derived from human embryos, fetal tissue, and adult tissue. In addition, several Senators holding pro-life views testified in support of stem cell research. The August 1 hearing focused on intellectual property issues as well as ethical issues. The October 31 hearing focused on testimony from the various derivers of the existing stem cell lines. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (Senator Edward M. Kennedy [D-MA], Chairman) held its first hearing on this topic on September 5, 2001. The hearing focused on the quality and viability of the existing stem cell lines. The Secretary of HHS, Tommy G. Thompson, testified.    The House has not been particularly active on this issue as a body. The House Government Reform Subcommittee on Criminal Justice, Drug Policy and Human Resources held a hearing on July 17. That hearing focused on testimony from individuals who adopted frozen embryos from in vitro fertilization clinics.    Although several bills have been introduced, none has had any legislative action. Given comments by the Senate majority leader during debate on the Labor, HHS, Education, and Related Agencies appropriation bill, it is possible that Senator Specter's bill will be the subject of debate when the Senate considers this issue again in the spring.    S. 723 and H.R. 2059, the Stem Cell Research Act of 2001, were introduced by Senators Specter/Harkin and Representative Jim McDermott (D-WA), respectively, to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for human embryonic stem cell generation and research.    H.R. 2096 and S. 1349, the Responsible Stem Cell Research Act of 2001, were introduced to require the Secretary of HHS to maintain a stem cell donor bank containing stem cells derived from adult tissue, placentas, and umbilical cord blood. S. 1349 was introduced by Senator John Ensign (R-NV), and H.R. 2096 was introduced by Representative Christopher H. Smith (R-NJ).    H. Con. Res. 17 was introduced by Representative Carolyn B. Maloney (D-NY) to express the Sense of Congress regarding pluripotent stem cell research.    H.R. 2747 was introduced by Representative Diana DeGette (D-CO) to codify the Clinton Administration's guidelines governing research using human pluripotent stem cells.    H.R. 4011 was introduced by Representative Maloney to establish a Stem Cell Research Board within the legislative branch to conduct research on the effects of the President's August 9, 2001, stem cell policy.     Provisions of the Legislation/Impact on  NIH    S. 723/H.R. 2059—Stem Cell Research Act of 2001    In general, these bills would permit DHHS to fund both the derivation and use of human pluripotent stem cells. Section 2 of the bills would add a new section (489C) to the Public Health Service Act, which would stipulate the following:    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, ""the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) may only conduct, support, or fund research on, or utilizing, human embryos for the purpose of generating embryonic stem cells and utilizing stem cells that have been derived from embryos in accordance with this section"" (Section 489C).    The only embryos that may be used for such activities are ""those embryos that otherwise would be discarded that have been donated from in-vitro fertilization clinics with the written informed consent of the progenitors.""    The research involved shall not result in the creation of human embryos.    The research involved shall not result in the reproductive cloning of a human being.    Any person receiving Federal funds would be prohibited from knowingly acquiring or transferring embryos for ""valuable consideration."" Valuable consideration would not include reasonable payments associated with transportation, transplantation, processing, preservation, quality control, or storage.    The Secretary of HHS would be required to develop guidelines that would ""expand on the rules governing human embryonic stem cell research to include rules that govern the derivation of stem cells from donated embryos under this section.""     H.R. 2096/S. 1349—Responsible Stem Cell Research Act of 2001    In general, these bills would require the Secretary of HHS to establish a stem cell donor bank containing stem cells derived from umbilical cord blood, placental tissue, and adult tissues. The bills contain the following key provisions:    The Secretary of HHS shall by contract establish and maintain a National Stem Cell Donor Bank for the purpose of seeking and preserving donations of ""qualifying human stem cells"" and shall make such donated cells available for biomedical research and therapeutic purposes.    ""Qualifying stem cells"" are defined as human cells obtained from human placentas, umbilical cord blood, organs or tissues of a living or deceased human being who has been born, or organs or tissues of unborn human offspring who died of natural causes (such as spontaneous abortion).    The bills would authorize appropriations of $30 million for FY 2002 and such sums as may be necessary for each of the FYs 2003 through 2006 for  NIH  to conduct and support research using qualifying human stem cells.     H. Con. Res. 17—Support for Pluripotent Stem Cell Research    H. Con. Res. 17 would express the ""sense of the Congress supporting Federal funding of pluripotent stem cell research.""     H.R. 2747—Stem Cell Research for Patient Benefit Act of 2001    In general, the bill would codify the  NIH  guidelines for research using human pluripotent stem cells. The bill contains the following key provisions:      Would require the Director of  NIH  to conduct or support research using human pluripotent stem cells from embryos and fetal tissue in accordance with the  NIH  guidelines published in the Federal Register on August 25, 2000    Would require the Director of  NIH  to conduct a study on the current state of knowledge regarding stem cells derived from embryos, fetal tissue, and adult tissues    Would require the Institute of Medicine to conduct a study on the current state of knowledge regarding therapies, including somatic cell nuclear transfer and therapies using pharmaceuticals, that may be used to address immunologic rejection of stem cells and differentiated cells and tissue derived from stem cells    Would establish a Biomedical Advisory Commission, with members appointed by Congress, to conduct studies and make recommendations regarding bioethical issues arising from research on human biology and applications of such research.     H.R. 4011—Science of Stem Cell Research Act    In general, the bill would establish a Stem Cell Research Board within the legislative branch to conduct research on the effects of the President's August 9, 2001, stem cell policy. The bill contains the following key provisions:      Would establish in the legislative branch a bipartisan commission to be known as the Stem Cell Research Board.    The Board would be required to conduct research on the effects of the President's August 9 stem cell policy, including the progress in advances in curing certain diseases, and all aspects of the funding process of the  NIH  for both embryonic and adult stem cell research.    The Board would be required to make recommendations to Congress regarding any changes in legislation that may be warranted to reduce any inefficiencies in Federal funding of human embryonic stem cell research.    The Board would include members appointed by the President, the Speaker of the House, the minority leader of the House, and the majority and minority leaders of the Senate. There is no specification in the bill that any of the members must include individuals with scientific expertise.     Status and Outlook    On April 5, 2001, Senator Specter introduced S. 723, the Stem Cell Research Act of 2001, which has 18 cosponsors. S. 723 was referred to the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. A series of amendments to the bill were also referred to the Committee in June and July. An identical companion measure, H.R. 2059, was introduced by Representative McDermott on June 5, 2001. H.R. 2059 has 28 cosponsors and was referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. On June 18, 2001, the bill was referred to the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health.    On June 7, 2001, Representative Smith introduced H.R. 2096, the Responsible Stem Cell Research Act of 2001. The bill has 68 cosponsors and was referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. On June 18, 2001, H.R. 2096 was referred to the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health. An identical companion measure, S. 1349, was introduced by Senator Ensign on August 3, 2001. S. 1349 has three cosponsors and was referred to the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.     On January 30, 2001, Representative Maloney introduced H. Con. Res. 17. The resolution has 84 cosponsors and was referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. On February 14, 2001, the resolution was referred to the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health.    On August 2, 2001, Representative DeGette introduced H.R. 2747, the Stem Cell Research for Patient Benefit Act of 2001. The bill has 15 cosponsors. H.R. 2747 was referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.    On March 20, 2002, Representative Maloney introduced H.R. 4011, the Science of Stem Cell Research Act. The bill has four cosponsors and was referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.    Stem cell research continues to be the source of considerable controversy and discussion within Congress. As many predicted, there was considerable debate on this issue when the Senate considered H.R. 3061, the Departments of Labor, HHS, Education, and Related Agencies Appropriation Act of 2002, this fall. The Senate version of H.R. 3061, as amended, initially contained an addendum, introduced by Senator Specter, to the yearly Human Embryo Research (HER) ban that would permit embryonic stem cell research at the President's discretion. Viewing this as a weakening of the human embryo ban, the White House threatened to veto the bill if this language was included. Senator Brownback also offered four amendments to the Senate bill on issues related to stem cell research. They were as follows: 1) to make criminal the creation of embryos for research purposes, 2) to make criminal both therapeutic and reproductive cloning, 3) to make criminal any combining of human and animal gametes for the purpose of creating a hybrid, and 4) to make criminal human germ line modification. After much negotiation, Senator Specter agreed to drop the additional paragraph regarding embryonic stem cell research, and Senator Brownback agreed to withdraw his amendments. The Senate majority leader agreed to bring a freestanding bill regarding stem cell research to the Senate floor in the spring of 2002. Senators Harkin and Specter promised additional hearings on this topic.    The FY 2002 Labor and HHS Appropriation Bill (H.R. 3061) does not include any new language other than the HER ban. The Committee report accompanying H.R. 3061 (H. Rept. 107-229) contains language in support of the President's policy and encourages  NIH  to move forward expeditiously in funding both adult and human embryonic stem cell research.                                                                                               Privacy         |  Accessibility         |  Disclaimer"

Opening Statements:    Chairman: Chairman Specter opened the hearing stating,     ""On Monday I was informed by staff that Dr. Zerhouni had just called to say that   he believed there were stem cell lines which were not contaminated with mouse feeders, which was   more than a surpriseit was a shock.  And I sat down with Dr. Zerhouni on Tuesday afternoon to   go into the matter in some greater detail.  And the reason that the issue was so startling was   that this Subcommittee has been consistently advised that the eligible stem cell lines have   all been grown with mouse feeder cells.      That information was given to us by the Secretary of HHS, Thompson; Dr. Allen Spiegel, the   Director of the National Institute on Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases, which has   principle responsibility on the stem cell issues; by Dr. James Battey, Chairman of the  NIH    Stem Cell Task Force, all from  NIH , and from other scientists as well:  Dr. Roger Pedersen   from Cambridge, Dr. George Daley from MIT.  There is a considerable body of additional   authority for the proposition that the existing cell lines, stem cell lines, are contaminated   with mouse feeders; but I will not take the time to go into them now.""     He then outlined the following issues:       Disparity between funding at the  NIH  for human embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells   raises real questions.  Stem cell research received $10.7 million in 2002 and $17.1 million in   2003, and adult stem cell research received $147.6 million in 2002 and $155.7 million in   2003.    Reasons for additional stem cell lines: 1) genetic diversity, 2) proper comparison of cells   grown with mouse feeder cells and lines that were grown without mouse feeders, and 3)   production of cells that could be used for treatment.    His views that scientific information should be received by Congress without   politicization and without shading.    His desire to get the facts from  NIH  and outside scientists about whether embryonic stem   cell research and discovery is impeded by the President's policy.      Ranking Minority Member: Senator Harkin joined the Chairman in expressing his view about  seemingly contradictory information about the state of stem cell research.  He expressed his  concern that the information process at  NIH  had been politicized.    Statements of Witnesses:    Dr. Zerhouni: Dr. Zerhouni described the progress that has occurred in the field of  embryonic stem cell research as a result of  NIH  funding:        More than 60 investigators at 48 institutions have received  NIH  awards and are working   on embryonic stem cell research.    78 embryonic stem cell lines, in various stages of development, are available for Federal   funding.    NIH  support has helped increase the number of widely available lines to many researchers.    One line was available in April 2002; five lines were available in November 2002; today, eleven   lines are available for distribution to scientists.  Dr. Zerhouni explained that more are   being developed and will be available in the future.         Dr. Zerhouni stated  NIH  is, ""as diligently as possible implementing the policy set by the  President on August 9, 2001, which has enabled the field of scientific research to advance.   Prior to that date, no funding had been spent on the field of embryonic stem cell research.  And,  we are going to accelerate the funding as fast as we can.""    Dr. Zerhouni described recent scientific advances in the field of embryonic stem cell research:        NIH  supported researchers succeeded in replacing a specific stretch of DNA in human   embryonic stem cells:  ""This very important advance opens the door to those who want to   study the function of specific genes and also provides a way to modify derived tissues in   a very precise manner for use in treating patients.""    NIH  supported research is also identifying the genes involved in human embryonic stem   cell differentiation and self-renewal:  ""This is an important scientific prerequisite before   scientific progress can be made.  Until recently, all human embryonic stem cells were   expanded after derivation on mouse feeder layers.  Now scientists are establishing   conditions to grow these cells using human feeder layers.   NIH  supported scientists in the   United States using approved available cells have tested the ability of human feeder cells   derived from fetal or adult tissues to support the growth of human embryonic stem cell   lines.  And are now learning, as fast as possible, how to expand and grow embryonic stem cells   without any feeder layers.""    In  August 2002,  NIH  established an  NIH  characterization unit:  ""This unit will provide   what is missing right now in the field of stem cell research at this time, that is, reliable,   standardized data derived from assays performed on human embryonic stem cell lines to make   available for widespread distribution lines that are fully characterized so that scientists   compare results across experiments.""        Dr. Zerhouni offered his assurance of  NIH 's commitment to the vigorous pursuit of embryonic stem  cell research.  He explained that, ""The President's policy has provided us the opportunity to be at  the forefront of new discoveries about stem cells.  We're exploiting this as fully as we can.""    In response to the concerns expressed in Senator Harkin's opening statement, Dr. Zerhouni  stated, ""it is very important for the  NIH  Director to be factual and provide accurate factual  information to the maximum extent possible to help form policy decisions.  This is what I am  doing.""    Dr. Kessler:  Speaking as both an  NIH  funded scientist and the father of a 17-year-old daughter who is confined to  a wheelchair, Dr. Kessler described his most sincere interest in seeing this field move forward.   He stated that  NIH -funded scientists should be able to apply their funds using the best tools  available including access to embryonic stem cell lines which have not been raised on mouse feeder  cells.  Dr. Kessler believes stem cell research would be improved by an increase of the number of  expansion techniques.  He stated that, although some claim that all of the relevant research can be  done now, the scientific community needs to be attentive to the way cells are derived and to their  genetic background.    Dr. Battey:  Dr. Battey stated that research efforts at this point should focus on: 1) increasing the number of  available cell lines, 2) characterizing the existing cell lines, and 3) standardizing cell culture  techniques.  Dr. Battey explained  that  NIH  is ""vigorously going after all of those things.""    Dr. Ogle:  Dr. Ogle described the enthusiasm of the scientists in this field of research.  He predicted  regenerative medicine will be able to repair tissue and deliver drugs in clinical practice within  the lifetime of some in the hearing room.  He stated that China is making embryonic stem cell  research the cornerstone of their biomedical program.  In Dr. Ogle's opinion, a greater number of  cell lines would allow greater statistical strength.  He stated that each cell division increases  the likelihood of critical changes in the cells; thus, more lines are needed.    Dr. McKay:  Dr. McKay explained that exposure to mouse feeder cells is one in a general class of problems that  are irreversible.  He described several kinds of changes that cells undergo as a result of long  term culture.  He stated that the  NIH  response to those scientific concerns is outlined in Dr.  Zerhouni's written statement and that the  NIH  is actively trying to move this field forward in a  scientifically appropriate manner.  He stated that Dr. Zerhouni asked him to direct the human  embryonic stem cell characterization unit. He explained the unit will directly compare and  characterize the embryonic stem cell lines that are available on the  NIH  stem cell registry and  make them available for distribution to scientists.    Mr. Cordy:  Mr. Cordy, who has Parkinson's disease,  spoke as one of the many millions of Americans who could  benefit from biomedical research.  He explained that he sees, ""a potential cure for my affliction  dangled in front of me only to see well-intentioned people limit our brilliant scientists from  reaching that goal.""  His statement concluded that time is running out for those with permanently  disabling, and ultimately fatal diseases and conditions.      Questions to Witnesses:          Chairman Specter:  ""There's something that needs to be asked. I    repeatedly requested that  NIH  recommend a non- NIH  scientist to testify in support of your    position that additional stem cell lines aren't required.  But  NIH  did not recommend for    me a non- NIH  scientist.  Is that because you could not find one who would back up the     NIH  position?""        Dr. Zerhouni:   ""I didn't know of this request.""       Dr. Battey:  ""I know of no individual who was willing to testify.""      Chairman Specter:   ""Now tell me, why is it that so many authoritative    spokesmen have told this Subcommittee that all of the eligible Federal lines were grown on    mouse feeders?  On September 5, 2001, Secretary Thompson stated that categorically.  On    September 26, 2001,  in response to our request,  NIH  prepared papers on the relevant    embryonic stem cell lines and, among other things, concluded that a major goal of their    work at present was to develop a culture system that was free of mouse feeder layers.  This    has not yet been applied.  Why is it that the Subcommittee was informed that all of the    existing lines were raised on mouse feeders until Monday of this week, when you contacted    my staff, and Tuesday, when you spoke with me?""          Dr. Zerhouni:   ""I wasn't there to know exactly what happened before 2002,    but I take your point there are inconsistencies. The new finding that human feeder cell    layers were supportive of the growth of human stem cells, reported by Johns Hopkins    scientists, was important enough, in my mind, to make sure that we reviewed the    information.  Prior to that date, there was no other technique used to grow stem cells    of that kind; so, it was very important to make sure we did a complete review at that time.     But I understand your point and I reviewed those papers.  I can only tell you one thingthat    I am actively committed to providing you with the most accurate information at the time    it happens.  The field is fast evolving.  It's a new field.  We've only been funding this    field for less than 18 months.  This is the commitment I make to you.  I'll be happy    to be on the record reviewing the prior data set.""        Chairman Specter:   ""Doctor, with all due respect, these are not    inconsistencies.  It's a flat out contradiction.  Night and Day.  Black and White.  Yes or    No.  They're not inconsistencies.  It's just flat out different.  Dr. Battey, how do you    feel about it?  You were one of those who said that all of the lines were grown with mouse    feeders.""        Dr. Battey:   ""At the time I was asked the question I knew of no cell lines    on the  NIH  registry that were not grown on mouse feeders.  I learned differently earlier    this week.  I apologize for propagating misinformation.  It was not done deliberately on    my part.""        Chairman Specter:  ""Dr. Zerhouni, in our conversation on Tuesday you    told me that you had a suspicion that there might be some cell lines that might not have    been grown on mouse feeders.  Why didn't that suspicion lead you to investigate the matter    further?""       Dr. Zerhouni:   ""We had heard scientists wanted to freeze these cell lines    until culture conditions were optimized.  But, we didn't know that for a fact.  However,    when the Johns Hopkins paper came out, it became important to focus on this issue.  So,    the contact that I've had with people led me to believe that not everybody was growing cell    lines but some were preserving them prior to exposure, perhaps; but I didn't know that    for a fact, Senator.  I only focused on that issue.""        Chairman Specter:  ""When did you first suspect this?""        Dr. Zerhouni:   ""When the Johns Hopkins paper came out, it became an    important scientific issue.  I decided to, and the  NIH  staff decided to, focus on    this issue.""        Chairman Specter:   ""Was that the first time you had suspicion in    your mind there might be stem cells lines not grown on mouse feeder cells?""       Dr. Zerhouni:   ""I knew before that some of the 14 private lines,    and we don't always have access to information about private lines, were frozen.""        Chairman Specter:  ""It seems to me that as soon as you had a    suspicion, I would have thought you would have looked into it.  At least at the time    when you became Director, or perhaps prior to that time, when you and I discussed    the matter.  I'm looking for the sequence of events as to why this wasn't determined    earlier.  That bears on the authenticity.""        Dr. Zerhouni:   ""I appreciate your point.  We knew, I knew, I suspected,    and I think we knew at various time points that people had frozen cell lines that they    were keeping in reserve.  I knew that over several months and even before I came to    the  NIH .  Whether or not any of those frozen lines have or have not been exposed to    mouse feeder cells became relevant about 4 to 5 weeks ago when the Johns Hopkins    paper was published.  And, that's when I started to question our knowledge about    the specific growth conditions of these not-yet-defrozen lines.""        Chairman Specter:   ""Dr. Zerhouni, I don't agree with you.  I think it    was relevant before the Johns Hopkins paper was published, that there were stem cell lines    out there not grown on mouse feeders. It's a big deal, isn't it?""        Dr. Zerhouni:   ""Yes and no, Senator, because at the time, prior to that,    there was no technique to grow the cells other than using mouse feeder cells.  So, the    question becomes relevant when you have someone describing a viable technique.""        Chairman Specter:  ""Dr. Zerhouni, I just don't agree with you.     Techniques are developed.  And, you never know when a technique will be developed.  It is a    major matter if stem cell lines are in existence that have not been grown on mouse feeder    cells and frozen, you may say in anticipation of the development of this kind of technique.    So, you're saying that sometime before you came to  NIH  you had the suspicion there might    be some stem cell lines that were not grown on mouse feeders.""       Dr. Zerhouni:  "" No, no.  Let me be very specific.  I knew that scientific    groups were freezing their lines waiting for better knowledge about how to grow them out    more effectively.  At that point, I did not focus my attention, personally, on mouse    feeders or others because there were no other techniques known. Five weeks ago, with the    report of the very specific method, what that would mean for  NIH  available lines, whether    they were grown using mouse feeders or human feeders, then it became very important.  So,    I may have missed a turn, but frankly, the point became relevant when, finally, a    technique was publically described that could do that.""        Chairman Specter:   ""I've heard about reports from Singapore last year    where scientists claimed to grow embryonic stem cells without mouse feeders.""        Dr. Zerhouni  responded that those private sources of embryonic stem cells    were not forthcoming with information and their data have not been published or peer    reviewed.        Chairman Specter:  ""Are there scientific reasons to have more lines    available?""        Dr. Zerhouni  responded it is more important to have well characterized lines    available for use.  As demonstrated by experimentation that enabled sequencing of the    human genome, scientists do not need too much genetic diversity early on.  The human    genome was first sequenced using DNA from only six individuals.  And, now that techniques    were developed, we are looking at the issue of genetic diversity.        Chairman Specter:  ""Why can't you find scientists willing to back up the     NIH  position?""       Dr. Zerhouni  responded that all scientists are welcoming of the openness    of the process.        Chairman Specter:   ""Don't a vast majority of scientists think there need    to be more lines?""      Dr. Zerhouni  responded that he can only deal with facts and provide a    medium for discussions to occur.  He stated he is trying to contribute to progress in this    field.        Dr. McKay  responded,  ""I do believe we're doing all that we can.  In the    future we'll need more.""        Dr. Kessler  responded, ""I'm doing all I can at this time.  However,    there is no question that supplying the best scientists with the best tools will cause    the field to move faster.  I would like to state for the record that  NIH  is supportive    of all of us.""         Chairman Specter:  ""Are these lines sufficient for what we want to do    today?""        Dr. McKay   responded that mouse feeder cells are not a rate limiting step    at this point.  He stated that we'll make it known publically when a rate-limiting    problem does come up.         Senator Harkin:  ""I want to talk about what's happening with the recent    revelations.  I understand there's a lot of debate in the field about the best way to grow    human embryonic stem cells.  I was told that they might grow differently depending upon    whether you use mouse feeder cells, human feeder cells or no feeder cells at all.  And,    studying these differences is important, scientists tell me because, before you use stem    cells in humans, you have to make sure they are safe.  And you can have contamination    problems with cells coming in contact with mouse feeder cells or even human cells.  But,    from what I understand, all 11 cell lines that are currently available to Federally    funded researchers  were grown on mouse feeder cells.  Is that correct?        Dr. Zerhouni:  ""That is correct.""        Senator Harkin:   ""Now, apparently, scientists in Sweden have grown four    to five lines without feeder cells.  Is that correct?""       Dr. Zerhouni:   ""There is no published data.  That is verbal communication.     But, that is the statement.""        Senator Harkin:  ""So, you don't know whether they have or have not    really grown four to five cell lines without feeders?""        Dr. Zerhouni:  ""We are certain that they have them. I have no peer reviewed,    fully published methods or paper.  We have verbal data.  This is what they have    told us.""      Dr. Battey:   ""Mr. Harkin, nor can we tell how well characterized those    cells are or what kind of state these cells are in.  We don't know whether or not they're    going to differentiate into all the lineages, we do not know whether they will be    continually self renewed, we do not know whether or not they can remain karyotypically    normal in their genome when cultured over long periods of time.  All of those are issues    that need to be addressed.  That's why Dr. Zerhouni refers to peer reviewed papers.  That's    why that is the gold standard within the scientific community.  We need a gold standard.     Otherwise we end up mired in controversy and contradictory information, which is going to    be an issue for you and Senator Specter to raise.""        Senator Harkin:   ""Wouldn't it be helpful for scientists to be able to    compare the four to five  lines with the 11 lines that already exist?  Would it be helpful    for scientists to compare them or not?""        Dr. Zerhouni  responded that the issue in stem cell lines is whether to    suspend them and when to provide them to the scientific community at large. ""We are pushing    the research.  We are trying to develop ways to try to grow cell lines without feeder    layers.  It is difficult to grow these cells.""  It took a year to develop a cell line.        Senator Harkin:  ""To the best of our knowledge, I know of no lines that    were developed in this country that were not developed on either mouse feeder cells or    human feeder cells.  Is that correct?""        Dr. Zerhouni:  ""There is a group at Johns Hopkins who just reported, 5 weeks    ago, a  well described and validated method using stem cells that were originally grown on    mouse feeder cellsthese are  NIH -available cellsthat were separated out.        Senator Harkin:   ""They separated them out but we still don't know    whether they carry some contaminant.""        Dr. Zerhouni:   ""The key element here is that, until these papers cleared,    no one had discovered the way to do it.""        Senator Harkin:   ""I think, Dr. Zerhouni, that the key element is, if in    fact, there are four to five lines in Sweden that have been developed or are being developed    without using any feeders, it seems to me that we would want to jump on them.     Get those lines.  Get them to researchers in this country as soon as possible to start    comparing them and to see whether or not you can develop those lines further along.  Because,    as you just stated, it takes another year.  It takes a year. And, you know, we've got people for    whom that's another year of time.  Why not use those four to five lines they have in Sweden?     Why not?""        Dr. Zerhouni:   ""We don't have those lines.  They are in the very early    stages of defining the technique.  Even the Swedes themselves would tell you that.""        Dr. Battey:   ""They have not published their methods.  They are asserting    that they are in the early stages of thinking that they have made some advances that will    allow them to define the technique.  At this point it is very preliminary and that is not    scientifically established.  So, we will encourage them.  We have funded that group to    find out what are the conditionswe have funded the main group, including the group at    Hopkins and other labs, to try to accelerate our understanding of how to grow these cells    without mouse feeder cells.""        Senator Harkin:   ""But you don't know whether or not they've actually    done that?""       Dr. Zerhouni:   ""We do not know that they've been successful.  They claim    that they are seeing early signs that they are able to do that.  But, as Dr. Battey    mentioned, without characterizing them, without knowing if they're differentiated or not,    they're not the steps, Senator.""        Senator Harkin:  ""Do you think they're farther along than we are?""        Dr. Zerhouni:   ""No, I think not necessarily.  Again, I think that we should    be factual.  And, facts of science means you publish a paper that's peer reviewed and the    method is duplicated. The only two sources that we know have done that are Johns Hopkins,    in their recent paper, and the source in Singapore that is claiming to have grown without    human feeder cells.  But, those cells have not been extended and made available to the    research community.""        Senator Harkin:  ""Again, my understanding, and correct me if I'm wrong,    is that the lines developed in Sweden, however far they have been developed (and it is not    clear in my mind how far they have been developed), are farther along than anything that    this country has donewithout using feeder cells.  These data suggest that they have    gotten a lot farther than we have.""       Dr. Zerhouni:   ""Again, you're asking me to comment on a verbal description    without the ability to look at the process.  We need to be very watchful.  Jim and I are on    every single piece of information that we can get to try to accelerate the field.  But,    it is a difficult field.""        Senator Harkin:   ""If those four to five lines were derived after August    9, 2001, does that limit you?  I understand they were derived after August 9, 2001, isn't    that right?""          Dr. Zerhouni:  ""Right.  And, those would not be available for Federal    funding.""        Senator Harkin:   ""But, you just told me that you had people investing    them?  These cell lines, which had been developed and are much better than what people are    using here in terms of not using feeder cells""       Dr. Zerhouni:   ""They're not better than anything we've done.  Not for sure.     We do not know.""         Senator Harkin:   ""Well, if, in fact, they've been developed, would you    not want to compare them with what we have?""        Dr. Zerhouni:   ""Right.  And, the strategy is multi-pronged.  You cannot    just go on one technique and one source.  My strategy is to fund multiple groups of    investigators.  Now the Swedes are trying to discover what we are trying to discovera    reliable technique to grow these cells without feeder layers.  They say they have made    some progress.  We are looking forward to their progress, but we've heard about progress    before that did not materialize.""        Senator Harkin:  ""If it were true, that they had developed these and you    wanted to federally fund researchers to compare these cell lines with what we have now, you    wouldn't be able to do it?""        Dr. Zerhouni:   ""No.  Not necessarily, Senator, if they were to develop a    reliable method, which we are really seeking and actively promoting scientists to do.""        Senator Harkin:   ""I'm not talking about those lines, I'm talking about    the lines in Swedenthe ones that were developed not using feeder linesthe ones that were    developed after August 9, 2001.  And, I'm saying, if we wanted to compare those with what    we've done here, you would not be able to do it.""        Dr. Zerhouni:  ""Any researcher can use other funds to compare those lines    with ones that are available.  We're not preventing that from happening.  I am telling    you that we will fund the Swedish researchers once we know they have a reliable    scientifically developed technique with cells that will then go to the registry that we    have.  No scientist is prevented in this country from doing that.  We are not preventing    anyone from using federally-funded lines as well as not federally-funded lines.""        Senator Harkin:  ""What's the difference between the four to five    different cell lines that we've heard aboutyou're saying we don't have good scientific    datathat have been developed to some point...without using any feeder cells.  What is the    difference between those and taking the 16 that are still frozen and developing those?     What's the difference?""        Dr. Zerhouni:  ""The difference is that this is hearsay and that we don't    know if that information is valid, nor is it clear to us that the methods they are    exploring will be effective.  If these methods were effective and efficient, then we    certainly would want to see these methods to transport to the 16 cell lines that are    available for Federal funding and fund those.  But, this is hearsay at this point.  I want    to be factual and solid in terms of  what we know.""        Senator Harkin:  ""How long will it take you to find out?""       Dr. Zerhouni:   ""That's not in my hands.  It's in the hands of the Swedish    researchers.  Researchers are to publish their results to demonstrate the validity of their    claim.""      Senator Harkin:   ""What I hear you saying is that you will wait for the    publication of the findings of these studies and then apply that information to these    16 frozen cell lines available for Federal funding.  So, it seems to me, in the end what    you're saying is that you're wasting a year and a half or more of time because it's going    to take you a year to develop them.""        Senator Harkin:  ""The only difference between the four to five lines that    are being developed and the 16 Federally fundable lines that are still frozen, the only    difference is August 9, 2001.  And, I ask you, is that a scientific basis?        Dr. Zerhouni:   ""The Federal funding decision the President made on August    9, 2001, was a policy decision made using more than scientific considerations.  The moral    and ethical debate allowing, for the first time, Federal funding for this line of    researchit had never been funded before.""       Senator Harkin:  "" I  don't expect you to comment on this, but I have to say    that I have a problem with the policy that suggests it is moral and ethical to use cells    derived before 9 am on August 9, 2001, but somehow not to use those derived after.""        In his concluding remarks, Senator Specter requested Dr. Zerhouni provide for the record: 1) a  total number of eligible stem cell derivations, 2) the total number of stem cell lines, and 3) the  total number of stem cell lines available to federally funded scientists.

Witnesses:    Dr. Elias Zerhouni, Director of the National Institutes of Health, accompanied by:  Dr. James  Battey, Director of the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communications Disorders ( NIH );  Dr. Francis Collins, Director of the National Human Genome Research Institute ( NIH ); Dr. Thomas  Insel, Director of the National Institute of Mental Health ( NIH ); and Dr. Raynard Kington, Deputy  Director of  NIH      Purpose of Hearing:  The purpose of the hearing was to continue the discussion with the  Subcommittee of the Fiscal Year (FY) 2004 budget for the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ).      Summary:  As a number of Members attended the hearing, there was discussion of many topics including:          how  NIH  sets priorities for research and funding    how it translates the results of research to the public    what steps are being taken to encourage research using the   human embryonic stem cells under the President's requirements    what successes have there been from the 20-year investment in adult stems cells    specific questions about certain diseases and conditions such as autism, PSTD, arthritis, and breast and prostate cancer.          Dr. Weldon and Mr. Jackson were both interested in stem cellsfrom different perspectives.  Dr.   Weldon asked whether adult stem cells have shown promise and for which diseases might they be   targeted.  He also asked about human embryonic stem cells and what research had shown about   them.  Dr. Zerhouni described research in adult stem cells to see if bone marrow cells can be   modified to become heart cells or liver cells.  He also said there is evidence that if damaged   hearts are injected with adult stem cells, there is some recovery in heart function.  In animal   models, there is evidence of function that is being demonstrated in human embryonic stem cells   in terms of producing dopamine.  Mr. Jackson wanted to know 1) the status of stem cell lines   provided for Federal funding by the President; 2) how many stem cell research grants have been   awarded thus far; and 3) what  NIH  is doing to ensure that more stem cell research grants are   funded.  Dr. Weldon also asked questions about  NIH  funding for autism research and observed   that from a cost benefit perspective, investing large amounts of money into a well-funded chronic   disease may not be as likely to provide a breakthrough as a modest investment in a disease (like   autism) where very little has been spent, and much is still unknown.       Statements of Witnesses:  In brief remarks, Dr. Zerhouni said that in  NIH 's view, the  genome era begins today, offering opportunities which were never before possible, yet created  the need to revolutionize the way we do research.  This will change the way healthcare and  medicine will be provided in the 21st Century.  It will change from the paradigm of the 20th  Century in which we waited for the disease to become manifest and then treated it to a paradigm  in the 21st Century where we will know enough about the molecular events that lead to a disease  to detect those molecular events before the disease strikes.  If we can do that over the next 25,  30 years, we will completely change the dynamics of healthcare in this country; and this is the  number one priority for  NIH .         Questions:    Representative Regula:         I've read that we're all programmed at birth. Can you comment?  You're saying you can    alter the gene makeup of each of us to change behavior or to change medical conditions?     Dr. Collins, you said that in doing genetic research, you could perhaps predict behavior    and that while you can't alter the genetic makeup, you might alert the individual that    their lifestyle changes could be productive in terms of their health.  Am I stating    correctly?  How does John Citizen get that kind of an evaluation?  It seems to me that's a    little bit sophisticated for Dr. Smith down the street who is in the general practice    of medicine.     Will the bio-defense needs consume all of the proposed funding increases in FY 2004?     Will that limit your ability to expand research?  Dr. Zerhouni responded that  NIH  expects    the bio-defense budget to stabilize around the FY 2004 figure, which is $1.625 billion.     To Dr. Stephen Katz, Director of the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal    and Skin Diseases:   Dr. Katz, are we making any progress on arthritis?  Is it true that    you do not have older individuals in your clinical studies?  Dr. Katz noted that  NIH     has just launched an osteoarthritis initiative in which most of the patients enrolled will be    55 or 60.  Patients within the longitudinal study of osteoporosis in men, a joint study with    the National Institute of Aging, will recruit men at age 60 and over because that's the    susceptible population.     What is a statin?       Representative Northup:        To Dr. Duane Alexander, Director of the National Institute of Child Health and    Human Development (NICHD):   We are visited by individuals marketing material for use    in schools, but we have no way of knowing whether it is research based.  Is NICHD looking    into these products?  Is there a way to provide systematic review of instructional    materials to improve education?  Dr. Alexander responded that we can demonstrate the    effectiveness of certain interventions certain methods of teaching that are beneficial    for most children. There is, however, a need for individualization of assessment of    children's different needs.  The No Child Left Behind legislation requires states to have    their instructional materials based on research.  We hope that much of that will be NICHD    research.     To Dr. Insel, Director of  NIH :   Is it true that in mental health studies there    is quality control to insure that the person who is part of the trial is taking exact    doses in the exact way?  How can we accomplish this in a non-research setting?  Is there a    mechanism to stabilize the medications to provide consistency over a long period of time,    like a three-month cycle.       Representative Roybal-Allard:        I've heard from people outside of Washington that there is sporadic collaboration among    Federal agencies and community health organizations.  Does  NIH  collaborate with the Agency    for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services    Administration (SAMSHA), and the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA)?     Does AHRQ have a seat at the table when  NIH  is determining its research priorities?     What needs to happen to make this sort of a seamless effort?     How is the healthcare system poised to ensure that the best treatment is used?         Representative Weldon:        Are you funding research using adult stem cells; and if so, roughly what is the    dollar     amount of that research and in what conditions are adult stem cells showing    promise?   You have been funding adult stem cells for over 20 years, correct?  Do you have    any information on the types of diagnostic or clinical conditions where adult stem cells    are showing clinical application usefulness?  What about the work of Dr. Rafai on adult    stem cells which she has been able to get to differentiate into all the different germ    layers?  Dr. Zerhouni said he was aware of Dr. Rafai's work, called M-A-P-C cells.     What is your research showing using the embryonic stem cells?  What have you    seen in animal models?     There is not an animal model where they've been able to alleviate the symptoms of    Parkinson's or diabetes using human embryonic stem cells.     I understand that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is saying the    incidence of autism is up, and up dramatically.  What is your level of funding for autism    research?  It seems to me there is heavy emphasis on the genetics of this disease and    inadequate funding in terms of treatment and intervention.  I wanted to know if you were    doing anything in that area.  Dr. Zerhouni responded that he had the same experience over    the past 20 years with reports of increasing numbers of children with what appears to be.     In terms of  NIH , the funding for autism has more than tripled since FY 1998, and  NIH  is    funding two centers.  Dr. Insel expanded on this issue and agreed that at this point    there is not a medical treatment that really gets at the core issues.        Representative Wicker:          How do you define cancer survivorship, and what can you share with us from the     report?  Are we going to have a national cancer survivorship action plan?  What sort     of research are we funding on cancer survivorship, and how much money are we spending?      To Dr. Claude Lenfant, Director of the National Heart, Lung and Blood     Institute:   Dr. Lenfant, can you discuss the Jackson Heart Study?      To Dr. Roderic Pettigrew, Director of the National Institute of     Bioengineering, Bioimaging and Bioinformatics:   Dr. Pettigrew, is the imaging     conference held recently in Jackson, MS, the first of its kind for NIBIB?  Were     you able to reach your goal there of defining the state of the art?  Were there     scientists from all over the world at this meeting?            Representative Lowey:          What is  NIH  doing to advance the next generation of breast cancer detection     techniques?  The recent Amsterdam study indicated that breast tumors appear to     have genetic signatures that predict whether a tumor is going to be fast growing     or slow growing, treatable or untreatable.  What gene activity research is  NIH      conducting in that regard, and are we also developing new treatment options     based on this information?  How close are we in determining the difference between     an aggressive cell and a passive breast cancer cell?      When will the large arthritis trial jointly supported with the National Center     for Complementary and Alternative Medicine be completed?       With all the claims made for medications for arthritis, what should we do?  Are     we properly informing individuals of side effects?  What about studies which show     the value of  physical therapy?  Dr. Katz responded that many studies have shown     that for patients who have chronic arthritis walking is very helpful.            Representative Granger:          Please discuss regressive autism.  What kind of studies have you done on autism,     particularly the correlation with inoculations?  Dr. Insel told her that the     Institute of Medicine (IOM) took a very close look at this problem about a year     ago to ask whether the relationship to vaccines might be real and whether receiving     vaccines, particularly receiving  thimerisol which is a preservative that's put into     certain multi-dose vaccines, could precipitate autism.  IOM concluded that the     evidence was inconclusive; but they also pointed out that absence of evidence is not     the same as evidence of absence.  It is sometimes possible that in very rare cases     there would be a sensitivity and that, perhaps, in such a case it would be possible.      What vaccines still contain thimerisol?        What is the future of full body scanning machines for medicine?  Dr. Zerhouni     cautioned that we are rushing into this area of using high technology for screening.      It is expensive, not currently reimbursed, and probably not recommended on the ""grand     scale.""         Representative Jackson:          What is the status of stem cell lines provided for Federal funding by the     President?   How many stem cell research grants have been awarded thus far?      What is  NIH  doing to ensure that more stem cell research grants are funded?  Dr. Battey     responded that of the 78 entries on the  NIH  registry, 11 have been developed into cell     lines available for research.   NIH  currently has 13 research grants, investigator     initiated research grants, in its portfolio, with a total committed investment of about     $14 million, and eight infrastructure awards to date.  To meet the human resource need,     which is currently the rate limiting step in this research,  NIH  is planning to support     five hands-on training courses a year, spread across the nation, to help investigators     learn the art of handling these stem cells.      Referring to the recently submitted Prostate Cancer Report, Representative Jackson     asked for an explanation of how  NIH  plans to eradicate a disease which claims the lives     of more than 28,000 men a yearmany of them African Americanwithout defining the     resources or time line required to implement the plan?         Representative Peterson:          What's the average number of prescriptions taken by older people cared for under     home health care?  Dr. Zerhouni responded that prevention would be better than multiple     medications.  Appropriate diet and exercise may lead to a reduction; but right now,     besides being able to manage drug interactions, this is the standard care for a     population that tends to have multi-system disease.  He lamented that there is a sense     in this country that if you don't feel good you take a pill.      Is there ""anything where we've leapfrogged ahead"" on some key issues because we've     doubled funding in a 5-year period, three or four items?         Representative DeLauro:          Dr. Insel, what are the latest research efforts on the post traumatic stress?  How     can we be most effective with public information on this?  What are we doing now to     prepare for those who have been involved in the war?         Representative Obey:          There is tremendous pressure on this committee to earmark for specific diseases.      The completion of the ramp-up in funding will increase the pressure by each of these     disease groups who will no longer see the expanding research dollars, and will be even     more anxious to try to specify exactly where the money should go.  How would you explain     to them the process by which you decide how much money gets allocated to each disease?      What factors do you use?  What can you say to these groups to convince them that  NIH      simply isn't allocating money on the basis of habit and old pressures so that do not     feel shortchanged in your process?  Dr. Zerhouni responded that about 60 percent of      NIH  funded research is driven by the scientific opportunities through the competitive     review process, but there are public health imperatives.   NIH  looks at the burden of     disease and is also looking proactively because of this potential burden for conditions     such as obesity.  Also,  NIH  Institutes and Centers are working on strategic plans for     many diseases.      For the Record:  Would you describe this process for the record.  Why are we ""under     investing"" in Parkinson's in comparison to the research on other diseases?  Why are we     ""under investing"" in diabetes?  Mr. Obey added, ""I think it's crucial that we not     succumb to the demand for earmarking; but I think you may be a lot more credible     than we are in answering those two questions.""

Dr. David Hess,  Chairman, Department of Neurology, Medical College of Georgia, testified that the field of regenerative  medicine is ""taking off"" and that several stem cell centers have been established.  Dr. Pablo Rubinstein,  Director, Placental Blood Program, New York Blood Center, indicated that NIH support of the COBLT study  has made it possible to collect cord blood and make it available for transplantation to patients in  need.  He told the Committee that cord blood has several advantages over the use of bone marrow as a  source of stem cells.     Dr. Joanne Kurtzberg, Director, Pediatric Stem Cell Transplant Program, Duke University Medical  Center, discussed the clinical applications of cord blood transplantation.  She said that cord blood  transplants can cure sickle cell anemia.  Dr. Kurtzberg also advocated for the establishment of a  National Cord Blood Bank.  Senator Sam Brownback (R-KS) announced that he and Senator Orrin Hatch  (R-UT) plan to write a letter in support of establishment of a National Cord Blood Center, and they  will help move legislation in this area.    Dr. John McDonald, Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine,  testified  on behalf of the Coalition for the Advancement of Medical Research.  Dr. McDonald  expressed support  for continued research on all forms of stem cells.  However, he believes that it is much more feasible  to pursue embryonic stem cell research because they can be encouraged to differentiate into various  types of cells.  Dr. Jean Peduzzi-Nelson, Department of Physiological Optics, University of Alabama  at Birmingham, said that despite the Federal ban, most stem cell research continues to focus on  embryonic stem cells, rather than adult stem cells.  In addition to the scientific experts, the  Committee heard testimony from patients with sickle cell anemia, leukemia, and ALD, who have  benefitted from treatments using cord blood stem cells.                                                                                        Privacy         |  Accessibility         |  Disclaimer"
GX026-68-13774424	August 13, 2001                               Embryonic Stem Cell Research   Last week, President Bush addressed the American people on an issue that has profound implications for our nation and for humankind.  I was very pleased that he chose to speak directly to the American people, in his first televised address, with his decision on federal funding for embryonic stem cell research.     He did his best, on a very difficult issue, to defend and support human life, while at the same time advancing medical science to help those with debilitating diseases who may potentially be helped by embryonic stem cell research.  And I commend him for his statement on human cloning  that it is not acceptable under any circumstances.  However, despite the fact that he has put together the best possible compromise, I do not think this is an area for compromise.  Though no federal funds will go for the actual destruction of human life, under his plan, we will be benefitting from the previous destruction of human life, and that is not something I can support.    Scientists believe that embryonic stem cells may have the potential to grow into replacement tissue for people with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, heart disease, diabetes and other ailments.  Although stem cells may have therapeutic value, research on embryonic stem cells raises ethical considerations because of the procedures by which they are derived.  These controversial procedures include destroying human embryos, extracting cells from aborted fetuses, and cloning.     As a member of the bipartisan Senate Biotechnology Caucus, I have spent considerable time and thought on this very important issue.  And, although I cannot support embryonic stem cell research, I do believe that the promise that lies in adult stem cells has been lost in the recent debate over embryonic stem cells.  Currently, adult and other post-natal stem cells are readily available for research purposes, and are already being used successfully to treat patients with breast cancer, brain tumors, diabetes and many other diseases.     Accordingly, I recently joined Senator John Ensign (R-NV) to introduce the Responsible Stem Cell Research Act, which would increase funding for adult stem cell research by $275 million next year, approximately 50 percent more than the current funding level.  The bill would also establish a National Stem Cell Donor Bank to generate a source of stem cells which would be available for treatment, biomedical research and other clinical purposes.  Our bill aggressively funds and develops promising medical research without relying on harvested embryonic stem cells.    I commend President Bush for defending human life and taking a strong stand against human cloning, as well as for conducting this public discussion in a sincere and judicious manner.  But while the President may have put forward the best possible compromise, I still must respectfully disagree with any taxpayer funding for embryonic stem cell research.  I have been and remain a strong supporter of doubling National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding to fight diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, and I have worked closely with Pennsylvania's many prestigious research facilities.  While I am a strong supporter of biomedical research, I cannot support federal funding for any research that destroys human life or that is based on the prior destruction of human life.             -###-                                                                    [  Santorum Home Page  ]     [   Office Addresses ] [   Constituent Services  ] [   About the Senator  ][   Federal Links  ][   Pennsylvania Links  ] [   FAQs  ]

Con. Res. 17, H.R. 2747, H.R. 2838, H.R. 2863, and H.R. 4011                          Background     In November 1998, two different groups of scientists reported the successful isolation and culturing of human embryonic stem cells.  Generally referred to as pluripotent stem cells, these cells have the ability to develop into most of the specialized cells or tissues in the human body and can divide for indefinite periods in culture.  Because these cells can give rise to many different types of cells, such as muscle cells, nerve cells, heart cells, blood cells, and others, they are enormously important to science and hold great promise for advances in health care.     The establishment of human pluripotent stem cell lines represents a major step forward in human biology.  This advance has generated interest among scientists, the public, and patients and their advocates, especially with regard to the ethical issues related to stem cell research.    The Clinton Administration published guidelines governing the use of human  embryonic stem cells in the Federal Register on August 23, 2000.  On April 25, 2001, a scheduled review of pending grant applications was postponed to provide President George W. Bush and his new Administration an opportunity to review the issue.  On August 9, 2001, President Bush issued a long-awaited decision on stem cell research.  He authorized funding of stem cell research using existing pluripotent stem cell lines that were derived from human embryos before August 9.  Such research is eligible for Federal funding if the following criteria are met: 1) there must have been informed consent of the donors, 2) the embryos must have been created for reproductive purposes and in excess of clinical need, 3) there must not have been any financial inducements to the donors, and 4) the embryos must not have been created for research purposes.  During fiscal year (FY) 2002, the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) funded the first grants to conduct human embryonic stem cell research, including both new grants and supplements to existing grants.     The Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services (HHS) and Education (Senator Tom Harkin [D-IA], Chairman) held four hearings on the issue during the 107th CongressJuly 18, 2001; August 1, 2001; October 31, 2001; and September 25, 2002.  The July 18 hearing focused on the release of a comprehensive report prepared by  NIH  that described the current state of the science on stem cells derived from human embryos, fetal tissue, and adult tissue.  In addition, several Senators holding pro-life views testified in support of stem cell research.  The August 1 hearing focused on intellectual property issues and ethical issues.  The October 31 hearing focused on testimony from the various derivers of the existing stem cell lines.  The September 25 hearing was held to provide the new Director of  NIH  with an opportunity to update the Subcommittee on the implementation of the President's stem cell decision by  NIH , and to hear from researchers on their efforts to obtain the eligible stem cell lines listed in the  NIH  Stem Cell Registry.  The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee (Senator Edward M. Kennedy [D-MA], Chairman) held one hearing on this topic on September 5, 2001.  The hearing focused on the quality and viability of the existing stem cell lines.  The Secretary of HHS, Tommy G. Thompson, testified.    The House was not particularly active on this issue as a body.  The House Committee on Government Reform Subcommittee on Criminal Justice, Drug Policy and Human Resources held  one hearing on this issue on July 17, 2001, which focused on testimony from individuals who had adopted frozen embryos from in vitro fertilization clinics.     H.R. 2059 and S. 723, the Stem Cell Research Act of 2001, were introduced by Representative Jim McDermott (D-WA) and Senators Arlen Specter (R-PA) and Harkin, respectively, to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for human embryonic stem cell generation and research.    H.R. 2096 and S. 1349, the Responsible Stem Cell Research Act of 2001, were introduced by Representative Christopher H. Smith (R-NJ) and Senator John Ensign (R-NV), respectively, to require the Secretary of HHS to maintain a stem cell donor bank containing stem cells derived from adult tissue, placentas, and umbilical cord blood.    H. Con. Res. 17 was introduced by Representative Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) to express the Sense of Congress regarding pluripotent stem cell research.    H.R. 2747 was introduced by Representative Diana L. DeGette (D-CO) to codify the Clinton Administration's guidelines governing research using human pluripotent stem cells.    H.R. 2838 was introduced by Representative Juanita Millender-McDonald (D-CA) to require  NIH  to conduct human embryonic stem cell research and repeal the Human Embryo Research Ban contained within the Labor, HHS, and Education Appropriations Act.    H.R. 2863 was introduced by Representative McDermott to require the establishment of an additional Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Advisory Committee to make recommendations on the field of cell development, including human embryonic stem cell research and therapeutic cloning.    H.R. 4011 was introduced by Representative Maloney to establish a Stem Cell Research Board within the legislative branch to conduct research on the effects of the President's August 9, 2001, stem cell policy.     Provisions of the Legislation/Impact on  NIH    S. 723/H.R. 2059—Stem Cell Research Act of 2001    These bills would have permitted the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to fund both the derivation and use of human pluripotent stem cells.  Section 2 of the bills would have added a new section (489C) to the Public Health Service Act, which would have stipulated the following:    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, ""the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) may only conduct, support, or fund research on, or utilizing, human embryos for the purpose of generating embryonic stem cells and utilizing stem cells that have been derived from embryos in accordance with this section"" (Section 489C).    The only embryos that may be used for such activities are ""those embryos that otherwise would be discarded that have been donated from in-vitro fertilization clinics with the written informed consent of the progenitors.""    The research involved shall not result in the creation of human embryos.    The research involved shall not result in the reproductive cloning of a human being.    Any person receiving Federal funds would be prohibited from knowingly acquiring or transferring embryos for ""valuable consideration.""  Valuable consideration would not include reasonable payments associated with transportation, transplantation, processing, preservation, quality control, or storage.    The Secretary of HHS would be required to develop guidelines that would ""expand on the rules governing human embryonic stem cell research to include rules that govern the derivation of stem cells from donated embryos under this section.""     H.R. 2096/S. 1349—Responsible Stem Cell Research Act of 2001    These bills would have required the Secretary of HHS to establish a stem cell donor bank containing stem cells derived from umbilical cord blood, placental tissue, and adult tissues.  The bills contained the following key provisions:    The Secretary of HHS would have been required to establish and maintain by contract a National Stem Cell Donor Bank for the purpose of seeking and preserving donations of ""qualifying human stem cells"" and shall make such donated cells available for biomedical research and therapeutic purposes.   ""Qualifying stem cells"" were defined as human cells obtained from human placentas, umbilical cord blood, organs or tissues of a living or deceased human being who has been born, or organs or tissues of unborn human offspring who died of natural causes (such as spontaneous abortion).   The bills would have authorized appropriations of $30 million for FY 2002 and such sums as may be necessary for each of the FYs 2003 through 2006 for  NIH  to conduct and support research using qualifying human stem cells.     H. Con. Res. 17—Support for Pluripotent Stem Cell Research    H. Con. Res. 17 would have expressed the ""Sense of the Congress supporting Federal funding of pluripotent stem cell research.""     H.R. 2747—Stem Cell Research for Patient Benefit Act of 2001    The bill would have codified the  NIH  guidelines for research using human pluripotent stem cells.  The bill contained the following key provisions:      The Director of  NIH  would have been required to conduct or support research using human pluripotent stem cells from embryos and fetal tissue in accordance with the  NIH  guidelines published in the Federal Register on August 25, 2000.   The Director of  NIH  would have been required to conduct a study on the current state of knowledge regarding stem cells derived from embryos, fetal tissue, and adult tissues.    The Institute of Medicine would have been required to conduct a study on the current state of knowledge regarding therapies, including somatic cell nuclear transfer and therapies using pharmaceuticals, that may be used to address immunologic rejection of stem cells and differentiated cells and tissue derived from stem cells.   A Biomedical Advisory Commission would have been established, with members appointed by Congress, to conduct studies and make recommendations regarding bioethical issues arising from research on human biology and the applications of such research.     H.R. 2838—New Century Health Advantage Act    The bill contained the following key provisions:         The Director of  NIH  would have been required to conduct or support research using human pluripotent stem cells derived from excess embryos created for purposes of fertility treatment and in excess of clinical need.       Section 510 of the FY 2001 Labor, HHS, and Education Appropriations Act, which prohibits certain research involving human embryos, would have been repealed.      H.R. 2863Cell Development Research Act of 2001    The bill contained the following key provision:         A Cell Development Advisory Panel would have been created to provide recommendations to the FDA regarding the field of cell development, including human embryonic stem cell research and therapeutic cloning.       H.R. 4011—Science of Stem Cell Research Act    The bill would have established a Stem Cell Research Board within the legislative branch to conduct research on the effects of the President's August 9, 2001, stem cell policy.  The bill contained the following key provisions:      A bipartisan commission to be known as the Stem Cell Research Board would have been established in the legislative branch.    The Board would have been required to conduct research on the effects of the President's August 9 stem cell policy, including the progress in advances in curing certain diseases, and all aspects of the  NIH  funding process for both embryonic and adult stem cell research.    The Board would have been required to make recommendations to Congress regarding any changes in legislation that may be warranted to reduce any inefficiencies in Federal funding of human embryonic stem cell research.    The Board would have included members appointed by the President, Speaker of the House, minority leader of the House, and majority and minority leaders of the Senate.  There was no specification in the bill that any of the members be individuals with scientific expertise.     Status and Outlook    On April 5, 2001, Senator Specter introduced S. 723, the Stem Cell Research Act of 2001. The bill had 18 cosponsors and was referred to the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.  A series of amendments to the bill were also referred to the Committee in June and July.  An identical companion measure, H.R. 2059, was introduced by Representative McDermott on June 5.  H.R. 2059 had 31 cosponsors and was referred to the House Energy and Commerce Committee.  On June 18, the bill was referred to the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health.    On June 7, 2001, Representative Smith introduced H.R. 2096, the Responsible Stem Cell Research Act of 2001.  The bill had 70 cosponsors and was referred to the House Energy and Commerce Committee.  On June 18, H.R. 2096 was referred to the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health.  An identical companion measure, S. 1349, was introduced by Senator Ensign on August 3.  S. 1349 had three cosponsors and was referred to the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.     On January 30, 2001, Representative Maloney introduced H. Con. Res. 17.  The resolution had 85 cosponsors and was referred to the House Energy and Commerce Committee.  On February 14, the resolution was referred to the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health.    On August 2, 2001, Representative DeGette introduced H.R. 2747, the Stem Cell Research for Patient Benefit Act of 2001.  The bill had 15 cosponsors and was referred to the House Energy and Commerce Committee.    On September 5, 2001, Representative Millender-McDonald introduced H.R. 2838, the New Century Health Advantage Act.  The bill had no cosponsors and was referred to the House Energy and Commerce Committee.    On September 6, 2001, Representative McDermott introduced H.R. 2863, the Cell Development Research Act of 2001.  The bill had 17 cosponsors and was referred to the House Energy and Commerce Committee.    On March 20, 2002, Representative Maloney introduced H.R. 4011, the Science of Stem Cell Research Act.  The bill had 25 cosponsors and was referred to the House Energy and Commerce Committee.    While no further action on this legislation occurred during the 107th Congress, stem cell research continues to be a source of considerable controversy and discussion within Congress.  As many predicted, there was considerable debate on this issue when the Senate considered H.R. 3061, the Departments of Labor, HHS, Education, and Related Agencies Appropriation Act of 2002.  Rather than passing new legislation, most Members of Congress appeared willing to accept the President's policy and await the results of its implementation before determining whether any specific legislative remedies were needed.  It is possible, however, that if the 108th Congress considers the Labor, HHS, Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill this spring, rather than one omnibus spending bill, stem cell amendments may be added.  It is also possible that Members of Congress who have been active on this issue, such as Senator Specter and Senator Sam Brownback (R-KS), will introduce legislation to either expand or limit the President's policy. Given comments by the Senate majority leader during debate on the Labor, HHS, Education, and Related Agencies appropriations bill, it is possible that Senator Specter's bill will be the subject of debate when the Senate considers this issue again in spring 2003.    The Senate Report to the FY 2003 Labor, HHS, Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill currently contains language that would 1) require DHHS to submit a report to Congress explaining how the Agency plans to encourage more stem cell grant applications and make more stem cell lines available to researchers, 2) encourage  NIH  to expand the stem cell registry to include more detailed information regarding the availability and characteristics of the existing lines, and 3) encourage  NIH  to consider developing a stem cell repository.                                                                                               Privacy         |  Accessibility         |  Disclaimer"

Witnesses:                      Panel 1:  Senators Orrin Hatch (R-UT), G ORD on Smith (R-OR), Sam Brownback                      (R-KS), and William Frist (R-TN).    Panel 2:   Lana Skirboll, Ph.D., Associate Director for Science Policy, National Institutes of Health;  Diane Krause, M.D., Ph.D., Associate Professor, Yale University;  Mary Hendrix, Ph.D., Professor and Head, Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, University of Iowa;  Michael West, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer, Advanced Cell Technology;  William Gibbons, M.D., Chairman, Jones Institute for Reproductive Medicine; and Richard M. Doerflinger, Associate Director for Policy Development, Secretariat for Pro-Life Activities, National Conference of Catholic Bishops.     Summary:    Purpose of Hearing:  This hearing, the eighth stem cell hearing held by this Subcommittee, was to provide a forum for release of the  NIH  report ""Stem Cells, Scientific Progress and Future Research Directions,"" which reviews the current state of the science of stem cell research. However, it was also an opportunity to hear from conservative Members of the Senate who had recently spoken out in favor of Federal funding for human embryonic stem cell research. Other Members of the Subcommittee who expressed support for Federal funding for human embryonic stem cell research included Senators Specter and Murray, who is a co-sponsor of the Specter-Harkin legislation. Senator Cochran said, ""This issue deserves our best efforts to learn the facts and act on them to serve the public interest."" Senators DeWine and Hutchison did not offer an opinion.     Opening Statements:    Senator Harkin mentioned the pending bill sponsored by Senators Harkin and Specter that would allow federally funded scientists to derive human stem cells from embryos under four conditions. Specifics of the measure include that embryos must be obtained from an in vitro fertilization clinic, the donors must have provided informed consent, the embryo must no longer be needed for infertility treatments, and there can be no payment to the donors. He also stated that while some say that stem cell research is fine as long as you use just adult cells, he disagreed. Pointing to the  NIH  report, he said, ""Embryonic and adult stem cells are different, and both present immense research opportunities for other potential therapies. I think it would be irresponsible to wait for years to determine the potential of adult stem cells before studying the benefits of embryonic stem cells.""    Senator Specter echoed the remarks of Senator Harkin, noting that he believes there are sufficient votes in the Senate to pass their bill. He also raised an issue of concern to him about the difficulty of this Subcommittee in getting the ""unvarnished facts from the Department of Health and Human Services."" He reiterated his concerns about the responses from  NIH  to the stem cell questions posed in May. He noted that of the 15 letters which were submitted, there were 21 deletions in 10 of the letters, and then proceeded to read some examples for illustration. He then moved on to the stem cell report. He noted that he read about the report in the New York Times on June 27. He immediately, thereafter, started to request it, but couldn't get a copy of the report. He wrote to the Secretary of HHS on July 11, 2001, and again on July 17. He further stated that Secretary Thompson's reply of July 31, 2001, did not respond to the censorship issue. He, subsequently, asked to have a copy of the original report, as submitted to DHHS, submitted to him.     Senator Murray spoke in support of stem cell research and noted that she is a cosponsor of the Specter-Harkin legislation. She said that her father had suffered from multiple sclerosis and expressed her hope that this research might address diseases such as this.     Statements of Witnesses:    Panel 1:   The first panel, comprised of U.S. Senators, was the focal point of the hearing. The majority of the time of the hearing was spent in discussions with these Members. Senators Smith and Hatch are two Members who consider themselves to hold strong pro-life, profamily values and strongly oppose abortion but who, after much reflection and thought, have spoken out in favor of this research. They have sent letters of support for this research to both the Secretary of HHS and the President, urging support. Perhaps the most moving testimony was offered by Senator Smith, who spoke of watching his cousin Congressman Morris Udall, ""literally die in public of Parkinson's disease."" He then addressed the issue of where he believes life begins, which is a major issue for individuals of faith relative to the stem cell debate. ""I believe that life begins in the mother's womb, not in the scientist's laboratory.... And I believe the Federal Government should play a role in research to assure transparency, to assure morality, to assure humanity, and to provide the ethical limits and moral boundaries which are important to this issue. Those boundaries and limits must stop at a mother's womb. For again, that is where life begins.""    Senator Frist, who had not taken a public position on this issue until the evening before the hearing and also holds strong pro-life values, concluded ""that both embryonic stem cell research, as well as the adult stem cell research, should be federally funded within a very carefully regulated, fully transparent framework that ensures the highest respect for the moral significance of the human embryo."" He then articulated what he called a ""comprehensive framework"" under which he said he believes such research should be carried out. The ten points he outlined were the following: 1) ban creation of embryos solely for research purposes, 2) continue the funding ban on the derivation of stem cells from human embryos, 3) ban human cloning, 4) increase adult stem cell research funding, 5) provide funding for embryonic stem cell research only from blastocysts that would otherwise be discarded (using only those blastocysts that are left over after in vitro fertilization and would otherwise be discarded), 6) require a rigorous informed consent process, 7) limit the number of stem cell lines, 8) establish a strong public research oversight system--a national research registry to ensure the transparent in-depth monitoring of federally funded and federally regulated stem cell research, and to promote the ethical, high-quality research standards, 9) require ongoing independent scientific and ethical review, an ongoing scientific review by the Institute of Medicine--an independent presidential advisory panel--to monitor the evolving bioethical issues surrounding stem cell research with annual reports to Congress, and 10) strengthen and harmonize the fetal tissue research restrictions.     These points generated much of the subsequent discussion, both with this panel and the next, particularly the issue of deriving additional stem cell lines and whether that should be federally funded, and the issue of how many separate stem cell lines are appropriate for research to proceed. There was not unanimity among the panel members about whether Federal funds should be used to derive the stem cells--Senators Hatch, Frist and Brownback opposed the use of Federal funds for derivation, but Senator Smith disagreed and said that if one believes the research to be appropriate, then the process of getting to that point must also be appropriate. Senator Brownback stated that he does not support any research where human embryos must be destroyed to derive stem cells. The panel members were asked whether they opposed in vitro fertilization? Each of the panel members said that he was not opposed to this. Senator Specter raised two issues which were discussed with the first panel and carried on with the second panel. One was the issue of how many cell lines would be adequate for research, and the other was that the Federal government should derive the stem cells and cell lines. Although he stated at the outset that he would oppose the creation of additional cell lines, after further discussion, Senator Frist said, ""I would propose that we have a discussion with the scientists and say how many do you really need."" This was reinforced by a witness from the second panel, Dr. Krause, who, in her testimony, raised this issue that the proposals to limit funding research to only existing cell lines is far too limiting; that scientists need to compare multiple cell lines in order to better understand the common factors that gave embryonic stem cells their incredible plasticity. When Senator Specter raised the second issue of  NIH  deriving stem cells and cell lines, Dr. Skirboll said that there may well be intellectual property issues with regard to patenting and the patenting of the technology that may or may not allow for Federal funds to go toward derivation.     Panel 2:  Dr. Skirboll presented the  NIH  report ""Stem Cells, Scientific Progress and Future Research Directions,"" which is based on a review of more than 1200 scientific articles and interviews with over 50 private and public sector scientists conducting stem cell research, and addresses both animal and human stem cell biology. It reviews research on adult stem cells as well as stem cells derived from embryos and fetal tissue. Dr. Skirboll pointed out what is needed to pursue this research: scientists need cultured cell lines that are pure, cell lines that are well characterized and identical for safety reasons; they need cell lines that are diverse, that have the capacity to develop into as many kinds of cells that are possible to replace tissues that are destroyed or damaged from disease; and cells that proliferate, can make sufficient quantities in culture so that many patients will have access to them. The report also addressed the ability of these cells to differentiate into specialized cells and ultimately to function, and made three determinations: 1) both adult and embryonic stem cell types may be useful in developing cell based therapies, 2) these kinds of stem cells are different, and 3) there are more unanswered questions than there are answers. ""Scientists all agree that stem cell research holds enormous promise to lengthen and improve the quality of life for many patients suffering from perhaps a broad spectrum of diseases--spinal c ORD  injuries, Parkinson's disease, heart disease, kidney disease, liver failure, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and diabetes to name a few. In summary, because it is not known from which stem cell type the best therapies will come for these diseases, scientists believe the door should be left open to conduct research on both embryonic and adult stem cells.""     Both Mr. Dorflinger and Dr. Anton-Lewis Usala spoke in opposition to embryonic stem cell research under any circumstances. Mr. Dorflinger called it illegal, immoral and unnecessary; and Dr. Usala called it ""a cataclysmic paradigm shift. The perceived right of the state will have superseded the right of the individual.""     Dr. Susan Lanzendorf, the lead scientist on the recently published work concerning the experience of the Jones Institute with human stem cells, described the rationale and work of the Jones Institute which uses donated gametes to produce embryonic stem cells. She urged that resources be made available to continue the research endeavors of the scientific community in the area of human embryonic stem cells. Michael West spoke in favor of therapeutic cloning, as a means by which the problem of transplantation histocompatibility could be addressed.    Dr. Diane Krause, an associate professor at Yale University School of Medicine and a researcher on adult-derived stem cells, testified about why Federal funds need to be applied to embryonic stem cell research. She stated that it is important that the Subcommittee understand that adult stem cell research is not a substitute for embryonic stem cell research. She said she was deeply concerned that people seeking to end Federal funding for human embryonic stem cell research were using her data as justification for no Federal funding. She said this ""interpretation is not only stunningly premature but potentially undermines the development of adult stem cell therapeutic options."" Dr. Mary Hendrix spoke as a scientist conducting cancer research and as the past president of FASEB. She said that FASEB strongly supports allowing human embryonic stem cell research and, based on current knowledge, while adult stem cell research is highly promising and should be pursued, embryonic stem cells have greater potential.    Questions    Specter:     Took issue with Senator Frist on two of his points--continuance of the Federal funding ban on derivation and limiting the number of stem cells lines, but conceded that he is prepared to, as Senator Frist seemed to be, to rely upon the scientists to tell us how many cell lines are needed.     To Senator Frist: If we are going to have the Federal Government pay their private concerns to derive embryos, it seems to me much wiser to have  NIH  do it directly.     To Dr. Skirboll: Do we need more stem cell lines? Are there adequate stem cells available at the present time for  NIH  to do research without having derivation paid for by the Federal Government? Isn't it true that you will need to have Federal funding to get adequate number of stem cells from the embryos if this research is to continue? Is there any conceivable excuse for  NIH  not to actively seek to have the federal funding available to extract them from embryos? The concern I have is that your report is a quasi political document because it does not tackle the question of Federal funding to extract stem cells from embryos. I am not asking you for a political position, I'm asking you a scientific question.     When was this report substantially completed, Dr. Skirboll? How many changes were made except for editorial comments and punctuation and a little polishing after June 19 when you submitted the report? Was it substantially completed in draft form? We would like to have a copy of that draft report to compare it to what was finally completed.     Harkin:    To Senator Frist: I wonder about the logic that would allow our Federal researchers to work on stem cells but not to derive them.                      To Senator Frist: What incentive will the private sector                      have to derive the stem cells if all they're going to do is                      give them free to  NIH ? Or is  NIH  going to have to purchase                      these? Is that acceptable?    To the Panel: Are you opposed to in vitro fertilization?    To Senator Frist: Would you only support use of in vitro fertilization embryos no longer needed only if they have been frozen?    To Dr. Skirboll: Does it make any sense to allow federally funded researchers to work with embryonic stem cells already derived, but not to allow those researchers to derive the stem cells in their own labs?                      To Dr. Hendrix: If you decided to do research today using                      embryonic stem cells, but you were limited to using those                      lines now in existence, what problems would that present for                      you? Are there sufficient existing stem cell lines; do they                      offer sufficient diversity; are there patent issues? And we                      heard the discussion--you heard the discussion this morning,                      is it 30, is it 50, is it 100, is it 200? Do we have any idea                      at all how many lines that we think might be sufficient? How                      do we finally figure this out?    To Dr. West: Would you tell me again how your research differs from what we're talking about in terms of embryonic stem cell research? What is the procedure?     Hutchison:                       To Senator Frist: It's my understanding that the longer an                      embryo from in vitro fertilization is frozen, the less likely                      it is to be as viable. If it's not viable as a potential life,                      is it still viable for stem cell research?                                        To Mr. Dorflinger: It seems to me that when you talk about                      adult stem cells being adequate, which is the argument being                      made by some, isn't the availability always going to be in                      question because of the pain involved in extracting stem cells for someone to donate just to an unknown?    To the Other Members of the Second Panel: Are adult stem cells as effective as the stem cells from embryos about which we are speaking today? Do you think there is a lack of availability of adult stem cells because of the pain involved at this point in donating? Is there a possibility that the c ORD  blood could be as effective as the embryonic stem cells? Do you think we should pursue it?     DeWine:    To the Second Panel: I wonder if I can ask the panel if you could give us some idea of how much private funding is currently going into human embryonic research?     I would assume that the amount of money spent on this is going to continue to grow very significantly. Does anyone disagree with that?

An  NIH Guide  notice explaining changes to the Grant Application (PHS           398) and Application for Continuation of a PHS Grant (PHS 2590) will be           forthcoming.           Several features make the update user-friendly, especially the ability to fill           in the form using Adobe Acrobat Reader. The new document also contains links to           policy information and, for the first time, will be used for the Small Business           Innovation Research           and Small Business Technology Transfer           programs.           All the latest human subjects           policy changes are reflected in the new 398, so while you still have to read it           carefully and follow instructions to the letter, all the documentation           requirements are now there. You'll see that the reporting table for population           groups is more detailed, requiring planning for PIs           studying human subjects.           Also take note of a few procedural changes. In the Appendix, applicants may           include only manuscripts that have been  accepted  for publication.

On a more cautious note, achieving           this level will require a $4.2 billion budget hike in FY 2003, a move that may           prove politically tough in light of the meager increases many agencies face           next fiscal year.           Keep in mind that the President's budget is a proposal to Congress, not our           final appropriation.           For FY 2002, NIAID's budget continues to do comparatively well with a gain of           14.2 percent over last year, as proposed by the President. Though the           percentage of funds for research project grants           drops slightly to 66.8 percent under the President's budget scenario, this           level is still more than 10 percent higher than that for NIH as a whole. The           drop is mainly due to $42 million targeted           to bioterrorism research, which swells our research contracting line. Under the           current plan, these monies will be funneled to CDC.

We want to clarify the current           situation related to review and funding.                                                                             What Stem Cell Research Is and Is Not Allowed                    Based on further clarification from the NIH associate director for science           policy, we'd like to explain what you can and cannot do if you are considering           or conducting stem cell research. To recap, in August 2000 NIH published           procedures for investigators proposing to use human pluripotent stem cells             ""NIH Guidelines for Research Using Human Pluripotent Stem Cells ."" But           since then, in response to a lawsuit, the U.S. District Court for the District           of Columbia has issued a stay order while the Department of Health and Human           Services reviews the NIH guidelines, changing the rules for the time being.                    For investigators, the key concept to keep in mind is that both the motion and           the NIH guidelines ban activity only for stem cells from pre-implantation           embryos created for fertility purposes through  in vitro  fertilization.           They do not apply to human adult stem cells, embryonic germ cells  derived from           aborted fetal tissue, or research on animal           stem cells. However, there are other limitations to the review of embryonic           germ cells. Here are the key points; also see the definitions below.           Research on the derivation or use of human embryonic stem cells                                 You cannot use NIH funds (either direct or indirect) to derive stem cells from           human embryos.                     NIH cannot peer review applications proposing to use pluripotent stem cells           from human embryos.                     Set up by the NIH guidelines, the Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Review Group will           not meet while the DHHS review is taking place and thus cannot review           documentation showing compliance with the guidelines.                      NIH will not be allowed to fund applications proposing to use human pluripotent            stem cells derived from embryos until at least 30 days after DHHS review is            finished.                                         Research on the derivation or use of human embryonic germ cells                                For studies using human embryonic germ cells, the NIH guidelines apply to their           use, not their derivation.                     NIH may peer review proposals to use embryonic germ cells, but cannot fund them           because the Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Review Group is not meeting.                     NIH can fund work to derive embryonic germ cells because neither the guidelines           nor the lawsuit pertains to the derivation of these cells.                      It is essential that investigators planning to request funds to derive stem            cells from human fetal tissue understand that potential future NIH funding for            research on the use of these cells would likely require submission and review            of compliance documentation as described in the NIH guidelines. Thus, such            investigators should seek technical assistance in developing their            applications.                               Research on adult stem cells                                 NIH can fund research on adult stem cells.                     Research on animal stem cells                                 NIH can fund research deriving and using all forms of animal stem cells.                               Definitions                                         Fetus - the product of conception from the time of implantation to the           expulsion or extraction of a viable fetus.                     Fetal tissue - tissue or cells obtained from a dead human embryo or fetus after           a spontaneous or induced abortion or after a stillbirth.                     Human embryo - any organism not protected as a human subject under  45 CFR Part 46 derived by fertilization, parthenogenesis, cloning, or any other means from           one or more human gametes or diploid cells.                      Human embryonic stem cells - pluripotent cells derived from the inner cell mass            of a blastocyst stage, pre-implantation embryo capable of self-replicating            indefinitely  in vitro .                      Human embryonic germ cells - cells derived from the gonadal ridge of a five- to            nine-week-old fetus. Capable of self-replicating  in vitro , they are           pluripotent in that they can differentiate into somatic cells derived from all           three embryonic germ layers.                      Human adult stem cells - undifferentiated cells found in differentiated fetal            tissue (with the exception of the gonadal ridge), cord blood, and people of all            ages.  In vivo , the adult stem cell can renew itself and become            specialized to yield all the specialized cell types of its tissue of origin.            Recent evidence indicates that under certain conditions some adult stem cells            can differentiate into tissue other than that in which they normally reside.                                                                                                               Victoria Cargill Appointed Acting Director, Office of HIV/AIDS                    NIH recently appointed Victoria A. Cargill, M.D., acting director of the Office           of HIV/AIDS Policy for the DHHS Assistant Secretary for Health. Dr. Cargill           comes from the NIH Office of AIDS, where she directed minority research and           clinical studies. At her previous position as internist and epidemiologist at           Case Western Reserve University and University Hospitals of Cleveland, Dr.           Cargill created Project SAMM -- Stopping AIDS is My Mission -- a           community-based AIDS education program now funded by an NIAID-supported Center           for AIDS Research.

Following our article,  Leave            plenty of time for a renewal application,  in our May 23, 2001 issue,           Dr. John Oaks of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, sent us this question:           Q. Regarding your advice to applicants to apply early for renewals,           how can investigators submit renewal applications early if they do not feel           that they have developed enough data (i.e., completed their Specific Aims) at           the earlier time? This is especially difficult for people with shorter awards           (i.e., three years) who have kept to their proposed timeline.           A. This raises a good question we'd like to clarify. Though for shorter awards           or for work progressing more slowly you may not be ready to apply early, in           general it's a good strategy. Send in your application one or more review           cycles early only if you have enough data to show progress in the research. If           you do not have enough data, don't do it. No matter when your application           arrives, reviewers expect to see data indicating progress.           Thus, deciding whether to apply early hinges on how comfortable you are with           your data and progress as well as the grant duration (it's easier to apply           early for a longer award), and the complexity of the project. For very complex           projects, e.g., program projects (P01), definitely apply early.                                                                                           Conducting Human Subject Research? Protect Your Research Participants                    If your research collects personal identifiers and sensitive information, you           should apply to NIAID for a certificate of confidentiality to protect your           participants against legal demands. Visit our             Certificates of Confidentiality site  to find out if your research study           is eligible and for application procedures, language samples, and frequently           asked questions.           PIs should consider certificates of confidentiality a matter of procedure for           clinical trials and sensitive research issues such as HIV, AIDS, sexual           preference or behaviors, drugs, alcohol, genetic information, mental health,           illegal conduct, or other information that may be potentially dangerous to a           participant's financial standing, reputation, or employability.

GX039-00-8347460	"NATIONAL STEM CELL RESOURCE  Release Date:  December 23, 1998  RFA:  RR-99-002  P.T.  National Center for Research Resources  Letter of Intent Receipt Date:  February 11,1999 Application Receipt Date:  March 11, 1999  PURPOSE  The purpose of this Request for Applications (RFA) is to solicit applications to establish a National Stem Cell Resource.  The resource will be for deposit, maintenance, preservation and distribution of nonhuman-derived embryonic and other stem cells from a variety of species, as well as for deposit and distribution of related reagents and information in order to make these critical research tools available for biomedical research.  HEALTHY PEOPLE 2000  The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of ""Healthy People 2000,"" a PHS-led national activity for setting priority areas.  This RFA, National Stem Cell Resource, is related to several priority areas, including cancer, heart disease and stroke, diabetes and chronic disability conditions, maternal and infant health, and others.  Potential applicants may obtain a copy of ""Healthy People 2000"" (Full Report:  Stock No. 017-001-00474-0 or Summary Report:  Stock No. 017-001-00473-1) through the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402-9325 (telephone 202-512-1800).  ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS  Applications may be submitted by domestic, for-profit and non-profit organizations, public and private, such as universities, colleges, hospitals, laboratories, units of State and local governments, and eligible agencies of the Federal government. Racial/ethnic minority individuals, women, and persons with disabilities are encouraged to apply as Principal Investigators.  MECHANISM OF SUPPORT  This RFA will use the National Institutes of Health (NIH) animal model and animal and biological material resource grant (P40) mechanism.  Responsibility for the planning, direction, and execution of the proposed project will be solely that of the applicant.  The total project period for an application submitted in response to this RFA may not exceed 5 years.  The anticipated award date is December 1, 1999.  Because the nature and scope of the research proposed in response to this RFA may vary, it is anticipated that the size of an award will vary also.  This RFA is one-time solicitation.  Future unsolicited competing continuation applications will compete with all investigator-initiated applications and be reviewed according to the customary peer review procedures.  FUNDS AVAILABLE  Approximately $700,000 (including direct and indirect costs) will be available for this initiative in Fiscal Year 2000 and for each subsequent year.  It is anticipated that one award will be made.  Proposed funding levels are subject to change due to budgetary, administrative and/or scientific considerations, and are dependent upon the receipt of a sufficient number of applications of high scientific merit.  The award of grants pursuant to this RFA is contingent upon the availability of funds for this purpose.  RESEARCH OBJECTIVES  Background  Embryonic stem cells and other stem cell precursors for differentiated tissues are critical models for fundamental understanding of biological and disease processes.  Embryonic stem cell research is important to provide the tools for studies of basic mechanisms of development and function, in functional genomics, and in production of transgenic animals.  The ability to control differentiation and sort differentiated cells from undifferentiated, and possibly tumorigenic precursor stem cells, holds great potential for therapeutics, particularly involving tissue replacement.  Many laboratories are now engaged in research using mouse embryonic stem cells and lineage-specific precursors derived from embryonic stem cells.  In addition, embryonic stem cells are being isolated and developed in such widely used and important model systems as nonhuman primate, zebrafish and chicken.  As stem cells are isolated from different species, and stem cell precursors for differentiated cell types are characterized and isolated, it will be critical that these resources are not lost, but are made available from a centralized source for use in studies of biology, disease, and therapies.  To ensure that invaluable stem cells are available to the research community, a National Stem Cell Resource will collect, maintain, preserve and distribute nonhuman embryonic, transgenic and lineage-specific stem cells from a variety of species.  In addition, the Resource will be a focal point for exchange of reagents directly related to the characterization of the stem cells on deposit (specific antibodies or nucleic acid probes, for example).    Other Features of the Resource   Plans for the National Stem Cell Resource must incorporate features that will enable the resource to acquire, preserve, maintain, and distribute stem cells and directly related reagents for the biomedical research community.  An Advisory Committee must be established to advise on policy for acquisition, distribution, de-accessioning and general functions of the resource.    Plans must include a database component to collect and distribute information about the Resource to the research community; this information component must be available through the World Wide Web and allow researchers to determine what resources are available and how to obtain them.  Furthermore, this component should be designed as a critical focal point for information exchange for research using the cells and reagents in the Resource.  Because the Resource is expected to collect and distribute cells from a variety of nonhuman animal models, plans to accommodate the specific needs for growth, preservation, expansion, and distribution of stocks from these various sources will be an important part of the project.  The application for this Resource must also put forward a clear plan for cost recovery from investigators acquiring materials from the Resource, and clear plans for how that program income will be used.  Furthermore, the application should demonstrate institutional support for this resource, including, at a minimum, a letter from the institutional official with authority for the space and time of the Principal Investigator.  SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS  A requirement under the P40 mechanism is that research related to improvement of the Resource must be proposed.  Examples of such research would be investigations into optimal methods for cryopreservation of cell stocks, or investigations into reagents to characterize and identify stem cells of various types.  These are examples, only, and are not intended to be limiting.  The Principal Investigator for the Resource is expected to attend the annual meeting of resource directors for Comparative Medicine area, NCRR, resources, to be held at one of the resources.  The application should include a budget item for this expense, calculated on a two-day meeting.  The application must include a plan to track users and the general types of projects the Resource materials are used in on a calendar-year basis.  Users include both investigators depositing materials and investigators ordering the materials.  These results must be reported to the Program Director, NCRR, on a yearly basis to show activity of the Resource with respect to materials deposited and who has used the materials from the resource.  LETTER OF INTENT  Prospective applicants are asked to submit, by February 11, 1999, a letter of intent that includes a descriptive title of the proposed project, the name, address, and telephone number of the Principal Investigator, the identities of other key personnel and participating institutions, and the number and title of this RFA.  Although a letter of intent is not required, is not binding, and does not enter into the review of a subsequent application, the information that it contains allows NCRR staff to estimate the potential review workload and avoid conflict of interest in the review.  The letter of intent is to be sent to:  Jill L. Carrington, Ph.D. Comparative Medicine National Center for Research Resources 6705 Rockledge Drive, Room 6164 Bethesda, MD  20892 Telephone:  (301) 435-0744 FAX:  (301) 480-3819 Email:  jillc@ncrr.nih.gov   APPLICATION PROCEDURES  The research grant application form PHS 398 (rev. 4/98) is to be used in applying for this grant.  These forms are available at most institutional offices of sponsored research; from the Division of Extramural Outreach and Information Resources, NIH, 6701 Rockledge Drive, MSC 7910, Bethesda, MD 20892-7910, telephone (301) 435-0714, Email  grantsinfo@nih.gov ; and from the program administrator listed under INQUIRIES.  The RFA label available in the PHS 398 application form must be affixed to the bottom of the face page of the application.  Failure to use this label could result in delayed processing of the application such that it may not reach the review committee in time for review.  In addition, the RFA title and number must be typed on line 2 of the face page of the application form and the YES box must be marked.  Submit a signed, typewritten original of the application, including the Checklist, and three signed, photocopies, in one package to:  CENTER FOR SCIENTIFIC REVIEW NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH 6701 ROCKLEDGE DRIVE, SUITE 1040, MSC 7710 BETHESDA, MD  20892-7710 BETHESDA, MD  20817 (for express/courier service)  At the time of submission, two additional copies of the application must be sent to:  Jill L. Carrington, Ph.D. Comparative Medicine National Center for Research Resources 6705 Rockledge Drive, Room 6164, MSC 7965 Bethesda, MD  20892 Bethesda, MD  20817 (for express/courier service)  Applications must be received by March 11, 1999.  If an application is received after that date, it will be returned to the applicant without review. CSR will not accept any application in response to this RFA that is essentially the same as one currently pending initial review, unless the applicant withdraws the pending application.  The CSR will not accept any application that is essentially the same as one already reviewed.  This does not preclude the submission of substantial revisions of applications already reviewed, but such applications must include an introduction addressing the previous critique.  REVIEW CONSIDERATIONS  Upon receipt, applications will be reviewed for completeness by CSR and responsiveness by the NCRR.  Incomplete and/or non-responsive applications will be returned to the applicant without further consideration.  Applications that are complete and responsive will be evaluated for scientific and technical merit by an appropriate peer review group convened in accordance with NIH peer review procedures.  As part of the initial merit review, all applications will receive a written critique and may undergo a process in which only those applications deemed to have the highest scientific merit, generally the top one half of applications under review, will be discussed, assigned a priority score, and receive a second level review by the National Advisory Research Resources Council, NCRR.   Review Criteria  The goals of NIH-supported research are to advance our understanding of biological systems, improve the control of disease, and enhance health.  In the written comments reviewers will be asked to discuss the following aspects of the application in order to judge the likelihood that the proposed research will have a substantial impact on the pursuit of these goals.  Each of these criteria will be addressed and considered in assigning the overall score, weighting them as appropriate for each application.  Note that the application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact and thus deserve a high priority score.  For example, an investigator may propose to carry out important work that by its nature is not innovative but is essential to move a field forward.  o  Significance.  What will be the impact of this resource on biomedical research?  o  Approach.  Is the resource designed to effectively provide a service to the research community?  Will the database support research by providing important information about the Resource materials to the research community?  o  Innovation.  Are the design of the resource and the method of providing service innovative?  o  Need.  Is there a demonstrated need for the resource in the biomedical research community?  o  Investigator.  Is the investigator appropriately trained and well suited to carry out this work?  Is the work proposed appropriate to the experience level of the principal investigator and other researchers?  o  Research Component.  Is the research to be performed of value to the resource?  Is the research innovative and significant?  o  Environment.  Does the environment contribute to the probability of success of the resource?  Is there evidence of institutional support for the resource?  The initial review group will also examine the provisions for the protection of human and animal subjects and the safety of the research environment, as well as the appropriateness of the budget.

RESEARCH OBJECTIVES  Background  Long-term alcohol abuse is known to cause pathologies in a number of the  body's organ systems. Those disorders most commonly associated with chronic  alcohol consumption include alcoholic liver disease (ALD), pancreatitis,  cardiovascular disease, endocrine dysfunction, osteoporosis, cancer, and  immune dysfunction.  Heavy alcohol intake is also associated with structural  and functional changes in the adult and developing central nervous system,  manifested by brain atrophy and neurodegeneration, as well as  neurodevelopmental disorders such as fetal alcohol syndrome.  Brain regions  most severely affected by chronic alcohol consumption, as well as by prenatal  alcohol exposure, are the frontal cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, and the  hypothalamus.      Embryonic and adult stem cells offer powerful tools to elucidate mechanisms  underlying normal biological functions and the mechanisms by which alcohol  disrupts normal functions in susceptible organs.  They may also prove valuable  in developing therapeutic approaches for treating alcohol-induced  physiological impairments and overt organ damage.  Although rapid progress has  been made in characterizing embryonic and adult stem cells and their capacity  to proliferate, migrate, differentiate, and integrate into multiple tissues,  very little is known about how alcohol affects these processes. For example,  does alcohol exposure alter normal stem cell fate determination and  plasticity?  Does chronic alcohol consumption alter the number and  availability of autologous stem cells and their biological properties?  Does  alcohol exposure alter the biochemical environment of tissues, thus  interfering with the capacity of stem cells to establish contact,  differentiate and function in target tissues?  Does alcohol interfere with the  capacity of endogenous stem cells to limit or repair alcohol-induced pathology  in various tissues? These are some of the fundamental research questions that  need to be addressed.    It now appears that cell fate changes are a natural property of stem cells and  may be involved in tissue homeostasis and repair of tissue damage.  For  example, adult neural stem cells have the capacity to express a variety of  neuronal cell types, and hematopoietic stem cells have been shown to form  functional liver hepatocytes. Evidence suggests that circulating stem cells  home to niches within an organ, where signaling factors stimulate  differentiation into the desired cell types.  The effects of different  patterns of chronic alcohol exposure on the niche environments essential for  engrafting and differentiation of stem cells needs further investigation.  Although more research is needed to improve stem cell isolation techniques,  use of autologous adult stem cells for tissue-replacement therapy could  represent a major advantage by avoiding immune rejection.  However, it is  unclear whether chronic alcohol consumption would also destroy the host's  natural supply of stem cells and/or alter their capacity to respond to  cellular signals in target tissues. In liver regeneration, both oval stem  cells and hematopoietic stem cells are key players; thus, the capacity of  these cells to regenerate the architecture necessary to support liver function  after chronic alcohol exposure also needs to be studied.  Stem cells have particularly exciting potential in combination with genetic  engineering strategies and gene therapy.  Stem cells stably expressing  transgenes may be used to deliver soluble molecules to specific sites by  migrating and differentiating into the target tissue. In addition to tissue  repair, stem cells have the potential to control progression of disease.  For  example, engrafted stem cells engineered to overexpress proteins in specific  brain regions potentially could modulate host levels of critical  neurotransmitters involved in pathological alcohol consumption.  Furthermore,  transgene expression in a patient's own somatic stem cells should prevent the  adverse immune responses often seen with adenovirus and other gene therapy  vectors. Combination therapy is likely to be most useful for certain alcohol- related disorders where delivery of genes will compensate for impaired  enzymes, peptides, and neurotransmitters.  Research Objectives and Scope  This RFA solicits research on the application of stem cells to alcohol- relevant problems.  The use of stem cells derived from any approved source,  including human embryonic stem cell lines listed in the NIH Human Embryonic  Stem Cell Registry (see REQUIRED FEDERAL CITATIONS below for additional  information) is encouraged.  Although some types of clinical research would be  appropriate for this RFA, clinical trials are outside the scope of the RFA.  Examples of research that would be responsive to this RFA are identified  below.  These research areas are not intended to be inclusive or restrictive.  o  Studies on the effects of alcohol on in vivo and ex vivo stem cell  viability and differentiation into specific cell types including neurons,glial  cells, liver cells, pancreatic cells, cardiomyocytes, etc.  o  Biochemical and physiological studies examining the capacity of stem cells  to integrate with host tissues and to restore impaired tissue function under  conditions of chronic alcohol exposure.  o  Studies to determine the effects of alcohol dose and exposure pattern on  the long-term fate of transplanted stem cell-derived populations in animal  models of alcohol-induced tissue injury including brain and liver damage.  o  Studies to assess the functional integrity of autologous stem cells in   animal models of prenatal, adolescent, and adult alcohol exposure.  o  Studies to determine the effectiveness of stem cells engineered to  overexpress candidate genes/proteins to offset/reverse neural maladaptive  responses to alcohol, such as tolerance, dependence, craving, and withdrawal.  o  Development, in animal models, of stem cell transplantation and combination  stem cell/gene therapy approaches to protect against or prevent alcohol- induced tissue damage, or hasten repair of integral processes that are  sensitive to alcohol.  MECHANISM OF SUPPORT  This RFA will use NIH research project grant (R01), NIAAA  exploratory/developmental grant (R21), and NIAAA small grant (R03) award  mechanisms. As an applicant you will be solely responsible for planning,  directing, and executing the proposed project. Exploratory/developmental  grants (R21) are limited to three years for up to $100,000 per year for direct  costs.  (See PA-99-131, ""NIAAA Exploratory/Developmental Grant Program,""   http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-99-131.html , for a complete  description of the R21 mechanism.) Small grants (R03) are limited to two years  for up to $50,000 per year for direct costs.  (See PAR-99-098, ""NIAAA Small  Grant Program,""  http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-99-098.html ,  for a complete description of the R03 mechanism.) This RFA is a one-time  solicitation.  Future unsolicited, competing applications based on this  project will compete with all investigator-initiated applications and will be  reviewed according to the customary peer review procedures.   This RFA uses just-in-time concepts.  It also uses the modular as well as the  non-modular budgeting formats (see   http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/modular/modular.htm ).  Specifically, if  you are submitting an application with direct costs in each year of $300,000  or less, use the modular format.  Otherwise follow the instructions for non- modular research grant applications.  FUNDS AVAILABLE   The NIAAA intends to commit approximately $2 million in FY 2002 to fund six to  eight new and/or competitive continuation grants in response to this RFA. An  applicant may request a project period of up to five years and a budget for  direct costs of up to $300,000 per year, using the R01 support mechanism.  An  applicant may request a shorter project period and lesser amount of support,  using the R03 or R21 mechanism, as described above.  Because the nature and  scope of the proposed research will vary from application to application, it  is anticipated that the size and duration of each award will also vary.  Although the financial plans of the NIAAA provide support for this program,  awards pursuant to this RFA are contingent upon the availability of funds and  the receipt of a sufficient number of meritorious applications. At this time,  it is not known if this RFA will be reissued.  ELIGIBLE INSTITUTIONS   You may submit an application if your institution has any of the following  characteristics:    o For-profit or non-profit organizations  o Public or private institutions, such as universities, colleges, hospitals,  and laboratories  o Units of State and local governments o Eligible agencies of the Federal government   o Domestic or foreign (only domestic organizations are eligible for the R03  mechanism)   INDIVIDUALS ELIGIBLE TO BECOME PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS     Any individual with the skills, knowledge, and resources necessary to carry  out the proposed research is invited to work with their institution to develop  an application for support.  Individuals from underrepresented racial and  ethnic groups as well as individuals with disabilities are always encouraged  to apply for NIH programs.

If an application is received  after that date, it will be returned to the applicant without review.   The Center for Scientific Review (CSR) will not accept any application in  response to this RFA that is essentially the same as one currently pending  initial review, unless the applicant withdraws the pending application.  The  CSR will not accept any application that is essentially the same as one  already reviewed. This does not preclude the submission of substantial  revisions of applications already reviewed, but such applications must include  an Introduction addressing the previous critique.  PEER REVIEW PROCESS     Upon receipt, applications will be reviewed for completeness by the CSR and  responsiveness by the NIAAA. Incomplete applications will be returned to the  applicant without further consideration.  And, if the application is not  responsive to the RFA, CSR staff may contact the applicant to determine  whether to return the application to the applicant or submit it for review in  competition with unsolicited applications at the next appropriate NIH review  cycle.  Applications that are complete and responsive to the RFA will be evaluated for  scientific and technical merit by an appropriate peer review group convened by  the NIAAA in accordance with the review criteria stated below.  As part of the  initial merit review, all applications will:  o Receive a written critique o Undergo a process in which only those applications deemed to have the  highest scientific merit, generally the top half of the applications under  review, will be discussed and assigned a priority score o Receive a second level review by the NIAAA National Advisory Council on  Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.    REVIEW CRITERIA  The goals of NIH-supported research are to advance our understanding of  biological systems, improve the control of disease, and enhance health.  In  the written comments, reviewers will be asked to discuss the following aspects  of your application in order to judge the likelihood that the proposed  research will have a substantial impact on the pursuit of these goals:   o Significance  o Approach  o Innovation o Investigator o Environment    The scientific review group will address and consider each of these criteria  in assigning your application's overall score, weighting them as appropriate  for each application.  Your application does not need to be strong in all  categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact and thus  deserve a high priority score.  For example, you may propose to carry out  important work that by its nature is not innovative but is essential to move a  field forward.  (1) SIGNIFICANCE:  Does your study address an important problem? If the aims  of your application are achieved, how do they advance scientific knowledge?   What will be the effect of these studies on the concepts or methods that drive  this field?  (2) APPROACH:  Are the conceptual framework, design, methods, and analyses  adequately developed, well integrated, and appropriate to the aims of the  project?  Do you acknowledge potential problem areas and consider alternative  tactics?  (3) INNOVATION:  Does your project employ novel concepts, approaches or  methods? Are the aims original and innovative?  Does your project challenge  existing paradigms or develop new methodologies or technologies?  (4) INVESTIGATOR: Are you appropriately trained and well suited to carry out  this work?  Is the work proposed appropriate to your experience level as the  principal investigator and to that of other researchers (if any)?  (5) ENVIRONMENT:  Does the scientific environment in which your work will be  done contribute to the probability of success?  Do the proposed experiments  take advantage of unique features of the scientific environment or employ  useful collaborative arrangements?  Is there evidence of institutional  support?  ADDITIONAL REVIEW CRITERIA: In addition to the above criteria, your  application will also be reviewed with respect to the following:  o PROTECTIONS:  The adequacy of the proposed protection for humans, animals,  or the environment, to the extent they may be adversely affected by the  project proposed in the application.  o INCLUSION:  The adequacy of plans to include subjects from both genders, all  racial and ethnic groups (and subgroups), and children as appropriate for the  scientific goals of the research.  Plans for the recruitment and retention of  subjects will also be evaluated. (See Inclusion Criteria included in the  section on Federal Citations, below)  o BUDGET:  The reasonableness of the proposed budget and the requested period  of support in relation to the proposed research.  o OTHER REVIEW CRITERIA:  Additional considerations pertinent to the review of  Exploratory/Developmental Grant (R21) and Small Grant (R03) applications  include: 1) Pilot/feasibility studies contain little or no preliminary data.   Review should focus on whether the rationale for the study is well developed  and whether the proposed research is likely to generate data that will lead to  a regular research project grant or full-scale clinical trial.  Adequate  justification for the work may be provided through literature citations, data  from other sources, or investigator-generated data.  2) Because the research  plan of R03 applications is limited to ten pages, these applications may not  have the level of detail or extensive discussion normally found in an R01  application.  Review emphasis should be placed on conceptual framework and  general approach to the problem, with less emphasis on methodological details.  RECEIPT AND REVIEW SCHEDULE  Letter of Intent Receipt Date:  April 15, 2002  Application Receipt Date:  May 15, 2002 Peer Review Date:  July-August 2002 Council Review:  September 2002 Earliest Anticipated Start Date:  September 28, 2002  AWARD CRITERIA  Award criteria that will be used to make award decisions include:  o  scientific merit (as determined by peer review) o  availability of funds o  programmatic priorities.  REQUIRED FEDERAL CITATIONS   INCLUSION OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES IN CLINICAL RESEARCH: It is the policy of  the NIH that women and members of minority groups and their sub-populations  must be included in all NIH-supported clinical research projects unless a  clear and compelling justification is provided indicating that inclusion is  inappropriate with respect to the health of the subjects or the purpose of the  research. This policy results from the NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 (Section  492B of Public Law 103-43).  All investigators proposing clinical research should read the AMENDMENT ""NIH  Guidelines for Inclusion of Women and Minorities as Subjects in Clinical  Research - Amended, October, 2001,"" published in the NIH Guide for Grants and  Contracts on October 9, 2001 ( http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice- files/NOT-OD-02-001.html ); a complete copy of the updated Guidelines are  available at   http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/women_min/guidelines_amended_10_2001.htm  .   The amended policy incorporates: the use of an NIH definition of clinical  research; updated racial and ethnic categories in compliance with the new OMB  standards; clarification of language governing NIH-defined Phase III clinical  trials consistent with the new PHS Form 398; and updated roles and  responsibilities of NIH staff and the extramural community.  The policy  continues to require for all NIH-defined Phase III clinical trials that: a)  all applications or proposals and/or protocols must provide a description of  plans to conduct analyses, as appropriate, to address differences by  sex/gender and/or racial/ethnic groups, including subgroups if applicable;  and b) investigators must report annual accrual and progress in conducting  analyses, as appropriate, by sex/gender and/or racial/ethnic group  differences.  INCLUSION OF CHILDREN AS PARTICIPANTS IN RESEARCH INVOLVING HUMAN SUBJECTS:   The NIH maintains a policy that children (i.e., individuals under the age of  21) must be included in all human subjects research, conducted or supported by  the NIH, unless there are scientific and ethical reasons not to include them.  This policy applies to all initial (Type 1) applications submitted for receipt  dates after October 1, 1998.

JOHN GEARHART                  CHAIRMAN KASS:  Well,                I would like to ask Dean Clancy to officially open the meeting,                please.                 MR. CLANCY:  This meeting                is lawful.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Thank                you very much. Apologies to our guests and to members of the audience                for the late start. Council Members had to take an oath of office,                which should have been administered to us before our very first                meeting.                That has been done and we are now legal in every respect. Welcome                to this, the third meeting of the President's Council on Bioethics.                We are expecting colleagues Krauthammer and George today, and Stephen                Carter will not be with us, and Bill May will join us tomorrow.                I would like to introduce a new member of our staff, Judy Crawford,                who comes to us as the office manager. Judy, would you please rise                so that the council members can know you. We are very delighted                to have Judy with us.                We reconvene as the debate about the cloning legislation heats                up around us, a debate that we did not begin and do not control.                We are in the midst of our own careful and thorough investigation                of the ethical, social, and policy implications of human cloning                seen in its larger scientific, medical, and human contexts.                We have chosen to proceed in a deliberate, collegial, wisdom-seeking,                mode in keeping with our charge to inquire fundamentally into the                human and moral significance of developments in biomedical science                and technology.                The most challenging aspect of our inquiry to date has been the                moral significance of cloning for biomedical research, a topic discussed                for the first time at our last meeting, and to which we return later                today in the hope of making progress and clarifying the contested                moral issues at stake, and in articulating the best possible moral                arguments for and again the conduct of such research.                On behalf of the council, I would like to thank the staff for                its superb work in advancing our inquiry, and on behalf of the staff,                I would like to thank council members for their thoughtful comments                and responses. We are in your debt.                The agenda for this meeting brings us into some new, but not altogether                unrelated, areas of inquiry. Stem cell research, a topic of our                first three sessions today.                Second, the question of therapy versus enhancement as a goal for                the uses of biomedical technology, and third, possible regulation                of biomedical technology. These topics have been selected with a                view to initiating one of our obligatory future projects, stem cell                research, and exploring two possible future projects for the council                for the rest of our two year charter.                As everyone knows, in his speech announcing the creation of this                council, President Bush charged us with monitoring stem cell research,                embryonic and non-embryonic, human and animal, in order to assess                their progress in gaining knowledge and beneficial therapies, and                in due course to offer guidelines and regulations for the conduct                of such research.                As I indicated at our first meeting, we have begun to collect                data that will enable us to describe, assess, and compare the successes                achieved with both embryonic and non-embryonic stem cells.                As we are doing this, however, it seemed desirable for council                members to learn firsthand, and from some leading researchers in                the field, about the scientific and therapeutic promise of stem                cell research present and projected; embryonic and non-embryonic.                And it also seemed desirable to explicitly begin a disciplined                conversation about the ethical issues of embryonic stem cell research.                Our first three sessions today constitute the official thematic                beginning of our project on stem cell research.                We have of course already been deliberating about some of these                matters in our discussion of human cloning for biomedical research,                a topic that first arose for us as a crucial side question of the                larger subject of human cloning to produce children, what to think                about it, and what to do about it.                This is therefore a useful juncture at which to indicate the distinction,                as well as the connection between these two topics. Many members                of the public, including many of our elected officials who are in                the process of making policy in this area, as well as some members                of the media, have conflated the issue of stem cell research and                the issue of cloning.                The issue of cloning comes first to attention as an issue of the                ethics of producing children by novel technological means, and the                issue of cloning, insofar as it has captured the public attention,                is primarily about what to think about the asexual production of                new human beings who are going to be genetically virtually identical                to already existing individuals.                And the issues there are in the first instance the questions of                the ethics of, crudely speaking, baby-making. That is quite different                from the question of the ethics of embryo research.                Virtually all embryonic stem cell research now under way, both                in humans and in animals, involve cell lines developed from embryos,                whether inner-cell mass, or from the gonadal ridge of donated fetuses,                that originate from the sexual union of egg and sperm, and very                often in the human case using excess embryos produced in in vitro                clinics and in all cases from material not produced for the sake                of the research. The question of Federal funding of this research                that President Bush resolved last summer, this was the question                that was resolved last summer, and the research in this area proceeds                not only with Federal funding under the guidelines that the President                established, but also in the private sector.                The two topics, however, intersect and overlap because cloning                to produce children necessarily proceeds through the production                of cloned blastocysts, which offer special opportunities for embryonic                stem cell and other research.                Some proposals to curtail cloning for providing children would                do so by curtailing the initial steps, thus interfering with the                possibility of using cloned embryos for research.                And this has given rise to arguments for and against cloning for                biomedical research proper. This is where the intersection can be                made explicit, and that is where we now are.                In order for us in the other project to continue to make progress,                and therefore in order to see what value added might derive from                working with embryonic stem cells extracted from cloned blastocysts,                one needs to know something about what it would be added to. That                is to say, to work on ordinary embryonic stem cells. And in order                to see more clearly what the ethical issues are that might come                from the question of producing cloned embryos for biomedical research,                it would be helpful for us to know something of the ethical issues                of experimenting on human embryos of sexual and not clonal origin,                and of using extra embryonic -- using the extra embryos or fetuses                not created for experimental purposes so we can see what different                questions arise here.                To help us with our scientific and medical education, we are very                fortunate to have as our guests and presenters this morning two                distinguished researchers, one who is a pioneer in isolating and                characterizing human pluripotent stem cells, Dr. John Gearhart,                the C. Michael Armstrong Professor of Medicine at Johns Hopkins                University, and the Director of the Institute of Cell Engineering.                And second a person who is a pioneer in work with human multipotent                adult progenitor cells, Dr. Catherine Verfaillie, a Professor of                Medicine and Director of the Stem Cell Institute at the University                of Minnesota.                Each of our guests in separate sessions will make formal presentations,                roughly 30 to 35 minutes, after which time we will have a chance                to ask questions about the scientific, technological, and clinical                aspects of these areas of research.                This is our chance to learn about the wonderful prospects of these                investigations. However, let me say that because our guests are                here not only as scientists, but also as our neighbors, in a morally                aspiring human community, we will perhaps try toward the end to                elicit from them their own thoughts about the ethical issues in                their own work.                But the purpose of these sessions is primarily our own education                about the scientific and medical aspects. With that I would like                to turn the meeting over to Dr. Gearhart, and to thank him very                much for joining us this morning.                 DR. GEARHART:  I am                certainly grateful to have this opportunity to share with the President's                Council my knowledge in a very tiny area of biomedical research,                and it is currently quite tiny, but if you read and believe the                press, it is obviously going to expand enormously.                Much has been written and much has been said about stem cells,                and it seems every morning in the paper there is some article relating                to it and continuing the debate.                In the scientific literature, we see virtually in every issue                of leading journals a paper dealing with stem cells. An age old                dream I think of mankind or humankind has been to replace damaged                or diseased tissues with functional ones, new ones, and wouldn't                it be nice to be able if you had a damaged liver or kidney to take                one off the shelf if you know what I mean.                And this dream I think is going to become a reality, and with                some of the advances in biomedical research, and one of the ones                that we are going to talk about today, I think this will provide                the starting material that will lead to this reality.                The concept behind cell-based therapies -- and this is what we                are talking about here initially -- is a very simple one, and I                think that that makes it attractive, and it makes it understandable                to the public. And that is that if there is a tissue deficit, why                not just replace the tissue. Now, it is easy to say, and it will                be difficult to do, but the concept is an easy one.                Cell-based therapy has also been called regenerative medicine,                and there are many rubrics for this today. The power of this technology                is derived from information inherent in our genes and in our cells,                and the recent isolation of these embryonic type stem cells I believe                is going to provide the enabling material as I mentioned for this                to go forward.                Stem cells are going to serve several purposes, the first of which                could be as a direct source in transplantation therapies. That means                specific cell types will be grown in culture, such as heart muscles,                nerves, et cetera, and transplanted to patients for function.                Or they will be genetically engineered to do exactly what we want                them to do and transplant it to patients; or they will be used by                our tissue engineer colleagues to construct tissues and parts of                organs, which would then be transplanted to patients.                Stem cells will also be used as a source of information, basic                science, and this is really where we are at currently. That could                be applied to a patient's own cells, such that we could remove cells                from a patient and alter them in some fashion to produce the cell                types that we want, and then transplant them.                Or ultimately I feel that what we are going to be able to do from                the information that we are going to learn on stem cells is that                we will be able to work in vitro with patient cells to get them                to perform in a manner that we want without taking them out and                putting them in culture.This, I believe, is the future. The scientific                challenges to attain our goal of producing safe and effective therapies                are formidable. It will take the efforts of many scientists and                clinicians, in a variety of disciplines, to bring this endeavor                to fruition.                Now, the stem cells that I am going to talk about today interestingly                really do not exist naturally. That is, they don't exist in embryos                or fetuses. They are artifacts of culture.                But we take tissues from embryos and fetuses and they undergo                a type of transformation in culture to provide these stem cells.                And this source obviously brings with it a number of ethical concerns.                I, as an investigator, who has had to cross this bridge 9 or 10                years ago when I began this work, believe that the ethical issues                are manageable.                I also believe that it is the responsibility of scientists to                candidly and in a timely fashion present the social implications                of their research and its technological applications; to provide                assessments on reliability, and to participate in the establishment                of ethical guidelines and to work within those guidelines.                For the past 9 years at Hopkins, we have been in compliance with                all institutional, State, and Federal policies in dealing with the                cells that we work with.                It has not been easy because the landscape has changed in 9 years,                and every year there have been new concerns raised, and new issues                that had to be addressed, and I think we are keeping up with it.I                should tell you also up to this point in time that no Federal monies,                no public monies, have gone into our research effort. Now that Federal                policy has changed, we do have applications pending before the National                Institutes of Health.                I also want to point out something that may be surprising to most                of you; that in our laboratory at Hopkins that we just are not concentrating                on an embryonic or fetal source of stem cells.                We are studying stem cells from adult sources, umbilical sources,                et cetera. This is the only way that we feel that you can have a                scientific advance, and that is to be able to compare and contrast                the different sources of stem cells.                So side by side, in the laboratory, in experimental paradigms,                we are using stem cells from a variety of sources, and this is what                I think has to happen to assess which of these sources are going                to prove the most effective for any specific type of therapy.                Another thing that I want to point out to you is that the work                on the human cells, I do have the questions that came from your                committee in- hand, and many of them are asking what is the status                of certain types of work.                I just want to point out that this work has been ongoing for a                period of 2-to-2-1/2 years, and although we feel that we are making                progress, we certainly are going to come up with, well, I don't                know as answer to some of your questions.                I just want to let you know that we don't have all the answers                to this, and we are very, very early in all studies of stem cells,                be they from the embryonic or adult sources.                I would tell you though that to date the work in our lab and others                on embryonic stem cells and the results of that work is certainly                consistent with the idea that this is going to prove to be a productive                line of research.                Well, it is interesting that very few people know you and what                you are about, and I think it is important to point out something.                My interests, or my research interests for decades, have been in                the area of developmental genetics and development biology.                I have been labeled as a human embryologist, and my interests                certainly are in the area of how an embryo goes from a single cell                to a multi-cellular integrated organism.                And this is where our research has been in the past 25 years,                and I have carried this a step further. We are very interested in                congenital malformations and birth defects.                I have had a program project through the NIH for many, many years                dealing with Down's Syndrome, and we are very interested in trying                to determine what the mechanism is that underlies many of the unusual                anatomical neurobiological consequences of this extra chromosome                in human beings.                And this is essentially how I got into this work. We wanted to                have in the laboratory a source of cells in addition that we could                study at the site or level of the impact of these extra genes.                And this obviously is a goal, along with a number of other genetic-based                diseases and malformations in the human being. So this is what led                to our getting into this area of research.                Now, I have to say up front that we are now required by our university                to reveal where our monies come from, and these are the sponsors                of our research, and there is one sitting in the middle there that                I also have to show to you that I am conflicted.                And which means that to the sponsorship of this private company,                we have received money for research, for which licenses have been                negotiated between Hopkins and Geron, and that I am a stockholder,                albeit a few hundred shares of something that is trading now at                -- and I hate to think about it.                It is not in our possession as you know. It is held in escrow.                But nonetheless we do have this arrangement with this company. So                I would tell you that this is not the motivation, this connection.                Without the sponsorship of this research, this work would not                have gone forward over the past seven years. We are not in this                business as individuals to make money.                Well, having said all of that, let's talk about stem cells. The                first thing I want to give you is a little bit of a primer on stem                cells so that we are talking the same language, and you have an                understanding of where I am coming from.                Well, what is a stem cell, and basically a stem cell is a cell                that has two properties. It has a property in that it has a capacity                for self-renewal, which means that the cell can divide and produce                more cells like itself.                And it has some type or some degree of differentiative capability,                which means that it can go on to specialize into a single cell type,                or it can specialize into a number of cell types.                And in a developmental sense, if we over time at what our research                has told us about stem cells, they fall into a number of categories.                Early on in developmental practices, we have a cell that is totipotent.                It can renew, and it can form virtually every cell type that is                present in an embryo. As development proceeds, its developmental                capabilities become more restricted until we get into different                lineages, specific lineages, and its ability to divide also becomes                more diminished over time.                This has been the classical picture of development. Now, what                has happened over the past couple of years interestingly is we find                that these restrictions in developmental capability are much more                plastic than we had thought.                So out here where we thought that these cells are highly restricted,                perhaps they aren't so, and when you remove them from the organism                and culture them, they have capabilities of forming other cell types,                and Catherine will be talking to you about some of these issues.                Well, we are going to be talking about embryonic stem cells, and                what is it about them. Well, interestingly, we know that these cells                are capable of producing virtually every cell type that is present                in an embryo, a fetus, or an adult, except one.                And that one happens to be the trophoblast cell, which I will                tell you about in a moment. So we consider these cells to be totipotent.                They don't have the ability in and of themselves to form an embryo                or an individual, okay? They have this other property of self-renewal,                which basically with respect to embryonic stem cells means that                they will expand indefinitely, and grow indefinitely, and this is                a very important property.                It means that within the laboratory from a very few cells that                you could grow a roomful of these cells very easily. But there is                an issue here that we don't know much about, and that is obviously                there is a finite probability that at every cell division that a                genetic mutation will appear.                And there was a paper published recently that indicated that indeed                this is the case, and the types of mutation, although the mutation                frequency and the mutation rate is greatly -- by several folds lower                than in normal somatic cells, mutations do occur in these cells,                and they are of the nature of making these cells susceptible to                formation of tumors.                The uniparental disomy appears and it is a condition about which                we should be concerned. And up until this point, in the mouse where                these cells were first isolated, and for that work the person who                did this, Martin Evans, was awarded the Lasker Award last year.                We know that these lines forming whole animals, which is what                they have been used for up to this point, in genetic mutations is                getting genetically defined strains of mice.                That there comes a time when these cells are no longer productive                in doing this and that they lose some quality. So we know that there                is going to be a half-life to the use of these cell lines for whatever                reason.                I just want to point that out, although they do have this replicative                ability. Well, where do these totipotent cells come from, and two                major sources. The first is this pre-implantation stage which we                are going to talk about, and the second are from specific cells                within the fetus.                I also have on this slide, and by the way, I have given you two                handouts. One is the slides in the presentation, and another in                a fairly recent Nature review of this material, that you can refer                to.                I want to point out another source of a cell that is very similar                to these two that we have isolated, and that comes as a stem cell                for a specific type of tumor called in the old days teratocarcinoma,                and now called mixed cell carcinomas.                These stem cells, referred to as embryonal carcinoma cells, were                first isolated back in the 1970s when I worked on this, and we thought                that these would be the answer to finding cells that would produce                a variety of cell types that we could work with within the human.                And I should tell you that at this point in time that there is                a clinical trial going on at the University of Pittsburgh using                embryonal carcinoma cells that have been selected for a neural lineage,                and so that in culture you can derive neural cells and that these                have been placed in the brains of 12 stroke patients.                It is a cell that is very, very similar to the two that I am going                to talk about. Well, the first source that you are aware of comes                from these structures here, which are pre-implantation stage human                embryos, and I am sure you are familiar with this.                And where that structure consists of two groups of cells; this                outer layer called trophectoderm, and an ectopically placed inner                group of cells called the inner-cell mass. It is from this group                of cells here that the embryo proper is derived, and it is connected                ultimately to this outer layer, which develops in the placental                tissue by connecting stock in an umbilical cord.                These cells may number only 15 or 20 in an embryo that may consist                of perhaps several hundred cells. And in work in the mouse, and                subsequently done in humans, first by Jamie Thomson, was that these                cells were isolated, placed in a culture condition, which then permits                their growth and their conversion into an embryonic stem cell.                This process of conversion can be highly inefficient, meaning                that you would need a large number of blastocyst and inner cell                mass cells to derive a few cell lines.                In some people's hands, it can be more efficient, but there is                an issue with that. A second source of cells with the same features                was identified in the early 1990s, first by Peter Donovan at NCI.                And what they were attempting to do were to culture long term                cells that are called primordial germ cells. These are diploid cells                that are present in an early embryo that eventually give rise to                egg and sperm.                And they isolated, and this is superimposed upon a human fetus,                they isolated from the gonads, the gonadal ridges, these large cells,                which at the time of isolation in humans are about 20,000 of them                present in a gonad, and placed them in culture and essentially ended                up with the same type of cell.                This is what a human EG culture looks like, this clustering of                cells and I want to point out that there are cells in the background                here which are the so-called feeder layers.                All of these cell lines are derived on feeder layers, and all                the lines that were approved by Mr. Bush, and all the lines that                we have, are derived on a mouse feeder layer, and this is a point                of contention, meaning that we are concerned now about the fact                of any endogenous viruses being transferred from other animal tissues                into the human cells.                And the FDA must deal with this at this point in time, but we                do not have permission on the use of Federal funds to derive new                lines, avoiding this issue of other animal products.                But they are grown on feeder layers. They are established and                grown on feeder layers of other species. If we compare different                properties of these cell types, and I bring this up -- some of these                are of no value to you immediately, but these are the criteria that                one must use to say whether or not you have a cell line.                It is very important, and of the 80 some lines that are now purported                to be available, I can guarantee you in talking to many investigators                from around the world that only a handful of these are bona fide                cell lines, and/or available to investigators.                Now, this may beg the point and that that may be enough to serve                the purposes in the immediate future. But really the majority, the                vast majority of so-called lines available do not meet the criteria                that are now used to say whether a line is a line.                Now, how do we -- we are very interested then in two things here.                One is the basic science aspect of this, and of course what is driving                all of this is the hope for some type of transplantation therapy.                Let's talk a minute about the basic science. What we have in the                laboratory now are cultures of cells in the plate that can form                any cell type in a human body.                Now, the argument is have we demonstrated that you can get out                of these all 200 and some cell types? No. You only find what you                are looking for.                What we have found though are a large number of cell types that                are present in the human body within these dishes. The problem at                the moment is getting homogenous population of pancreatic islet                cells or blood cells, or muscle cells.                This is the real part of the scientific struggle here, and coming                up with the paradigms to say can we take a cell that can form any                cell type, and get it to form but one cell type.                And to do this we have to rely upon our knowledge coming out of                molecular embryology as to the genetics and what not involved in                any type of cell specialization.                And this is really the limiting issue at this point in time, getting                these purified populations of cells on demand. There are strategies                that are used that we do pretty good at, and we will take the initial                populations of cells, and we can change feeder layers, and we can                change growth factors, and we can put them in different types of                cultures and force them then to begin to specialize.                But they are mixed cultures, and within the same dish you are                going to find neurons and muscle, et cetera. And we must then go                another step and begin to sort out either through procedures called                flow sorting based on what is on cell surfaces to get then pure                populations of hematopoietic stem cells, muscle cells, or neuro                cells.                And this works fairly well. We can get cultures of dopanergic                neurons that are 80 percent pure, and we can get cardiac muscle                that is 97 percent pure, et cetera.                But we are a long way from isolating in a homogeneous fashion                the various types of cells that we would like to get. Some of them                ere doing well at and others were not.                And it is going to require an extensive amount of research to                achieve this. Now in going to transplantation therapy -- we are                going to jump a little bit ahead here, and if we start, this could                be ES.                If we start with this population, we do not transplant into anybody,                or into an animal at this point, one of the stem cells. You don't                do it. The reason that you don't do it is this.                These stem cells are capable of forming a variety of tissues,                and they will form tumors, and these tumors are these mixed germ                cell tumors that contain a variety of cell types.                They are called teratomas in the old literature. Monster. I mean,                they are contained in a mixed array, and you can see teeth, sebaceous                glands, hair, bone, parts of the gut, et cetera.                So what you have to do to make this work is you want to at least                get cells that you have treated somehow in a dish into some of these                more defined lineages that are away from this capacity to form tumors.                So that we then begin to select tissues downstream, all right?                Part of the problem, and you will read this in the literature, is                how good your selection is, is also indicated by whether or not                when you take myocardiocytes that you say, oh, these are all 100                percent myocardiocytes, you transplant them into the wall of the                heart, and you end up with a teratoma.                This happens, and we are into the central nervous system, and                you end up with a teratoma within the brain. So getting rid of those                initial stem cells are essential, and we have ways of doing this                genetically, but I just want to point out that this is an issue.                To say nothing about the fact that we do not know whether any                cell downstream here has the capacity to revert. We know very little                about that at this point in time.                So let me give you an example. There are many of these coming                out in a number of laboratories, most of them in the mouse in which                lines have been derived in different lineages, and they have been                transplanted into animals to show proof of concept, and that you                can isolate a specific cell type, and you can transplant it, and                it will function within the transplant.                I would like to give you now an example from our work at Hopkins.                It is an unpublished work, and it is now under review, but I think                it is important because it really illustrates several points that                are critical here.                We have taken our human cells and grown them under culture conditions                that would select for specific types of lineages, and whether it                is neural, or whether it is muscle, et cetera. And now we have,                I believe, in our laboratory over a hundred a hundred lines like                this, of the human lines.                And in the one example that I want to present to you, which was                done with members of our department of neurology, and in collaboration                with our lab, is a model, using these cells in an animal model of                the motor neuron disease.                And in this study, these animals are treated with a virus that                destroys lower motor neutrons, so that animals become paralyzed,                and they are paralyzed because they lose the big nerve muscles that                in your spinal cord hook your muscles up to the central nervous                system.                So that in a period of 10 days following the injection of the                virus into the brain, the animals become paralyzed, and we have                gone to great lengths to show that it is really the ventral roots                that are involved.                You wipe out these neurons and these animals never recover. They                never recover. So what we have done is to take our human neural                cells out of this and infuse it into the spinal cords of these rats,                and to look then for the recovery of motor activity.                This is a rat out for a mid-morning stroll, and this animal is                infected with the virus, and it is a virus that really leads to                an encephalomyelitis, and within a period of 10 days the animal                is paralyzed.                We can document exactly what this paralysis is about. The virus                is cleared, and shortly thereafter we will put a cannula into the                lumbar region of the animal, and infuse 300,000 cells into the cerebrospinal                fluid, and these cells will float all the way up to the hind-brain.                And then we monitor the motor activity of these animals, and within                a period of a few months, we begin to see animals that can now place                their limbs underneath them, and that can draw them up, support                some weight, and begin to push off.                And at the high end, within a several month period, we can have                animals that are now walking. And the issue is why are they walking.                And what we have learned, although it is not as you can see a normal                gait, et cetera, and we have really documented this as well, they                are walking.                And why are they walking? Well, initially what we felt was this.                This is a panel showing cells within the ventral horn of those animals                and I want you to look at this cell here.                This cell, based on its marker, and based on its physical characteristics,                and molecular characteristics, is a human motor neutron cell that                has been specialized out of these neural precursor cells, that has                sent an axon out into the periphery at least two centimeters.                And we have been able to cut the sciatic nerve out on the limb                of this animal, place a dye at that site, and that dye is picked                up by that axon, and brought back to the cell body that extended                the axon.                And it comes back, and this is the green stuff here, and it comes                back then into the cell body of the human motor neuron. We have                gone on to document how many human cells are present, and what they                are as far as the phenotype is concerned, to see -- you know, yes,                they are forming glia, and they are forming a variety of cell types                within the ventral horn of that animal.                Interestingly, and one of the safety issues that we find is that                50 percent of the cells don't do anything. And we are a little bit                concerned about that.                I mean, is it good to have all these cells in there that aren't                doing anything, but this is an issue that we have got to resolve.                Well, it turns out that this is only part of the answer. It turns                out that the human cells at the same time are producing growth factors                that rescue and enhance the regeneration of the animal's own cells                within the ventral horn.                And so this has led us then to set up experiments to try to figure                or try to determine what growth factors it is that is causing the                growth of axons in those mice and in rats in the ventral horn, and                it may be that eventually we can use just the combination of those                growth factors to elicit this response. We don't know.                So these cells are serving in a dual capacity, which is somewhat                exciting. We have taken the human cells and we now have grafted                them into monkeys. They were in monkeys for over a year.                This was a safety study to in fact show that we are not getting                tumors formed. I think you can appreciate one of the major issues                here that we are going to be faced with, with this type of approach,                is animal experiments are of a very short duration. Mice and rats                are for periods of several months.                Monkeys we can go much longer. How much data is going to be needed                to convince the FDA that this is a safe approach, and this is something                that is being debated now within the FDA and it is a difficult issue.                But here we show human cells, and that is these blue ones that                have been in this monkey, and in this case for 180 days, but we                are now out a year, and we can show that these cells are forming                specialized structures and they are non-tumorigenic.                The next phase is to look at a graph model here that is functional.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Can                I just ask a question?                 DR. GEARHART:  Sure.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  What                has been injected here?                 DR. GEARHART:  Oh, I'm                sorry. These are the same -- what has been injected into this monkey                are the same cells that were injected into the rat. The same cells.                They were human cells --                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Neural                precursors?                 DR. GEARHART:  Neural                precursor cells. The same cells, the same culture cells. A major                issue that we must discuss and that we are concerned about is graft                rejection. Obviously, anything that you grow up, unless it matches                the patient, is going to be subjected to that, and now we get into                an area which Dr. Kass has mentioned earlier.                But what are our options here? What are the options of being able                to grow these cells into any of these lineages and then to transplant                them and not have rejection?                Well, there is a long list, and it starts with, well, maybe what                we ought to do is derive hundreds of ES and EG cell lines, and then                you would have a best match for a patient. Not very practical.                Can we use the patients own cells, and you will hear about some                of this shortly. Should we use immunosuppressive therapies. We would                like to get away from that.                Can we use what the tissue engineers are referring to as sequestering                grafts, and what this is, is you can take grafted cells and put                around them matrices that will not permit other cells to touch them,                but yet they can produce products, or they can function in a graft.                So you are trying to hide them from the host immune cells. How                effective that is going to be, we don't know.                Can we perhaps come in and genetically modify, which is easy to                do in these cells with the histo-compatibility genes, so we can                make them more like a patient that is going to receive these cells.                Or is it possible that we may end up being able to produce cells                that may be universal donors. Again, we are trying this, and at                the moment it is speculation.                Clearly the one thing that has worked is the issue of nuclear                transfer therapy, the so-called therapeutic cloning, in which as                you know the argument is to take a cell from a patient, and fuse                it to an enucleated egg, derive a blastocyst, recover the inner                cell mass, culture it out, and then these embryonic stem cells would                match the genome of the patient.                Is this a pipe dream? The answer is no, and I will give you an                example of that in a moment. To get around some of the issues with                the human cloning, embryonic cloning in humans, you have seen reports                in the Wall Street Journal and other places which I can confirm                are real, in which there are attempts now to take human cells, human                nuclei, place them for example into rabbit eggs, enucleated rabbit                eggs, and grow up a blastocyst, and generate stem cells that have                human nuclei and rabbit mitochondria.                And the argument has been made here that, well, these cells would                be perfectly fine for an autograft, and this isn't accurate. We                know that mitochondria produced polypeptides that are integrated                into the cell membrane, and are actually considered to be minor                histocompatibility antigens, and will be recognized and rejected                by the host from which the nucleus came from.                So this really is not getting around the issue of the graft stuff                at all using other animals, and we are a little bit concerned about                how this is being handled.                So, let me give you an example, and one which you should read                these papers if you haven't from Rudy Jaenisch and George Daley                at MIT, using the nuclear transfer therapy, or the therapeutic cloning,                to do two things.                What they did was to take a mouse that had a genetic mutation                in genes that are important as far as the immune response is concerned.                And they took cells from this mouse, took the nucleus out of the                cell, and placed that nucleus into an enucleated egg to produce                a blastocyst from a cloned embryo.                They took the inner-cell mass cells out of that, and generated                embryonic stem cells, that then are the same genome type as this                animal, and then went in and repaired genetically the mutation within                those cells.                And then differentiated these cells into the hematopoietic stem                cell component, transferred them back into this animal that had                the mutation, and the transplant took, completing the whole hematopoietic                system, and in rescuing that animal.                So this is a proof of concept kind of experiment, and I urge you                to read it. It is an extremely powerful illustration, not only of                the therapeutic cloning end of things, but also the ability then                to come along and correct the genetic mutation and the reference                was given to you.                Another argument has been made that we should be using perhaps                just eggs that have been stimulated to form embryos, and these are                parthenotes.                And the argument here has been that we can then use these directly                into the female from which the eggs were taken. I just want to point                out that in my opinion that this is going to have very low usage.                You are going to have to recover embryos or eggs from patients,                post-pubertal, and pre-menopause. The window is going to be fairly                short, I think, for many of the therapies that you would want to                effect.                And the other issue is that we don't know much about cells that                are derived this way, and how viable, and how functional they are                going to be. But this has been used or promoted also as a source,                and this is an illustration of where you take those cells.                All of this type of technology, I just want to let you know, and                I know that you are grappling with this, but even within the field                of the scientists are beginning to argue about what is an embryo                and what isn't an embryo.                So any arguments that you have within your council on this, I                will tell you is also being held among biologists. I think that                my own personal feeling is that anything that you construct at this                point in time that has the properties of those structures to me                is an embryo, and we should not be changing vocabulary at this point                in time. It doesn't change some of the ethical issues involved.                What are some of the problems here, and I will summarize this                a little bit. Current research. Well, we have to come up with better                ways of having high efficiency differentiation protocols resulting                in homogeneous cell populations.                We are dealing with growth environments, and genetic manipulations,                and we are trying to define stages of cell differentiation within                our cultures.                And assessing whether or not the differentiated cells that we                are getting out are normal and completely functional. And this is                in a dish.                And let me tell you that there are examples of where you can spend                all of an effort studying something in a dish, only to find that                if you pop it in an animal that it doesn't behave how you think                it is going to behave. We have a lot to learn here.                I think you can imagine that what is going on in a dish is not                exactly what is going on in a site where you transplant. The whole                issue of grafting, and how you put it in, and the safety issues,                and that cells migrate away, and they differentiate, and will they                form tumors, and then the issue of the immune response.                These are all, you know, formidable obstacles that lie ahead.                I mentioned to you that we can use cells individually, and have                been used in a variety of paradigms in our collaborators of single                cells, and the tissue engineers are now taking these different cell                types and seeing if they can reconstruct or construct organal aids                or tissues to do in-grafting, and thee has been some success with                this at this point.                Finally, to me, the future is going to be that the basic science                coming out of this is the most important element, and that from                that information we are going to be able, I think, to take patient                cells, where appropriate, and I say where appropriate because if                you have autoimmune disease, or in cases where you have an injury,                spinal cord injury, or stroke, or heart attack, and you don't have                time to take that patient's cells, you are going to have to come                up with different paradigms.                But I think we are going to be able to eventually coax a patient's                own cells to behave in a manner that we want to, but we are going                to learn this I think through the study of stem cells.                The last thing I will say is I know that you want to ask, well,                what is the future going to bring, and I am concerned about predicting                the future. I can't even do this on a three year NIH grant and this                is what is expected of us.                You know, what is going to happen here. I certainly think that                everything that has happened up to this point is consistent with                success in this area, and I could get into more predictions in a                moment.                But we are always asked when is this going to happen, and it is                going to be I think based on specific cell types, and on, and on,                and on. But the predictive thing is very, very difficult.                Well, I thank you for your attention, and I hope that this was                enough of a primer to add more meat to your discussions. Thank you.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Thank                you very much.                (Applause.)                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  We were                only physically in the dark, but we are grateful for your enlightenment,                Dr. Gearhart, and the floor is open for questions, and comment,                and discussion. Don't forget that you have to turn your microphones                on to be heard. Jim, go ahead.                 DR. WILSON:  Dr. Gearhart,                do you foresee that it will ever make a difference whether cells                that are transferred for human cell regeneration come from cloned                eggs, or from the retrieval from IVF eggs? Does it make a difference                what the source is?                 DR. GEARHART:  Well,                I think in the short term that it will. I think the only way we                have around the immune rejection story at this point is from cloned                embryos.                For a patient in which you can predict ahead of time is going                to need stem cell therapy and you have the time and money available                to do the cloned approach.                I would like to think that this is going to be a transitionary                period, and that we will not have to rely upon this in the long                term, and that we will be able to take for any specific disease                a stem cell, or a derivative of a stem cell that may come from the                adult source, the umbilical source, the fetal source, or embryonic                source.                I mean, whichever presents, and that we will have ways of dealing                with this graft rejection story other than through the cloning of                human embryos.                 DR. WILSON:  If I could                just supplement my question with a related one to which you referred.                What is your current assessment of the value of adult stem cells,                as opposed to embryonic ones, as a source of organ regeneration                currently?                 DR. GEARHART:  Oh, I                think it is a very viable option and I think NIH should fund it.                I think that from what we see in the work, and Catherine will present                a nice overview of this, that this is going to be a good source                of stem cells.                They have some issues that they have to overcome, issues of expandability,                and plasticity, that we feel are -- that have not been demonstrated                as well as embryonic stem cells, but I think that eventually we                will be able to overcome this.                But I think part of the knowledge of overcoming it is going to                be coming from our studies of cells that have those capabilities,                and being able to transfer that information to those other cells.                So I think we are going to come up with -- I believe that in the                stem cells, cell-based therapies, that we are going to identify                certain adult sources that are going to be good for some diseases,                some injuries, and embryonic sources for others.                So I think we are going to mutually proceed on this and benefit                from it.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Please,                Elizabeth.                 DR. BLACKBURN:  Dr.                Gearhart, you can give us I think a unique perspective on the comparison                between adult, and embryonic, and fetal stem cells.                And in particular many of us read the recent papers, the scientific                peer-reviewed papers that came out with respect to the adult stem                cells, and the interpretation of their plasticity being cast in                some considerable doubt by the observation that there was cellular                fusion of those cells which had led to in these particular cases                examined a mistake in interpretation of their plasticity.                And I wondered if you could give us your perspective on that aspect,                which extends Jim's question somewhat.                 DR. GEARHART:  I will                do so in the face of Catherine sitting back here, who is --                 DR. BLACKBURN:  Yes,                I am going to ask her, of course, about this, too.                 DR. GEARHART:  -- actually                done those experiments. Clearly the most difficult experiments that                we have had to address and interpret are those utilizing adult stem                cells that have been placed into the blastocyst of mice to create                chimeras.                And in those chimeras, we see that the descendants of those adult                cells gave rise to many, many lineages within the embryo, and this                was really the issue. How did we explain this.                And from the studies of Austin Smith and others that you are referring                to, the implication was that when those cells were transplanted                into that blastocyst to generate the chimeras, that a subset of                these cells fused with the hosts own cells and it was those fusion                products then that gave rise to the variety of lineages.                At the moment that is an implication, and that has not been demonstrated                in the embryo. It has been demonstrated in the dish that they had                that capacity.                So we are now waiting and putting pressure on Catherine, and Freizen,                and others to look into those animals to see if they can recover                those specialized cells that were derived from or that had the adult                phenotype if you know what I mean, the marker, to say are you truly                of the adult stem cell lineage, or do you have other markers present,                other chromosomes present, that come from host cells.                So until we see that data -- you know, I will wait. That is something                that can be looked at scientifically, and that is as far as I would                go with you, Elizabeth, at this point.                It is an interesting observation, and we will see if it actually                is the answer.                 DR. BLACKBURN:  And                just to extend on what you said, I think what it does now do is                to demand that the onus be put on the researcher to show that there                has been a plasticity or transdifferentiation, and there are other                set of criteria, which would be karyotype and multiple micro-satellite,                polymorphisms -- sorry to get overly technical -- and other genetic                markers.                There are clearly tools in hand, and so it seems as if every experiment                can in fact be subjected to those sets of analyses now.                 DR. GEARHART:  Right.                 DR. BLACKBURN:  And                will need to be before we can get a good view of this.                 DR. GEARHART:  Right.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Rebecca.                 PROF. DRESSER:  I have                four questions, and maybe if I say them all it will be possible                to answer some of them together. One, I was wondering if the rats                are being given immunosuppressants in this study.                And then you said a problem with the rabbit eggs is that the mitochondrial                DNA might cause rejection, and so I wondered if that would happen                with a cloned human embryo as well if the egg came from another                person, and if you are trying to do a therapy that is compatible                with a patient.                And let's see. The feeder layers, I was wondering if they have                available feeder layers that do not come from animals or what the                state of that development is.                And then finally what about the fact that if you are creating                a blastocyst from a patient's cell, and if the patient, let's say,                has cancer or some condition that could be related to genetics,                would the stem cells somehow perhaps be risky?                 DR. GEARHART:  There                is no question in my mind that the possibility exists that if you                are doing an egg donor, and nuclear transfer into an egg, that there                possibly exists that that cell -- that the embryonic stem cells                derived from that could be rejected. Absolutely.                Now, how do you test this? I mean, where do you test it. This                almost comes under the same criteria that I have for anyone coming                to -- if I was on an IRB and they wanted to clone a human reproductivity,                what data do you present before you permit it to go.                To me, it is one of these things where you need perfection before                experimentation, or without experimentation, which is something                in science is anathema.                 PROF. DRESSER:  Well,                you could test that in an animal, right? I mean, you could at least                see --                 DR. GEARHART:  Well,                you can, and we could set it up in an animal, but the issue is --                I mean, where you are very defined and to demonstrate it by doing                it into a different strain of mouse. There is no question about                it.                But whether or not that would carry over in polymorphisms that                exist in human, again you are still faced with human versus rodent.                The feeder layer issue. It is one that is being taken on, and                there is no banning of this type of work with private money, and                clearly there are a number of investigators, laboratories, working                on establishing feeder layers from human tissue that could be used,                and I think that this is very important.                So those studies are certainly under way. We have used a variety                of different human tissues as well to look at in our studies. Oh,                the very first question that you asked. I'm sorry, it was again?                 PROF. DRESSER:  For                the rats --                 DR. GEARHART:  Oh, sorry.                We did animals that were immunosuppressed and animals that were                not immunosuppressed. And we did not find a great deal of difference                in the short term, although -- I mean, as far as any type of destruction                of cells and things like that, although clearly in the animals that                were not immunosuppressed that you could see reactive cells present.                So clearly in the monkeys immunosuppressed, absolutely, and so                we have done them both. And then the blastocyst question?                 PROF. DRESSER:  If it                comes from a patient with a particular disease.                 DR. GEARHART:  Yes.                Clearly where there is a genetic basis of any type of a disease,                you would be concerned about reintroducing the same cells that were                subjected to whatever the disease process was.                And I think that this carries over also into, for example, the                diabetes work, where if you have an attack on insulin itself, you                know, is this going to be a viable alternative, and there are some                evidence now that you can alter the insulin molecule to make it                not recognized by some of the autoimmune antibodies.                I should say that there are a number of laboratories -- and this                is one area that is being emphasized in the use of human cells,                including our own, with Mike Shamblott, where we have lines that                are -- human lines that are insulin producing that you can pop them                into animals, and demonstrate that they can produce human insulin.                And we are very encouraged by some of these early results. But                I would still contend that we have a long way to go to carry that                into some type of clinical application. We have a lot of questions                to answer.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Janet.                 DR. ROWLEY:  Well, I,                too, have multiple questions and I want to thank you for a very                lucid presentation. That helps a great deal. I would like to first                -- and I think I will do these one at a time.                It is a substantial question as to what value the embryos that                are left over from IVF can play in this whole process as compared                with embryos that you develop for either a particular purpose, or                just straight off.                And my understanding was that maybe some of the embryos were sufficiently                mature so that maybe the cells derived from IVF would not be useful                in developing, say, cells lines or things. And I would like your                comments.                 DR. GEARHART:  One of                my hats at Hopkins when I moved there in the late '70s was to develop                the IVF program. So we are very well tuned into the issues of IVF,                and clearly in an IVF procedure the best embryos obtained are those                that are used first in first transfers.                So that generally those that are left over are of the ones --                we don't want to call it a lesser quality, but at least as far as                our eye is concerned, and how we judge grades of embryos, based                mainly on morphology to be honest, and more currently we are looking                at biochemical parameters that we can measure in the media in which                these cells are growing that something has been secreted to have                some kind of a measure.                And that clearly those that are the spare embryos generally are                those of -- let's say, what we deem, and knowing what that means,                of lesser quality.                So what does that mean? In most cases, they have not developed                far enough along, which means that if they are left over that you                take them back out of the freezer, and you try in your culture conditions                to get them up to this blastocyst point.                If you can't get them to a blastocyst stage, you can't derive                the cells. If there is no inner cell mass, you can't do it. And                you find that you are compromised there, and that generally these                are not very good embryos.                So one could argue that overall that you would expect to have                a low efficiency yield with respect to taking in embryo and deriving                a line from spare embryos in an IVF program. That is in general.                 DR. ROWLEY:  Okay. You                mentioned modifying the histocompatibility locus, and I would have                thought that there is still so much that we don't know about the                MAC that that would -- I mean, obviously anything can be done in                the future with time, but do you look on this as practical?                 DR. GEARHART:  Well,                back in the ancient days, in the early '80s it seems in this field,                Oliver Smithies and others did do knockouts of Class I and Class                II genes, in an effort to determine whether or not this could prolong                grafts into animals without those.                And that depending on the tissue or the organ, there was evidence                that this indeed could be the case, and not that it was an indeterminate                thing, but just by days, or weeks, or months, that this was the                case.                What they didn't know about at that time were NK killer cells,                and those kinds of things, and the importance of other determinants                which must be on cells. They wiped everything out.                So some labs are now taking a look at this to see if it is possible                then to rebuild back some of these markets. But it is a matter of                speculation at this point whether or not this could occur.                Now, what we can talk about I think is it possible to take using                the act of transgenesis and things like this, where we could move                big pieces of DNA; of taking part of a patient's chromosome-6, you                know, and cloning that into a stem cell after knocking out some                of it, and we may get some degree closer.                But that says nothing about the myriad of other loci that could                be involved as minor histocompatibility problems. So, some of it                is speculation, but I think it is also testable at this point in                time.                 DR. ROWLEY:  And my                last question is coming back to the 80 plus cell lines, and you                raised concerns, which many of us have, as to how useful some of                those are going to be.                 DR. GEARHART:  Right.                 DR. ROWLEY:  Could you                expand a little bit, in terms of whether you think they are really                not going to be long term cell lines, and that is your concern,                or whether there are other aspects.                 DR. GEARHART:  Well,                I have many concerns, and I hope that I can get them all in. I mean,                look, we were all thrilled when Mr. Bush made the decision to move                forward with this and establish cell lines to permit the work to                go forward. There is no question about it.                But as we looked into -- and by looking into, it was a practical                matter. Many investigators around the world, and I have close contacts                with colleagues in Germany, and in France, and in England, and Japan,                and Australia, and on and on, as we compare notes all the time on                our results of research, as well as on practical things like this,                and on political issues.                I mean, there is no question that we have to keep abreast, and                what happened, particularly from the German investigators, which                is significant, as you know, in Germany, they are not permitted                to derive cell lines.                And for a while they were not permitted to use those that were                even derived, and recently their parliament voted to permit the                use of existing cell lines as of January 2002.                But what happened was that when these investigators set about                to import cell lines, and contacted the registry list at the NIH,                which continues to grow each day, and more lines are added to it                as you know, it turned out that many of the lines were not defined.                Someone just reported that they had a clump of cells growing in                a dish, and they didn't have any of these parameters or very few                of them done.                And this reduced the list substantially, quite substantially,                down to -- we are talking about, say, a dozen. And then the issue                came up as to, well, are these -- can they be imported without a                stringent material transfer agreement, and with a reach through                clause that would say that anything that you would do with those                lines belongs to the person giving you the line.                And this reduced the line substantially. And then other lines                are not available because if you needed to get them, you needed                NIH funding, and only NIH funding. You could not use private funding                with them, and on and on.                And so it drastically reduced down the number of lines that are                practically available. Now, whether or not this will have a major                impact, clearly the NIH is receiving grants, and we have been reviewing                grants, and using the existing approved lines, the few that one                can get.                And the work will go forward, and whether or not that will be                sufficient, and we recognize that there is going to be a half-life                to these lines for various reasons, and that there will come a time                if it proves effective in the basic science part of this to move                forward, that we should be looking at being able to generate new                lines.                And the issue of the feeder cells is a major issue as well, and                to begin to establish lines on human cells so that we are not faced                with that anything that we derive from this now, and it is important                to consider, has to be considered as a xenograft.                Although it is a human line, the FDA requires that if it has seen                these other products, it has to be considered a xenograft, which                sets up a whole new set of criteria for moving this into the clinical                applications.                So I think there are reasons why we should eventually be permitted                to derive new lines. Well, I'm sorry. We can do it now on private                money, but anything that is derived cannot receive Federal money                for support.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  There                are people waiting in line, but can I get a clarification on this                question that came up in your answer to Janet about the durability                and longevity of the lines, and on the one hand, one says that the                embryonic stem cell lines, their great virtue is that they can be                self-renewed indefinitely.                On the other hand, they have a half-life, perhaps because of accumulated                mutations. Could you say a little more? I mean, some people claim                these are eternal lines.                 DR. GEARHART:  Right.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  And                could you say something about the possible differences between human                and mouse with respect to renewability, because I think it is an                important factor.                 DR. GEARHART:  Well,                the issue is maybe they are eternal, but can you still use them.                They can still divide indefinitely, but they may not --                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  But                they are no longer the same.                 DR. GEARHART:  Yes,                they are no longer the same, and they may not give you the biologic                properties that you need. Strangely enough, Leon, there have been                very few publications up to this point, and up to this point there                is one that I can cite for you, and I have it in answer to some                of your questions by Joe Stanbrook at -- Peter Stanbrook, at the                University of Cincinnati, in which he looked -- these were mouse                lines.                And he looked at the frequency and rate of mutation within several                mouse lines, and contrasted those with several schematic cell lines                that were in the lab as well.                And he found that indeed the mutation rates -- and what you do                is you pick certain genes to look at changes, and to look at chromosome                lost or gain.                This paper was published in PNAS in the March 19th issue for those                who are interested, and what he found was that the frequency and                rates of mutation were orders of magnitude less in the embryonic                stem cell line than in the schematic cell line.                And you are looking at a rate of generally 10 to the minus 6 frequency                within any mammalian cell as it is divided. But what he did find,                and that was a bit troublesome, was that the type of mutation that                appeared in the embryonic stem cell one led to what is called uniparental                disomy, which is a situation where you end up with homozygosity                across a region, or across chromosomes or regions of chromosomes,                that gets rid of really the dominant tumor suppressor genes, which                then raises the issue that these cells may be more susceptible to                tumorigenesis than others.                Now, that is the only report, and I will tell you that in several                laboratories what is being done now with the human lines, and that                is using express sequence tags, for example, and you can use 10,000                of them, they are looking at mutation rates at 10,000 loci, if you                know what I mean, over time in culture passage, after passage, after                passage.                So we will get information on this parameter, and how significant                it is going to be, I don't know, but one would predict that clearly                there is going to be an accumulation of mutations within these cells.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Okay.                Thank you. I have Michael -- well, also, was that on this point?                 DR. BLACKBURN:  Just                a very brief clarification. Did the absolute frequency of uniparental                disomy go up? Was it an absolute frequency increase, or simply did                it relatively increase as you looked at the whole spectrum of mutations                in the mouse embryonic stem cells?                Do you see the difference that I am trying to get at?                 DR. GEARHART:  Yes.                 DR. BLACKBURN:  That                if it were an absolute increase, that is a reason for concern, much                more than if it were simply a relative increase in a number that                has already gone down by --                 DR. GEARHART:  These                numbers are rates, and so I believe it is an actual number. In other                words, it was a real --                 DR. BLACKBURN:  An absolute                increase?                 DR. GEARHART:   Yes,                an absolute increase.                 DR. BLACKBURN:  So I                just wanted to make sure that I understood the numbers here.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Michael                Sandel, and then Frank.                 PROF. SANDEL:  I would                like to go back to the adult stem cell versus embryonic stem cell                question, and ask it in a slightly different, and maybe more pointed,                form.                As you know, there are some people who regard embryonic stem cell                research as morally objectionable. I am not asking you or trying                to drag you into that debate. But I would like to know your view                on the following scientific question.                If adult stem cell research in the best case scenario redeems                its promise, what would we lose medically and scientifically if                we ban embryonic stem cell research, or imposed a moratorium on                it for a period of time, until we could assess what adult stem cell                research could achieve?                 DR. GEARHART:  I personally                think it would be a tragedy, and for the following reason, if this                was to happen. I think the length of time that it is going to take                to assess whether the adult stem cell avenue is going to provide                the potential therapies that we are thinking about, is going to                be years.                And I think for us to deny at this point any avenue that has the                potential of the embryonic stem cell story is a tragedy to those                people who need or who will need these cures.                And I think that it is a time element. If this could be done in                a year, I would maybe listen to that argument. But it is going to                take years to really assess any of these approaches.                And I really think they should move forward together. I think                we are going to learn in both directions how to utilize information                coming out of these studies that would benefit, for example, or                enable us to understand more about the adult sources if this is                going to be the emphasis, and to really make them effective in their                use.                So I think that it wouldn't be wise to put a ban on the embryonic                source at this point, and wait until another avenue is assessed.                The length of time is going to be too long.                 PROF. SANDEL:   Can you                be more specific? Are there certain types of research avenues that                you would associate more with embryonic stem cell research, as against                adult stem cell research?                Is it likely that success is in particular areas, or is it just                that you feel that as a general matter it is better to have more                avenues rather than fewer?                 DR. GEARHART:  Well,                I think that one of the messages that I hope that I can get across,                and maybe Catherine will, too, is that we are in very early stages                in all of stem cell research, no matter what the origin of the cells                are.                And to make a judgment as to which of these is already more advanced                than the other, it would be a tenuous one at this point, because                you have got to remember that there are very few investigators actually                working on embryonic stem cells at this point.                The list on the adult side obviously is larger. I mean, as far                as investigators are concerned. And I don't think that any of us                are really showing dramatic -- you know, utilization in the sense                that we can say we are going to go to any clinical use of this.                It is going to take years for this to occur. We are in the very                early stages and so I would be really hesitant to say that anything                is demonstrating anything better.                All I would say about embryonic stem cells at this point in a                very positive way is that we know that at this point that out of                these cells we can virtually generate any cell type we want in dish                and in large numbers.                That is the advantage of this approach. Now, whether this will                be surmounted by other discoveries in adult stem cells to do the                same kinds of things, I don't want to predict. I hope that it happens.                You know, our -- and I also want to emphasize that we -- and although                we are associated with the embryonic form, we are studying other                forms as well. We are not foolish.                As a scientist, you know, you are not going to put all your eggs                in one basket here. And so we are trying to move forward on a broad                front, and I think that this would be the more rational way to proceed                in this arena                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Frank.                 PROF. FUKUYAMA:  Dr.                Gearhart, did I understand you correctly that in the experiment                that you headed up with the mouse that it lost the motor function                in its rear legs, that you were injecting human stem cells?                 DR. GEARHART:   Yes.                Well, if I could correct you a moment. It was a rat, first of all.                 PROF. FUKUYAMA:  Okay.                A rat.                 DR. GEARHART:  Rat,                too, but the issue is please don't say that you are injecting stem                cells. These are derivatives of stem cells. I mean, just so that                we know, but they are out of the stem cell line, okay?                 PROF. FUKUYAMA:  Okay.                Fine. But what was the resulting tissue? It was a mixture then of                rat and human neurons, or do you think it was simply the stimulation                of these other factors that was causing the rat neurons?                 DR. GEARHART:   Right.                That is a good question. We still don't know -- I mean, to be honest                with you -- what the mechanism of recovery here is. We know that                sitting in the ventral horns of these animals, and where these big                neutrons reside, you now have a mosaic population of host cells,                of neurons, inner-neutrons.                I mean, we all -- I mean, human and rat, or human and mouse, depending                on which one we did. We don't know the relative contributions. We                can count cells, but really what is the functional basis of what                occurred there.                We know that the human cells are also rescuing the other, but                to what degree. This is where the hard work comes in. What was the                mechanism, and what really went on or is going on in that ventral                horn.                I can tell you in work that John McDonald has done at Wash U,                in which they generate a contusion injury in the spinal cord of                a mouse or a rat, and then infuse in mouse embryonic stem cell derivatives,                and that he is faced with the same issue. He can see that these                animals recover to a certain degree, but the mechanism of what is                it, of what has really occurred there, is not known.                And I think what we are going to find is a demand that we come                up with mechanism in some of these animal models so that we can                completely understand what that therapy is going to be if you take                it to a human.                And this is going to require a lot of work. Now, some of it you                could argue is that you could do it all within animal studies. You                know, mouse embryonic stem cells, and you don't have to put the                human in.                But I think we are finding enough differences between species                that it would warrant at least the study also of the human derived                cells in the same paradigms to ask those questions.                 PROF. FUKUYAMA:   But                I am just curious. Are you getting actual tissues in which you have                cells from different species that are growing simultaneously?                 DR. GEARHART:  Oh, yes,                absolutely. Yes, sitting in the same -- well, you can see in the                section here that might be 15 or 20 microns across, you see a mixture                of the rat cells or mouse cells, and human cells, functioning.                You know -- I mean, this isn't uncommon. We do interspecific grafts                a lot in experimental things, and the question is when you do it,                and we see, you know, human cells growing in animals very nicely.                I mean, as long as there is immunosuppression and things like this                occurring.                 PROF. FUKUYAMA:  But                could you go the other way, also injecting stem cells from other                species into human beings?                 DR. GEARHART:  Oh, yes.                I mean, this is one of the issues with xenografts. You know, is                this something -- well, there is a report recently about chicken                embryonic stem cells, and the fact that people who had derived these                were promoting the use in humans.                Pig stem cells, you know, et cetera, and so it can be done, but                a couple of issues, and one of them is the issue of the xenograft                itself, of bringing in endogenous viruses, and is this a wise thing                to do.                And the other thing that I would ask you, and I won't be flippant                about it, is to say that if you -- and one of the concerns that                we have that maybe this council and others would take up, is long                term in a neurologic sense.                If you are putting stem cells in, and you are putting them in                between different human beings, what are you doing to that individual.                And I would say to you that if you have a stroke, and someone comes                along and says, well, we have pig, cow, mouse, human, take your                pick, what would you select.                I am not being flippant about it, but I am just saying that I                think that we know that human would be preferable at this point                in time.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Could                I ask a question, and just for clarification again also on your                own experiment that you showed us. You said that some of the rats                were immunosuppressed and some were not. Is that correct?                 DR. GEARHART:  Yes.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  And                were there functional differences in the results between those two                groups, and would that bear upon the question of whether or not                the major effect was owing to the action of the human cells, or                a stipulation of the endogenous cells?                And lastly, if these animals had come to post-mortem was there                a difference? Was there rejection in the non-immunosuppressed animals                of the human cells?                 DR. GEARHART:  It is                important to keep in mind the time frame that these experiments                are done in. They are of very short duration relatively speaking,                in a period of several months maximum.                In experiments that have been done in our laboratory, principally                by Mike Shamblott, in taking human cells and grafting, and these                are insulin-producing cells, and we have done it in a variety of                tissues into rodents, you always see reactive cells, which means                that you are eliciting an immune response.                Again, they are short term, and whether you are getting destruction,                we see cellular debris, and we see this kind of stuff at these sites.                I should tell you a little bit that may be enlightening.                When you do grafts like this, if we say we are putting in 300,000                cells or we are microinjecting in a lot of these cells, many of                these cells will die at the time of injection, simply because you                have taken them out of one environment and you put them into another,                and you see a tremendous amount of cell death.                Very few of these populations of cells continue to divide. In                other words, it may undergo one more round of division, and they                sit there.                You do see when you come in finally to look at where is the human                versus where is the rodent, and you use your human markers. You                invariably find a group of cells that you can't phenotype, if you                know what I mean, and to say what has happened here, and clearly                there are cells being destroyed.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Fused?                 DR. GEARHART:  Well,                we don't know that. And one of the arguments for many years has                been that the central nervous system is an immune privileged site.                I don't think anymore that this is something that is believed or                subscribed to, and if you have the option of immunosuppression,                or of getting around that, that that would be preferred.                And particularly when you are talking about a graft going into                a human being that may be there for 20 years, as opposed to a matter                of a few months. So I think that this is going to remain a major                issue, and there is no question about it.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Thank                you very much. Bill Hurlbut and then Paul McHugh                 DR. HURLBUT: :  John,                I hear you saying that we should pursue all lines of research, but                I want to weigh the different options here and pursue the question                of if the lines were restricted what would be gained or lost.                Specifically, I have several questions that hinge each on the                other. First of all, the cells that were implanted or tested for                their tumorigenicity effect that you spoke of in your paper were                the so-called EBDs.                Were those derived only from embryonic germ cells; is that what                is implied there?                 DR. GEARHART:  Yes.                In our paper, we took the stem cell itself and plated it out in                a variety of culture conditions, some of which are designed to enhance                or select for certain types of differentiation.                And we referred to these as embryoid body-derived cells. They                came out of this little cluster, and in our field it is essential                that we take the stem cell off the dish, and let it form into a                little ball, and which is just a multi-cellular structure, called                an embryoid body.                Now, this was an unfortunate name that was given to it by a French                pathologist back in the '30s, but as you can imagine, when someone                in a political sense talks about an embryoid body, they conjure                up embryos here.                But these are little clusters of cells, and within those or within                that cluster, the beginning of differentiation begins. These cell-cell                interactions are essential for this. We have not been able to mimic                this in a sheep yet.                So what happens is you get within that ball a variety of cell                types being formed, and all that you want to do is to disassociate                that ball after a period of time, and select out only those that                are going in the direction that you want them to go in.                So this is what we did in that experiment, and so we have now                these EBD lines, and in these lines, in these human lines, and these                lines have been placed in a large number of animals, in the grafts                that we have used, we have never seen a tumor up to this point.                And it may be unique to humans, because human primary cultures                are easy to establish and mouse aren't. I mean, there is an issue                here that we don't know that you can't do the same experiment in                the mouse.                So with our experience with the EBDs, we have never seen a tumor.                Our experience in the mouse and using what we thought were equivalent                lines, we have seen too many tumors with respect to grafts into                the central nervous system.                 DR. HURLBUT: :  Just                parenthetically haven't I been reading all along that embryoid bodies                are also formed from ES cells?                 DR. GEARHART:  Oh, yes,                absolutely.                 DR. HURLBUT: :  But the                point is that your particular lines don't produce tumors, and the                ones derived from the primordial germ cells don't seem to produce                tumors; whereas, the embryonic stem cell lines do?                 DR. GEARHART:  Well,                the only comparison that we have at this point are mouse ES lines,                in which we have derived different types of precursors under different                conditions, have been compared to human EG lines that have been                derived, or which precursors have been derived in a slightly different                manner.                You can't derive them both in the same way. We have seen nothing                up to this point on human ES derived lines transplanted. We just                have not seen any data on that.                So I don't want to make it clear that there is a difference between                the derivation either from a germ cell derived, or an inner-cell                mass derived line. Does that make sense? That comparison is not                there yet.                 DR. HURLBUT: :  Well,                obviously what I have been getting at here is if in fact your cell                lines are less likely to cause tumors, then does that imply that                there might be some advantage to using your cell lines, and if so,                would it in fact be the greatest advantage if a patient's own cell                line could be derived from primordial germ cells?                 DR. GEARHART:  Oh, boy,                this committee would -- well, wow. Now, think what this means. It                means that you would be generating an embryo, and having it implanted.                Now, what you don't know is that our fetal tissue comes from 5-to-9                weeks post-fertilization. These are therapeutic abortions.                And which means now that you are way beyond -- I mean, the point                of where a blastocyst is, and obviously way beyond I think anyone                subscribing to that approach.                 DR. HURLBUT: :  You told                us that in your paper.                 DR. GEARHART:  Okay.                 DR. HURLBUT: :  But is                it true that maybe there would be some great advantage if we could                find a legitimate way to harvest tissues generated from a specific                patient at a later date?                 DR. GEARHART:  Right.                Well, I think it would be terribly risky. We have been asked this                question a lot though; is it possible to do a biopsy on a developing                embryo, and to remove just a few germ cells.                I think at the stage that we are using these embryos are a matter                of -- or fetuses are a matter of maybe 6 or 7 millimeters in length,                and to do the surgery on this I think would just be impossible without                causing harm.                The other issue that I would contend is do you think it would                be okay to go in and remove the germ cells from an embryo and let                that individual go on and say, well, we have taken your germ cells.                Now, we have another therapy for you.                And so I don't think it is a very good thing to do.                 DR. HURLBUT: :  And that                is my final point, and I wanted to ask you personally in working                with these cells, do you see 14 days as some kind of magic marker                moment?                Do you see something crucial about implantation? And you spoke                of keeping all options open.                 DR. GEARHART:  Right.                 DR. HURLBUT: :  Why in                fact do we allow abortion fairly late in term, and yet now we are                speaking as 14 days as the sacred moment? I know that I am opening                a very difficult issue here.                But in fact wouldn't we gain a lot scientifically from extending                that 14 day limit potentially if we could find a culture median                that could sustain the embryo, or wouldn't we gain a lot from implanting,                even gestating and harvesting?                And why do we feel that we shouldn't do those things? And I would                also be interested in your personal response to these ethical issues.                 DR. GEARHART:  Wow,                you have asked a lot. As you know, stem cells have been obtained                from many stages of human fetal development, and have been found                to be useful in generating various cell types in culture.                And if we look at a variety of studies, you can find it in the                published literature. We have had a number of requests for fetal                tissue at different stages, and I think legitimate requests of investigators                willing to investigate cell lineages, et cetera, within the embryo.                So people have been thinking about it. I mean, there is no question                about that. We have found it difficult enough to be fortunate enough                to obtain the fetal tissue that we work with.                I mean, there is a consenting process and we have nothing really                to do with other than to make sure that it complies with institutional,                Federal, and State law.                To obtain viable tissue from abortuses of any kind is a major                concern. When we started our studies, we looked into using spontaneously                aborted material, which occurs across the board, but mainly in the                early stages.                And we thought that this would be a good source. As it turned                out, by the time that we were notified -- and this occurs in outlying                hospitals, and not at major medical centers, where investigators                are -- you know, a patient presents with a miscarriage, and it is                taken care of in the ER.                And it turned out that it was very ineffective, number one. And,                number two, and then I will get back to your question, we found                that most of the material that did come to us had chromosomal abnormalities                that made it less desirable for use.                Now, the issue of the 14 days, and what does it mean. Well, this                was something that really came into play in the United Kingdom when                they were trying to deal with this issue.                And it was decided at that point that at that stage the embryo                still does not have a central nervous system. It can feel no pain,                et cetera. And this was why basically that period of time was set                to be able to grow them in culture, or to remove tissue.                We, as embryologists, argue the point all the time as to what                is going on in these early stages, and we were always asked these                questions. When do you believe personhood occurs and when is it                established, and things like this.                To me that is not a biologic question. We don't have a means of                probing that. So I think that is why the 14 days was selected, and                that's why it is sort of adhered to in a sense.                Do I adhere to that? Well, to a certain degree, no. We take material                that is later on, and it is cadaveric fetal tissue. I think that                we should be able to utilize any tissue that comes out of abortion                if the alternative is that it is just going to be disposed of, which                is what happens.                The pathologist takes a look at it to make sure that all of the                parts are accounted for, and there is an issue about being concerned                about what is left in the uterus.                That is my personal opinion on that. But I don't think that we                should be going and establishing pregnancies, and to downstream                then utilize that tissue.                I mean, to then stop the pregnancy and then to recover it. I mean,                that is my personal opinion. I don't think we should be doing that.                As you know, years ago, President Reagan was faced with this, I                believe, when he heard that families were establishing pregnancies                so that regions of the brain could be harvested to treat Parkinson's                disease in the family.                And clearly we don't subscribe to that in any fashion.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Thank                you. We are coming up to the break and I have Paul McHugh, Mike                Gazzaniga, and we are running a little late because we started a                little late. We will take a break shortly. Paul and then Mike.                 DR. MCHUGH:  My point                is very brief, John, because you have touched upon it in several                places. But first of all, I want to thank you very much for that                coherent presentation, and I especially thank you for showing us                experimental data.                And that is what of course generates better questions to ask you.                And it is really out of that experimental work that I did have a                question. And that is what you showed us was fundamentally a xenograftic                experiment using human tissue, human cells, in rats.                And the results were very interesting, and not only was there                growth of cells, but you told us that there were trophic factors                that were probably acting in this way.                And I then wondered, and you can answer this, why was it necessary                to use human cells to demonstrate this phenomenon in a rat, and                why weren't you using rat cells to do rat experiments.                And if that is true, that you could do rat cells to do rat things                and the like, the development of the question is would it not be                wise of us to ask you all to go back and work with your rats and                your mice, and your cats and your sheep, and keep going at it, and                come back and tell us why you need human stuff to do this stuff,                okay?                 DR. GEARHART:  Okay.                We did it first with mouse cells. We don't have rat embryonic stem                cells. We did it first with the mouse and it worked.                And in our exuberance, saying, well, would the human cells work,                and they did. There is no question that I think that the mouse cells                worked better, and the mouse cells were from these neural precursors                that we had obtained that I had mentioned that we had this concern                about tumors.                But they did work, and so the only two cell types that we have                found at this point that work have very similar origins if you know                what I mean.                Clearly the paradigm has to be extended to other sources of stem                cells, adult and umbilical, and this is planned to say in this particular                paradigm will it work.                So, Paul, the answer is that we did it first with the rodent cells,                and we could pursue that. I mean, as far as looking for the growth                factors and what not.                But we have changed almost completely to the human cells for trying                to determine what those growth factors were that were secreted,                but we could do that again with the mouse, absolutely.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Mike.                 DR. GAZZANIGA:  Just                briefly, thank you again for a wonderful presentation. This moves                to another level, and that is how big is the American biomedical                engine.                And I ask that from the sense of having just taken a trip to China                and Japan, and England, and you read that Sweden and Singapore,                and India, and so forth, are going ahead.                If America dropped out of this for legal reasons that are on the                horizon, how big an impact would that have on the overall resolution                and development of these therapies?                In other words, if you just look across molecular genetics and                microbiology now, and prior to this issue arising, what is the size                and importance of the American effort?                 DR. GEARHART:  Well,                I don't think that there is any question that the investigators                funded through the National Institutes of Health, and our academic                establishments here, are the engine that drives biologic research,                biomedical research, in the world.                There is no question about it. I mean, the volume, the sheer volume                of this, is enormous. And if you look at this compared to even in                our country to what the biomedical industry, or I mean the private                industry is putting into this, it is dwarfed by the Federal funding.                And this is really what is enabling and this is why I think the                U.S. has been so far ahead. So it is essential I think to have Federal                funding into this area really to reach our goals as quickly as possible.                There is one last thing or one thing that I would like to say                to the committee, and it is understandable, but when you are in                and start in a business like this, you don't know the impact of                it.                The thousands of communications that we have received from patients,                and patient-based groups, about our work and about moving the work                along, not only is it emotional, it is unbelievable. I mean, from                the standpoint of just pure numbers, sheer numbers.                It doesn't just extend within the United States, but throughout                the world. In 1998 when we published our paper, within a few days                we had 10,000 e-mails alone about it.                And every day I still get hundreds of e-mails relating to this.                It extends not only to bona fide -- you know, many people don't                understand what this work is about.                They are contacting you for a brain, or a uterus, or from some                countries we have had requests, hundreds of requests for penises,                for example. And you are trying to figure out why -- you know, what                is the issue here.                We need education and we need informing to say that we are dealing                really with cells and tissues at this point. That is what we are                really about. It is going to be years away before it goes beyond                that.                And so what I am trying to say is that there are requests throughout                the world. So that is one issue. I mean, the pressure is enormous,                and also people offering you large sums of money to provide them                with cells outside of the arena that it should be done in. Do you                know what I mean?                There is desperation, and you see this, and it is tragic, and                as a researcher this is new to you. This is something that you are                not accustomed to and never will be accustomed to handling.                So I just wanted to let you know what that pressure is like. It                is enormous. I have boxes full of these things. I don't know what                I am going to do with them, but you try to respond.                There has been an issue with brain drain. We know that there has                been one investigator from the University of California system that                went to the U.K. and received one-and-a-half million pounds to pursue                this work in the U.K.                Well, this happened here. I will tell you that -- and I am talking                to students in our own group, you know, go to Europe for your post-doc,                and go to England for your post-doc if you want to continue in this                thing.                And I think you will see more of this, and whether major investigators                will leave, I don't think so. I think we will get through this,                and I hope that we will get through this period in this country.                There are many, many investigators, many investigators, and I                can't tell you what it is like not to be able to give a cell to                the person next door to you because of a policy.                I mean, this is just an incredible situation. I think we will                get through it, and I think we will be okay. But I am still concerned                about it. Sorry for the editorial, but I think it is important.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Charles,                did you want a quick word?                 DR. KRAUTHAMMER : If I could just ask                a very quick question. You said that you would oppose and you supported                the opposition of creating a fetus for, say, harvesting the brain                cells, and you talked about the example in the Reagan years.                On the other hand, there is no difficulty, at least in your estimation,                of using tissue from a discarded fetus already aborted, and tissue                which would otherwise be thrown away.                Would you apply that same distinction to the embryonic stage?                In other words, you now use -- you develop embryonic stem cells                from discarded embryos from IVF clinics, and would you be equally                opposed to the creation of embryos specifically for their use as                sources of embryos using that same analogy?                 DR. GEARHART:  No, I                would not be opposed to that. I don't give the same moral status                to that entity.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Well,                we have -- let me just make mention of one matter. Janet Rowley                has submitted in writing, and I would endorse, these questions if                we had enough time.                We would like your comments on what kind of regulation you think                might be or should be developed for this area, and what is the status                of government support for what kind of research, and what are the                limitations that are counterproductive.                If we could invite -- if you would be willing, and these are hard                questions and they are big questions, but if you would be willing                to respond if we put these set of questions to you, and perhaps                some others to you in a letter?                 DR. GEARHART:  Absolutely.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  I think                the committee would be very grateful for your help in thinking through                the regulatory questions, which are at the moment not what we have                here.                 DR. GEARHART:  Absolutely.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  I just                want to thank you very, very much, for an instructive morning, and                also for the wonderful spirit in which you presented your remarks                and engaged the questions. I am very grateful to you for coming.                We are running about 15 minutes behind, and we will reconvene                at a quarter-of. We have an hour-and-a-half for the second session                this morning as originally planned.                (Whereupon, at 10:33 a.m., the council was recessed and resumed                at 10:49 a.m.)                                                    SESSION 2: STEM                CELLS 2:                MEDICAL PROMISE OF ADULT STEM CELL RESEARCH (PRESENT AND PROJECTED)                 DR. CATHERINE VERFAILLIE                   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Would                the members please rejoin the meeting. While we are waiting in the                hope that our straggling colleagues will arrive, a couple of matters                of business.                If anyone has not turned in a request for a box lunch, please                do so now, and that should be in front of you. We will have lunch                in the room just down the hall where we gathered before.                The photographer who has been around here is doing individual                photographs for the commission and he will want to take individual                photos of members, and we can do that in connection with lunch.                And you will also have in front of you in addition to the materials                that Dr. Gearhart provided us, which by the way is -- and the lights                were out and so you couldn't see, but one could recapitulate his                talk with the help of the figures here, as well as checking his                article in Nature.                But you also have in front of you a revised version of Bill Hurlbut's                memorandum. This has been updated and corrected, and he would like                us to substitute it for the one that was sent around earlier this                week. Is that correct, Bill?                 DR. HURLBUT: :  Yes.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  All                right. Well, again, it is a great pleasure to welcome Dr. Catherine                Verfaillie, from the University of Minnesota. You have her curriculum                vitae in the briefing book, which you can consult.                I won't waste any more of her time by reading from it, and just                simply allow her to help educate us on the prospects of present                and projected of adult stem cells for regenerative medicine.                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  Good                morning. I would also like to start out and thank Dr. Kass and the                council to allow me to present this information on new findings                in adult stem cell biology which have been received with great excitement,                and correctly so. If they are, and they are actually set upside                down, the classical paradigms of biology, and so to be able to do                that you have to have full proof to actually be able to be in a                position like that.                If they are, and they are actually set upside down, the classical                paradigms of biology, and so to be able to do that you have to have                full proof to actually be able to be in a position like that.                As Dr. Gearhart already gave in his previous eloquent description                of what stem cells are and what they can do, and we will get back                to that to some extent at the end, although we are far away from                actually being able to use adult stem cells for clinical applications.                But what I would like to do is give you an overview of the greater                potential of adult stem cells, which has always been termed adult                stem cell plasticity, and what we do know and what we don't know.                And where this may actually lead us. Dr. Gearhart also indicated                that embryonic stem cells in humans are fairly or very much in their                infancy, the same as we are for adult stem cell biology, too, and                so I don't think we are anywhere close to be able to come up with                new therapies at this point in time.                I would also like to reiterate that even though my laboratory                and our group works on adult stem cells, we have actually actively                pursued investigators in embryonic stem cell research, human embryonic                stem cells, just so that within the same institution we would have                laboratories that have one cell, and other laboratories that have                the other cell, so we would be in a position to compare and contrast                the potential of the different cell populations, and I think that                is very important.                With that, I will actually start my presentation, and I will point                out that the work was mainly funded through the NIH, since it is                all adult stems that we are working on, and not embryonic stems.                And also a number of foundations and one pharmaceutical company.                Dr. Gearhart already gave you an overview of where embryonic stem                cells come from, and where primordial germ cells or stems come from.                And I am going to reiterate that for you.                I just put up this cartoon that Dr. Weissman published two years                ago in Science to point out a couple of things. During development,                cells in the inner cell mass make sequential decisions, and each                of these decisions is actually accompanied with gain of function,                but also loss of function.                The gain of function is that the cells learn how to become a more                specified cell type; and on the other hand, actually lose the potential                to become other cell types.                And so the decision to be made is somatic or germ cell, and within                the somatic lineage doing something that is called gastrulation,                cells decide to become the different parts of our body, whether                it is endoderm, which is the internal organs, mesoderm, which are                limbs and soft tissue, and ectoderm, which really comprise the skin,                the central and peripheral nervous system.                And within each of these groups cells again make decisions and                learn how to become stem cells for specific organs. And the stem                cells for specific organs that has been most well studied is actually                the hematopoietic stem cell, which is currently extensively being                used in clinical applications for bone marrow transplantations or                peripheral blood stem cell transplantations, or cord blood transplantations.                And so that actually has set the paradigm on how we decide what                stem cells are. Aside from hematopoietic stem cells or blood stem                cells, we have a number of investigators who have identified tissue-specific                stem cells in a number of different organs, including for instance                the brain, which we until about 10 or 20 years ago thought was a                final product when we were born.                But it is now clear that there are stem cells in the brain that                can recreate neurons and other components. There is also stem cells                in the liver, and stem cells in the gut, and there is stem cells                in the skin, and so forth.                The reason why I put this slide up is actually to point out that                these arrows have always gone down, and so we have always thought                that each time a cell decided to learn something new that it lost                the capability of doing something else.                And so if we envisioned beforehand that the arrows would be reversed,                we thought that was possible, but we associated that with classical                transformation, or actually cancer-forming cells.                So what do we know about hematopoietic stem cells and that is                really the paradigm to which I am going to try to talk through the                whole field of adult stem cells.                In hematopoietic stem cells, we can actually take a single mouse                bone marrow cell that we characterize by proteins on the cell surface,                and take that single cell, and for instance you can take it from                a mouse that is engineered to fluoresce green under a specific light,                and put that in a regular mouse, and ask whether they can reconstitute                the blood elements of that animal.                And a number of investigators have actually been able to do that.                You can take a single cell, and give it to a mouse that was lethally                irradiated so it has no blood, and this cell can recreate the red                cells, the white cells, platelets, lymphocytes, for the lifetime                of that animal.                And that is really the proof that you have a stem cell that can                self-renew, and a single cell can make multiple different things,                and it can repopulate functionally the organ that it needs to repopulate.                And so that is really the criteria that we have to hold ourselves                to, to actually talk about stem cells, and if you talk about plasticity,                you will have to hold us on the same criteria and showing that a                single cell can now make two tissues, and that this cell can make                two tissues from a single cell, and that these new cells can repopulate                a tissue functionally in vitro.                Now, over the last 5 or 6 years, there has been an enormous number                -- well, not an enormous number, but probably 40 or 50 papers now                that have come out in the scientific publications that have used                the word adult stem cell plasticity.                And what is meant by that is that you take a cell that was supposed                to be a one cell type. For instance, you take a bone marrow cell,                or you take cells that are enriched for hematopoietic stem cells.                And it appears that some of these cells may acquire characteristics                of cells outside of the organ where they came from. And so it has                been shown for bone marrow cells, or cells enriched for hematopoietic                cells, that if you transplant these into an animal that was irradiated,                and you look in tissues outside of the blood, that you can actually                find, for instance, skeletal-muscle cells, heart muscle cells, or                endothelial cells, that are now derived from this donor hematopoietic                cell.                There is also papers that have shown that if you take muscle from                an animal and mix it up in the laboratory, and culture it for a                few days, and then use the muscle tissue to give back to an animal,                that you could reconstitute the blood system in that animal.                Now, if you think in anatomical terms, this is still within one                of the three categories that I gave you at the beginning; mesoderm,                endoderm, and ectoderm, and all of this is still within the mesoderm.                So this is maybe not so hard to understand.                However, there is also papers that two different cells from bone                marrow, hematopoietic cells, and zymogenic cells, which are cells                that make bone and cartilage, can give rise to cells that appear                to have neuronal characteristics, both neurons and glial cells,                that support the structure of the brain.                And there is a number of studies that have shown that bone marrow                cells can contribute to liver, skin, lung, gut, and so forth, and                so you can pretty much put arrows in whichever way you want.                You know, people have published data that suggests that indeed                this may be possible. So obviously this goes against our paradigms                and this would say that either something strange is going on, and                just something in the last few years is something that we have actually                identified.                Now, if we want to talk about blastocyst, I started out with the                paradigm of stem cells, and so there is multiple different possibilities                here.                Either the bone marrow, which seems to be the organ that harbors                the most of these cells, harbors many, many different stem cells,                and it harbors the hematopoietic stem cells, but it also harbors                the neuro stem cell, and the liver stem cell, and so forth.                And which that would not be bad, but that truly would not be a                single stem cell that could be expanded and used to actually transplant                patients with all kinds of different organ diseases.                A second possibility is that somehow the cell can be ""de-differentiated""                and redifferentiated, depending on the environment that it is put                in, and that the hematopoietic stem cell can learn how to become                a liver if you put it in the liver, or it can learn how to become                a brain if you put it in the brain.                Or it could be that it is a remnant of embryonic stem cells or                the primordial germ cells that you heard about from Dr. Gearhart                that are left around in the body, and that under specific circumstances                can be reactivated and contribute to tissues.                And the issue of fusion has been brought up because of the two                papers recently in Nature, and the possibility is in theory that                what we see is actually that.                For instance, a hematopoietic stem cell fuses with a liver cell,                and now you actually have something that is a hybrid, but it has                actually liver characteristics.                The other questions that I am going to try to address, and I don't                have all the answers for this, is this actually clinically relevant?                You know, if you transplant bone marrow into a patient and you find                two liver cells that are derived from the patient, from the donor,                it doesn't necessarily mean that that is going to help anybody down                the line.                So the graft has to be robust and persistent, and there has to                really be proved that we don't just see cells that look like a tissue                that they end up in, but they also have to function like a tissue                that they end up in.                And then the question that I will bring back up at the end, the                first question, what is plasticity, and will that matter from a                clinical standpoint?                And so we started out in this field -- I am a hematologist, and                I do bone marrow transplantation as my clinical profession, and                I have been interested in hematopoietic stems in the bone marrow.                And about six years ago somebody in our group asked me whether                we could grow mesenchymal stem cells, which are cells that may grow                on cartilage, to treat children with a specific genetic disease                called Hurler's disease.                And when we did this, mesenchymal stems we happened to find, and                we went about trying to create these to be in compliance with GMP                qualifications, meaning we were trying to remove all sera out of                the system, and yet we were trying to use very well defined culture                systems.                And so while we were doing this, we came up with a cell that you                have heard Dr. Kass refer to as a multi-potent adult progenitor                cell, because we don't have a much better word for it.                And it will be appreciated as MAPC, and which appears to have                a much greater possibilities than the mesenchymal stem cell possibilities.                So we take these cells from bone marrow from humans, and we can                also take them from mice and from rats.                And you place these in a culture system that is very well defined,                and ingredients, and growth factors, and no serum, and low density,                and we expand the cells as much as we can by splitting the cultures                on a regular basis.                And if we do this, we have actually found that these cells appear                to have an enormous growth potential. And so here on the left-hand                side would be bone marrow from an individual, and we start with                about 10cc's or a spoon of bone marrow, deplete all the blood elements                from the bone marrow, and put it in a culture dish, and then grow                the cells for long periods of time.                Classical adult cells would actually not expand much more than                50 times or 60 cell population doublings, just because we have a                clock inside the cell that actually causes the cells to become senescent                or old once they go beyond a certain number of cell divisions.                And so in the human system, as well as in the mouse and the rat                system, we have been able to show that we can create or grow cells                that do not seem to conform to this internal aging clock.                And the cells can go beyond that and the human cells are now close                to a hundred population doublings, and in mouse and rat, over 150                population doublings.                If you look at the aging clock itself, which are the telomeres,                the telomeres are long and they do not seem to shorten in culture,                which goes again with the idea that the cells do not senesce in                culture.                So in this respect, they have characteristics that are similar                to what you would find in embryonic stem cells, but also this internal                clock is actually not working.                The phenotype of the cell is strange, and it doesn't really fit                anything in particular, but there is definitely no characteristics                in these cells.                These cells are blood hematopoietic stem cells, and I am not going                to go through all the details here, but if you do an extensive phenotype                characterization of the cells, they don't look like blood.                They have some characteristics of embryonic stem cells, but there                are a lot of other ones that they do not have. So they have some                genes that are turned on that are present also in embryonic stem                cells, which are the top two here, and then they have on the cell                surface antigens that you really only find on embryonic stem cells,                or primordial germ cells.                So in some respects again these cells have some features of embryonic                stem cells, even though we got these from the bone marrow of humans,                mice, and rats.                We then started trying to test initially all in culture dishes                what these cells could do, and we asked whether they could differentiate                in multiple different cell types.                And because our initial charge was actually to try to grow mesenchymal                cells and make bone and cartilage, that is what we did first. And                so what we showed in the culture dish is that if we switch the culture                conditions around, and actually use ingredients that are no longer                supported for maintaining the stem cells in an undifferentiated                state, by actually switch them such that we hope that we can turn                on the genetic programs to make bone or cartilage, and so forth,                we could indeed do this.                And this is no different than the classical mesenchymal stems                that have been described. So we can induce the cells to become bone,                and if we say that they differentiated into bone tissue, it is actually                a calcified tissue at the bottom of a dish.                We can induce the cells to become cartilage that looks like articular                cartilage, even though it isn't very well organized. And you can                induce the cells to become lipid-laden lipocytes, and we can induce                them to become skeletal muscle cells.                And these cells can actually fuse and make long muscle tubes almost,                and we can induce the cells to express a number of muscle markers                for the heart, even though we haven't really seen beating cells.                And so we don't really know whether these cells are heart muscle                cells. So this is still not that strange, because there is this                cell in the bone marrow that has been identified that can do this.                Now, we found three other lineages that are completely outside                of the mesenchymal lineage, and some of this has been published,                and most of it is actually in press currently.                One of the things that we found is that these cells can differentiate                into cells that line blood vessels, which we call endothelial cells.                And we have been able to show that these cells differentiate into                cells that look like endothelial cells, but also function as endothelial                cells.                And as shown in this picture here is actually a blood vessel from                an animal that had a tumor underneath the skin, and we actually                infused human endothelial cells derived from human MAPCs in this                animal, and showed that these endothelial cells seek out the tumor                and actually help create new blood vessels in the tumor, which the                tumor needs otherwise it can't grow.                And so this proves that these cells that are in the bone marrow                can differentiate into cells that can make endothelium. More surprisingly                is that the cells can differentiate into cells that look like neutrons,                look like astrocytes, and support themselves in the brain, and to                some extent function like these cells in the brain.                And so we show here that they differentiated into cells that look                like neurons and have electrophysiological characteristics like                neurons.                And so this is the second major layer of the embryo, and then                we also have been able to show that we can make these cells differentiate                into cells that look like liver cells, and actually function like                liver cells in a culture dish.                And so this would mean that this cell population, these MAPC cells,                can actually differentiate into all of the major components of a                human being, even though we only show a few cell lineages here.                I am not going to go through this in too much detail because it                is highly technical, but essentially we have not been able to use                genetic marking to prove that this could all be derived from a single                cell, and we don't depend on population of cells.                So this fulfills two of the criteria of a stem cell. A single                cell can differentiate and grow for long periods of time, and can                differentiate into multiple different tissue cells.                Two more sets of experiments were done to try to gauge the potential                of these cells. The first one was done in an chimeric animal model,                in which we took the adult cells, and injected even a single adult                cell into the blastocyst of a mouse and asked what would happen                in this mouse, and whether we would see contribution to some tissues,                no tissues, or all tissues.                So we injected a single cell or we injected 10 to 12 cells, and                shown here are two animals. The top one is obviously and the donor                cells here have a gene that if you stain it correctly the cells                turn blue.                So what we did is we let the animals get born, and we looked at                the animals by genetic tools to try to figure out if there were                donor cells in multiple different organs.                And we also then took the mouse and actually cut a thin slice                through the middle of the animal and asked which organs would have                blue cells contributing to the mouse.                The top mouse is an animal that if you looked in the tail by genetic                tools that we couldn't find any donor cells, and the bottom mouse                here, this is its head, and over here would be his tail, and you                can see the spine, and the brain, and all the internal organs.                And you can see that the majority of all the tissues of this animal                actually appear to be derived from a single blue adult cell that                we have put into the blastocyst.                The efficiency isn't a hundred percent, and this is shown on the                bottom here, and so if you look over here, and if you put in one                cell per blastocyst, 60 percent of the animals will not be chimeric,                but 30 percent or 40 percent of the animals will be chimeric to                varying degrees.                If you increase the cell number the chimericism goes up. So this                is probably not quite as good as embryonic stem cells, but it is                a fairly significant degree of chimericism, and actually the frequency                appears to be one in three cells.                So this would suggest that the cells can probably make under the                right circumstances more cell types than we have be able to prove                in a culture dish.                We can also ask if we now take these stem cells and give them                to a mouse that is born, and we give here again cells from the donors'                mouse, which again are blue, and we gave these to an animal that                was either not irradiated or irradiated with a small amount of radiation                therapy in the hope that maybe that would help the cells engraft.                We used an immune-deficient recipient mouse, just because we were                worried that the new genes that are in the blue mouse might actually                be a basis for rejection. So we don't know what would happen in                a non-immumodeficient mouse.                If we do this, what we found is that we do find engraftment in                some tissues, but not all. So, for instance, in the top panel, we                see that there is engraftment between 3 and 9 percent in the hematopoietic                system of this mouse, and we can find the cells, and the blood we                can find in the bone marrow, and we can bind them in the spleen.                And if we look in these animals, we can also find over here, and                what we did is we actually -- the blue color, we used an antibody                that is now green, and co-labeled it with a red stain that stains                the specific tissue.                And you can see in the liver that there is areas in the liver                where donor cells appear to be present. And there is areas in the                guts, in the villae of the gut, where donor cells appear to be present.                And there is areas in the lung where donor cells appear to be                present. The presence of these cells can be seen anywhere from four                weeks after transplantation, all the way to 24 weeks, which is about                six months, and the unfortunate thing with the mouse model that                we use is that these mice usually die from lymphomas at an early                age because of the deficiency that they have.                So we really have not been able to extend the cultures or have                the mouse experiments beyond 6 months, and so we are actually trying                to go further.                We transplant the cells in an animal that is 6 to 8 weeks old,                and so it is not a very young mouse, and it is also not an old mouse.                What we showed is that if you damage certain tissues like the hematopoietic                system, and the gut system, that you have increased engraftment,                which is consistent with the fact that these cells go to places                where the repair might be needed.                However, we did not see in this mouse model engraftment in a number                of other tissues, and mind you that we gave these cells IV to an                intact mouse, which actually was not damaged in any way, shape,                or form.                And we don't see engraftment in the heart, skeletal muscle, or                brain, and these tissues do not proliferate. We also don't see engraftment                in the skin and the kidney, and so these organs we didn't really                see very much engraftment.                However, if you infused the cells directly in the muscle, which                causes damage, and actually done the cells in response to the local                cues within the muscle, appear to be able to differentiate into                muscle cells.                So it appears that these cells have the ability and blastocyst                experiment to give rise to many, many different tissue types, if                given post-natally, and we gave them as stem cells, not as differentiated                cells.                They appear to be able to respond at least in some respects to                cues that are present in certain organs to differentiate into the                cell type that is specific for that organ.                We have looked carefully at the cells in culture and we do not                see a significant number of gross genetic abnormalities. We have                not looked with a very fine-toothed comb through whether there might                be some minor genetic abnormalities over time and culture, and these                studies are ongoing.                If we infused the MAPCs in animals, we really do not see any tumors,                and so far we have not seen that there are tumors that Dr. Gearhart                talked about, and we also have not seen any other tumors.                Obviously if these cells come from bone marrow there is lots of                precedent on bone marrow transplantations, where actually if you                do this, actually you do not cause tumors in patients.                So MAPC that we have identified in our laboratory seems to be                a cell that is not senescing and that can be found in adult tissues                of humans, as well as mouse and rats, and they seem to be capable                of giving rise to cells from the three germ layers, and it can engraft                in vitro in a limited number of tissues.                Now, what I cannot tell is whether these cells actually exist                as such in a person, in a mouse, or in a rat, or whether our culture                condition is actually such that it, quote, reprograms or dedifferentiates                the cells that we take out of the animal, and that then acquire                this much more greater potential, and I will come back to that in                just one second.                So we now go back to my initial definition of what is plasticity,                which is really at the bottom of all of the adult stem cell excitement.                I mentioned initially that we would have to show that this is a                single cell of a rat, and I think the majority of papers so far                published have actually really not been able to prove that a single                cell could, for instance, give rise to blood and muscle.                In vitro, we have evidence for that, and in the blastocyst injection,                we took a single cell and actually found multiple different tissues.                You could ask, well, does it matter?                Does it matter if there are multiple different cell types in the                bone marrow, and I think ultimately from an FDA or regulatory standpoint,                it will matter, and we will have to be able to say exactly what                cells that we are using to be able to acquire a certain function                in vitro, and so I think that will be important.                The second question is, is the differentiation or is the remnant                ES, and again you could say, well, it probably doesn't matter. But                I think at this point in time, I don't think anybody in this field                knows whether these are left-over early stem cells like ES cells,                or whether these cells are cells that can be reprogrammed, and redifferentiated,                and dedifferentiated under certain circumstances.                Now, does it matter? Well, you heard from Dr. Gearhart that embryonic                stem cells as such, and not necessarily the differentiated progeny,                but the ES cells themselves can cause teratomas, and even though                nobody in the adult stem cell plasticity era has actually shown                teratomas, it doesn't mean that it might not happen.                If it is dedifferentiation, it means that you reprogram or you                change the genetic material in a cell. But if you do that, currently                we have no proof that we actually change something and actually                cause an oncogene or something like that to be activated, but that                is definitely within the possibilities, and that definitely needs                to be looked at carefully.                Is it fusion? All the in vitro work that has been published, including                the data that I have shown to you today, I couldn't prove beyond                any doubt that that is not based on fusion.                Our in vitro data, we have never co-cultured things with anything.                So we have single cells that are deployed that can do multiple different                things, and so we can't really ascribe that to fusion.                However, in vitro, I couldn't prove it to you today, and we are                doing studies to try to address this. I think that fusion might                be the reason why some studies in which a lot of pressure has been                put on to the system, which is essentially what those two papers                had to do in vitro.                So we have a lot of pressure exerted to have that one cell survive                after it fuses, and that is a possibility. Also, single cells that                are found, rather than whole colonies, may also be the result of                fusion, more so than experiments where you see huge colonies arise                in an in vivo model.                And so I think we currently cannot exclude the possibility that                some of the data is as a result of fusion. Some would say does it                matter, and I think it matters a whole lot, even though some investigators                say, well, if you fuse the cells and it functions properly, it probably                doesn't matter.                But I think ultimately that we do need to make sure that we understand                the whole mechanism underlying everything. And is all this plasticity                clinically relevant?                And so the majority of studies published to date have actually                shown the very low numbers of tissue differentiated cells can be                found in multiple different tissues.                A number of papers have been published, two in particular. The                paper by Lagasse, et al., where they show that they could rescue                an animal with liver failure by bone marrow transplantation, but                they have significant degrees of engraftment.                So that definitely was up to 80 or 90 percent of the liver could                be replaced by bone marrow cells. And a paper by Don Orlic showing                that if they injected stem cells into the heart that was infarcted                that a significant amount of donor cells would be found in the heart.                And in the data that I have shown you, that we have up to 5 to                9 percent of the differentiated tissue that seems to be derived                from the graft.                However, the majority of studies again haven't really addressed                the other question in plasticity, meaning is it in vitro functional                differentiation?                And there is really only a single study that has been able to                show that, and it is again the same study by Lagasse, et al., who                showed that if you did bone marrow transplantation in an animal                that had a failing liver, you could rescue the animal and take it                off the drugs that kept it alive.                Some studies have shown that there is functional improvement,                although the mechanism for the functional improvement isn't completely                known, and that is to some extent similar to what you heard from                Dr. Gearhart.                And so there is a number of studies who have injected cells in                adults in organs and have shown, for instance, that there was improvement                in the neuronal function, and that there was improvement in heart                function, although there is no proof that the cells, per se, were                actually responsible for doing this.                And the question will be is this acceptable from a clinical standpoint,                and if you show only functional improvement without knowing the                mechanism for knowing why we see functional improvement, and in                the long term, again, that is not a tenable situation, and we really                have to dig into this much further.                So what can adult stem cells be used for? Well, I think like embryonic                stem cells, or primordial germ cells as you heard from Dr. Gearhart,                the cells are good tools to study five basic principles in biology.                And we can study self-renewal, and we can study differentiation                and redifferentiation if that is indeed the case, and learn what                the implications for that are.                And actually try to understand how organs are being created, and                what the genetic programs are that you need to turn on. The cells,                like other stem cell populations, could be used for drug discovery,                for drug toxicity screening.                Adult stem cells could be used as systemic therapies, and currently                systemic therapies are done with adult stem cells. Bone marrow transplantation                is done every day in many, many institutions around the world, and                so we can infuse these cells if we do not think that they make tumors.                So since adult stem cells don't seem to have that as their side                effect, theoretically, we could genetically correct cells for patients                who have deficiencies of certain enzymes. And the disease, and Hurler's                disease would be one example, and a second possibility would be,                for instance, in hemophilia, where you need to have a cell that                produces clotting factors.                Or other congenital diseases, like Alpha-1-Antitrypsin deficiency,                or it could be used for systemic cell therapy, which you would have                to treat in many, many different places in the human being. For                instance, muscular dystrophy.                So if you had a stem cell that was able to engraft in most muscles,                and you could genetically correct it, you could correct that disease                in patients with that disease.                Systemic cell therapy may be more complicated with cells that                have the inherent capability of making teratomas just because you                would always run the risk that teratomas might show up.                And then again if this field progresses further, the same diseases                that has been quoted for embryonic stem cell therapies would also                be on the list here, and if indeed the cells can differentiate into                functional neuron cells, they could be used to treat Parkinson's                disease and many other ones.                And since the cells can appear to be able to differentiate into                functional liver cells, they could be used either in vivo to replace                the liver, but also would be very useful to make bioartificial livers,                for instance.                We have shown, and others have shown, that cells from bone marrow                can contribute to new blood vessels, and so this could be harnessed                to create new blood vessels in vivo, or actually the opposite; lower                these cells with anti-cancer agents, and actually use them in a                anti-angiogenesis approach for treatment of cancer, and then many                other diseases.                Again, we are not anywhere close to being able to do this in any                way, shape, or form, and a lot of basic research still needs to                go on.                So the first point that was on my previous slide, we really need                to spend a lot of time in trying to understand what these cells                are and aren't.                And at the same time, start thinking about how we might be able                to scale these up under GMP conditions that conform with regulatory                agencies, and we will have to ask the question, as with any other                stem cell population, whether we will use the cells as stem cells,                or as more mature cells that have been educated to some extent to                become the final product are totally mature cells.                And then again perform large scale culture systems or develop                large scale culture systems. And then the last question is whether                we should use these cells in an autologous setting or in an allogeneic                setting.                Obviously adult stem cells for a number of diseases could be used                in an autologous setting. However, if they were to be capable of                repairing hearts, and you have a heart infarct today, we would not                have adult stem cells sitting around instead of your own to treat                you at that moment in time.                So I think there are some issues, and Dr. Gearhart also brought                up the idea that with diabetes, for instance, in Type-1, is an immune                problem, and again autologous transplantation may not be the way                to go.                I think that for adult stem cells, the initial trials may well                be autologous, but that in the long term, to make it more cost effective                and more available to many patients with certain frequent diseases,                that it might have to be an allogeneic therapy, and then we are                actually faced with the same questions that investigators that work                with ES cells, and primordial germ cells are faced with. I think                I will stop there. Thank you.                (Applause.)                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Thank                you very much, Dr. Verfaillie, for a clear, lucid, orderly presentation,                and it is very helpful to us. The floor is open for questions, comments,                discussion. Elizabeth Blackburn, please.                 DR. BLACKBURN:  Thank                you. Could I just ask a couple of quick clarifications. Dr. Gearhart                mentioned in response to Bill Hurlbut's question the difference                between fetally derived human cells and mouse embryonic stem cells                with respect to their teratoma producing properties.                And I could not quite gather whether it is human embryonic stem                cells that are also known to have any teratoma producing properties.                Could you clarify that for me, because you also had mentioned this,                and I wasn't sure if you were referring to the mouse embryonic stem                cell work or the human.                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  If                you use either mouse or human embryonic stem cells without predifferentiating                them into a committed progenitor cell, and you use the stem cells                as such, they will form teratomas, because it is one of the tools                that investigators use that an embryonic stem cell has that capability.                So they will form teratomas.                 DR. BLACKBURN:  And                then post-differentiation?                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  I think                there is very little data on the human embryonic stem cells, post-differentiation                in vivo, and whether there is still the tendency for these cells                to make teratomas.                 DR. BLACKBURN:  And                the second question, since I promised that I would ask you about,                is the fusion issue, and which of course you have raised in your                talk as well, but again a question of clarification for me, and                maybe expanding on your point that you said, well, fusions are going                to be problematic.                I mean, the thing that immediately occurred to me was that these                fusions, as reported from the in vitro culture, and I believe from                engraftment into mice, that they showed aneuploidy, which of course                anybody being a hallmark of tumor cells.                So I wondered if those issues and perhaps others were things you                could tell us a bit more about when you mentioned that you had concerns                about the fusions.                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  Well,                I think it is something that because of the papers that were published                that elegantly showed that if you took a somatic cell, an adult                hematopoietic stem cell or brain stem cell, and co-cultured it with                embryonic stem cells, and then put quite a bit of selectable pressure                on the system in the culture dish, they proved that an embryonic                stem cell quality could be transferred to the blood brain stem cell.                And initially they interpreted this as being reprogramming of                the cell. But then it turned out that there were four sets of chromosomes,                and that the cells fused.                And they took these fused cells and gave them to -- injected them                into a blastocyst as hyperdiploid as cells with four sets of chromosomes.                One group was not able to create chimeric animals, and the second                group, under the direction of Dr. Austin Smith, were able to create                chimeras in the mice that were what he calls unbalanced, meaning                that he saw a contribution to tissues, and that four sets of chromosomes                are actually tolerated.                For instance, the liver, where at least 50 percent of the cells,                actually half, have two nuclei. So I think that currently no investigator                who has worked with adult stem cells has set up the right experiment                to actually be able to disprove that it isn't fusion.                I would argue that the data that I showed today in vitro, where                single cells make three layers of the embryo, and these were euploid                cells, meaning that they had a normal set of chromosomes, and which                done in human, mouse, and rat, at the single cell level, we can                make the three major layers of the embryo.                So that would go against the argument that at least in vitro,                that all of it is caused by fusion. In vivo, in our blastocyst experiments,                1 in 3 cells could do it, which is much higher than the one in a                million cells that were quoted in the two papers that were in Nature,                but which indicated that one bone marrow cell out of a million could                actually make a fused cell population.                And I think one in 50,000 neural stem cells could actually cause                fusion. So that was a very rare event; whereas, our events are higher.                We are in the process of actually going back to these animals --                that we have cryopreserved, to try to identify that since some of                the transplants were done female into male, we should be able to                prove that we do not find the y chromosome in the engrafted areas                and in the chimeric areas, which would get at the question whether                it is caused by fusion.                And so I think we really need to set up experiments where we have                generic markers on both sides, meaning the donor and the recipient,                so that we can prove beyond any doubt that the in vivo results would                be the results from a fusion.                 DR. BLACKBURN:  Yes,                I totally agreement with that. I think the in vitro, and I am very                impressed by the in vitro results, and as you said, there are questions                in vivo.                I think in-part my question was addressing this issue, and I was                asking about the tumor forming ability or otherwise, because it                was not exactly 4N. It was the median number of chromosomes was                different from simply 4N, suggesting that there was aneuploidy,                and for example, one might not find Y chromosomes, for example,                because those had been selectively lost.                So one would probably have to do much more extensive genome-wide                analysis of both of those to be sure that there wasn't some genetic                contribution from the recipient cells.                But I certainly am very impressed as you say with the in vitro                results, and they seem quite unequivocal, and I guess which is the                question that you are addressing, and we will find out as the in                vitro --                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  Yes,                and I think we need to set up the experiments where we have on multiple                chromosomes genetic markers. You know, sequences that we can distinguish                the donor and recipient between. So these experiments need to be                repeated.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Questions?                Janet Rowley, please.                 DR. ROWLEY:  Well, I                would like to ask a question that will include both Elizabeth, as                well as Catherine, because I was struck in the data that you presented                on your human cell lines that you had passed for more than a hundred                generations, that telomerase was still active.                And I just am curious about that, because many of us do believe                that that is, if you will, the internal clock that limits the number                of doublings that those particular cells can undergo.                And you derive these from adults, presumably young adults in human,                but at least adults, and I am curious as to what you thought about                the mechanism of preserving the telomerase activity, and maybe if                Liz would have any further comments on that, because again one of                the critical features and potential limitations of adult stem cells                is the fact that they would have potentially fewer doublings than                would those derived from embryos.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Could                I ask as a favor to the non-scientists in the group if someone would                just give an ABCs on the telomerase matter, and just very, very                briefly, so that everybody can understand what the discussion is                about. Elizabeth, or Dr. Verfaillie, if you could just give the                barest --                 DR. BLACKBURN:  I am                the worst person, because I will fall into expert jargonese and                so I will try not to. So, telomerase keeps the DNA at the ends of                chromosomes replenished, and such replenishment is necessary, because                each time one of our cells divides, the DNA at the end of the chromosome                is a little bit whittled away.                So, telomerase keeps putting back a little extra DNA on to the                ends of the chromosomes each time on average a cell divides. So                the issue that Catherine pointed out in her talk was that if you                don't have telomerase after a number of cell multiplications, that                whittling away process would have gone too far, and that sends a                signal to cells to cease dividing.                And so many, many normal cells in culture are characterized by                the inability to keep on multiplying. Did that clarify the question?                So many cells do not keep multiplying because they turn the cells'                telomerase off as part of their natural differentiated state.                Cancer cells, on the other hand, have telomerase, almost in a                great majority of the cases, and very up-regulated, and cells of                the hematopoietic system -- and I will defer to Catherine on this                -- have an interesting intermediate situation, where they have regulated                telomerase activity that is turned on in a natural and regulated                way as the cells multiply in response to signals in the body. Is                that fair to say?                 DR. ROWLEY:  Yes.                 DR. BLACKBURN:  So I                think it is a very interesting question of why telomerases is turned                on in those cells that are multiplying so well in culture, and has                there been a selective event that has allowed those cells, that                for some reason have turned their telomerases on in the culture                conditions.                But those are the cells that are outgrowing perhaps others in                the population, and perhaps that question might be answered by what                is the clonal efficiency with which you get these lines growing                out. You may already know this.                 DR. ROWLEY:  But can                I intervene, because you assured that it was often turned on, and                maybe these cells are identified because they never turned telomerases                off.                 DR. BLACKBURN:  Yes,                and I don't know if that is the typical situation when one puts                cells into culture, and I thought that they more often would turn                off and an earlier subset would keep multiplying, and again I want                you to correct me on that cell growth phenomenon.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Thank                you.                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  So                currently we do not know whether it is often turned back on in culture.                If we look at the cultures, for the first 40 population doublings,                the cells appear to grow slightly faster.                And then a second wave of cells grows out and it grows slightly                slower. So initially we thought that maybe the more classical senescing                cells were disappearing, and that those were the cells that were                growing faster, and the you then select for the cell that has inherent                -- you know, has the system turned on to not be subject to the clock                of aging.                The frequency with which we can grow out the cells from human                bone marrow is we believe one in a million bone marrow cells. So                it is a very rare event, and so it will be quite difficult to actually                specifically ask whether it is turned on and then back off, or turned                off and then back on, unless we can actually do some genetic trapping                experiments to try to ask the question.                 DR. BLACKBURN:  I'm                thinking of David Beaches' experiments in which he was able to show                that cells would spontaneously, if you keep them in culture, turn                their telomerases back on, because that gives them some selective                advantage.                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  Right.                 DR. BLACKBURN:   And                so I was wondering if such selected advantages occur in your situation?                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  It                could well be, and so the culture conditions are very particular,                and so I didn't go into too much detail.                But if you do anything wrong to the culture conditions, we cannot                create the cell lines, and so it might well be that it is what we                call in my lab a cultural artifact what we see, which would mean                that these cells may not exist really as such, but actually are                induced to become this long-term proliferating cell by the culture                conditions that we put them under.                 DR. BLACKBURN:  Thank                you.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Janet,                again, please.                 DR. ROWLEY:  I have                two more questions. One is a follow-up of a question that I asked                you about a year-and-a-half ago, on whether out of your MAPC cells                you can get hematopoietic tissue.                 DR. VERFAILLIE:   Well,                I think I showed you in vivo that if you infuse the cells into mice                that were either not irradiated or sub-irradiated, that the cells                appear to be able to differentiate into hematopoietic elements that                have red cell, and granulocytic markers.                In vitro, we have had more difficulty to try to do that, even                though it appears now that we can at least get for people who don't                understand this, but what would be yolk sac hematopoiesis, even                though we haven't really seen hematopoiesis that would occur in                the embryo proper.                But we can find cells that look like the cells that have been                created at the earlier stages of development, where the initial                one is made, which is in the yolk sac.                 DR. ROWLEY:  And the                other question is more a more practical question. I don't know precisely                how many cells would be required to treat an adult patient with                a particular disease, and are the number of cells required, or what                kind of limitations, using your system, would be faced if you have                not one patient, but hundreds or thousands of patients that could                benefit from a particular therapy?                Is this really going to be an applicable strategy?                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  I think                it is a bit too early currently to really be able to answer that                question. We have been able to take cell populations and have them                undergo 80 to a hundred population doublings, which is really if                you were able to do that and not throw cells away along the way,                it is 10 to the 50th cells or something like that.                So it is an enormous number of cells that you can in theory create.                What I didn't go into too much detail on is that the way that we                have to grow these cells is under very low density conditions, meaning                that the cells have to be far away from one another, or otherwise                they do not maintain their undifferentiated state.                Which is quite different from embryonic stem cells, which tend                to grow in tight clusters. From a bioengineering standpoint, meaning                scaling it up to making hundreds of millions of cells, will be a                major bioengineering question of how we can actually adjust the                system to be able to do that.                But on theoretical grounds, you know, if you could overcome all                the bioengineering problems, you should be able to create enough                cells to treat multiple individuals, rather than a single individual                at a time.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Question.                Robert and then Mike.                 PROF. GEORGE:  Just                a very quick question of clarification in response to Janet's first                point. On this question of whether they were -- whether the teleomerases                were turned off and then turned back on in the culture.                If it is not that, and if that's not what is happening, the other                possibility is that they were never off to begin with?                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  Correct.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Mike                Gazzaniga.                 DR. GAZZANIGA:  Again,                thank you for a very excellent talk and a cautious talk I thought.                I thought it would be helpful for us to understand the new pressures                of a biologist like yourself, which are the following.                Here you have this fantastically interesting finding, and up until                5 or 10 years ago, the normal way that such things would be treated                is you publish the work in peer review, and then you make the stuff,                whether it is reagents, or whether it is cell lines available to                others for reproducibility.                And that is a normal sequence of events that we are all familiar                with. And now we have the bio-med inserting itself into these laboratories,                where all of a sudden it becomes proprietary goods from this work.                When the original media picked up on your story, and I guess it                was The New Scientist, there was this cryptic little paragraph in                there about how they had seen the patent on some of this work, which                is a very complete description, and how does that -- what is going                on here?                How can -- and this is where I would like to go obviously, and                obviously it is good for everybody here to get these cell lines                that you have out to other labs, and reproducibility, and then the                process goes forward.                Are you constrained in some way, and has life been made complicated                because you didn't have full public funding and you had to use this                other money, or was that your own? What is going on?                 DR. VERFAILLIE:   So                the work was really done at the university with NIH funds and university                funds, and so there was really no private funds, except for the                small amount from the company that was listed in the beginning,                has gone into the work that we have done.                And because of the possible importance of the observation, the                university, as well as myself, thought we should get some kind of                protection, even though I am not sure that you can truly patent                stem cells, because all of us have them.                But just such that we would be in a position to work with biotech                companies to be able to produce large-scale numbers of cells and                things like that, which is hard to be funded to known private funds.                So there is patents pending on the cell population. Currently,                that really has not precluded us of collaborating with other institutions,                or investigators within the same institution.                So they have collaborations with 10 or 15 different groups within                the U.S., or outside of the U.S., depending upon the expertise that                we need, to try to recreate the cells in other laboratories, and                actually use their expertise, since I am a hematologist, and not                a liver physician or a neuro scientist.                And to actually be able to use expertise in other people's laboratories                to move the research forward. So there are some minimal ties attached                to working with the cells, but I think it isn't overcomeable, and                it really has not been an issue with other academic investigators                to collaborate with them.                And teaching people from those labs to come and to grow the cells,                and at least start working with the cells. But it is a very complicated                and it is a -- and I have had myself a lot of problems in trying                to find the right patent between potential biotech interests and                academic interests.                 DR. GAZZANIGA:  Right,                and you are not alone in that dilemma. So are there other MPAC lines                at other institutions now that behave like yours, or is yours still                the Golden Grail here?                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  We                have given out the mouse, and to some extent, human MAPC lines to                other investigators who are now setting the lines back up. We are                also explaining and teaching people how to create them from beginning                bone marrow.                And I know that there is one group in Japan who I think pretty                much as the system set back up from human bone marrow. You know,                they still need to do some additional studies to prove that it is                really MAPCs, but we trained a person from there for 3 or 4 months                in my lab, and they went back to Japan, and were able to it appears                to recreate them.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Could                I ask a couple of sort of semi-scientific and semi-practical questions?                How hard is it -- I mean, you have just indicated that not many                people have already been able to do this, but how hard is it to                find these cells?                And by which I mean two pieces, and in how many individuals in                which you look for them can you find them? And how hard is it to                find -- how rare are they, and how hard is it to find in any particular                individual?                Both of these questions bear upon at least a preliminary assessment                of how useful this might be clinically speaking down the road, although                things could change where you might be able to enhance the yield.                But could you give us a preliminary sense of this?                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  I think                we have studied now between 70 and 80 normal humans to try to identify                the cells. The age range, the youngest donor was two, and the oldest                donor was 55. The majority are young adults who want some money                to donate bone marrow at the universities.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  The                two-year old?                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  No,                the 20 year olds. The 2 year old actually did a bone marrow donation                for a sibling who needed a bone marrow transplantation. So we have                been able to create the cells I would say in about 70 percent of                the individuals that we have looked at.                Whether that means that the other 30 percent didn't have it, or                there was some technical issue that came about, and we were not                able to create them, we start out with 10 milliliters of bone marrow,                and we would usually find a few clones that can actually grow out.                And so really the frequency is quite low, and it is one in a million,                and that is at least the estimate that we have right now. But there                is lots of bone marrow and so one in a million isn't an impossible                task to do it.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  And                could I also follow up on the question of these cells and their                promise, assuming the best, and the embryonic stem cells, assuming                their best.                This is not a question of whether one should prefer one line of                research or another, or whether we should now go ahead with them.                But is there anything specific that you could imagine could not                be done therapeutically with these MAPC cells that you would then                need cells derived from embryonic tissue to do?                Or is this in the rosiest division, is this really a substitute,                and one that might even have the rejection problem solved if I am                dreaming?                And this is not a question about whether the other research should                go forward, but really what is the best promise of this research                so that at least we can think about it?                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  Well,                I think that the data that we have in vitro suggests that we can                create cells of the three germ layers of the embryo, and so theoretically,                you could envision that you might be able to make more than we have                done so far.                We have made liver-like cells, and brain-like cells, and epithelial                cells, and we have not tried all the other ones. In vivo, the blastocyst                experiment, unless that is a fusion event, and if it isn't a fusion                event, would indicate that the cells hold the inherent promise of                making all the different cell types that make up the tissues, the                somatic tissues of an animal.                So again that would suggest that is under -- that if we changed                culture conditions further that we might be able to, for instance,                create insulin-producing beta cells, which we haven't done, or create                two heart muscle cells that function like heart muscle cells, and                don't just look like it.                So if all these promises hold true, and if we continue the cultures                and they can be expanded even further into 80 or 90 population doublings,                and so there are lots of ifs here, they may be able to be used to                treat a large number of diseases.                The problem at this point in time is that there is so many ifs                that it is a very difficult question to specifically answer.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Of course,                and I appreciate that, and on the question of the longlivedness,                or the half-life of these things, you have gone through -- in vitro                is what? It is what?                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  From                80 to 100 population doublings.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  And                it is obviously too early to say how much longer, and whether those                conditions are matched in vivo. But when the people say that the                promise in terms of longevity for cells derived from the adults                is really much less, is there anything to be said on that question                of the basis of knowledge now had?                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  Human                embryonic stem cells have been kept in culture now for 350 or 400                population doublings. So that is 3 or 4 times as long as the adult                cells. So we are striving to go there, but we just need time to                do that.                Are these cells going to be able to do that? As far as we can                tell, after 80 population doublings, there is no shortening of telomeres,                and so that means that there is at least another 50 or 60 left.                If for some reason telomerase is shut off along the way for reasons                that we currently don't know why that might be, then the longevity                would be less than what has been shown for embryonic stem cells.                Now, for classical adult stem cells, if you take hematopoietic                stem cells that make blood, but not something else, they would not                go for 80 population doublings.                So there is something special about these cells, that they can                overcome this senescent block at 60 or 70 population doublings,                which is actually long for any other adult stem cell.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Thank                you very much. Questions or comments? Janet again, please.                 DR. ROWLEY:  Coming                back again to partly the real world in this iffy situation, and                it is a question of the practicality for treatment for particular                individuals.                It seems to me that the notion that you might be able to derive                these MAPC cells from an individual who had some medical problem                might have some limitations because it probably takes 3 to 6 months,                or so to get enough cells to then be able to use them therapeutically                in that individual, and that is always assuming that the individual                has some kind of a somatic disease, and not the basic underlying                genetic problem.                So then the way to get around that if it really is 3 to 6 months,                and you don't have that window of time, would be to do somatic cell                nuclear transplant. Now, have you ever tried that in your MAPC cells?                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  In                collaboration with Dr. Jaenisch, and two weeks from now we will                try the mouse MAPC cells in mouse eggs, and ask whether the efficiency                of nuclear transfer would be closer to what you would see with embryonic                stem cells, and where the efficiency is much, much, much higher                than if you use a classical adult cell.                And that might improve efficiency of making cloned embryonic stem                cells.                 DR. ROWLEY:  But I am                thinking of the other experiment. You have a patient who is desperately                ill, and so you would have cells from that patient, and you would                want to use the nucleus of the patient's cells into your MAPC cells,                and so that is a different thing.                You have got these cell lines, and how can you make them more                compatible with the patient, and agreeing that you can't get rid                of the mitochondrial problem unless you do additional manipulations                and strategies.                But have you ever tried to replace the nucleus in your MAPC cell                with a nucleus from an adult somatic cell?                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  No,                we have not yet.                 DR. ROWLEY:  Do you                plan to?                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  We                might.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  We could                always get everyone at the age of 15 to put away a little bit of                marrow for the time that we might need it.                 DR. ROWLEY:  Another                reason to save cord blood.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  This                is your chance, council members. This is a wonderful opportunity.                Questions?                 DR. ROWLEY:  Well, I                would just be interested from Catherine's point of view on her answers                to some of the questions, to the two questions that I posed at the                end to John Gearhart, and again give her the option to do this as                a written response rather than a direct response, but I think it                may be easier to -- and the second question, which may be very simple                to answer in terms of the kinds of restrictions that you find now                in funding.                And I would assume since you are dealing with adult cells that                there aren't any, but I would be interested in your perspective                on the funding, in both government and other agencies.                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  Well,                currently for the work that is ongoing in my group, which works                with adult stem cells, actually the amount of funding that has become                available through the NIH has increased dramatically over the last                few years to support this kind of research.                So that has not been a problem. I have wanted to compare these                cells carefully with embryonic stem cells, and so we are in a position                currently to do this in a mouse, but mice aren't humans.                And so we have really not been able to do that until earlier this                year when human embryonic stem cell research was allowed in academic                institutions under NIH funding.                And as I mentioned, we had actually gone out and tried to recruit                an investigator with that kind of expertise to be in a position                to try to address some of the questions that have come up here,                and are these cells going to be equipotent.                And I think to date, even though they are exciting and they seem                to be quite potent, I can't really say whether that is the case.                And so ultimately we won't be able to answer this question until                we can truly compare them and not across country borders, but actually                within the same institution, where people can look at the two cell                populations at the same time.                And so in that respect, I think that the lack of funding for embryonic                stem cell research in humans has made it impossible up until just                recently to be able to do that.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Michael                Sandel.                 PROF. SANDEL:  I wonder                if I could put to you the same question I put to the previous speaker.                Given that some people regard embryonic stem cell research as morally                problematic, what would you think of the idea of imposing a moratorium                on embryonic stem cell research until we could assess what might                be achieved by adult stem cell research?                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  I think                that my answer is very much in line with what you heard from Dr.                Gearhart. I think that the main reason why we -- to investigate                in the field of embryonic stem cell -- human embryonic stem cell                research is to be able to compare and contrast the two cell populations                at the same time.                I also think that what we did in our culture dishes to try to                differentiate these MAPCs into liver-like cells or neuronal-like                cells is really based on what has been learned from mainly the mouse                embryonic stem cell field, where investigators have been able to                take these cells and drive them in vitro to become certain cell                types, even though that is not a hundred percent fool-proof, and                it is not completely figured out how you should do that.                So I think if you have a number of different cell populations                at the same time, we try to test all these different questions.                What we learned in adult cells might be applicable to embryonic                stem cells if they are the cells that ultimately will be the suitable                source for our clinical applications or the other way around.                And so I think stopping research in one field actually will slow                down research in the other field, and it would be either way. In                other words, if you stop our research in adult cells, or embryonic                stems, as I think what can be learned in the two systems should                be translatable in the other system.                And so I think if you were to ban all embryonic stem cell research,                it would really slow down the insight that could be gained in adult                stem cell research.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Rebecca                Dresser.                 PROF. DRESSER:  This                is unfair, but I am wondering if you had any ideas about the cost                of such a procedure? I mean, just based on what you have done in                mice, and you mentioned at the very end that to be cost effective                that you would probably would have to just have a number of cell                lines and not rely on the patient cell.                Is this going to be a very, very expensive technology, and where                we have to worry about -- well, if all these ifs work out, will                we have to worry about who has access, or will it be comparable                to the stem cell transplants that we do now with bone marrow now?                Or what do you think?                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  Well,                I think it will be relatively expensive if you do it on a single                person basis, and you will have to create the cell lines from the                beginning, rather than go going to a frozen stock of cells, where                you have a very well-qualified product to start with and where you                expand cells.                And so you might even have already committed cells frozen as well,                and so the cost to get to that point would have to be incurred once                rather than doing this over, and over, and over again.                The costs I think -- well, it is hard to say, because I am not                sure how much of the regulatory issues we have actually complied                by at this point in time to actually truly gauge how much it would                cost.                But I think that by the time that you do all the quality control                tests for infectious agents and things like that, that amounts to                quite a bit of money for each cell line that you try to establish.                And in the long term I think it would probably be more cost effective                if you would have a therapy for heart infarcts that you could go                to a limited number of cell lines. And to put numbers of them, I                don't really know.                It would probably be in the range of a bone marrow transplantation                currently, which is quite expensive. So it is anywhere between $50,000                and $200,000 per patient.                If you had qualified cells that were frozen, and then you could                expand them for a short period of time and do a limited number of                tests at the end, the amount of cost incurred would really be all                up-front, and then there would be a relatively small amount per                patient.                 PROF. DRESSER:  I guess                the other thing is that bone marrow transplants work fairly well                with some illnesses and not with others, and would you expect to                see those kinds of results with these kinds of therapies?                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  I think                that would highly depend on the type of disease that you tried to                treat. You know, you are all well aware of the treatments that have                been used for Parkinson's disease, which the trials that were done                in Sweden have made little complications.                But when this was extended in multiple hospitals in the West,                there were a lot more complications if it was done on a larger scale.                So I think that depending on the disease that you go after that                it may work better or worse, and it is really way to early to be                able to comment on that.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Bill,                do you have a question?                 DR. HURLBUT: :  Well,                if we have time, I would like to ask a couple of scientific questions                if that is all right.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Please.                 DR. HURLBUT: :  Do I                understand this correctly that you are saying that your MAPC is                put into the blastocyst to perform more cell lines than do other                adult stem cells?                I thought that adult stem cells generally formed lines in a blastocyst?                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  There                are 3 or 4 papers published on adult stem cells into blastocyst                experiments. There is one paper published by a German group, where                they took purified hematopoietic stem cells, and injected them into                the blastocyst, and what they were able to show was that the cells                gave rise to some hematopoietic elements, and that they actually                recapitulated the developmental behavior of hemoglobins, which switched                at different stages of development during embryos, fetuses, and                then adults.                They did not see any contribution outside of the hematopoietic                system. The second paper is a paper from a Swedish group, where                they had taken neural stem cells that have been cultured, and introduced                them in the blastocyst, and as far as I know, they have never had                animals been born alive.                And they saw a contribution to a few tissues, but not all tissues                of the mouse fetus. And in the last papers, we did a paper by Austin                Smith, the one that reported on fusion, where they had taken defused                cells and given them to a blastocyst again, and it showed a contribution                in one animal that was born, and that was really only a single animal,                to the liver and a few other tissues.                But it was not quite the amount of contribution that I showed                in the picture here, where every single tissue of the mouse appeared                to be having a fraction of the single MAPC cell.                 DR. HURLBUT: :  That                is very, very exciting. Another question that I think might be of                good general interest to our council, but he question of whether                transdifferentiation is occurring, or even the process of embryonic                stem cells just differentiating, it is always clouded by the question                of how do you know when there is actual differentiation taking place?                In other words, just because you follow one or two gene expressions,                you don't know, and one of the problems with embryonic stem cell                therapies will be to get the target tissues up to speed, like beta                cells producing enough insulin.                I know that there are advances being made on this, but can you                just give us a general description of how you identify when you                are satisfied that a tissue has in fact been produced?                And maybe tell us a little bit about the -- maybe we need a little                education on messenger RNA assays.                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  Okay.                The criteria to say that you produced tissue I think needs to include                that you turned on the genetic program that is compatible with the                tissue that you want to produce.                You find therefore proteins from the genetic program in the cells,                and the cells have morphological changes consistent with the cells                that you are looking for, and the cells have functional characteristics                of the tissue that you are looking for.                So what happens in a cell is that in an undifferentiated state                a number of gene programs are shut down, meaning there is no transcription                to the messenger RNA, and you will find no protein, and therefore                no function.                During a differentiation process, you come in with a growth factor                or a cytokine, or a stimulus from the outside, and you trigger a                certain set of signals that then open up a new genetic program and                the first thing that happens is that you transcribe messenger RNA,                that then gets translated into proteins and/or sugars, that then                supposedly give a new function to the cell.                So what we have been looking for in vitro, and that is where most                of our work has been done initially, is actually taking an undifferentiated                cell and showing that a certain genetic program isn't turned on,                meaning that you don't find mRNA, and you don't find protein, and                you don't find function.                We then switch the culture conditions and add triggers by trial                and error, to a large extent to try to activate certain genetic                programs. And if we do that, we look for protein and mRNA first.                So we look to prove that the genes are turned on, and then we                look to prove that these gene products actually give rise to proteins.                We have gone to the next step also and actually tried to then take                the cells that we believe that are like brain or like liver, and                started asking questions.                If it is a liver cell, it should secrete certain things. It should                have the machinery to detoxify blood and things like that. So we                have been able to show that in the liver lineage, for instance,                that we do turn on the programs to make albumin, which is one of                the major proteins that is being secreted in the liver and is present                in the blood.                These cells have, for instance, cytochrome p450, which is a massive                machinery in the liver that helps detoxify the blood components.                And we can show that it is there, and it responds in the correct                ways as liver cells would do.                So that is what you do in vitro, and in vivo, it is a bit more                complicated, and you really need to use animal models where there                is a disease. So you would have to show that the cells ingraft and                you can find the donor cells.                You would have to show that they turn on RNA and protein, and                therefore have this genetic program turned on. And then function,                which means that if you take an animal that has a failing liver,                and you give the liver cells to this animal, the animal will now                live without having drugs that keeps it alive.                And so that would prove that the cells that you put in have actually                acquired the ability to function like a liver cell. And so for adult                stem cell research, very little proof of the latter is actually                present.                For embryonic stem cell research in mice, there is a lot of evidence,                and in the human embryonic stem cells, that evidence is just starting                to become available, just like it is with adult stem cells.                 DR. HURLBUT: :  Could                I ask one last little question? How many genes are we talking about                here; like hundreds, or thousands, and how many do you monitor in                fact?                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  Well,                we usually monitor between -- well, there is probably hundreds of                thousands that get turned on, and so using the new technologies,                the array technology, and the proteomics technology, that is one                of the things that we are looking at, because it will give us a                much better insight in the whole programs that are being turned                on.                We just pick and choose the ones that we think are known to be                important at certain stages of the differentiation. So, for instance,                if you go from a stem cell to a liver cell, we know that you have                to turn on X number of genes that happen to be known to be turned                on.                So we look at 2 or 3 that are early, and 2 or 3 that are in the                middle, and then 5 or 6 at the end. We have not exhaustively looked                at all of them yet.                But I think with the human genome being sequenced, we now have                the tools in hand to now take cells created from stem cells and                look at the whole program of genes that is present, and what we                created in a culture dish, compared to what is actually present                in real life in vivo, and get a feel of how closely we actually                are getting to the real cell.                 DR. HURLBUT: :  Thank                you.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Could                I -- Robby, did you have a question? Why don't you go first, because                I have a couple of things as well. Please.                 PROF. GEORGE:  Actually,                I just wanted to follow up the question that Dr. Kass asked earlier                just for clarification, and I recognize that there is a great deal                of uncertainty as to what the future holds in your area for research,                as well as in embryonic stem cell research.                And estimating or evaluating what the prospects are therapeutically                is a speculative business, but having all of that in mind -- and                I was not clear in responding to Dr. Kass whether you identified                some areas in which knowing what we do know now about the differences                between embryonic stem cells and the MAPC cells, it is possible                to identify some areas where we just know that whatever the prospects                are for MAPC cells that they won't be able to do, or our therapies                won't be able to be developed based on them to do certain things.                And that there is at least a prospect of embryonic stem cells                being used to do.                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  It                is so very hard for me to answer that question, just because embryonic                stem cells have been worked with for so much longer, and so investigators                have been able to, for instance, make cells that secrete insulin                to some extent on demand, which has not been accomplished with adult                stem cells.                There is a little bit of evidence from pancreatic tissue itself                that there might be precursors that can do that, but from MAPCs,                for instance, we have not been able to do this yet.                It doesn't mean that we can't. I don't know that answer. So there                is a lot more experience with embryonic stem cells and there is                a lot more -- at least in the mouse system, there is a lot more                known on how to try to trigger certain differentiation programs                and whether the MAPCs will respond to the same extent and to the                same degree.                And I think that currently I can't really answer that question.                 PROF. GEORGE:  But asking                if you look at it and not asking what do we know MAPC cells will                be able to enable us to do, and have a prospect of doing, that embryonic                stem cells have a prospect of doing.                But if we simply ask the question as do we know just on the basis                of the facts of what we know about the differences, and that there                are in fact some things that MAPC cells, no matter what, won't be                able to do. Or is the answer that we just don't know?                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  I think                we don't know currently, and I can't really answer that question,                because we just don't know at this point in time.                 DR. FOSTER:  I just                want to interrupt with this one point. Those questions are really                hard to answer, but there is another whole area that is going to                impact what you are going to use cellular based therapy for.                And that has to do with good vectors, retroviral gene therapy,                and that you are going to accomplish with other diseases that you                don't have to use cells for at all.                I mean, the most recent thing in severe combined immunodeficiencies                in humans, is you put a retrovirus in, and you put the common gamma                chain in for about five cytokines, you know, for these kids. It                was just in the New England Journal a couple of weeks ago, or three                weeks ago, or something like that.                And they are now two years out, and so there are going to be a                whole lot of diseases that you are not going to have to use regenerative                therapy or cell therapy. You can't predict those things either at                this point.                So I think if you try to jump way ahead of what the basic science                is doing, then you are prone to error, and I know everybody wants                to know whether an adult cell is better than an embryonic stem cell,                or something like that.                And I don't think you can answer those questions, and one of the                things that we have heard from both the investigators this morning                is that they cross-fertilized with each other.                And so -- I mean, that you could not have done what you are doing                in the adult cells without what had already been done with the embryonic                cells.                So I just would argue against trying to push investigators to                say whether an adult stem cell can do this or do that at this point,                because we have not even taken into consideration many other approaches                to human disease.                I don't mean to be fussy, but I do think that that is an important                thing.                 PROF. GEORGE:  But I                was actually asking -- well, I think the question I asked was that                it really is about what we know now. The question is do we know                now that there are certain differences, that as a result of which                the prospects for the one area are different from the prospects                of the other. And I got my answer. Thank you.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Let                me take the privilege of the Chair to expand in a way Dan Foster's                comment in a direction that he might not have intended.                 DR. FOSTER:  That does                not surprise me.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Well,                I mean, you are a genial sort, and I think you won't -- I mean,                one of the things that one has to remember in this conversation                is that wonderful as the stem cell approach is from whatever source                to the treatment of these diseases, that is not the whole area here                also.                And that the gene therapy is not the whole story as well, and                there are preventive measures, and there are all kinds of other                things. I mean, the conversation, because we are taking it up, gives                it a certain type of dramatic focus and concentration.                But for the people who work in clinical medicine, they know that                this is -- that there are lots of ways to try to skin this cat.                But I wanted to ask a couple of -- to make a comment, and then ask                a couple of questions.                You have talked understandably and very welcomely to us about                your own very exciting work. There is a great deal of skepticism                about many of the published works in using adult stem cells.                And unfortunately, for better and for worse, these reports are                caught up in the political controversy that now surrounds us, with                people on both sides having a stake in either making the results                on one line of work seem better than the other, precisely because                they are wed to an either/or choice.                Can you, abstracting from all the political considerations, and                the various axes that various people are grinding on these poor                cells, can you say anything at all generally about the kinds of                initial reports of a clinical sort that we have had with alleged                adult stem cells?                Because at least according to some accounts, these have been very                exciting, and yet there is a great deal of skepticism about whether                these are in fact stem cells that are producing the results.                Can you tell the council anything at all about how we should at                the moment regard the news that is coming out to us in this area?                How should we receive it?                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  There                have been several publications that came out over the last 1 or                2 years now, where investigators or clinicians have looked at individuals                who were transplanted with classical bone marrow transplantations,                and looked in tissues outside of the hematopoietic system to ask                whether bone marrow derived of donor-derived cells could be found                in different tissues.                And the reports that have come out have indicated fairly significant                levels of contribution to certain tissues, meaning they have found                cells in the heart, and they have found cells in skin, gut, liver,                and so forth.                And we really have not looked in the same situation to see whether                we can confirm these data or not. I know that some clinical groups                have put in doubt to some extent the degree of contribution that                has been reported, and it is not quite clear whether the 5, 10,                or 20 percent that has been quoted in some papers is indeed actually                going to hold up over time.                I think there is some contribution, and the question in my mind                still is how clinically important is it what investigators have                seen or what clinicians have seen currently.                If you go strictly by the term of stem cell plasticity, none of                these studies really show that it was a single cell, or it was a                blood cell that gave rise to these tissues, and it might still be                that some contaminating cells were contributing to that.                And really none of these studies have shown that this has had                any clinical impact on what was going on in these patients. And                so they didn't really show that you restored function of the organ                that the cells were found in.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  I was                thinking of a recent report on the Parkinson's cases.                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  Correct.                So the Parkinson's cases were -- and that is with fetal brain tissues,                and are those the reports that you are referring to?                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Yes.                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  And                so there has been a series of patients transplanted in Sweden with                Parkinson's disease, where one team of investigators in a non-controlled                study, shows that implantation of the fetal tissue brain -- fetal                brain tissue into the brain of patients with Parkinson's disease                could rescue patients, and could actually correct the Parkinsonism.                And actually have now done so for some patients for more than                10 years. Now, these were highly selected patients, and done by                a single group of investigators.                The same was done in the west in 3 or 4 institutions, and some                patients got better and some patients did not get better. But I                think that gets to the proof of concept that if you have the right                cells, and if you can create the right cells, and if it is from                embryonic stem cells, or adult stem cells, or from tissues itself,                that there might be a way of correcting Parkinson's disease.                But there is again -- and I think it would behoove us to really                look carefully at exactly what single cell or fused cells that we                have to put into the brains of patients with Parkinson's disease                to try to correct the disease, and not over correct it as it was                done in some of the patients in the U.S., where they had more side                effects from the therapy than they initially had from their Parkinson's                disease.                And so even though there is an enormous amount of pressure on                all of us with stem cell research to try to come up with therapies                yesterday, I have been very, very cautious in telling people that                do the clinical work that you can't just go around and take stem                cells and put them in places in the hope that they will work.                Because we will get into situations like the gene therapy field,                where a couple of awful problems have popped up, and have actually                halted the clinical potential of these cells enormously.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Could                I follow that up, because if there had been more time, I would have                asked Dr. Gearhart this question as well, and you are a clinician                who deals with patients that are also -- now thanks to your new                results, and I am sure that you are getting lots of calls as well.                There is an ethical dimension to this area that worries not so                much about where you get the cells from, but how we deal with the                desperately sick patients looking for any sort of hope.                And let me say flat out that in-part to fend off the opponents,                the people in the scientific community and medical community, has                to some extent not been adverse to shall I say hyping the benefits                here and possibly even taking rather cruel advantage of these hopes.                And from what I hear from you, and from what I hear from Dr. Gearhart,                these therapies, there are lots of problems to be solved before                these things will be made available.                And that is not to say that there isn't this enormous promise,                but what can you tell us, or what advice would you give us about                we could responsibly speak about this promise without behaving,                let me say, unethically in dealing with the very patients who are                coming to us for help?                And I think that's something that you have probably faced directly,                and whatever help you could give us on that would be welcome.                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  Well,                like Dr. Gearhart, my e-mail and phone have a lot of messages on                them from patients locally, around the country, and around the world                who want to bring a child or a parent with a certain disease, and                want us to treat whatever disease you can come up with.                And we have to speak the truth, and even though we are excited                about the work that we have, and for the work that people do in                embryonic stem cells, at this point it is a promise, and I don't                think there is any data to say that in the next 1 or 2 years we                will actually be in clinical trials with any of this.                So we really have to tell patients, families, and whomever, that                currently we are trying to cure mice, but a lot of mice have been                cured with a lot of different things, and that doesn't necessarily                mean that it will translate into humans.                And so we need to do the regular science that needs to be done                to come up with a therapy that is both potentially useful and for                certain not dangerous.                And so that the last part of that whole thing is really where                everything sits. And so we could go ahead and do things now, but                then run into major, major complication issues which would make                patients way worse off than they started out.                You could argue that bone marrow transplantation, there was not                a whole lot known when the first bone marrow transplants were done,                and that is before I started in bone marrow transplantation, and                probably some patients didn't fare that well either in the beginning.                But people ultimately still have to learn by doing it in humans,                but we have to learn as much as we can in culture dishes, mice,                rats, and larger animals before we proceed with therapies for things                that are not immediately legal.                And so it is not because you are diagnosed with Parkinson's today                that four months from now that you will die from your disease, which                is different if you have a acute leukemia, where there is really                no other solutions.                And so I also think it will have to be graded depending on the                type of disease that you start treating.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  And                I have one last question, and I don't think we will have another                opportunity in this discussion, but this comes to Rebecca Dresser's                question about the costs, and how to think about this. And also                about the applicability.                There was recently a meeting of the major biotech companies in                Princeton, and our scientific director, Dick Roblin, was there,                and they were discussing among other things the question of the                solution of the immune rejection problem from all these various                things.                And all of the ones that were present there are putting their                research money not into somatic cell nuclear transfer to deal with                the rejection problem, but into other means, for a reason that would                have never have occurred to me until it came back from this meeting,                which is to say that if you have highly individualized treatments,                case by case, that at least under present regulatory systems, if                you call these things products, each one of them has to be approved                independently by the FDA before it can be used.                And so the question is whether or not -- and in partly thinking                about the cost and the scalability, and the things that might make                things universally applicable, doesn't it make sense more to be                thinking more in terms of cell lines, whether embryonic or adult,                and that could be made universally applicable, rather than trying                to continue to think each person, his or her own replacement, given                these practical problems of scale and product approval?                I am not sure that the question was clearly put, but it bears                upon the efficacy of this in terms of long term clinical use, and                the questions of cost.                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  Ideally,                it would be personalized therapy, and so you would create cells                that are completely compatible with the person that you need to                treat, except again in situations where there is an autoimmunity                issue, which makes it complicated.                And if it is an autoimmune problem starting out, then cell therapy                is probably not the best way to go about doing this. For instance,                Type-1 diabetes would come to mind, where there is really a rejection                of your own islet cells.                I think the costs -- and I spoke to that just a little bit before                -- of creating everybody's own cell line will in the long term will                be extremely high, and it will not be a therapy that is suitable                for acute events.                So if you have an acute stroke, or if you have an acute heart                infarct, and you try to correct that, there is no way that you can                clone ESLs to correct that, or you could create MAPCs to correct                that within the next one or two weeks.                It just takes too much time to try to do this. Then you could                argue, well, I will store our own MAPC cell lines or own ESL lines                just in case we need it, which definitely I don't think is financially                tenable.                So even though the ideal situation would be to be able to make                everybody's own cells, and I think in the long term if the cell                therapies are proven to be, for instance, very useful in patients                who have a severe MI that you can actually correct them almost immediately                after the MI has occurred, or within the next few weeks after it                has occurred, it almost has to be done on an allogeneic basis.                And in that case, trying to come up with wise ways of making the                cells acceptable to the vast majority of patients, whether it is                multiple cell lines and a minimum amount of immunosuppression, or                establishing partial chimerism by creating both blood cells and                heart muscle cells from the same cell lines, for instance, would                be one way to get around that.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Thank                you very much. Thank you very much for a wonderful presentation,                and a very generous and full response to our questions. If we might                take the liberty of just contacting you with some other things.                I know that your e-mail is full, and we will try to add very little,                but as we go along, we might have some additional things.                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  That                would be great. Thanks.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Thank                you very much. Members are asked to go immediately from here to                the other room, where they want a group photo, and the four or five                of us who have not yet posed for our individual mug shots, are asked                to stay. I think lunch will be served there.                We will reconvene here shortly after 1:30, and let's say about                1:35 or 1:40.                (Whereupon, at 12:28 p.m., a luncheon recess was taken.)                                                    SESSION 3: STEM                CELLS 3:                ETHICS OF HUMAN STEM CELL RESEARCH                DR. GENE OUTKA                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Well,                if I sing a song, or make some announcements, maybe we will get                the full numbers, but this is the third of our three sessions on                stem cell research, having spent the morning hearing two presentations                on the science.                And we now turn in this session to ethical questions in stem cell                research, and we are very fortunate to have as our guest Professor                Gene Outka, who is the Dwight Professor of Philosophy and Christian                Ethics at Yale University.                And for a long time one of our most careful students of the ethics                of biology and medicine among many other things.                Apart from our interest in the merits of the case, a paper written                on a subject of concern to us, I have confessed in the chairman's                cover letter, in a sentence which has a missing word, that I have                an additional purpose in mind here, namely as just as those of us                who are not experienced in science, need practice in grasping the                concepts and methods of scientific analysis, so those of us who                are not experienced in ethics would need some practice in working                with the concepts and ways of ethical analysis. And Professor Outka's                work is nothing if not careful, analytical and disciplined, and                we are very thankful that he could be with us to discuss his paper.                All of us have had a chance to read it, and I exhorted you to                read it more than once, and there is a lot packed in it. And Professor                Outka is going to lead off with a few remarks, after which I have                asked Michael Sandel to make comment that would open our discussion.                Thanks very much, Gene.                 DR. OUTKA:  Well, it                is a great honor for me to be here, and I enjoyed sitting in enormously                in the morning sessions, and noted that although the focus was on                scientific matters, moral matters also arose from time to time,                as when Dr. Gearhart told us that he doesn't give the same moral                status to the embryonic entity as he does to the fetus.                And I think that illustrates one of the claims that I actually                make in the paper, which is that on this subject, whether we like                it or not, we all have to be moralists in one way or another; that                certain moral determinations are unavoidable.                And in-part that is because the moral positions that we take have                such direct and sometimes colliding implications for the policy                and political recommendations that we make.                And I contrast that with certain other cases where you could have                some theoretical debates and disagreements might abound on that                level, but you could when you turned to practical and political                matters, you could come to some modus vivendi or something of the                sort, where the theoretical disagreements don't translate into necessarily                practical political disputes.                That is not the case with this subject I contend, and so we all                have to be inclined to engage in moral reflection, and although                moral reflection has its own esoteric features in the hands of at                least some, I think that this session may be more egalitarian in                a way, because I, like Samuel Johnson's dictum, that we are perpetually                moralists, but we are geometricians only by chance.                And by that I take him to mean that moral matters, that there                is a fundamental equality about our reflection on moral matters,                and it does not require a special talent in the same way.                So that then leads me to say a few things about this paper, which                we are going to discuss. I tried to do several different things                in it, and I tried to give some kind of an account of some of the                major points of disagreement, and I have a spectrum of views from                the right to the center, to the left.                And I myself then plum for a particular region of the center,                and along the way though I do try to show how debates about abortion                and debates about stem cell research converge and diverge.                And finally I propose a nothing is lost principle, and let me                say a little more about that, but I think probably the most economical                way to proceed is simply to indicate for you some of the normative                conclusions that I put forward in the paper.                And not tarry over the questions about whether I do justice to                those either more conservative than I am, or more liberal than I                am. Spokespersons for both positions can speak for themselves later                on.                So let me just then lay out some of the claims that I make, and                that will get us started at least. I make some claims about the                status of human life from conception forward, and I argue that once                conceived each entity is a form of primordial human life that should                exert a claim upon us to be regarded as an end and not a mere means                only.                And I say that it is one thing to allow that we need not yet ascribe                full moral standing or equal protectibility to embryos. That is                to say, I deny that abortion and embryonic stem cell research are                morally indistinguishable from murder.                But I claim on the other hand that it is another thing to instrumentalize                embryos through and through when what we intend in the actions we                perform exhaustively concerns benefits to third-parties.                And I take that to be one indication of sheer instrumentalization,                where the actions that we perform we can only justify, and justify                exhaustively by virtue of benefits to third-parties.                That is to say that I deny that abortion and embryonic stem cell                research are morally indifferent actions in themselves to be evaluated                wholly by the benefits that they bring to others.                I then go on to conclude that to conduct research on embryos that                creates them in order to destroy them clashes directly with the                judgment that entities conceived have irreducible value.                So that is on the one hand. I want to say that the case for sheer                instrumentalization is to be resisted, but on the other hand, I                also think that we don't confront a single either/or as some conservatives                and some liberals suppose, to the effect that we should forbid all                embryonic stem cell research, or we should permit it all.                I consider instead a more nuanced possibility, or at least I think                it is more nuanced, where we may distinguish creating for research                and only employing for research.                And the latter of employing for research allows us to consider                in vitro fertilization as a practice in our culture, and employing                for research connects with th"

Good morning.  Welcome Members of the         Council to this, our twelfth meeting.  Welcome also to members of the         public.  I'd like to recognize the presence of Dean Clancy, our         Executive Director, the Designated Federal Officer, in whose presence         we have a legal and proper meeting.                         And I would also like to take this         opportunity on behalf of the Council to express our congratulations to         Jim Wilson who yesterday received the Presidential Medal of Freedom.          Congratulations to you, Jim.                         (Applause.)                         A word of thanks to Council Members for         your loyalty and devoted service and especially this time for the         heroic amount of material that you have, I would assume, read or will         have read before long.  I warn you there is more to come, but we are in         your debt for your attention and comments, of course.  Welcome.                         The first session of this meeting,         ""The Research Imperative:  Is Research a Moral Obligation?""         does double duty in this Council.  First, it's part of our ongoing         effort at what we call a richer bioethics and second, it does have         something to contribute to the on-going discussions of the ethics of         stem cell research.  It will continue our effort to lift up to view         some of the unstated assumptions that lie behind the debates, say about         stem cell research or cloning for biomedical research, assumptions that         rarely get the attention and scrutiny that they deserve.  We've         paid some attention to the assumptions about the moral status of the         human embryo.                          At the next meeting we want to look at         the ethical and political meaning of funding or not funding ethically         controversial research in a pluralistic society.  And today, we're         going to look at the so-called imperative of research, especially         research in biomedical science that could lead to cures for diseases.                         No one doubts the great value of such         research and no one should have anything but admiration and gratitude         to the generations of scientists who have pushed back the frontier         against ignorance and who provide knowledge and techniques fruitfully         used to alleviate human suffering.                          The question is, rather, what kind of a         good is such research and what kind of an obligation do we have to         pursue it?                       Is it an unqualified obligation, a so-called perfect duty that                takes precedence over possible objections and concerns, especially                ethical ones?  Such seem to be, at least the implicit view of at                least one scientist who presented to this Council, who in so many                words indicated that this Council would be held morally responsible                for any lives that were lost should we erect any legal barriers                to cloning for biomedical research and similar opinions have been                voiced many times in the public debate in recent years.                   Others have argued that there is no moral         or social obligation to medical research at all, even if such research         were a social good and good for us, but rather an optional goal to be         pursued, one among many and by no means supreme.                         To help us continue to think about this         question, is there an imperative to research and if so, of what sort?          We're very fortunate to have with us Daniel Callahan, the         co-founder and for 27 years the Director and President of the first         bioethics think tank of the United States, The Hastings Center.  Dan         Callahan has a nose for all the tough big questions in the field, as         the titles in his résumé will show.  And moreover, the courage to try         to make other people face up to them.                         It is the tough question of the research         imperative that is the topic of his forthcoming book,  What Price         Better Health:  Hazards of the Research Imperative  and that makes         him the perfect person to get us thinking about this today.                         If I might add a note of personal         pleasure, I was a young researcher at NIH almost 35 years ago when Dan         Callahan was starting The Hastings Center and he invited me to the         first organizing meeting of what would become that center and in an         ill-fated writing venture Dan and I were co-editors of a volume called          Freedom, Coercion and the Life Sciences  for which I had written         a chapter on ""Freedom, Coercion and Asexual Reproduction""         whose arguments I've been cloning ever since.                       Dan, it's a great pleasure to have you here.  We look forward                to your presentation and discussion.                                SESSION 1: ""THE RESEARCH IMPERATIVE"":                IS RESEARCH A MORAL OBLIGATION?                   DR. CALLAHAN:   Leon and I have worked         together for a long time and I can remember my first discussion with         you, I think, at my house on Summit Drive, and we talked and you seemed         exactly the sort of person I was looking for.  You were suggested to me         by Paul Ramsey who many of you knew.                         It's a double pleasure being here         then to be with Leon and this particular Council and also because I         think I know at least two thirds of the people on the Council and         it's so nice to see you collected here.                         The term research imperative first arose         for me with an article that was in The Hastings Center Report and Paul         Ramsey used the phrase.  He engaged in really a most interesting debate         with the Jesuit theologian Richard McCormick on the question of human         subject research on children, particularly what's called         nontherapeutic research, for the sake of knowledge, rather than direct         therapeutic treatment of children.                         And McCormick argued that children should         be available for nontherapeutic research.  Their parents should be         willing to make them available as a sort of a noble sacrifice for the         good of humanity and the advancement of research.  Paul Ramsey rejected         that notion altogether, felt children should not be used in that way         and accused McCormick of falling prey to the research imperative.                         I had no particular interest in research         at that time and it had passed out of my head, but shortly thereafter I         did run across Joshua Lederberg, Nobel Laureate, former President of         the Rockefeller University who said to me at a meeting, I gather         something similar to what Leon quoted at another meeting saying         ""If we don't carry out research, the blood of those who die         will be on our hands.""                         I wondered at the time whether that was         true, but again had no particular interest in research and didn't         pay much attention to it, so it faded away.  But in recent years, all         of that sort of came back to me for a variety of reasons.  I got         interested in the whole enterprise of biomedical research in this         country, particularly in this country, although obviously it goes on in         other countries as well.                       And there were a number of things that caught my eye.  First of                all, the NIH budget is something of a federal marvel.  So far as                I know it is the only budget that hasevery year without fail gone                up rather than down.  A researcher went through all the transcripts                of hearings of the National Institutes of Health and it has always                had complete bipartisan support.  There's never been any serious                dissent of any kind.                  There has been some discussion in recent years about the priorities                of NIH, but basically no objection to an increased budget and typically                the President each year, whether Democrat or Republican, has put                in for a certain amount for the budget.  Congress has always found                that inadequate and forced the NIH to take more money and they were                happy enough, of course, to take it.  So the NIH budget caught my                eye as an interesting phenomenon in American life.                   I got interested also in the escalation         of what I think is escalating history of medical research in this         country where research was a worthy cause in the late 19th century when         it first was taken seriously in this country, particularly in medical         schools.  But the kind of shift from a worthy cause to a kind of         imperative, necessary cause which really came into play after the         Second World War and I suppose nicely symbolized by President         Nixon's declaration in 1970 of a ""War Against Cancer.""          And thereafter, language of the imperative of research became stronger         and stronger.                         More recently the stem cell debate caught         my eye since many people have argued and you may hear it in your         discussion, but a moral duty to pursue such research.  Simultaneously,         more or less, the pharmaceutical industry, for those of you who follow         it you can't help following it a bit these days, pharmaceutical         industry has long claimed that they, the main reason they need the high         profits is in order to carry out research which is going to save future         lives and relieve future suffering.  Hence, they have used a very         strong research imperative argument in justifying their drug pricing         and the like.                         Now to me, the interesting question is,         why has this happened?  What has been the reason for this kind of         increased interest?  It's rather striking, if perhaps unusual, that         health care, I suppose — particularly NIH research, but it is a budget         that has gone up despite the fact that health is getting better.  It         seems to me there's some straight line correlation between the         better health we have, the more money we spend on health care and         particularly the more we think we ought to spend on research and the         argument there is, of course, the prospects of new breakthroughs are         greater than they've ever been historically and therefore we should         go after them.                         In any case, as health gets better, the         budget goes up and spending on health care continues to go up as well.                         Now I think that there are a number of         things culturally that have happened.  First of all, I think         there's a very strong feeling in this country that illness and         disease, which have always been considered human evils have taken a         kind of transcendent status as evils in our country.  They are seen as         among the worse things that can happen to people, one of the most         important things we can spend money on, and that there is really         nothing better we can do for each other than to invest money in         research to promote better health.                         I think also, as part of that, is that         one shift that I think has taken place since the Second World War has         been a kind of abolition of fatalism.  It's been argued that in the         past we reconciled ourselves to aging and death simply because we could         nothing.  People could do nothing about it and then it had to be         rationalized, it had to be given a place in human life, but fatalism,         many would, in effect, argue should be put behind us.  Now we can do         something about the evils of illness and disease.                         The political scientist, Michael Walzer,         I think very perceptively made this point about 20 years ago when he         said, ""What has happened in the modern world is simply that         disease itself, even when it is endemic rather than epidemic, has come         to be seen as a plague.  And since the plague can be dealt with, it         must be dealt with.  People will not endure what they no longer believe         they have to endure.""  That was from his book,  Spheres of         Justice .                         I think it's also the case that the         pursuit of health through research is seen as not only a good in         itself, morally and socially, but also of great economic benefit, both         in the lives saved and the future productivity of those lives, but also         in the jobs and profit that research generates.  A strong argument         behind the annual NIH budget is that the research is exportable.          It's one of America's great products.  People need it.  They         love it.  And they will spend money for it.                         Most importantly, I think, and an issue         that's worth a side discussion, but we won't have time to get         into today, a strong argument that medical research offers the greatest         promise of eventually reducing our escalating health care costs.  A         number of economists, David Cutler and the new Commissioner of the Food         and Drug Administration, Mark McClellan, have argued very strongly that         research and biomedical investment is the greatest investment that has         been made on anything in this country, that has been worth trillions of         dollars to our economy.  And both the pharmaceutical industry and from         time to time the NIH itself has argued that better research is what         will beat the problem of rising health care costs.  I would add as a         footnote, it hasn't happened yet.  It seems to me a wonderful idea,         but the historical record is not encouraging.  Anyway, the argument has         been made.                         Now I want to really make three basic         contentions in this talk.  I'm going to make them and let's see         if I can defend them and make them quasi-persuasive.                         First of all, I want to argue that, in         general, there is no moral research, no moral imperative or duty to         pursue medical research, or in particular, to pursue any specific line         of research.  Research, I want to argue, is a moral good to be weighed         against other human goods, but not an overriding moral obligation.          That's the first contention.                         The second is that in the absence of what         I will call a common metric, there is no rationally justifiable or         viable way of balancing the moral good of research against other         claimed moral goods.                         And my third contention is that in the         legal and ethical policy, international policy now in human subject         research that has developed since the Nuremburg Trials in 1947, the         principle of informed consent for competent patients has come         decisively to overcome any and all claims of research benefits that         could come from violating the principle of informed consent.  I think         this has great historical significance.                         Let me go to my first contention, why is         there, with one exception I will shortly mention, no moral obligation         or duty to carry out biomedical research, but at the same time one can         say that research is clearly a moral good?  I offer you three         considerations for that.                         First of all, this is a point that         philosophers sometimes make about the very notion of obligation.          Philosophers distinguish between  perfect and imperfect obligations.  A         perfect obligation is one which is based on a specific promise we have         made.  We're then obliged to keep it.  Or an obligation that flows         from certain types of roles we take on such as doctor, policeman,         lawyer, what have you, obligations that typically are called role         obligations and they go with the carrying out of particular         professions.                         So an imperfect obligation by contrast is         one where no one in particular has any obligation to carry it out.  We         talk about it as an obligation, but one cannot say that any given         individual has a duty to carry out the obligation.  In that sense,         it's a very weak kind of obligation.  Indeed, it's not clear         when you talk about imperfect obligation whether you ought to use it at         all, talk about obligation at all, but nonetheless that has typically         been done.                       And here I would want to argue that medical research falls in the category                of an imperfect obligation, imperfect in the sense that it's                not clear whose duty it is in particular to carry out such research.                 One can't even claim that of the researcher.  If a researcher                decides to do basic research with no interest in therapy, one would                hardly accuse that researcher of being irresponsible or to say that                any given researcher had a particular obligation to pursue this                or that line of research.                   So in that sense, medical research itself         would be a classic case of an imperfect obligation.  Now it might well         be the case that someone in say the field of genetics who took on         particular issues pertinent to society or therapy would have some moral         obligation to carry through on that if the person had chosen to do that         research it would then begin to take on some of the characteristics of         a perfect obligation.  But there's no obligation in the first place         that a person become a particular kind of researcher.                         Now this may seem like a rather         technical, indeed, precious point, the kind of thing philosophers have         lots of fun with, but don't persuade many others.  I think the         question is pertinent because if we're going to talk about a duty         to carry out research, and obligation of research, we really then have         to ask, in what sense are we supposed to carry out research and what         moral sense is there a claim upon us?                         I simply want to argue that it is         perfectly possible to talk about it as a good.  It's an ideal of         our culture, a very strong ideal.  It is based on the notion of a duty         of empathy, mercy, of the relief of suffering, the virtue of         beneficence, the virtues of mercy.  And in that sense, one can make a         very strong case that it is a good thing to do, but not necessarily a         strict obligation.                         Now by calling it a good thing to do, it         seems to me one then has to raise the question well, how does it         compare with other good things we might do?  As an economist might say,         what are some of the optional ways we might spend a similar amount of         money?  How do you compare the value and need for man's educational         needs, national defense, jobs, all sorts of other things that societies         need in order to function well?                         It seems to me then once one has said it         is a good, and simply a good and not necessarily the highest good, then         one is in a situation of trying to juggle budgets, juggle moral         priorities and make a determination of where we want to locate health         over against other things we might do with our money and with our         aspirations.                       I think it is fairly obvious in this country, as at least symbolized                by the NIH, that we have given it an uncommonly high status and                this is clearly not the case in other countries.  The British, the                French, the Germans all spend money on medical research, but they                don't put nearly the amount of money into it as we do in this                country.                   But I would point out that we don't         consider it morally objectionable that they spend less money on         research and more money say on other things, since it seems to me once         one begins talking about comparative goods for society, this will be         determined by the politics, the values, the history, culture and a lot         of other things.                         So basically, I have a very modest kind         of goal here, which is simply to use an old fashioned term from         theology, demythologize the notion of a research imperative by simply         saying sure, it's an absolutely good thing to do, but once         we've said it's a good thing to do, then it has to be compared         with and compete with other goods in society, whereas to talk about it         as a duty seems to act for many as a kind of a trump care which then         allows people to not only ask for more money than they might for other         things, but also to argue that somehow we have an inescapable duty and         I want to argue with that.                         Now I would make one exception which I         think is important in our world.  I think one can make a very strong         case that there is something pretty close to a duty when you're         talking about infectious diseases and particularly disease such as         AIDS; diseases that don't simply kill people, but mainly kill         younger people and in particular kill those who are responsible for the         running of the society.  And one of the great problems in sub-Saharan         Africa is not simply a high death rate although that, of course, is         horrible, but the point is that what we're seeing is the         destruction of the health care workers, the police force, government         administrators, all the people that make society run, and of course,         leaving thousands of children as orphans.  So it's very destructive         on the family.                         So it seems to me that plagues and         particularly those that affect younger generations and affect the         infrastructure of society and not simply the death rate stand out as a         particular exception, which is only to say in a way that there is a         difference between what was called the endemic diseases, cancer, heart         disease and the like and contagious diseases that seem to fall into a         different category.                         Now let me respond to the Lederberg         argument.  I think when we think about the Lederberg argument, the idea         that somehow it's a sin of omission not to support research and         therefore we will bear responsibility for the results of failing to         support the research, this will certainly be true if we consider a very         hard and specific obligation a duty, therefore, we will have seen,         failed in our duty and thus to be condemned.  But it seems to me one         has to really ask about all the other needs of society and ask is it         really wrong to decide in a given society, at a given time that         education, say, is more important than health care.                          In this country, we have more or less         spent around 6 percent of our gross domestic product on health care for         nearly 30 years or so.  We now spend about 14 percent on health care         and around 3 and 4 percent on defense.  Thirty-five years ago we spent         about 6 percent on each.  So one can really raise the question whether         it makes a great deal of sense or there leads to a balanced society to         allow one sphere, namely health care to so remarkably outpace all of         the others, as if somehow our education system is terrific, we         needn't put more money in that, but only health care deserves the         constant escalating budget that it typically gets.                         Now I think in trying to ask the question         of research as a good and comparing it with other goods, we really are         forced to ask what kind of an evil disease, suffering, and death are.          Clearly, they are very important evils.  All societies have considered         them evils.  As I suggested maybe earlier fatalistic societies had to         develop rationalizations and ways of making sense of them.  Many of         these, I believe, still make sense, but we have at least entered a         period where there is not much pleasure taken in arguments that seem to         have a fatalistic flavor to them.                          So that pushes us really back to the         question of let's take, for instance, the question of death.  I         think it's very pertinent to ask what kinds of death are comparably         more or less evil.  There's death by disease.  There's death by         social violence, war, domestic violence and the like.  There's         death by accidents.  There is death by poverty.  Can we rank in some         sense, even if very crudely and roughly, can we rank those deaths in         terms of evils?  I myself would say that the greatest, the worst kinds         of deaths are those that come from social violence and deaths that are         unexpected, unnecessary and are a function of human evil, rather than         biological evil.                         We can obviously argue about that matter,         but it seems to me it's important when we begin thinking about the         comparative good that medical research can bring, what are the         comparative evils we are trying to overcome and how do we want to         understand and rank those evils?                         To my mind, premature death is something         to be worked against.  Threats to public health are to be worked         against.  This would particularly include infectious diseases and         threats to sanitation, air and the like, and I suppose anything that         threatens the ability, particularly of people in their adult years, to         run families and to manage societies.                         I would want myself to classify the         endemic diseases of modern society, particularly those that primarily         affect older populations, as comparatively low priority.  That is to         say they are terribly important.  People — it would be a good thing to         cure cancer, heart disease and the like, but it seems to me in terms of         social priority, I would want to argue that they have a comparatively         low priority and it's very difficult, I believe, to say that we         have an obligation to overcome cancer and heart disease as much as they         cause individuals suffering.  I use that as an example because my         family has a history of cancer as a cause of death and certainly that         brought suffering to our family as to many other families, but I think         if one takes a social perspective on, say, death from cancer, one would         have to say that while a source of great pain and suffering for         individuals, it is not a disease that threatens the very structure of         society or the overall functioning of society.                         I might mention a very interesting quote         by Harold Varmus.  Harold Varmus, many people will recall, was the         Director of the National Institutes of Health, a Nobel Laureate and I         think considered a particularly effective Director.  He retired — he         left that position in the year 2000 and is now president of Memorial         Sloan-Kettering in New York.  In his last talk he gave to the staff at         NIH, he said something very interesting that was not picked up by the         press, but I thought was very radical for a Director of NIH.  He said         first of all, he said I think we pay too much attention to health in         our society, an interesting thing for an NIH Director to say; and the         second thing he said was he was concerned that too much of the research         they were carrying out was going to produce products that Americans         would not be able to afford to buy.                         And it seemed to me that was what I         thought was the very first time that anyone in a position like that         began to question some of the very basic work that the NIH has been         doing.                         Now let me bring in a third consideration         here.  It seems to me that if one cannot say that health is an         overriding good as I would want to say, but it is one of many goods,         then the question is really how do we balance the ensemble of human         goods necessary to make up a society?  Obviously, a society where you         have a very low death rate from the endemic diseases, but is one marked         by social violence, corruption and other things will be a lousy society         to live in, however healthy physically people may be.  And for that         society a priority would want to be given to dealing with the social         problems of the society.                         The question always would be, if one         wants to say health is a basic necessity for human beings, obviously         the same thing can be said for food, clothing and shelter and maybe a         slightly less sense of the importance of jobs and other things for         society.  So the question then is to find a way to decide what priority         to give to health compared to the other goods and at the same time to         recognize that the aim of a society is to find a way to get a good         balance between all the needs and not just one.                         I am particularly interested in this         issue because while the research drive has received an awful lot of         money and great attention, we have done less well with the delivery of         health care in this country.  We've spent a lot of money on         research, but we have spent less money doing research on how to better         deliver health care and there has been far less public debate, much         less agreement on the value of say achieving universal health care in         this country.                         Harold Varmus said something rather         radical for somebody in his position.  Floyd Bloom, who is the recently         retired President of the American Association for the Advancement of         Science and before that editor of the journal  Science , said very         interestingly he thought we should spend less money on medical research         and more money on the delivery of health care, because we have a         paradoxical problem in this country.  Namely, we have a research agenda         that's going forward to find cures for disease, but there is by no         means any guarantee that all Americans will be able to receive the         results of those disease.  There are some 41 million uninsured in this         country.  There are many people who can't afford the drugs that are         coming out of the research enterprise, the pharmaceutical industry and         yet somehow we can't seem to find unanimity to deal with that         problem the way we can in putting money into research itself.                       Okay, so much for my thoughts on the obligation to do research.                 Let me turn to the issue of balancing research against other goods                and values.  Here I mean to talk very generally about balancing                research against other human needs and goods, but here I want to                particularly look at the language of balancing when, in the moral                debate, because it is often said and has been said in many government                reports that we must balance various considerations.                   Let me give you some obvious examples.          In the human subject debate, the question has been one of balancing         potential, harm to subjects against potential research benefits.          I'll come back to that issue.  In the stem cell debate, a very         common use of balancing language there; namely, the destruction of         balancing the destruction of early embryos against the potential         benefits of stem cell research.  A third area that has received some         attention lately, the protection of privacy against the public health         benefits that would come from epidemiological  and collecting         information on people's health behavior and other items concerning         their health.                          In short, in each of those debates, the         issue has arisen, how do we balance the potential harms of doing the         research and what harms of different kinds over against the potential         values.  Now I find this very interesting, first of all because it         seems to me one can't really use the language of balance in any         meaningful way unless one has a kind of common metric, that is to say,         it's the old question of sort of comparing apples and oranges.  In         that case, the issue you can talk about is the fruit, but in many of         these other cases, the differences are very great between the values to         be pursued.                         Now it seems to me that unless you have a         common metric, you really can't do that in any meaningful way.  For         instance, by a common metric, I mean if your physician says look, you         have a very painful condition, we have some surgery that will relieve         the condition, but the surgery is very painful, then, of course, you         have a common metric of pain and you can do some serious balancing.          But in the cases I've mentioned, the human subject research stem         cell debate, protection of privacy, we don't have anything that         works in such a tidy manner.                         Now my own observation is that, lacking         this common metric, and despite the language of balancing, the de facto         results of efforts to do so have pretty much reflected the ideological,         prior ideological commitments of the people doing the balancing.  I         look at the language of balancing in previous national commissions         beginning with the National Commission for the Protection of Human         Subjects in the mid-1970s through three other federal commissions and         finally this President's Council, I'll leave out this one, but         the other ones use the language of balancing, but pretty much the         balancing would typically go in the direction of the known policies,         attitudes, ideologies of the Commission Members.                          And it seems to me there's probably         no other way of doing it.  People will bring to bear on balancing         questions their previous commitments.  Hopefully, they may have been         influenced by arguments and debate they heard, but nonetheless, they         are likely to act out some of their deepest values and that will tip         the balancing one way or the other.                        And of course, one way you achieve balancing, there are a variety of                ways.  One is simply decide that on the balancing of a see-saw,                one value really isn't such a high value after all and you get                rid of it entirely and thus getting rid of the problem or you find                some way to make one of less value than the other, but in point,                all I want to argue is I don't think there's any very rational                way of doing this.  It ends up a matter of politics, maybe in a                good sense, but still politics rather than any form of rational                calculus.                 The third issue I'd like to look at is that of human subject research.                 I think the history of human subject research offers a very interesting                perspective on the question of balancing and also on the research                imperative.  Although the famous physician William Osler, at Johns                Hopkins over a century ago insisted on the importance of gaining                informed consent from human subjects, and even a German Commission,                interestingly, in the early 1930s made it a moral requirement, it                was only slowly and fitfully accepted by medical researchers.  Their                objection over the decades, as one might guess, was that research                requires human subjects, that medical progress cannot take progress                without the use of medical subjects and that the cure of disease                took priority over any claimed rights of subjects to be free of                having their bodies invaded by researchers.                   In short, there was an effort — an effort         was made to look at the problem of balancing, but by and large, in         earlier decades, probably the Second World War, the balance was always         typically in favor of the researcher and again, the arguments are         rather familiar ones.  You can't do the research unless we go         forward without the consent and in any case the saving of lives and the         relief of suffering is something that is of higher value than the         protection of human subjects.                         A friend of ours, Leon remembers him         well, Robert Morrison, a physician, said of his medical training in the         1930s, it was hard to take the idea of informed consent seriously when         so many of our patients were dying all around us, particularly young         people.                         Well, all of that changed with the         Nuremburg Trials in 1947, trials of the Nazi doctors accused and         correctly indicted for many horrible medical crimes, particularly         crimes involving human subject research.  Out of that trial came the         Nuremburg Code which at its very core had the idea of informed consent         as a necessity.                         Nonetheless, despite the blessing of the         Nuremburg Code, it took many years for the report really just to sink         in and again the arguments against it were the necessity of the         research, the value of the research, and one that became increasingly         common, the fact that your average lay person would simply be too         incompetent, too ignorant to make informed judgments.                       In any case, over a period of time, by virtue of the Nuremburg                Code, and by other codes that were developed, the principle of informed                consent was accepted and accepted in the face of many rationalizations                to evade it.  And it's very interesting because I think the                rule at present, in effect, says competent subjects have a right                to make, give informed consent and without their informed consent,                no research may go forward, regardless of how many lives might be                saved, how much suffering might be relieved.  It is a hard and fast                rule.  We basically get rid of the problem of balancing all together                and said this is not an area where balancing is appropriate, patients                must be protected.                   Now this was, I think, a very important         precedent.  It said something about the research imperative.  It said         something about the competence of people, even lay people, to make         informed judgments and it certainly said something about the necessity         to bring in regulation of something very important.  A number of people         who believed in informed consent such as Henry Veatch, one of the         people who blew the whistle in the mid-1960s on the problem, said it         would be certainly important that there be a moral requirement for         informed consent, but the government ought not to enter in and try to         regulate this area.  It should be left to the integrity of the         researcher.  Well, that view was rejected.  The institutional review         boards were born in the late 1960s and it is now a firm regulatory         requirement that research be protected by informed consent.                         Now I might mention that, of course, as         many of you are familiar with earlier Commissions, the issue never gets         totally solved.  Efforts to this day still go on to evade informed         consent.  The work of institutional reviews is endlessly being         reviewed, criticized.  Nonetheless, I think it very striking that this         one principle did endure a lot of criticism and particularly criticism         from those who argued for a research imperative to do the research.                         Let me end — I'm not charged to say         anything about the stem cell debate, but let me try to make a few         applications of what I've said generally to that debate.  First of         all, if there's anything to what I've said, it is not         appropriate to talk about a duty to carry out stem cell research, even         if you believe it extraordinarily valuable, even if you believe there         aren't any terrible moral objections against it.  It seems to me         inappropriate to talk about it as a duty.  It certainly doesn't         meet the standards I've suggested.                         Now even if we want to say, however, it         is not a duty, but simply a high good, then the question is high how a         good and how are we to think within that context.  The thing that has         certainly caught my eye is that it is claimed to be promising         research.  But I'm struck by the fact that the National Institutes         of Health over the past few decades has spent literally hundreds of         millions of dollars on other promising research for the very same         diseases that stem cell research is supposed to help.                         In the case of Parkinson's disease,         an article a couple of years ago listed 10 different research lines         being pursued for the cure of or relief of Parkinson's disease and         certainly that's the case with heart disease, spinal cord injuries         and lots of other things as well.                         Therefore, one can hardly argue that stem         cell research is the only possible way of — unless someone once said         the NIH has been wasting lots of money on everything else over the         years, I don't think they would want to say that.  One would have         to say the stem cell research is promising, but other things are         promising as well and that this might be even comparatively more         promising, but promising in and of itself is not enough to constitute a         duty to carry it out, particularly when there are alternative lines of         research.                         I would notice something else that people         haven't noticed which I found at least amusing.  Christopher Reeve         who has been a great proponent of stem cell research, as you know,         there's been a couple of stories about him over the past year, one         that he is now able to have some movement in his limbs that he         didn't have earlier and this came from recent research on         rehabilitation.  And secondly, that he is gradually being weaned from a         ventilator and this was cited as a sign of research progress on weaning         people from ventilators.  In short, some of these other alternative         lines of research are working on his very condition and bearing some         fruit.                         I think on the question of balancing and         here, this is where the balancing issue has come in very strongly, how         do you balance the claims of an embryo against the potential of         benefits from the research itself?  Well, I guess the question is one         thing is pretty clear, embryos are killed in order to carry out the         research for research that is promising,   its hypothetical benefits         over against at least some real harm.  Now unless one believes that         embryos have no moral standing whatever, which some do, of course, one         is then left with — or believes that they have such moral standing that         they shouldn't be used at all, but if you're like many of us in         sort of muddling around in the middle there, then the question is how         do you balance off the decisive harm done to embryos against         hypothetical benefits?                         It seems to me that at least from the way         I think about the issue, there is one kind of common metric here, that         is to say we're talking about the potential value of the life of         the embryo over against the lives of future victims of disease.  But it         seems to me the question is again, it's not a very good metric         because it's still a hypothetical benefit.  We don't know the         stem cell research will, in fact, work.  We do know that lots of harm         can do lots of harm to embryos to get there.  So I suppose I would want         to try to think about the matter in terms of how likely are the         benefits and even if we don't believe that there's full human         life present in embryos, what do we mean when we say, as many former         Commissions have, that embryos deserve respect.  I think that is a kind         of way on the part of the embryos a certain insecurity about the way we         talk about embryos, even among those who don't believe embryos         should be considered a full human life worthy of full protection.  I         think the language of respect has been invoked as a kind of middle         level term, if you will, to help us say well, we don't think         they're nothing, but at the same time we don't think they have         quite enough standing to merit their non-use for the sake of research.                         I suppose I would want to end by saying         on this issue and here I will simply end by saying this, I think         embryos have a fairly weak moral claim, but on the other hand I think         the research claim is even weaker.  Thank you.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you very much, Dan.                         Let me just simply throw the floor open         for comment.  Elizabeth, is that half a hand, Elizabeth Blackburn?                          PROF.BLACKBURN:   I would like to         address the points that you raised in the last part of your         presentation.  With respect to stem cell research, you point out that         the NIH has, of course, spent very much more money on different kinds         of research avenues from stem cell research.  But I think we should         acknowledge that the reason for that has been partly because there has         not been the possibility to do very much stem cell research because of         the situation being so limited right now.                         So it's not that the stem cell         research has been abandoned.  It's being sufficiently useful         compared with other avenues to pursue it.  It's simply that we at         this stage haven't had the opportunity, we as a society, to look         into it.                         I think it's early days.  And you         pointed out that there hasn't been a whole lot of evidence about         how useful it can or could not be, but again, the only way to find out         that is to gain the knowledge.                         So I think I was getting from you words         somewhat of a sense that you were thinking that extensive research was         the inferior mode of research.  And I was just going to point out that         we really don't know that at this point because we have not had the         opportunity.                         Another quick point I wanted to raise         about Christopher Reeve.  I think that the news is wonderful that the         injuries that he had were in some way not completely irreversible, but         I think that what he acknowledges is that he was in a rather unusual         position of having a lot of resources.  And he could devote enormous         resources, financial, into having the very, very intensive sorts of         effort put into his rehabilitation, which I think is not commonly the         situation for most people.                         And so if there were alternatives to this         route that he was able to take, which was heroic and very encouraging,         I think that would be better because these people do not have         Christopher Reeve's large amount of resources that he could sink         into his rehabilitation.                         So those are the couple of points I just         wanted to raise.                          DR. CALLAHAN:   Well, let me first point         out I in no sense meant to imply that stem cell research is inferior,         in fact, it may be superior to all the others.  I was simply making the         point that NIH already is pursuing other things that they consider very         promising as well.                         Stem cell would be one more thing added         to the list.  It might be better than the others, but unless we think         they have been wasting money over the years, the NIH has believed that         other things are valuable and worth pursuing as well.                       With Christopher Reeve, you may well be right, but much of that                research, the benefits came out of NIH-sponsored research.  How                it got paid for with him, I haven't the faintest idea.                 But, again, this gets back to Harold Varmus' point.  It may well                be that a lot of the research will develop things that only well-positioned,                affluent people will be able to afford.  But that is a side issue.                                 PROF.BLACKBURN:   I think the point         was that his current one was such an expensive kind of therapy.  And if         there were cheaper ones that might be more readily accessible, that         would be —                          DR. CALLAHAN:   Sure, sure.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   At the risk of perhaps         deflecting people from where they would like to go, it seems to me the         real challenge that Dan's paper and presentation throws out for us         is to think really about the large theme, which is the moral imperative         to research.                         And I wonder what people think of the         general thesis of the presentation as stated.  And the use also of         informed consent at least indicates that, if I understand Dan's         argument, there were certain kinds of trumping limitations that         indicated that the imperative to research, if there were one, or at         least the pursuit of research, if there were one, simply wasn't the         sort of thing that trumped all other kinds of considerations, including         moral considerations.  I wondered what people make of the general         thesis that has been presented.                         Frank Fukuyama?                          PROF. FUKUYAMA:   Well, I appreciated         that presentation because it really made me think about a lot of         things, but it does seem to me that fundamental to your argument is         actually not the question of the value of research per se, but the         value of biomedicine directed towards basically curing diseases in old         people that will add, say, another five years of life expectancy to a         population whose life expectancy has already been pushed to a fairly         high limit.                         And the value of that compared to other         things because you are willing to say, well, infectious diseases that         affect younger people I guess in your mind actually do trump quite a         lot of other moral considerations.                          DR. CALLAHAN:   Not informed consent,         however.                          PROF. FUKUYAMA:   Not informed         consent, but you're willing to concede that.  So it seems to me         that that is really the focus of the issue, the relative value of         biomedical research directed towards that particular population.  And         that becomes, then, a kind of metric by which you can value one type of         research over another.  Isn't that the basic —                          DR. CALLAHAN:   I guess to me the         fundamental question is, what are appropriate goals of medicine at this         stage in history given the fact that we have already made great         progress, given the fact that most people now die in old age, rather         than as young people.  Where ought we to be going?  That's the         basic question.                         And at the same time, though, I want to         say that I think it's been given an excessively high evaluation.          And I would simply want to bring it down a little bit and put it on a         par with a lot of other things we could usefully spend money on.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Frank, do you want to         pursue that?                          PROF. FUKUYAMA:   Yes.  I think that         that's really in a way a core issue that we ought to discuss much         further.  I remember once hearing the director of HHS saying that heart         disease is down, mortality from heart disease is down, and a number of         other diseases, but, unfortunately, mortality from these other diseases         is up.                         Now, it seems to me even the director of         HHS should be able to figure out that the total of mortalities from all         diseases have to sum to 100.  So that if you actually cure some         diseases, you will be raising the rates of mortality from other         diseases unless you can presume that they are not going to die.                       So, really, what you are talking about is, in a way, this whole                life extension issue and the kind of value that.                    DR. CALLAHAN:   Implicitly, that certainly         arises, yes.  Well, it's also there's another issue, which I         have written about in another case and gotten in trouble for writing         about, namely, what is our obligation to the elderly given the fact         that the average age of cancer deaths is at age 69 or 70 now.  So it is         clearly a disease of the aging.                         Should we continue giving it the high         priority it had by virtue of the fact that it's mainly older people          who have it, as with spending on money on young people to improve the         schools?  Which is the greater social contribution?                          PROF. FUKUYAMA:   And I would just         point out that among the complexities of that, you get into all of         these quality of life issues.  One of the reasons that there has been         this explosion in rates of Alzheimer's is that you have actually         succeeded in other areas of biomedicine, keeping people alive long         enough that they can get to an age where they are much more susceptible         to that.                         So it seems to me the total good that is         being delivered to society by some of these advances is much more         problematic.  And I think that's a perfectly reasonable issue to         raise.                        CHAIRMAN KASS:   Alfonso Gómez-Lobo and then Bill May.                    DR.GÓMEZ-LOBO:   I have a concern and a         question, but I would like to preface that with a broad agreement on         your approach.  I think there's deep wisdom in placing the question         within the ranges of goods.                         And I totally agree.  I seem to see an         emphasis on health, which may not be reasonable in the long run.  I         mean, we are surrounded by other goods.  And we may be neglecting lots         of other social goods by emphasizing that.                         Now, what I think is very important is to         say there is a limit to the balancing.  In other words, that balancing         goods is something that is reasonable when the pursuit of those goods         is morally permissible.  And there I think — and I totally agree with         you — the notion of informed consent plays a very important role         because that's the nonnegotiable limit, right?  You don't         balance that in any way.                         Now, here is my concern and my question.          I have seen since I have been on the Council and reading some stuff         that informed consent is sometimes extended to the treatment of         children and then also to the disposal of, say, frozen embryos.                         What I am doubtful about here is whether         there can be valid informed consent for actions that will not benefit         the subject.  And I would love to hear some clarification of that.                         And, of course, that ties into your last         remark, the remark about the embryos having a weak moral claim.  And I         want to ask you, what does that mean?  And if it's weak, how does         it become stronger and say how strong would that be in an infant?  In         other words, does the notion of varying moral claim for drastic action,         like the action of killing, really make philosophical sense?          That's the question I would like to raise.                          DR. CALLAHAN:   Well, your last question         bears on the whole discussion, the rest of this meeting.  I mean, I         could say a lot, but let me say very briefly I think by ""weak         moral claim,"" I mean a claim where we are uncertain about the         moral status and we are uncertain about how great the harm being done         to that moral status might be.                          By ""weak claim,"" I mean a claim         somewhere in between saying embryos are worth nothing and embryos are         full of life we claim is one that is somewhere in between.  It is         something.  It has some value, but we are not quite sure how much         value.                         And we may on occasion be willing to say         it might be overridden by other considerations.  That's all I will         say on that.  I would just as soon not have to get further into that.                       I'm sorry.  You're first —                    DR.GÓMEZ-LOBO:   The other point was         about consenting to an action performed, say, on a child or on an         embryo that would not benefit that child in —                          DR. CALLAHAN:   Well, that's a hot         area that has been disputed ever since the Nuremburg trials because         there are incompetent people doing research and somebody with         Alzheimer's disease doing research and children, people who are not         in a position.                         I think it's generally agreed that         you may have to indeed do the research, it's valuable research, but         there you have to depend upon a surrogate giving you permission,         somebody you believe is competent and capable of giving permission for         the research to be carried out on that person, the condition being that         the person is not able to carry out the research and that the research         would be beneficial.                       Now, on your question of non-therapeutic research, I don't see any                reason why a competent person can't agree to be part of research.                 It is not going to particularly help that person.  I was part of                a research project on amphetamines myself at one point.  It had                nothing to do with my health at all.  And I think I was able to                give informed consent on that subject.                   So the question of consent for embryos,         well, that's a whole totally murky kind of area.  I don't think         obviously you can give consent for an embryo because you have no idea         what that embryo might have wanted, where it's going, or anything         else.  I am going to put that question aside and not even try to mess         my way through that, which would be a confusing business anyway for me.                          DR.GÓMEZ-LOBO:   Yes.  I'm a little         bit disappointed, because that is exactly the kind of guidance —                          DR. CALLAHAN:   That's not my charge         at this meeting.  And I will give you references I have written on         that, but I can't do it in three or four quick sentences.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Bill May?                          DR. MAY:   The paper and the presentation         are offered with your characteristic reasonableness.  I would simply         like to explore the question of the place that you give to research         imperative in the setting of a metaphor, a fight against death and         understanding of death as a contingent, accidental fact and, therefore,         the tension between that research imperative driven by that military         metaphor with what you call the clinical imperative, at least the old         clinical imperative. You're talking about an imperative directed at         doctors.  I'm not sure if that is what you mean or patients where         the imperative is to accept death as a biological fact.                       Now, it seems to me what this leaves out, that gives heft to the research                imperative, is a further structural characteristic of death, that                death is uncertain but uncertain as to time when—  Heidegger                worked all of that out.  And behind that was Kierkegaard.                   Uncertain as to time when creates a huge         opening that allows one to give the impression that one is fighting         against death.  But one really creates space for the avoidance of         death.                         We send people to hospitals so often         because that is where the battleground is located and where we have got         people equipped to fight against that.  And if they don't have all         the resources behind them, it's research so that if it isn't         successful with this patient, it will be successful with future         patients, all of that.                         But the other deep response to death is         not simply fight but flight or avoidance.  And so the military         establishment fighting against death offers an important psychological         service to patients.                         Yes, it's certain but in a sense         uncertain as to time when this is going to happen.  And there are still         tricks that the doctor will have and so forth, so that push in the         direction of orienting even what goes on in the clinical setting, to if         not curative efforts, delaying efforts and so forth.                         Now, what this leads me to think about is         a huge shift in the religious landscape from earlier centuries, a West         shaped by a notion of a creative and nurturant God.                         And purportedly the authentic life was to         be open to this deity and then two forms of reaction to this deity,         which were defined as sin, fighting against God, Luciferian revolt         against God, and avoidance of his presence.  That was Philistine         flight.  So you had a fight and flight response in relationship to the         deity.                         One might argue that the religious         landscape of the last couple of hundred years has shifted over that the         encompassing reality is not a creative, nurturant God but what James         Joyce referred to as dio boia in ""Ulysses,"" the hangman God,         or Camus said, ""The whole world is organized by death.  In the         end, we're all done in.""                       And then you get people like Kubler-Ross saying, ""Hey, let's                be open to this.  And, indeed, being open to death, finally we're                open to ourselves at our deepest level.""  And she gave, in                a way, Heidegger-on-the-cheap there.                   But, on the other hand, the terrific         attraction of fighting against death and, further, the compounding of         that that you set up an apparatus of fighting against death that offers         people the sense that we don't get heft to face it.  So avoidance,         at a deep level, helps drive and give heft to the research imperative.                       The way you have written this chapter, it seems as though the research                imperative is driven by the military metaphor and then spills over                into the clinical setting when I think the existential setting is                quite the reverse for people, that it is certain but uncertain as                to time-when.  And there were things to be done in the hospital                that I can't do at home.  So you put them there and so forth.                 So it allows one not to have to face it yet.                   Now, yes, medicine ought to recover that         old, old imperative, learning how to accept finitude and death.  It was         very difficult to do in a setting where one really feels that         ultimately one is facing a hangman God.                         The kind of religious background, it         seems to me, would ask one to talk about the drive behind the research         imperative.  That may be at a deeper level and more complicated level         of our attraction to it and the temptation to it.                          DR. CALLAHAN:   Well, just a quick         response.  It seems to me that, even if one accepts the reality of         death, it's seemingly understandable that we would like to stall         things a bit, take our time.                         But this is true of a lot of things that         are rather unpleasant.  We avoid and we flee.  When the doctor says,         ""Well, you have to have your tooth pulled,"" we say,         ""Well, how about next week, rather than tomorrow?"" and so         forth and so on.                         I think the question of the research         imperative is — the way I like to put it is whether we ultimately         believe that death is kind of a biological accident, a contingent event         that ultimately can be overcome as distinguished from simply         forestalled.                         And it seems to me that the whole         trajectory of modern medical research has been basically to treat it as         if it were an accident.  As far as I know, there are no fatal diseases         that the NIH finds acceptable.  The NIH is not in favor of immortality,         at least officially, but there are no diseases that kill people that it         is prepared to tolerate.  And it puts money into research, any and all         lethal diseases.  So the logic of that whole movement is —                          DR. MAY:   Long before there was modern         research, you got Frazer and ""The Golden Bough"" talking in         traditional societies, a tendency to look upon death as an accident; or         in Freud, the eagerness to find out the cause of death because it is an         accident that befell somebody else and not me or you get the same thing         again in Tolstoy's ""Death of Ivan Ilych.""                          DR. CALLAHAN:   But I think with         contemporary medicine, we get a new plausibility to thinking that way.          That's the difference.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Rebecca Dresser, then         Paul.                          PROF. DRESSER:   I share many of your         views and concerns.  And I think I am so happy that you are writing         about this in your usual eloquent and elegant way.                         I had two questions.  One is, you alluded         to this but didn't speak to it directly.  Something that I think         goes on is the equation of provision of proven health care with money         for research in the political setting and sort of public ethical         debate.                         I take it you would see those both as         goods.  And so then the question would be weighing and saying which         should have priority, but I wonder if you can comment on how you might         weigh those two, the provision of proven health care to more people who         don't get access to it, versus money for research that might         improve the health care we have available now, but at the same time         leaving more people without it.                       And then my other question was about procedures, sort of at a practical                level.  If we are to try to make progress toward revising priority-setting                in these social programs, any ideas how we might go about doing                that and the role of lobbying and all of this?  Any thoughts in                that direction?                  DR. CALLAHAN:   Well, let me begin with your second question.                 I like the system used by the British government.  Of course, they                have the National Health Service.  It's financed by the government                and run by the government.  But I gather that a part of their annual                budget-setting is that the different social areas have to compete                against each other.  They have an open debate:  education versus                health versus economic development.                   I would love to see that.  Even if done         informally, I think it would be terrific if somebody could have a great         television program getting people, leaders from the different sectors         and say, ""Okay.  You want more money for education.  Are you         prepared to say less money for health?""  That would really put         everybody on the spot.  I think if we could get that in open debate, it         would be very valuable.                       I think on your first question, I think one major reform that I am in                favor of in the priority-setting area and in support of research                is that we really now need to look very carefully at the economic                consequences of research.                   Right now recently Medicare had some         hearings to look into new heart technologies that are going to very         radically increase the costs of treating heart disease.  And the         question is, which ones should Medicare cover?                         Now, typically that is done more         informally, rather than as a public debate.  I would like to see that         done openly.  I suppose my most radical suggestion would be that those         companies that manufacture new devices and new drugs must, at the same         time as they are doing safety studies and efficacy studies, be doing         economic studies and saying, ""This is our projection of the         economic impact of doing this"" and before the technology is         released.                         The typical procedure now is technologies         are developed.  And they're sort of thrown out of the window.  And         they say, ""Okay.  You health care administrators sort of deal with         it.  That's not our problem.""  And I would want to say we         should make it their problem.                         And I suppose if you want to go really         far, you would say no technology or at least to be reimbursed by the         government until it has had a very solid economic analysis and debate         and some consensus on whether this is economically worth advancing.                         Now, the typical attitude of researchers         is, well, a) that's not really their problem; and, b), after a         while, we find ways to pay for things anyway.  And this will hold up         research.                         Well, it probably would hold up research,         but, an issue that didn't come up at all, I happen to believe that         research is one of the main things that drives up costs, that right now         we are seeing cost inflation 10 to 15 percent a year.                         The estimate is 40 to 50 percent.          It's coming from new technologies or intensified use of old         technologies.  If that's the case, then I think we have to very         squarely face the problem of the research behind those technologies and         learning how better to evaluate the new technologies that come on         line.  And all of that is set within the larger context of comparing         health with other things in society.                       But I think more generally, it seems to me a really tragic situation                when we have — to me, the worst arguments around are those                on the part of the pharmaceutical companies that say, ""We need                these high profits to save future lives"" when, by God, if they                bring the price down, they could save lots of lives here and now                in Africa by making their drugs available.                   So that this notion of these wonderful         lives in the future somehow comes at a discount rate for the future.          They're basically saying, ""Oh, no.  These lives are worth more         in the future than the present lives we could save now.""  And the         drug companies simply dodge that issue altogether.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Paul McHugh?  I have a         long queue.  I will try to get to everybody before the break.                          DR. McHUGH:   Well, I also want to thank         you very much and was looking forward to your presentation because I         have read your work for a long time and expected, actually, to find         just what I found this time, that I agree with so much I am surprised         at what I disagree with.                         Let me develop my disagreements, at least         to the point of talking about them in practical terms.  I speak now as         a person who has run a laboratory and also a person who has been a         director of a clinical academic department.                         In this arena that you have laid out for         us of discussing the value and the value of research in relationship         to, is it a moral good, or is it an imperative, you first wanted to         talk about it in relationship to cost.  And it's that point I want         to bring up first, that even if it's a good, just a small good,         anyone who has had any experience with research, basic science research         or clinical research, knows what the problem for our country is in         relationship to its financial support.                         The growth of investigators and the         growth of reimbursement is a Malthusian problem because laboratories         grow and replicate themselves with their students in an exponential         geometric way.                         And anyone who has run a laboratory         begins to notice that he or she has many of these wonderful         postgraduate students.  They grow.  They become directors of their own         departments.  And they become steadily more expansive in bringing many         more opportunities to our world because of that.  But tax money and         money from the country can only grow arithmetically.                         So there is always going to be this         problem that you raise.  Why is it that the legislature, the things         closest to the people, closest to the citizenry, will always overrule         the executive, ask for more money because more money is going to be         needed for whatever, whether it is an imperative or a good, only to do         that to our country?                         On the other hand as well, it may just be         my perspective about your work and your presentation here, and it might         be just a prejudice on my part.  And so we'll accept that at the         beginning, but you've got to begin somewhere with a prejudice.  And         that is, how would I, who think of research as an obligation, a moral         obligation, approach that from my experience?  And what is research or         why research or how to judge research are the issues before us in         relationship to is it a good or a moral obligation?  And I would like,         of course, as you would, to produce, for example, one piece in this         scale, namely the achievements in research over these years.                         Now, you mentioned the wonderful         achievements we have had, at least in recognizing the cause of the AIDS         epidemic and developing very effective medications for them.  I lived,         like any doctor who has lived, with the AIDS epidemic from its earliest         beginnings right now, when everyone thought that nothing could be done         because it was a viral illness, and now out to a place where I am         taking care of a vary large number of people who carry the HIV virus         but are protected from the things which were discovered.                         In my area of work, of course, in         psychiatry, the results have equally been remarkable, really, with         research that is sometimes developed by accident but sometimes         developed out of reason.                         Those results are not just the reason for         wanting to speak about it.  I also feel that both attitude and         educational communities do not thrive unless there is research going on         within them.                         Again, I ran a clinical department.  And         the very great importance of mingling investigators with the clinicians         was to raise the standards of care offered to the patients and very         much raise the standards of discourse amongst the clinicians about what         they were doing and why they were doing it.                         Now, in psychiatry, we have this in vivid         terms described to us, demonstrated to us by the neglect of research         during the psychoanalytic era, what Ed Shorter has referred to in his         book on the history of psychiatry as the great hiatus in psychiatry         when during the psychoanalytic era, essentially no research was done         because everybody thought they knew the answer.  Okay?                         The result of that era was the neglect of         patients, the development of snake pits, the concentrations purely on         the worried well, and the loss of opportunities in neuroscience and         pharmacological work to do it.                         And for psychiatrists like myself, I have         come to believe that there really is an absolute moral obligation to         have this in our discipline and in our departments.                         And, finally, the very attitude that all         of this ultimately produces for us is an attitude of not only optimism         for the future but also an attitude of criticism for our views at the         moment.                       So for all of that, I think you have laid out a very interesting point.                 I have to say that there are some fairly fundamental disagreements                that I have with the conclusions you came to draw.  I hope you will                accept it in —                 DR. CALLAHAN:   Well, I guess if you want to continue to                use the word ""obligation,"" fine.  But then I would ask                you, is the obligation to do research in your field — and                it is not a coincidence that you feel it in your field and not my                field.  I feel an obligation for philosophical research probably                as strongly as in psychiatric medicine.                  DR. McHUGH:   Oh, I think that —                   DR. CALLAHAN:   I put that aside.  But how         do you compare with the obligation better housing, community, national         defense, safety nets?  I mean, my question is, do you want to give it         an overriding priority?  Do you say that this is worth far more money         than anything else or it ought to be put on the scale and compared with         the other obligations?                          DR. McHUGH:   Well, you know, once again,         in a democracy, we have issues of competing obligations, competing with         values.  And my assumptions are going to be that we should be trying to         meet all of those obligations as we see them and as we interpret them.                         That is how I am going to do it.  And         that is why I am in America, where we can earn the money to do it.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Michael Sandel?                          PROF.SANDEL:   Well, this follows,         Dan, on your discussion with Paul just now.  I think there is something         needlessly puzzling, confusing about the pieces you present that         obstructs what I think is really a very important insight that you are         directing us toward.                       So let me first say what I take to be one of the really interesting                directions that you have given us and then say what I think is puzzling                and wrong-headed about the way you have put the thesis.                   By calling into question the research         imperative, you have raised a bigger question lying in the background,         which you mentioned at the beginning of your talk, about the inflation         of health as a moral and social good in our society.  And Bill May gave         I thought a fascinating interpretation about the existential landscape         that might partly account for this dynamic.                       There may also be — and this is just a speculation —  a                shift in the moral and public culture that contributes to this.                 It might be that the more reluctant we become to pass judgment or                publicly to affirm what makes lives worthy or good, the more likely                we become to affirm what we take to be all-purpose means to any                lives.                 So the inflation of health may be a reflection of a non-judgmental impulse                that has entered into the moral and public culture over the past                40 years, roughly the time that you detect this inflation of health.                                Health is something we in a pluralist         society can agree on because we take it to be necessary to the         realization of just about any ends that people might pursue, against         the background desire not to affirm any particular ends as aims of         lives.                         And you have directed us to this whole         question.  That may not be the best or the only explanation.  But you         have directed us, I think rightly, to this very important phenomenon         about the inflation of health as a social and moral good.                         The thesis, what makes the thesis         confusing and puzzling, even to those of us who want to sympathize with         it, is that you really, as I understand, are saying two things.  First,         there is no moral obligation to pursue medical research.  That seems to         me wrong.  There is a moral obligation to pursue medical research.                         Then you are also saying another thing,         which you take to be the same, which is medical research is not an         overriding good.  It doesn't trump all other goods.  It has to be         balanced.  Well, that is surely right.  And I suspect everyone would         agree with that, but those two claims aren't the same.  It's         perfectly possible for something to be a moral obligation and still, as         Paul says, for there to be competing moral obligations.                         Consider other examples outside of         medical research.  There is an obligation to educate the young, to         prevent starvation, to save innocent lives where we can, to oppose         injustice, to protect the security of the country.  Those are all         obligations.  But to call them and to recognize them as such isn't         to say that any of them is an overriding good in the sense that its         pursuit trumps all other considerations.                         So I think that you could win wide         support for your thesis that medical research is not an overriding         good.  It has to be balanced against other competing goods without         making what seems to me a puzzling and unnecessary claim that it is not         a moral obligation.                          DR. CALLAHAN:   Well, the reason I was         trying to deal exactly with that confusion, which is the difference         between a perfect and an imperfect obligation, when people say there is         a duty to do stem cell research, they're giving it a very special         status.  They are saying that somehow: a) we ought to do it; and b)         others can make a claim against us that they have a right that the duty         be exercised.                         I would want to say most of these         obligations are rather nonspecific.  Yes, we have an obligation to         raise children well.  We have an obligation to our national defense and         so forth and so on.                         But I guess I want to say that you         can't use the language.  You can't make it a very specific kind         of obligation because you then have to say, who is the one who has to         carry it out?                         If you want to say there is an obligation         to carry out research, who has the duty to do that research?  Do we as         citizens have a duty that we must put up the money for it?  Does the         researcher, young researcher, have a duty that he must go into the         field that will deal with XYZ problem?                       It's narrow and very specifically goal-directed.  The imperfect                obligation it seems to me is the more general one.  So I put it                in the category of the imperfect, not the perfect.                    CHAIRMAN KASS:   Very quickly, Michael,         we're at the break time.  Let me ask the remaining people.  Dan,         are you okay for another ten minutes?  I know you have a plane to         catch?                          DR. CALLAHAN:   Yes.  Unfortunately, I         came from vacation on an island in Maine.  You can't get there from         here or back to there from here without leaving soon.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Seven minutes?                          DR. CALLAHAN:   Yes.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   We'll ask people not         to run over so the people in the queue can speak.  I have Gil, Mary         Ann, Janet, and Dan Foster.                          PROF. MEILAENDER:   Just quickly, Dan,         I wonder if I can get you to think with us just a little bit about the         structure of your argument because it seems to me there are a couple of         aspects to it.                         The one aspect that flows out of the         language of imperfect obligations is to start from goals, really,         aspirations that we seek to realize.  And there are many such goals         that we think of as goods.  And we often, contrary to Paul's         American optimism, we can't fulfill all of them.                         That in some ways becomes a process of         political argument, then.  And that's, in fact, what you have         advocated.  You would like to see more overt political argument.  There         is not necessarily any single answer that has to be given to how we         should weigh defense and medicine and education and so forth.                         It is also true, your talk about informed         consent suggests that in terms of the means to those goals, that there         are occasions when, even when a clear good could perhaps be realized,         one has to forego it simply because the means to it is prohibited.  And         that's what the principle of informed consent accomplishes.                         I just wonder if that doesn't need a         little more emphasis than you gave it, in a sense.  If there is not a         research imperative, to use that language, then I don't think the         primary reason is that we have a number of goals which we have to weigh         and that sometimes health care might come out not at the top.                         The primary reason is that we have         accepted, and I think in some ways the research community has accepted,         the fact that there are certain things that ought not be done even to         achieve a certain kind of undisputed good.  That's where you simply         can't claim that there is an imperative to do it because there is         some other imperative that really does trump it and is overriding.                         So, insofar as there is not a research         imperative, it seems to me that that fact grows primarily out of         prohibited means, rather than simply out of conflicting ends or goals.          Doesn't it?                          DR. CALLAHAN:   Well, it seems to me that         you can say that informed consent itself is a kind of moral         imperative.  And it's over against the research imperative.                         I guess I want to argue that the research         imperative is troublesome when it is taken to have the power to         overcome those moral obstacles.  That's when it seems to me it         causes trouble, moral trouble.  And it basically says it is such a high         goal that the means don't matter, that it is worth achieving         because what you are doing is of such ultimate good.                          PROF. MEILAENDER:   But you've         actually got a duty of perfect obligation in the requirement that you         respect informed consent.                          DR. CALLAHAN:   Well, in that particular         case, because you have a trust relationship between a doctor and a         researcher and a research subject, in that case, you have a situation         of perfect obligation because it is a much more narrow contractual         relationship of —                          PROF. MEILAENDER:   Not just because         of the narrow relation.  Because every human being has a right to claim         that over against potential researchers.                          DR. CALLAHAN:   But that's exactly the         point.  They have a right to claim it against researchers because we         agree that there is a particular relationship that ought to obtain         between researcher and subject.  And we, therefore, have put it into         the category of a perfect obligation; whereas, earlier, I think it was         not seen that way.  That was what the whole debate was about.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Mary Ann and Janet.                          PROF.GLENDON:   I want to thank you         very much for giving us your expansive vision of bioethics as         including, among other things, the ethical dimensions of the choices we         make about what social goods to pursue, and I just want to see if I can         make a little extension of your argument.  You have told us that         research is a good to be pursued among other goods and that there are         difficult problems of choosing among those goods.                         The extension I would like to make is         that in setting priorities among those goods, if you don't set them         thoughtfully, and after deliberation, then they are going to be set by         default or by the influence of special interests.  Would you accept         that as —                          DR. CALLAHAN:   Oh, absolutely.                          PROF.GLENDON:   And so some of the         references you made to what happens in other countries suggests that         there is more of a process of deliberation and balancing in some other         countries than there is here within the democratic forum.                         Of course, a cynical side of me says,         ""Well, yes, European countries can, just as they do with defense         spending, let us spend the big bucks on medical research.  And then         they have the luxury of democratic deliberation about education,""         et cetera.                         Nevertheless, the question I come to is,         why do you think it is that it is so difficult in these discussions to         get a public debate or even a legislative debate of the type that you         mentioned happens in England, a discussion of the pros and cons of         pursuing the various good things in a world of scarcity?                          DR. CALLAHAN:   Well, to me the great         difference between Europe and the United States is, at least as far as         health is concerned and a lot of welfare programs, the government         actually runs everything.                         They either control the financing or         financing and delivery as well.  And that means they have to work         within a closed budget.  And once you're forced to work within a         closed budget, you then are forced to deal with priorities.  You're         then forced to deal with rationing, saying some things are         comparatively more or less important.                         By virtue of our strange mixture of the         public and the private, we have no way to have a rational discussion         because you have so many different actors with different rules of the         game.                         I mean, the whole private sector can go         out and develop all sorts of things medically and technologically,         which are absolutely beyond the control of any government or any         regulation; e.g., private stem cell research, private human cloning if         they want.                         Under those circumstances, it is very         hard to set a budget.  It is very hard to have a rational discussion.          And it is very hard to have any kind of unified outlook that enables         you to set priorities.                         Now, the National Institutes of Health         has set a priority discussion and for a very simple reason.  They have         to live within a budget.  They get a certain amount of money.  And they         then have to decide how to spend that money.  So priorities are forced         upon them.  But we don't have a country that is run like the         National Institutes of Health.                         So that's why I happen to think         government is a good thing in this area because the market does not         enforce discipline.  The market forces profligacy; whereas, it is the         government's and closed budgets for discipline and         priority-setting.  We don't have it.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Janet Rowley and Dan         Foster.                          DR. ROWLEY:   Well, I appreciate the         thoughtfulness with which you have prepared the material.  I have to         say that I have very serious reservations, some of which were already         expressed in a sense by Paul.                         To me, the use of research imperative         implies that there is some direction of this imperative and an         agreement to its goals, even unstated.  And it seems to me this does         not reflect the real world of science or biomedical science as I have         lived it for over 40 years.                         Your statement just now about who is         going to tell a scientist to do stem cell research, that is not the way         science is carried out at all.  It is true it is carried out that way         in companies, but in the academic world, which is where fundamental         research is really flourishing, the scientists are the ones who have         the intellectual curiosity and the creativity to say, ""Isn't         this an interesting question?"" and to follow up on it.                         I think Liz Blackburn is a wonderful         example of somebody who was studying how the ends of chromosomes in         yeast were formed and maintained and discovered the enzyme telomerase.          And now this turns out to be a very important enzyme in cancer.  But         who would have expected research in yeast to then have that kind of         applicability?                         So there is no direction necessarily in         medical research.  It is what scientists find interesting.  Now, it is         absolutely true that many of the interests are channeled by research         questions that are considered to be very important or research areas         that are the hot topics.  And if you are a young scientist, that is         what you want to do because that is where the action is.                         But I just don't think that there is         a research imperative.  So I think that your example of NIH and their         following many different ways of Parkinson's, in part, that is         because there is no good answer.  So you try all of the options, hoping         that one or a combination of options will really give you greater         insight that will allow you, then, the next step to go beyond.                       And I realize you have a plane to catch, but I want to come back to                Alfonso's question of non-therapeutic research on children.                 I want to point out that our understanding now of how babies learn,                of how infants learn, of how different aspects of the nervous system                mature at different stages and allow infants to gradually respond                and observe, is all done by research, non-therapeutic research.                 And it has led to enormous changes on how we look on babies and                how we look on intelligence.                   So you have to put these in the context         of what it is that you are doing, what is the goal.  It may not benefit         that baby, but it sure is going to benefit babies down the line.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Dan Foster.  Why         don't we take both questions, Dan, and then we'll let you         comment?                          DR. FOSTER:   Well, I will give it to you         that the Council seems to have their loquacious genes fully on this         morning.  As a consequence, I am going to bring it back towards the         mean by depriving the Council of my remarks, which were really of         eternal significance, but I am not going to —                          (Laughter.)                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Do you want to follow         that?  Why don't you respond to Janet?                          DR. CALLAHAN:   Okay.  I certainly         wasn't claiming that the research imperative has goals.  The         research imperative in its benign sense I simply mean has a very strong         sense within the scientific community supported by the American public         that research is a good thing that ought to go forward.  And we ought         to put money into it.  And that's what I mean by the imperative,         that this is a valuable thing that should be carried out.  That's         all.                         The goals are all over the place.  People         have different goals at different levels and so forth, so on.  And, of         course, you are someone who spoke for the research imperative.  Your         scientific colleague said exactly sort of what I was saying.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Council members, we have         run over.  We have a guest waiting to speak.  Let's return at five         minutes of 11:00.  Dan Callahan, thank you very much for being with         us.  We're adjourned for 15 minutes.                         (Applause.)                        (Whereupon, the foregoing matter went off the record at 10:41 a.m.                and went back on the record at 10:58 a.m.)                                   SESSION 2:  STEM                CELL RESEARCH:   CURRENT ETHICAL LITERATURE                   CHAIRMAN KASS:   This is the second session, ""Stem Cell Research:                 Current Ethical Literature.""  As Council members surely recall,                the formation of this council was connected to President Bush's                decision announced in his address to the nation in August of 2001                to permit for the first time the use of federal funds to support                research on human embryonic stem cells, this despite the existence                of congressional statute, the Dickey-Wicker Amendment that prohibited                the use of federal funds for research in which a human embryo or                embryos are destroyed, discarded, or knowingly subjected to injury                or death, risks of injury or death, greater than that allowed for                research on fetuses  in utero .                   Among its other functions, this Council         was charged with monitoring stem cell research; that is, following and         keep abreast of all developments, scientific, medical, ethical, and         legal, in this exciting area of research, embryonic and adult.  The         rest of today's meeting is given over entirely to helping us         fulfill that charge.                         We are following and monitoring         developments in the ethical argumentations on stem cell research,         developments in the basic scientific research and clinical application,         developments in the state laws, as these have taken place over the past         two years under the current federal policy.                         To aid us in these monitoring tasks, we         have commissioned seven review papers:  one on recent developments of         the discussions of the ethics of stem cell research, five on recent         scientific and clinical developments in five separate areas of         embryonic and adult stem cell research, one on recent developments in         state law regarding stem cell research.                         The ethics review paper was prepared by         our guest for this session, Professor Paul Lauritzen, who is professor         of the Department of Religious Studies and the director of the Program         of Applied Ethics at John Carroll University in Cleveland.  Speaking         only for myself, I would note with gratitude that Professor Lauritzen         has tried in his paper to expand our horizon of the relevant ethical         issues to include matters beyond the one that has so preoccupied us,         namely the important issue of the moral status of the embryo.                         I would like to welcome Professor         Lauritzen, who will offer a beginning presentation, after which both         the presentation and his paper will be open for our discussion.  Thank         you very much for joining us.  We look forward to hearing from you.                          DR. LAURITZEN:   Thank you.                         Let me begin by saying I made the mistake         of sending the slide show ahead of time and got a call from Dean Clancy         last night wondering what the slide show and my presentation had to do         with my report because I had decided not to simply summarize my report         but to just highlight a few themes in my presentation.                         And I suspect that Dean is a better and         keener observer of human nature because he pointed out that perhaps not         everyone would have read the report as carefully as I might have         assumed.  But I wasn't going to write another presentation at nine         o'clock last night.  And so I am going to give the one I wrote,         which really takes some themes of my report and tries to highlight them         by way of some additional data.  Mostly I am just going to read this.                         Several people who have read the draft of         my report have commented that for someone who argues that we should         move beyond the debates about embryos and the status of the embryo, I         spend a lot of time in the report talking about embryos.                         At the risk of inviting that objection         today, I want to begin with of slide that reproduces data reported         recently from a study conducted jointly by the Society of Assisted         Reproductive Technology and the RAND Corporation on the number and         dispositions of frozen embryos in the country.  Forgive me if you have         already considered this data, but it wasn't clear to me whether you         had.                         As you can see from the slide maybe and         based on a survey of 340 of the 430 assisted reproductive technology         practices in the United States, the documented number of embryos in         frozen storage as of April 11, 2002 is approximately 400,000.                         Moreover, the study was able to document         the use to which these frozen embryos were designated by the IVF         couples from whom they came.  Indeed, one point of the study was to         determine how many frozen embryos are, in fact, available for use in         the derivation of stem cell lines.                       Despite the fact that many advocates of stem cell research call for                deriving stem cells from embryos left over from IVF procedures,                the authors of the study contend that so-called ""spare embryos""                are not a ready source of stem cell lines.                   Of the nearly 400,000 frozen embryos in         storage, apparently only 11,000 are available for possible use in         deriving stem cells.  Although this seems like a large number of         embryos, according to the authors, in fact, it is not.  And they break         down that 11,000 along these lines.                         Of those 11,000 or approximately 11,000,         only 65 percent will survive the thawing process, leaving roughly 7,000         embryos.  Only 25 percent of that 7,000 will develop to the blastocyst         stage, leaving roughly 2,000 blastocysts.  And only 15 percent of those         blastocysts will yield viable cell lines, leaving roughly 275 cell         lines.                         According to this study, then, despite         the large number of embryos frozen in this country, the number of         potential stem cell lines available from their use is relatively small.                         This is clearly an important study.  For         one thing, it gives empirical grounding to the claim that we can derive         stem cell lines from frozen embryos.  It is less likely to be widely         cited.                         My reason for beginning with it, however,         is quite different.  I wish to highlight not the number of frozen         embryos cited in the study but, rather, the date of the study's         publication, namely May 2003.                       As the study points out, the first live birth in this country                from a cryo-preserved embryo was in 1986.  That means for nearly                20 years, we have had almost no idea of the scope of embryo cryo-preservation                in this country.  Let me make two observations about this fact.                                First, I believe it supports my claim         that talk about respecting the embryo from conception is frequently         more rhetorical than anything else.  If the early embryo is really to         be treated as a being who deserves serious respect, you would think         that we would at least know how many embryos are routinely frozen,         discarded, or otherwise lost through IVF.  Not to put too sharp a point         on it, but if each embryo were equivalent in value to a dollar bill, we         would have lost track of nearly half a million dollars.                         Second, the fact that until recently we         knew almost nothing about the numbers or the dispositions of frozen         embryos highlights just how unregulated the world of reproductive         medicine is.                       As this Council knows well and as the staff working paper to be discussed                tomorrow highlights, the world of reproductive medicine is almost                entirely unregulated.  Cryo-preservation of embryos is just one                of the many developments in reproductive medicine that has been                introduced as therapy without any sort of clinical trials and without                any real oversight.  The significance of this fact in relation to                stem cell research is that we have in reproductive medicine a model                for what happens when commerce is wedded to desperation, when research                is privatized, and when there is essentially no regulation.                   More than one commentator has invoked the         image of the Wild West to capture this scene.  The image strikes me as         particularly apt, not least because the wild West was notoriously         dangerous, at least as it has been conceived in the popular         imagination.                         There are clear dangers in the         unregulated world of reproductive medicine.  I know there is some         controversy about this point, but consider the report in the  New         England Journal of Medicine  last year on the risks of major defects         after ICSI and  in vitro  fertilization.                         According to this study, infants         conceived of reproductive technology were more than twice as likely as         naturally conceived infants to have major birth defects diagnosed         during the first year of life and were also more likely to have         multiple major defects.  These were the odds ratios after the numbers         were adjusted for maternal age, multiple births, and other factors that         might have skewed the data upward.                         Moreover, the increased risks were not         confined to just one organ system.  They were found in cardiovascular,         urogenital, musculoskeletal, and gastrointestinal systems.                         Again, my point is not to focus on         specific problems with reproductive medicine, as it is currently         practiced, but to highlight a pattern.  Just as opposition to embryo         research has led to the privatization of work on  in vitro          fertilization, with virtually no oversight or regulation of IVF, so,         too, has it led to the privatization of stem cell research with similar         results.                         This is one reason I have noted the         relation of IVF and stem cell research in my report.  The other is that         I do not think we have fully appreciated the deep tensions between the         widespread acceptance of IVF and a widespread profession of respect for         the early embryos.                         A foolish consistency may be the         hobgoblin of little minds.  And Emerson may be right that such a         consistency is adored by statesmen, philosophers, and divines.  But         consistency in ethics is rarely foolish.                       I have no quarrel with Emerson's advice to speak your mind forcefully                today, even if it flatly contradicts what you thought and said yesterday.                 My concern is that we speak out of both sides of our mouths simultaneously                when we say that destroying an embryo is killing a person or that,                indeed, the early embryo deserves profound respect and also say                or act as if discarding embryos in IVF is non-problematic.                   I tried to illustrate this point in my         report by drawing attention to the cartoon comparing reactions to a         stem cell clinic and an abortion clinic and then asking the reader to         imagine that an IVF clinic is substituted for the stem cell clinic.          Here is the cartoon.                       As you can see, the cartoon depicts protesters in front of a stem                cell research lab, condemning those who worked there as being anti-life.                 Down the street at the abortion clinic, the workers are noting how                quiet things have gotten at the facility since the stem cell lab                opened.                 The point of the cartoon, of course, is that opposition to stem cell                research appears to be almost as passionate as opposition to abortion                and that there is perhaps an irony in the fact that pro-life advocates,                thus, appear to be committed to demonstrating against research being                done to find treatments for Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and                other devastating illnesses.                   Now, try to imagine protesters standing         outside an IVF clinic or, even better, outside maternity wings,         condemning couples who use IVF as murderers or at least complicit with         murder.  It is almost impossible to imagine this scene.  And it is         worth asking why.                         If the early embryo is fully a person,         shouldn't we condemn IVF and work to prohibit it?  Is condemning         stem cell research but accepting IVF not inconsistent?                         Of course, one response to this alleged         inconsistency would be to say that we should, in fact, be consistent in         trying to prohibit both IVF and embryonic stem cell research.  I do not         subscribe to that position myself, nor do I think it is a politically         viable option.  But it would at least be consistent.                         Notice, however, that a ban on embryonic         stem cell research will not eliminate the many issues raised by the         prospect of regenerative medicine.  And that is another theme from my         report that I wish to highlight.                         Although the ethics debate has mostly         focused on the status of the early embryo and has, therefore, tended         almost exclusively to issues raised by embryonic stem cell research, we         need to take a closer look at issues raised by the prospect of adult         stem cell research as well.                       I have discussed some of these issues in my report.  And I merely                list some of them here.  They include issues of social justice;                of commodification or of commerce; issues about the conception of                nature and what nature might mean; issues about human embodiment;                issues raised by the erosion of species boundaries, so-called hybridization;                and issues for implications of personal identity and moral responsibility.                                Worries about eroding the boundaries         among species, about destabilizing the concept of nature, and about         treating human bodies merely instrumentally are related.                         I believe that this cluster of issues         deserves special attention going forward.  And, again, my point is that         it's a cluster that is raised for adult stem cell research as well         as for embryonic.  So that while we ought to continue debating the         status of the embryo, we also ought to move beyond that debate to focus         on these other issues as well.                         I also think that we might do well, at         least initially, to think about these issues outside of the contested         question of human nature.  For example, I wonder whether there is some         merit in considering the pervasive human manipulation of nonhuman         animals.                       For example, it may be useful to take as more than a curiosity                the so-called transgenic art of Eduardo Kac.  Several years ago                Kac made headlines around the world with his public art intervention                that included Alba, the green fluorescent protein bunny.                   As you may recall, Alba was an albino         rabbit that glowed green under certain light because it had been         genetically altered and carried a gene from a jellyfish.                         Kac defined transgenic art as ""a new         art form based on the use of genetic engineering to transfer natural or         synthetic genes to an organism to create new living beings.""  And         here is a slide of Kac with Alba.                         Many people were outraged at Kac's         creation.  And many dismissed his work as a publicity stunt.  But, in         fact, part of the point of the Alba project was to generate a public         conversation on the cultural and ethical implications of genetic         engineering.                         According to Kac, ""The creation of a         chimeric animal forces us to examine notions of normalcy,         heterogeneity, purity, hybridity, and otherness.""  Here is Alba         glowing green.                       The claim that I just read is a bit too jargon-filled for my taste.                 That he did not use ""alterity,"" instead of ""otherness,""                is astonishing.  But Kac's work invites us to reflect on the                implications of turning nonhuman animals into artifacts.  Of course,                we have been doing that for a very long time.  Still, it's worth                thinking carefully about our reaction to the creation of Alba.                   It is worth asking whether our reaction         to Alba is different from our reaction to, say, the creation of the         Harvard oncomouse and if so, why.                         I began my written report with a passage         from C. S. Lewis.  And so it's perhaps fitting to draw my         presentation to a close with another passage from the ""Abolition         of Man.""  Lewis writes, ""Now, I take it when we understand a         thing analytically and then dominate it and use it for our own         convenience, we reduce it to the level of 'nature' in the sense         that we suspend our judgments of value about it; ignore its final         cause, if any; and treat it in terms of quantity.  The repression of         elements in what would otherwise be our total reaction to it is         sometimes very noticeable and even painful.  Something has to be         overcome before we can cut up a dead man or a live animal in a         dissecting room.""                         Although it is perhaps justifiable to         reduce the world of nature to mere nature, as Lewis puts it, I am         inclined to agree with him that something is lost when we do so.                         When I reread the ""Abolition of         Man"" in working on this presentation, I was struck by the fact         that the sort of dynamic Lewis describes here is very close to that         recorded in Jonathan Glover's impressive work ""Humanity, A         Moral History of the 20th Century.""                         Glover writes, ""Human responses are         the core of the humanity which contracts within humanity.  They are         widely distributed.  But to identify them with humanity is only partly         an empirical claim.  It remains also partly an aspiration.""                         As Glover powerfully argues, morality         must be rooted in human needs and values.  And these needs and values         are both rooted in human nature and grounded in human aspiration.                         As we move forward to wrestle with issues         of stem cell research, we ought to be conscious of what is at stake in         the possibility of redefining either our natures or our aspirations,         for, as Glover makes clear, the inhumanity of humans is a frightening         and all too familiar thing.                         Thank you.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you very much.  I         assume, Professor Lauritzen, that both the presentation and the paper         are fair game in the discussion.                          DR. LAURITZEN:   Sure, absolutely.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Does someone want to         start?  Jim Wilson, please?                        PROF. WILSON:   I wanted to be clear, Professor                Lauritzen, in your views.  You displayed the differences in the                cumulative prevalence of diagnosed major birth defects singled in                infants resulting either from natural conception or IVF and pointed                out that the data suggest that that incidence is roughly twice as                high with IVF as it is with natural conception.                   Do you conclude from that that we should         be opposed to IVF?                          DR. LAURITZEN:   No.  I mean, first let me         say that data is somewhat controversial, I gather, in that there are         other studies that don't show that kind of risk.  Rather, my point         is that we don't have the data.  I mean, that is part of the issue         here.                         I have to go back and look, but I think         that data actually came from western Australia.  So it doesn't even         reflect data in this country.  I think that is right.  I would have to         go back and look.                         The point is we are not tracking the         potential health consequences of  in vitro  fertilization in         anything like the way we should.  And it seems to me part of the reason         is that this is an area, reproductive medicine is, which has almost no         oversight.  And it obviously also has almost no federal funding.                         Had there been federal funding, there         might have been more oversight.  But even apart from the issue of         federal funding, it is an issue of one area of medicine where the move         from a novel idea, like intracytoplasmic sperm injection, moves very         quickly into clinical practice when it is really a therapeutic modality         that has been largely untested.                         And then it is offered as a therapy when         it is really, in fact, experimental and not tracked in any significant         way.  So we don't know, long term, what the genuine health risks         have been.                       So that one of the issues here I think a staff working paper —                the Council may have flagged that.  The little regulation there                is tends to be sort of consumer protection regulation so that prospective                couples using IVF should be protected in some way, get adequate                information about success rates of clinics and things of that sort                when, in fact, there may be larger public health issues about the                long-term implications for women and children, for the women undergoing                high-dose hormones to induce hyperovulation and for the children                to see if there are long-term health consequences or, for that matter,                short-term ones.                  PROF. WILSON:   Could I make one follow-up?                    DR. LAURITZEN:   Please?                        PROF. WILSON:   I certainly agree with you about                the unfortunate lack of longitudinal research that will track babies                from these processes.  My view is that we should encourage this.                                But let's suppose there is this         longitudinal research to the extent that we can.  And let's         suppose, in effect, it replicates the data you have presented for the         United States over the long term.  Would such data lead you to question         the value of IVF?                        DR. LAURITZEN:   Well, I think it raises certainly issues about                which there is a significant literature in the philosophical side                of things about so-called harm to future children.                   And there are folks like John Robertson         who have argued a variation of the point that essentially you can't         harm by bringing that into existence because without the technology,         this child would not exist or the adults that might come from the         child.                         So that even if it turned out that there         were significant health risks, much higher rates of cancer in children,          in vitro  fertilization procedures, that you haven't, in         fact, harmed those children because they wouldn't have existed         otherwise.                         My own view is that that is not the right         approach to frame it entirely in terms of harm to the specific child         and compare that to nonexistence, which obviously is a difficult         comparison.                         So I'm dodging your specific         question, I think, a bit except to say we ought to sort through it.  I         mean, obviously there is no regulation preventing couples to reproduce         who are carriers of known genetic effects with a certain percentage         likelihood of problems for their children.                         So I am not saying necessarily that that         would mean we should shut down IVF programs, but it's information         we need.  It's, frankly, information that ought to be a kind of         obviously a fairly detailed part of the informed consent process for         couples considering using IVF.  And I don't think that any of those         things are true now.                        PROF.WILSON:   Thank you.                    CHAIRMAN KASS:   Janet Rowley?                        DR. ROWLEY:   I would like to follow up on both your comment and                then Jim's question because I think that it is extraordinarily                important that we emphasize, as we have in previous Council meetings                and in the document we have under consideration, the lack of reliable                long-term data on the outcome of IVF and ICSI and other procedures.                                I think we have to emphasize that that is         because there has been no money available to gather such data.  And         such data is going to be very, very costly to obtain.                       I know just in terms of our own research projects of tracking                down cancer patients and what's the long-term outcome of their                treatment, that to try to find these individuals is extremely difficult.                                The laws have just been changed, the         Privacy Act.  So I would think that before you can contact any         individual, you have to go to the clinic.  The clinic has to go to that         patient and say that they're trying to collect information and         would the patient be willing to provide that information before you can         even begin the collection process.                       So this is no small task that we have set and that apparently CDC is                embarking on because it is a two or a three-stage process before                you get it.                   And you say research is privatized.  This         is the only area of medicine in which research is privatized.  And,         again, that leads to the problems that we are currently facing.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you.                          DR. LAURITZEN:   Can I just make one         observation on that?                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Please?                          DR. LAURITZEN:   I think there is going to         be that difficulty of getting consent.  There is also I think in the         case of reproductive medicine the additional difficulty that the         prospective parents in giving that consent would have to be         acknowledging in a way that is different from cancer, where the         expectation is that there is going to be certain morbidity and         mortality.                       Well, the assumption that most infertile couples have is that                if we go forward with this, we are going to have a healthy child                and there aren't going to be long-term problems.  So I think                to some degree, reproductive docs are going to be a bit reluctant                to raise the specter of potential long-term harms going in.                    DR. ROWLEY:   Can I make two comments?          One, my impression is that most infertile couples who live in states         where there is no insurance and, therefore, they are paying 30 to 50         thousand dollars for this procedure are pretty sophisticated and, as a         consequence, know the risks that they face.                       What we are trying to get is data on children 5 or 10 years old or older                now and what is their status so that the individuals involved in                IVF 5, 10, or 15 years ago gave no such consent for this follow-up                information.  And that is the first step of running a survey, to                get their permission to even contact them to get the information.                                 CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you.                         Just as one fact, I understand that the         NIH is gearing up for a massive study on children, a prospective         study.  And it might be of interest to us to explore the ways in which         some of the things that we would be interested in might be incorporated         in the planning of this study as it goes forward.  But that's for a         later discussion.                         I had myself in the queue.  Let me deal         with things in the paper, rather than in the presentation.  A couple of         comments and then a question.  First, I guess it's fair to say you         criticize what you take to be the excessively individualistic treatment         of the ethical questions, especially as they are concerned with the         matters of the embryo or even the language of rights in this area.                         I would simply observe that in questions         of life and death, which, after all, are things that befall         individuals, a certain individualistic focus ought not to be pejorative         but is somehow necessary, that there might be other kinds of goods that         are here that don't concern individuals, but the people who care         about whether or not embryonic life is destroyed will, in fact, care         about the death of individuals.  And that can't be avoided.          Whenever you are dealing with a question of death, you can't sort         of avoid that.  That would be an observation.  I don't imagine you         would dissent from it.  I would take that as a friendly amendment.                         Second, on the questions of economics and         commerce, it seems to me there are three things potentially that are         bothering you here.  One is the notion of commerce in the body         altogether.  Second are questions having to do with distributive         justice and unequal access to the benefits that are available.  And         third is a kind of faint whiff of a dislike of profit, although it         doesn't come out very strongly.                         These are questions that have come up         around the table before.  And I am sometimes sympathetic to these         arguments, but reading your paper made me less so for these reasons.                         It seemed to me that the mere assertion         of inequality is not ipso facto a demonstration of injustice, though         the question of equal access is important.  The remarks about the truck         company said, after all, why should they be able to profit from the         embryos when the people whose embryos they were don't?  The answer         to that is they have mixed their labor with it extracting the stem         cells.  The embryos as such are not by themselves valuable until         somebody has done something to them.  So at least there is a prima         facie case for saying that there is some claim for profit.                         And then on the question of commerce in         the body, I am not so sure whether it is the money changing hands that         bothers us as much as it is sort of the free alienation of body parts.          We don't object to people selling their labor, although people have         done so.  And, therefore, I wonder whether what might bother us is even         —  if there was something that was somehow disquieting simply about the         giving of an embryo for research, we would be bothered by the fact that         someone might be paid for it.  I think the commercial aspect of this is         a sign that there is something beneath the commerce that is troubling         to us.                         I have got more, but that is too much.          Let me stop.  I would be interested in your comment, really, on this         nest of the economic questions.  It's not the first time that we         have taken them up, but we haven't taken up in the stem cell         context.  And I think it would be useful to spend a few minutes on         that.                          DR. LAURITZEN:   Sure.  Well, my first         reaction is to say that I'm not sure your nose for the smell of the         concern about profit is on target.  I would be happy to accept a larger         stipend for my work here.  So we can talk about that afterwards.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   People make exceptions to         their own case.                          DR. LAURITZEN:   I mean, I do think         it's a fair observation.  And it depends, I suppose.  One point         about the embryo, the difference between the researcher who mixes his         or her labor to produce the product and the embryo is going to depend,         of course, what stage we're talking about with embryo research.                       And, arguably, women have mixed the labor of their body in producing                either the eggs and going through the hormone regimens to generate                the embryos or if we're talking about an embryo then subsequently                brought to term, obviously there is the work of gestation, though                I don't like that kind of language particularly.  And that may                just be my anti-profit convictions of some sort.                   As you were talking, I was trying to         think of some comparisons.  Here I am just trying to mine an intuition         in a way that as I thought about surrogacy, for example, in the past, I         have always found the prospect of surrogacy more troubling in a case         where there is a paid surrogate than in a case where there might be a         family member who has stepped forward to carry a child.                         So I am not sure quite how you put the         point, but there is something about the commercial aspect of paying the         surrogate that seems problematic in a way that a sister or a cousin or         something who might offer to gestate a child doesn't invoke.  So I         am not sure —                           CHAIRMAN KASS:   Why is that?                          DR. LAURITZEN:   Yes.  I think it is a         good question.  In part —  well, I'm not sure.  Let me say that my         inclination at this point is to draw on the story of the minister who         had gone to seminary and had training in doing sermons, which I         haven't had the benefit of.  This guy was giving a talk at the         university.  And he had a written text.  I went up afterwards.  In the         margin throughout, there were a couple of marginal notes that were         ""PP.""                       So I was puzzled by this.  And I asked him what they referred                to.  And he said, ""Pound the pulpit.""  So he always pounded                the pulpit at the weakest point in his argument.  And I'm inclined                to pound the pulpit here.                   I'm not sure that's the best         response, but it may be all I can come up with right now.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Gil Meilaender and         Alfonso.                          PROF. MEILAENDER:   At the risk of         dismaying our chairman, although perhaps not to your surprise, I want         to come to a question about the structure of your paper, the way you         work it out, where you suggest that there has been too much attention         paid to the embryo status question and not enough to this other range         of things.  Leon congratulated you on that, and I want to worry about         that a little bit.  Well, okay, Leon, I am just having a little fun         with you.                          I haven't at the moment come up with         a great analogy, but if in the instance of warfare, for instance, we         were using all sorts of very large, powerful weapons with very little         concern about the collateral damage that came to people apart from the         military targets themselves and I was worried about that and you said,         ""Well, yeah, but let's don't focus too much on that.          Let's worry about the fact that we are probably stereotyping our         enemies when we think we can do this to them,"" that we may coarsen         our sensibilities in pursuing warfare in this way, that acquiescing too         quickly in this may keep us from developing other better kinds of         weapons and those are the things that we really ought to worry about         while proceeding to bombing the living daylights out of them in this         way, it would strike me that —  and you will recognize that this is a         version of a different formulation —  that would be an argument for         sort of unlimited casualties always with tears.                         We should always feel bad about these         casualties because of all of these other reasons involved while we         continue to inflict them.  It seems to me that that is sort of the         structure of your argument.  And while I don't wish to deny that         one or another of the issues that you raise might be important to think         about, indeed, that they are all important and that taken as a package,         they bear considerable weight, I can't imagine that we would worry         so much about them if we had entirely set aside the issue that you say         we have worried too much about, namely what we ought to think about the         embryo.                         And so I guess what I want to know is,         will you accept my description of the structure of your argument as         sort of unlimited stem cell research always with tears?  And if you         will, are you really prepared to defend that kind of moral argument?                          DR. LAURITZEN:   What you need to know is         that Gil has accused me of this once before.  I think I denied it in         that context and will probably deny it again here.                         It seems to me that in urging in some way         the expansion of the moral discussion, I don't want to suggest that         we not attend to the status of the embryo.  There may be a way in which         I put my point too rhetorically sharply to try to suggest that.                         So I don't want to suggest that we         stop talking about the embryos, the status of the embryo.  We are going         to have sharp disagreements around the room.  And there is a sense in         which what I said in the report was suggestive of the fact that, look,         it's hopeless.  We're never going to make any progress on         this.  So let's just stop talking about it.                         And I may have come close to saying         something like that.  I didn't mean to.  After all, we have made         progress on moral status questions in the past.  I mean, we certainly         in this country have made progress with regard to African American         status and the status of women historically.                         I think there is some reason to suggest         that we have made at least some progress with regard to thinking about         the status of nonhuman animals.  So I think their status questions are         important and we should continue to talk about them.                         But my point, instead —  and I suppose         this is something of a structural issue.  My point is to say, why         don't we bracket for a moment that which divides us and focus on         that about which we are united?  There may not be universal agreement         about those thing we're united about, but I think we would find         more commonality around the table if we started focusing on some of the         issues that I identified that apply to both embryonic stem cell         research and adult stem cell research, which might, in fact, lead us to         hesitate to do embryonic stem cell research, not because we share the         conviction that their early embryo is a person with a full moral status         but because we agree on a cluster of other values.                         So that I don't think I am         necessarily suggesting that we continue doing, necessarily doing,         embryonic stem cell research and just wringing our hands about it,         though I do say in the end, just to try to weigh my own position out,         in fairness, that I think it is justified to go forward with both         embryonic stem cell research and adult stem cell research in a         carefully regulated way.                          PROF. MEILAENDER:   As long as         we're haunted by it.  Is that the language?                          DR. LAURITZEN:   Yes, that we will be         haunted by it, we will be wringing our hands about it and I will be         crying and tearful.  But I could easily be persuaded that part of the         regulation would be, for example, moratorium on embryonic stem cell         research until we do more adult stem cell work but, even there, be         awfully careful about how we are doing it.                         So I don't entirely accept your         characterization, but it's not entirely unfair either.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   I have Alfonso.  Bill, do         you want on this point or —                           DR. MAY:   Not directly.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Okay.  Then I'll put         you on the queue.  Alfonso?                          DR.GÓMEZ-LOBO:   I'm going to refer         to the paper as well, but I'll preface that by saying that,         unfortunately, it seems to me on certain moral issues, we just have to         have sharp disagreements, the idea focusing on what we have in common.          That papers over the deeper question, will it not serve the American         public?                         I read your paper over a couple of times         because I don't see in the paper the presentation of the         arguments.  I see descriptions.  I see appeals.  But, for instance, to         put embryonic stem cell research and adult stem cell research as         closely connected it seems to be obscures an argument that some of us         have against one and in favor of the other.  That's why, for         instance, I would say I am all for stem cell research.                       My only concern, my single concern is that we not use, destroy,                or instrumentalize human beings to do that.  That is why, for instance,                one of the great challenges I see for the scientist is just try                to figure out how to get those stem cells without destroying the                organisms.                   It's a challenge from someone who is         viewing this from the point of view of moral philosophy.  And         that's why I am very interested in your arguments for your final         statement that you think that an embryo is not a person.                         And just to go out on a limb, let me give         you an argument.  And you please try to refute it.  I would say the         following.  I have a twin brother.  I was conceived 64 years ago.  I         got my genetic inheritance from my father presumably at the time.                         Genetically I am the same individual I         was back then.  And spatio-temporally also, I have the relationship of         saying this with that early embryo.  If you pursue me in time and         space, it turns out that I am the same individual.                         And then my second premise, well, I am a         person now.  I am a human being now, and I should be respected now.          Why should I not have been respected then?                          DR. LAURITZEN:   Well, a couple of things,         first about your earlier point.  I guess what I want to press you on is         why your only concern about stem cell research, adult or embryonic, is         that it may destroy human beings.                         I think there is certainly a range of         issues that I think have come up in other Council deliberations that I         would urge you to take up going forward about the social implications         of profoundly enhancing human characteristics in various ways, perhaps         radically increasing the human life span.  Whether that is realistic or         not is another matter.  But if, in fact, it is, it seems to me to raise         important moral issues.                         Already this morning we have had some         discussion.  Dan talked about Harold Varmus' concern about access         to therapies.  All of those issues are I think terribly pressing moral         ones.  And they don't have anything at all to do with destroying         embryos or necessarily destroying human persons.                         So in a way, that's what I mean to         say.  I think we would have a very interesting conversation about that         when we didn't talk about embryos at all.                       The second part has to do with embryos.  There is some material                in the report that I think is at least intriguing to talk about                the developmental potential of that early embryo as if it was, in                effect, a kind of little homunculus that just is going to develop                in a set way is just biologically inaccurate, that it's the                interaction of a complex set of systems that in your case, in fact,                led to an arc that 64 years later is you.  And you can trace back                that arc.  But that doesn't mean that there was the potential                in that early embryo or only one natural kind of teleology that                leads to you.                   In a different environment, it would have         led to some other.  Well, if we derive stem cells and then grow an         organ from them, say, well, we say that heart, we can trace back to         that embryo that was then disaggregated to produce the stem cells.                       I didn't jot down everything you said but genetic relation,                spatio-temporal relations, you could trace the same arc backwards                if the environment were such that it produced something else.                   This is a fairly common argument, but I         don't find it compelling.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   I'll give you one         more round briefly.  You see the incorrigibility of this.  One more         shot.                          DR.GÓMEZ-LOBO:   I'll follow the         rules.  A heart is a part of an organism.  It's not a complete         organism.  And what matters, really, is the entity through time of the         complete organism, it seems to me.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Michael Sandel, Bill May,         and then Rebecca is what I have.                          PROF.SANDEL:   I liked your paper         very much.  I was just going to offer a brief reply that you might         offer to Leon, but while I'm at it, I could also offer you a brief         reply to Alfonso.                          DR. LAURITZEN:   That would be great.                          PROF.SANDEL:   That would be that         it's also true that every oak tree was once an acorn, but it         doesn't follow that acorns are oak trees or that we should regard         the loss of an oak tree as the same as the loss of an acorn.                         The reply to Leon, do you want to hear         that now?                          DR. LAURITZEN:   Absolutely, and anybody         else.                          PROF.SANDEL:   The reply to Leon         might be that the reason that commerce in the body is objectionable in         a way that is independent from the giving, as in your surrogacy case,         the reason there may be a difference is that to support your intuition         that there is something objectionable to commercial surrogacy that         might not be the case with gifted surrogacy, say, of a sister, for         example, that the ground for that intuition might be that the body         isn't private property, open to any use that we may desire or         devise, but, instead, is a gift with a certain telos.  This should         appeal to Leon, in fact, a natural telos, which means that it's not         open to use for other lesser purposes, like making money.                         So that in the case of commercial         surrogacy, this would be a case of using the body or selling oocytes,         for example.  This would be a case of using the body for a purpose at         odds with its telos, namely making money.                         But to donate or to gift without any         commercial transaction for one's sister, say, to carry her child         wouldn't be objectionable in the same way.  It would still be in         accord with the natural telos of the body.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   I won't say more than         it's an odd natural telos to say that one woman's uterus is to         carry the child of someone else, even out of love.  I mean, that's         a new kind of natural teleology.  We would have to argue about it.                          PROF.SANDEL:   But you would agree,         wouldn't you, that it's in line with the natural purpose in a         way that selling it to make money clearly isn't?                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   No.  It's a nice         try.  But I think that if there weren't something disquieting about         the thing itself, the fact that money changed hands wouldn't even         occur.  The same thing is true about prostitution.  The same thing is         true about a whole range of things.                         I am not saying it is wrong, but we are         not, most of us are not, upset with the fact that people sell their         labor.  And the money changes hands.  And it may distort human         relations profoundly, but we don't regard that somehow as a deep         violation in the same way as a lot of people seem to regard the selling         of body parts as a violation.  And that must mean it has something to         do with the alienation of one's body from one's self to begin         with.                          PROF.SANDEL:   It's use, rather         than alienation.  The intuition at odds with this is kidney fails, a         lot of people that object to a market in kidneys who wouldn't         necessarily consider that our position requires you to say that there         is something objectionable to a kidney transplant as such.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   I said,         ""disquieting.""  I didn't say, ""objectionable.""                          PROF.SANDEL:   Well, even         disquieting.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   There is.  There is         something to begin with disquieting about taking an organ from one body         and putting it in another.  I think it's terrific that we do it.          It's not a question of an objection.  But it's odd.                         I'm sorry.  I'm not on trial         here.  It is Bill May.                          DR. MAY:   I hadn't planned to say         anything on surrogacy, but it seems to me not simply the question of         the telos of the body, but it's different.  Gestating is different         from manufacturing, where you can distinguish the process from the         product.  But in gestation, there is a kind of bonding to what is         within you.  And the releasing of that child to another because         it's a bond ought not simply to be based on commerce.                         The early court case on this said they         tried to distinguish process from product, you know.  And merely buying         the process misses what is going on for the woman and bonding and why         it should not be an enforceable contract.  It can only be a gift         because a kind of bonding has gone on.                         I was interested in another issue, and I         will take advantage of my opportunity here to say you and Dan Callahan         have brought up front the issue of access to benefits in a way that it         seems to me we have not as frontally discussed that topic.  It has come         up from time to time, but it really hasn't been as openly discussed         across a couple of sessions.  And I wanted to deal with that issue.                         There might be a way of talking about the         status of the embryo but relate that issue to the import for access to         product.  Some of us in this group did not agree with the idea of a         total ban on cloning for research purposes.  We talked about the         intermediate status of the embryo, that it is not fully there with the         claim of the human.  And, therefore, we were not ready to talk about a         ban.                       On the other hand, it is not nothing.  It is not yard-lot materials.                 It has a kind of intermediate status.  And that has implications.                 Most of our time was spent on the issue of how you do the research                and respect for this pre-implanted embryo.  Most of the discussion                was in that area.                 But it seems to me if you use the pre-implanted embryo in research,                one has to talk about regulations that not only constrain how you                conduct that research, let's say the 14 days before the neural                streak an all of that, but if you are using this human source and                you are removing it from life, you are not removing it from the                circle of human indebtedness.                   And that is a consideration that is not         simply individualism.  It's that you are conducting research on         something that doesn't have the full claim of urgent human needs of         extant human beings.                         But, on the other hand —  and I would not         want to use the word ""resource.""  I would call it         ""source,"" a human source.  And if you are conducting this         research and removing it from life, you are not removing it from the         circle of human indebtedness.  And that has consequences not only in         how you conduct the research, but you structure the results in such a         way that all of those who are in need have access to the benefits of         that research.                         Otherwise one creates I think a lack of         respect for what one has used.  And that doesn't mean you don't         pay researchers and so forth, but you think through the problem of the         health care system.                         I think Dan this morning talked about and         you yourself talked about expanding the issues.  We're concerned to         talk about are we going to produce a lot of products that would be         available only to the few and not to all of those in need.                         And it may be the status of the embryo,         this intermediate status, is not simply individualistic reflection but         forces us to think about the communal significance of what we have done         and the necessity of honoring it in such a way to make sure that it         reaches not just the few privileged but the many.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Gil, do you want —                           PROF. MEILAENDER:   Yes, just really         quickly.  Bill, this is a question for you.  We're letting Paul off         the hook.  I know you have made this argument before.  And I am sort of         afraid I may be asking the kind of question where I am just asking you         to repeat yourself, but I really don't understand that argument;         that is to say, the ""circle of indebtedness"" language.                         So that if we use some embryos and         distribute the knowledge gained unequally, we have somehow not honored         those embryos that we used; whereas, if we distribute the knowledge         equally, we have honored them.                         Now, I just don't understand.  I am         prepared to grant that it would be better to distribute the knowledge         equally than unequally.  I just don't see what in the world this         has got to do with whether we have honored the embryo as a human         source.  Can you help me?                          DR. MAY:   I'm not sure that I can do         it in a form that doesn't realize your fears.  It just seems to me         that in making use of this to produce this benefit, one has to insist         that it reach the many.  And that is not simply some principle out         there separate from, indeed, what has been done.                          PROF. MEILAENDER:   May I try once         more?                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Briefly, yes.                          PROF. MEILAENDER:   So we honor the         slave better if we distribute the cotton garments equally than if we         distribute them unequally.                        DR. MAY:   Well, you have assumed that I have equated the                pre-implanted embryo with an extant human being.                    PROF. MEILAENDER:   Well, it was a         human source.  That's all.                        DR. MAY:   That sets me up for an equation that I am not                prepared to assert.  I already began with the notion of the intermediate                status.  And the slave does not have an intermediate status.                    CHAIRMAN KASS:   Mr. Lauritzen, do you         want to respond to the original comment?                          DR. LAURITZEN:   I was hoping Michael         would do that for me, but let me say just a couple of things.  In the         past, I have tried to weigh out a position that tries to avoid         understanding the early embryo as a person with a full set of rights         and to use language that is common and controversial about respecting         this as a source or whatever precise language we use and that one way         to do that would be, in fact, to do the research on adult stem cell         first, see what we can learn there as a last resort and perhaps         invoking fairly explicitly just war theory to do this deterrence of         using embryonic research if we hit dead ends.                       There are some issues about scientifically whether that is a viable                strategy, I understand.  But over time, I have come to be a little                concerned that —  and this is I think reflected to some degree in                the report.  I have become somewhat suspicious of the language of                respecting the early embryo.  And this I think partly goes to Gil's                point, while, nevertheless, destroying itregularly, et cetera.                 Perhaps the better way to proceed here would be to talk about                a slightly different frame for thinking about this, the way in which                we have increasingly kind of instrumentalized everything about our                world.  I mentioned before the instrumentalization of non-human                animals so that they're simply now artifacts that we create                with different traits without any concern for their value as independent                organisms.                   And I think we see the same dynamic with          in vitro  fertilization, frankly, with regard to embryos.          Whatever we happen to think about their status, I think there is little         question that  in vitro  fertilization has led to the kind of         instrumentalization of embryos that ought to give us real pause so that         we get some new idea about how to create an embryo.  Somebody dreams up         ICSI.  Oh, I know.  We can do that this week.  And we don't         hesitate.                         So I think the danger here is a danger         that is difficult to appreciate when you throw it into a certain         context where the frame of the debate is largely about protecting         individual rights and individual autonomy.                         So a John Robertson is going to say,         ""Who is harmed?""  Well, unless you give some account of the         early embryo as capable of experiencing harm, there doesn't seem to         be a good answer, at least in terms of the objects or subjects         direction.                         But it may be that we are harmed when we         so approach the world around us as something that we ought to be         utterly controlling in every aspect so that everything turns into a         human artifact, including humans.                         So that's a very different tact on         the issue that to some degree could remain agnostic about embryo         status, I think.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Let's see.  Rebecca?                          PROF. DRESSER:   I liked the way that         you are trying to bring in other issues because I do think this is a         complicated area.  And I think, especially when we are talking about a         topic that has public policy implications in a pluralistic country like         ours, we should think more broadly.                         So I wanted to mention a couple of other         points that maybe you might want to think about that I have talked         about and that bother me about the stem cell debate.                       One is the area of what I would call truth-telling and the way                that both adult and embryonic stem and all other kinds of stem cell                research is being discussed in terms of the exaggeration I think                of promise.  I don't know about exaggeration of promise but                exaggeration of speed with which this is likely to develop into                therapies, the likely success of any therapies, degree and percentage                of people it is likely to help, all of those kinds of things.                 I think in bioethics, we started with informed consent and we                went along with a focus on truth-telling to patients about a serious                prognosis and terminal prognosis.  And now in the United States,                at least, there is a strong belief that physicians should be honest                with patients about a prognosis that may not be very optimistic.                 So I think that we need to talk about research of all sorts in those                terms.  And I really see a violation of that in this area.  So that                is something that I think might be worth mentioning.                   The other is, is it worthwhile to think         about an ethical value of deliberation, accommodation, and compromise         when we are talking about issues like this that, as I said, have public         policy implications.                         And knowing that we live in this nation         where people have very strong beliefs on different sides, how should we         think about the problem and the activity of coming together to try to         work out policies, of course, in different areas?  But should we give         ethical weight to the idea that perhaps I will give a little on my         favorite outcome in order to reach an accommodation that might be         acceptable to more people?                         And, again, that's something I have         personally felt in working with this issue and something that might be         worth separating out and talking about on its own terms.                         Thanks.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you.                         Shall we collect a few or do you want to         respond?                          DR. LAURITZEN:   That's fine.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Let me collect a couple         of others and see.  I have Bill Hurlbut and then Mary Ann.                          DR. HURLBUT:   I want to return to the         idea of commodification.  I think it's very helpful to what you         said earlier about reflecting back on the embryo in light of these         other categories of consideration.                         When I think about the issue of         commodification, I am naturally drawn to thinking about, well, what is         it that you are commodifying or selling, commercializing even.                         And when I think about the body parts or         associated body realities that could be commercialized, I think of         people selling their hair for people to make wigs.  That doesn't         bother me very much at all, maybe none.                         Blood, that's a little more something         there, but that seems okay to me.  Sperm or ova, that troubles me a         little.  There's more going on there, and maybe troubles me a lot.          Selling a kidney definitely bothers me.                         And then selling your whole life really         bothers me if you know what I mean; in other words, ""I'll give         up my life.  I'll sell you my life.""  Okay?  Somebody might         sell their life so that their children got money, for example, to         survive.  That bothers me a lot.                         So there is a spectrum going on there.          On the one hand, something seems simple, trivial, and okay.  On the         other, it requires highly significant justification to even give up         your life or to give up a significant part of it.                         What is it that bothers me at the far end         of that spectrum?  What is the key here?  I think it has to do with         something that you would call integrated organismal integrity,         identity, or continuity that we can give up something that doesn't         challenge those three, but if we give up something that does, we have         to have a really good moral reason for doing it.  So commodification of         an expendable part is completely different than commodification of a         whole human life.                         And then when I reflect on it, what         bothers me about sperm, for example, is not just that it's giving         up a part of the being.  In this case when you give it up, it         doesn't hurt the static reality of the organism.  It's that         you're giving up a part of what you might say is the dynamic of an         integrated identity and continuity.  You're giving up a relational         dimension of being.                         There is no significant disruption of a         relationship to sell hair, but selling a sperm or a womb, use of a         womb, is not just part of the static being but parts of dynamic         relational being.                         So it seems to me that the key here is         that the moral meaning is in identity with the integrated organismal         integrity and the integrated of dynamic process or continuity or         overall purposefulness.                         This brings me back to the point that         Michael Sandel and I think it was William May and Leon were in a few         minutes ago.  What is the difference between selling and giving?  Well,         it seems to me that giving can sometimes be justified, even at the loss         of something, integrity, identity, and continuity, because it is an         adult form of voluntariness.                         You are doing something that is a very         high order act of hopefully consciousness, which preserves the fullness         of being of the individual as a moral entity.  This, in turn, brings me         back downstream to your comments that these larger issues of         commodification and so forth can inform our understanding, not just of         the absolute total landscape but can actually focus back down on the         status of the embryo.                         For me, as I read your paper, I thought         yes, yes as I went all along.  And I got to the end.  And I thought,         every one of these categories makes me more concerned about the moral         status of the embryo.                       Obviously commodification of the embryo violates the things I                have been talking about; whereas, selling or giving a body part,                let's say giving, is a high order of self-donation.  Relegating                an embryo to research is exactly at the opposite end.  It really                is commodification.  It doesn't have the voluntariness of giving                in it at all.  It's a violation of something that is fundamentally                human in the process.                   So what seems to me is going on here, at         least from my perspective as I looked at all of this, is all of your         categories, commodification or, worse, at the level of the embryo,         justice, giving something its due, is worse at the level of the embryo         because it's not taking something from anything that has a choice.          The idea of natural embodiment, the embryo, everything we are is         deeply, inextricably in continuity with that embryo.                         The erosion of species boundaries raises         a specialized dilemma here, violation of integrity, which is at the         concern of that ethical consideration.  And, finally, the implications         for personal identity and a deeply rooted thing that it is.                         So I don't know if this at all makes         the point, but what I would like to say is that I think these issues         are of one piece and that organismal integrity and identity and         continuity seem to focus all of your higher concerns right back down         again, I mean, both directions, of course, but there is a whole package         here that is inextricably related.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Do you want to take both         of these together?  I mean Rebecca Dresser's earlier comment.          Please respond if you wish.                        DR. LAURITZEN:   Well, let me just respond to the last part.                                 CHAIRMAN KASS:   Okay.                        DR. LAURITZEN:   Then I can go back to Rebecca's.  It                just suggested some friendly directions in which it might be pursued.                 I actually think that is a very interesting observation.  And I                want to think fairly carefully about that because I think that you                may be right about this.                   It may provide some language for actually         teasing out some of the concerns I want to articulate about adult stem         cell research and then rethink their implications for embryonic stem         cell research.                         I forget the exact language you used.          What did you say, the organismal integrity?  I wonder if that isn't         threatened in some significant ways, not by selling parts of our bodies         but purchasing new possibilities for our bodies in a way that might         fundamentally change who we are.                         I have thought about this a little bit.          I got married when I was 24 and have been faithfully married to my wife         now for quite a few years.  And at 24, I promised to be faithful until         death do us part, but that was a commitment of about 50 years.  And if         we doubled the life span, I am making that commitment for 100 years or         something.  What would that commitment look like and whether it would         fundamentally change how we thought about an institution like marriage         and things of that sort?                         I think it would have implications for         personal identity and responsibility over a very extended period of         time.  So there would be questions about purchasing as well as selling.                         My initial reaction, going back to the         embryo, is mixed.  On the one hand, I want to think more carefully         about this notion of eroding the sense of a kind of natural trajectory         because if there isn't that kind of natural trajectory, then I         don't think what is threatened with the embryo early on is that         unity that you describe because it has got multiple possible         trajectories depending on the environment, the interaction, et cetera.          But I want to think about that more because I think it is a very         interesting observation.                        DR. HURLBUT:   One little brief follow-up on that.  I think that,                actually, what you said has a power to it, but I see it at the other                end of life.  I think the embryo is not as contingent as the full                human being who has a sense of real opened determinacy and contingency.                                I mean, sure, environment is going to         affect things a lot for sure, the final trajectory.  I think it is more         determined early and less determined later.  And so if the criterion of         expendability is in determinacy, it wouldn't be the embryo.  It         would be the up and breathing, bubbling human beings.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Mary Ann?  We will break         in about three minutes.                          PROF.GLENDON:   I'm going to         follow Dan Foster's illustrious example except just to say that Dr.         Lauritzen I think has responded in his last remarks to the concern I         was going to raise that what I think we're getting at when we use         terms like ""instrumentalization,"" ""commodification""         is really a deep concern about what kind of people we are becoming when         we make certain decisions.  And so I think this has been a really         fruitful discussion.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Yes.  I would like to         take at least one minute to add one thing to underline something that I         thought was fairly good in the paper.  It ties in with things that we         didn't talk very much about in Dan Callahan's presentation.  I         found the two papers very nicely complementary.                         That really has to do with the questions         of the goal of stem cell research, combining both the embryonic and the         adult and thinking through the purposes for which these are used,         purposes which I think all of us at first glance will simply endorse         what we endorse for generative medicine.                         But the question about the limits of that         and whether or not that really isn't also using things at the         beginning of life to transform not just the trajectory but also the         question of whether there really ought to be an end or a completion I         think is a very important issue here.                       I've got sort of half-baked notes for an essay called ""The                Old Man and the Embryo,"" in which it's at least paradoxical                that one comes to look upon these cells, which are in some ways                part of the seed of the next generation, to come to see them as                the salvation for those of us who are getting close to the end.                                And if you want to present yourself with         a kind of parable in stock terms, imagine Abraham, the biblical         Abraham, and Sarah in a desolate world except for an IVF clinic.  And         they manage themselves.  I guess I've got to make two embryos.          They manage a couple of embryos.  And the question is whether the         embryo ought to be Isaac or ought to be the cure for Abraham's         Parkinson's disease.  Then you take that and universalize the         matter, and I think you see something of the difficulty here.                         This is not an objection to stem cell         research.  I want to underscore that.  But there is something going on         here about the way in which we think about the things at the beginning         of life in relation to things at the end of life.  And they're         becoming somewhat unmoored.                         I think your paper I think highlights the         importance of thinking about those things and the powers, what         we're going to use these powers for, as well as the questions of         the ethics and the means upon which we for the most part so exercised         ourselves.  So I'm in your debt for that and for much else as well.                        CHAIRMAN KASS:   Council members, show up at five of. Thank                you very much.                  (Whereupon, at 12:25 p.m., the foregoing matter was recessed                for lunch, to reconvene at 2:00 p.m. the same day.)                               SESSION 3: STEM CELL RESEARCH: RECENT                SCIENTIFIC AND CLINICAL DEVELOPMENTS                                 CHAIRMAN KASS:   Could we come to order,         please?  The third session of this meeting is on ""Stem Cell         Research: Recent Scientific and Clinical Developments.""  The most         challenging aspect of trying to fulfill our charge of monitoring stem         cell research is the monitoring of the scientific research itself.          There is so much of it, it's very diverse with many sources and         types of stem cells, and many types of research.  Things are changing         amazingly rapidly, and we are trying to monitor a moving target.  The         material is highly technical and hard, even for scientists outside of         the field, let alone a layman, to evaluate carefully.                          ""The Isolation of Human Embryonic         Stem Cells,"" and, ""Human Embryonic Germinal Cells,"" by         James Thomson and John Gearhart respectively was reported only five         years ago.  The obvious promise of these cells both for gaining         knowledge of development, both normal and abnormal, and eventually for         regenerative therapies with hundreds of thousands of patients with         degenerative diseases or injuries has produced great excitement, much         fine work, and to be frank, more than a little hype.                         At the same time, reports of previously         unknown and unexpected multipotent or stem cells in various tissues of         children and adults has produced enormous interest also in so-called         adult stem cells, with similar promise, and to be frank, also more than         a little hype.                         By almost all accounts we stand today in         the infancy, not to say embryonic, stage of these researches, and it is         surely too early to answer the questions that the layman wants         answered.  How soon, for which of our diseases, from what sort of         cells, at what cost, and at what risk will the cure be available?                        Yet it is not too early to learn where we are in fact in this                rapidly growing field, to try to separate fact from fiction, true                promise from hype.  And to do this we have gone to the experts,                commissioning review essays, essays that would review for us the                published literature over the past two years since the August 2001                decision, covering work in five areas according to the origin of                the cells.  ""Human Embryonic Stem Cells,"" a paper by Tenneille                Ludwig and James Thomson, ""Human Embryonic Germinal Cells,""                a paper from John Gearhart, a paper on cloned embryonic stem cells,                a paper by Rudolph Jaenisch, a review of the adult stem cell research,                a paper from David Prentice, and an update on the work with her                own multipotent adult progenitor cells from Catherine Verfaillie.                 The papers have been sent out with the briefing books, and I assume                that they've been read.  We are thinking about another paper                on mesenchymal stem cells.                  We're very fortunate and grateful to have with us this afternoon                three of the authors, Dr. John Gearhart, Dr. Rudolph Jaenisch, and                Dr. David Prentice, who will, in brief presentations, highlight                their own papers, after which we will have questions and discussion.                                 I would remind Council members that the         purpose of this session is wholly scientific.  We want to learn as much         as we can about the current and projected state of this research.  This         isn't the time for ongoing ethical arguments about the moral status         of the embryo, the research imperative, or equal access for the current         funding policy, important though these issues are.  And I will simply         say I'll use the authority of the Chair to see to it that we try to         stay on the topic.                         Dr. Gearhart has kindly agreed, by the         way, to field questions pertinent to the review essay submitted by Drs.         Ludwig and Thomson.  Gentlemen, welcome to you all.  Thank you for your         papers, your presence, and in advance for your presentation and         participation.  And we will proceed in alphabetical order with John         Gearhart first.                          DR. GEARHART:   Well, I can't say         I'm delighted to be back, but I'm happy to be back.  And to not         really dwell on the research that's going on specifically in our         laboratory, but to give you a bit of a general overview of where the         work is in this field, and I think there will be ample opportunity from         some of the things that I say that you can ask questions about it.                         I think the first question, and judging         from some of the morning topics, that I would like to address is the         one before you now, which is, why study these cells?  And what we have         heard most frequently are the issues, well, this is going to be the         most versatile source of cells for promised cell-based interventions         for various therapies.                        But I came at this at a different angle.  I am an embryologist                by training.  I've been a student of human embryology for 28                years.  And I'm extremely interested in knowing how we are put                together.  What are the events, what are the mechanisms that lead                to the formation of the human being?                And over time, as you can imagine, we've studied fruit flies, we've                studied mice, we've studied rhesus monkeys.  And I think one                of the major, and perhaps the most important bit of information                that we're going to get out of embryonic stem cells are going                to be the issue of how we are formed.  And this is going to involve                cell biology, genetics, on and on and on.  But this is what is going                to enable us.  And I think with this information, which at the moment                is under the heading of Fundamental Science, or Fundamental Discovery                in Basic Science, this, I think, is going to be the lasting contribution                of studies from embryonic stem cells.                   They're going to have applications,         obviously, with that information, and the sources of cells.  And         we're going to apply those to birth defects.  We're going to         apply it to injuries and disease, because many of the processes are         similar.  And we're going to be able to draw on that information in         trying to correct diseases and injuries.                         True, I think out of this we're going         to get sources of cells which, in the short term, are going to be used         directly for the cell-based interventions.  And I think through the use         of these cells, we're going to discover other important things         about these cells, and some in our research we've learned, which we         can apply in therapies.                         But I want to emphasize one point, and         this is my belief, that this period of time that we're going         through in studying embryonic stem cells is going to be transient.  And         I want to emphasize that I believe it's the information we're         going to get out of these cells that are going to be used in the longer         term to restore function, to regenerate tissues within the bodies of         patients, without the use of these cells.  And that to me, as I look         downstream, is going to be the most important outcome of this research.                         Now I realize that this quote is taken         out of context for these essays that were written, and what was being         questioned here.  But I want to make some comments which are important         when we consider the use of human embryonic stem cells directly.  And         that is, we are finding enormous differences between mouse embryonic         stem cells and human embryonic stem cells, not only in practical issues         within the laboratory from the standpoint of cell cycle times, et         cetera, but also, as we begin to differentiate these cells in a dish,         we find some very subtle and some very not so subtle differences         between the mouse cells and the human cells to get us to the         differentiated functional tissue that we need.                         So I do believe it's time that we         work directly on the human embryonic stem cells if we want to gain this         information on embryogenesis, and if we want to move forward with         developing cell-based interventions.                         So, the sources that we're going to         talk about in general deal with this very early stage here derived from         the IVF-donated embryos, and from tissues collected within the early         stage of fetal development, the germ cells.  These cells have many         things in common, and we've published on this.  You've seen         this, probably.  And so we look at them as a group.                          There's a third member of this group,         which is embryonal carcinoma cell, depicted here on the right, which         has very similar properties to these two other cell types.  In fact,         it's the only cell type from which any cell has been derived         that's being used in a pre-clinical trial.  And this is on stroke         patients at the University of Pittsburgh.                       I want to spend time now, or my brief time, on three slides to                give you an indication of where the human work is on this class                of cells.  What are the questions that are being asked, where are                we on some of this stuff, et cetera?                So here now are issues around human embryonic stem cells, or embryonic                germ cells.  One of the first questions that's being asked about                the stem cell itself is what is meant by ""stemness""?                 And obviously this, at the molecular level, gets us into genomics,                proteomics.  And so there is a major effort around the world at                trying to determine the genetic basis of a stem cell.  And the human                cells are being used extensively for this purpose.  How many genes                are involved, what genes are involved, what signaling pathways,                on and on and on.  So stemness is an important issue within this                research.                   Now, it's a comparative thing.  We         can do it also with mouse cells.  We can do it with adult cells as         well, trying to find commonality.  What is it that makes a cell a stem         cell?  That information will be vital, I believe, in the future, in         converting virtually any cell to a stem cell, if we want to go that         route.                         The second major issue currently are         characterizations of existing lines.  As you may know, there's no         standardization within the field as to what constitutes a human         embryonic stem cell.  We talk about developmental potential.  We talk         about molecular markers, biochemical/antigenic markers, this is now         being taken up by an international committee under the auspices of the         MRC in London to try to get an agreement on these issues from stem         cells around the world, human embryonic stem cells around the world.                         There's also the issue now of whether         or not we should be deriving new stem cell lines.  And in many         countries, this is indeed happening.  There are a number of new cell         lines coming online.  And what is the importance of this?  Now, many of         you have heard at least from what the Europeans refer to as the         presidential cell lines, those that are eligible for funding in this         country.  Should we have cells that are only grown on human feeder         layers?  Most of the cell lines that have been derived are on mouse         feeder layers, and there is a concern about infectious agents passing         into the human cells.                          I think there's a misconception out         there that these lines will be ineligible for any kind of therapeutic         use.  I think the FDA has made it very clear that they're certainly         willing to consider those grown on mouse feeder layers if they meet         certain criteria to also be eligible for use in the clinic.                          But there are a number of lines now that         have been derived on human feeder layers, and there are lines being         derived that are feeder layer independent, which means it makes it much         easier to work with in the laboratory.  You don't have to worry         about these other cells that are present in your cultures.                          And there's an attempt now being made         to derive these lines in defined media, which means there are no other         animal products, no serum, that you can control very carefully the         differentiation of these cells by adding specific growth factors in a         sequential fashion.                         The most important element to this,         though, is this top line here.  Many of you may not realize it, but         when we say that routinely three or four different mouse embryonic stem         cell lines have been used for the last 20-some years, what's the         problem here, why can't we use just a few of the human.  Those         lines have been selected from a hundred and some cell lines that were         made as to being the best cell lines to use for those purposes.  And so         I think we're still in this phase of trying to determine what are         really the good cell lines, human embryonic stem cell lines that are         available.  And thus the issue of generating more.                       For the use of these lines, emphasis in the lab now is in the                following area.  We're trying to work up high-efficiency differentiation                protocols that result in homogenous cell populations of functional                cell types.  That is, can we in the laboratory come up with protocols,                growth conditions, that are going to get us 10 million dopaminergic                neurons, and only dopaminergic neurons?  Most of the protocols we                have now result in a mixture of cell types within a dish, and we                go in and select out the ones we want.                   So there's concern about the         heterogeneity of the cells, and the fact that we can't at this         point have a high efficiency in getting the cell types we need.  We         manipulate the growth environments, and we manipulate the cells         genetically to accomplish this goal.                         Once we differentiate these cells, and         we've had some success in certain pathways which we can talk about,         we are very concerned about what we refer to as the authenticity of the         derived cells.  That is, is the dopaminergic neuron you've formed,         the insulin-producing cell you've formed, the cholinergic neuron,         the cardiac muscle, are these actually functional cells that are the         equivalent of those that you normally find in the adult?                          So a great deal of effort, both in the         dish,  in vitro , is being made in different parameters to measure         whether or not these are authentic cells.  There are many protocols, as         you can imagine, that lead to cells that look like something, but         they're not functional.  And this is a major concern.  The other         side of this is, the golden test is can you transplant these cells into         an animal model of some kind and see that they assume the function that         you're hoping that they would.                          But again, these are human cells going         into rodents, primarily.  Do we have every reason to believe that         they're going to function appropriately?  We don't know that         yet.  We're also putting cells into non-human primates to get that         kind of a measure as well.                         We are in the laboratory contrasting and         comparing among various sources of stem cells.  In our laboratory, we         work on human ES, human EG, umbilical cord blood, et cetera.  And the         importance of this is that you are able to compare and contrast in the         same paradigms the sources of these cells to see which ones are going         to be appropriate for which tasks.  And I think this is extremely         important.                         We're also very concerned, as you         know, if these cells are going to be continuously grown in the         laboratory, there's a finite possibility that you're going to         get genetic mutations.  We're interested in the frequencies of         this, and the types of the mutations that occur in these cells.          It's a safety issue.  But with our genomic and proteomic studies,         we can get a good handle on this at this point in time.                         When we get into the grafting issues,         which is obviously a desirable endpoint, both in the basic science         side, to say you have a functional cell, and then transitioning into         any use of these cells in cell-based therapy, we have a number of         issues here.                         The first, and I think you have to         realize this.  There is virtually no appropriate animal model for any         human condition.  That's the fact.  We approximate it.  We do the         best we can.  But under those limitations, we do the best we can.  And         you have to be aware of this.  There's a concern about what animal         models you're using for what test.                         The issue of what stage of cell         differentiation in any of these cells do you use for a specific graft?          We are finding that many things within the central nervous system, you         want to use something that is fairly undifferentiated so that the cells         can interestingly migrate to where they're supposed to go, set up         the appropriate connectivity.  And so if you are working with a motor         neuron, you'd like to use a motor neuron precursor.  If you put in         a fully differentiated motor neuron, nothing works.  I mean, when you         think about the nervous system, it's not surprising.                         With insulin-producing cells, we find         that you want the terminal cell, at least in the experiments that we         are doing.  But for each of the cell types you're working with,         we've got to determine this, as well as how do you want to deliver         it to those animal models.                         The last two are extremely important.          What are the fates of these cells that you've grown in a dish,         selected for in a dish, once you graft it into an animal paradigm?  We         know these cells like to migrate.  Do they differentiate         appropriately?  Do they form tumors?  I remember a few years ago when I         was all puffed up that our cells were working so wonderfully, and I         went to the FDA for this meeting I thought was going to be one-on-one         with members of that group.  And it turned out that there were 40 of         them and one of me.  All their questions were about safety issues.  We         now spend as much time on these safety issues as we do at looking at         differentiations of these cells in a dish.                          Why?  Well, what have we found?  Indeed,         in the early mouse work with embryonic stem cells the rates of tumors         were extremely high.  Formation of teratocarcinomas, mixed germ cell         tumors.  We have at this point, though, grafted well over 3,000 animals         with our human cells, and we haven't seen a tumor yet.  And maybe         we're just lucky, maybe there's a difference between mouse and         human cells.  We don't know that.                          But these experiments are extremely         expensive because you've got to serial section through the whole         central nervous system if you're putting cells in there.          You're putting them in IP, et cetera.  It's a lot of work.  The         FDA, ideally, would like to know if you're putting 300,000 cells         into an animal, they want to know where all 300,000 cells went.  This         has gotten us into extremely expensive experiments in labeling cells,         developing labels for cells that you could follow for a year or more         later.  You could go back and find those cells.  So we've employed         radiologists, and chemists, et cetera, to help us with these kinds of         things.  So it is a major issue.  And in all of our experiments, we         look at this.                         The last issue, on immune response graft         rejection, is obviously to some extent the Achilles' heel of this         work.  If we can't provide tissue that's going to be accepted         in a graft, then all this work has gone for naught.  So there are         issues of active experiments now going on in tolerance, in genetic         alterations of cells, the consideration of cell banks, how many         different stem cell lines would you need to cover certain populations         of people, and something you'll hear about probably from Rudy on         nuclear and cell reprogramming, so-called therapeutic cloning.  Is this         one of the avenues that we can approach?  So all of these are very         active research elements going on with respect to the human embryonic         germ cells and stem cells.  We can't divorce them.                         Now, in this cartoon, what I've         depicted here is one of the more difficult scientific aspects of the         research.  And that is that you have in a dish — now this is a bit of a         repeat, but it's important to mention — you have in a dish these         cells that are capable of forming any cell type that's present in         the body.  The major problem here is how do you get them only to form         hepatocytes, dopaminergic neurons, heart muscle, blood cells,         pancreatic islet cells, solely.  How do you do that?  This is where the         real issues are within the laboratory.                          And we try to recapitulate, as I showed         you this before — oh, and finally, the issue of — I put this little         thing down here to remind me.  Some of you have seen this report         earlier this year from Hans Schuler's lab at Penn, that he's         been able to find oocytes within embryonic stem cells derived from the         mouse.  Now, he did not — now keep this in mind, he did not         purposefully differentiate these cells into oocytes.  He came up with a         neat little trick of identifying them once they were present in the         plate.  Okay, so it's not that he's worked up a condition to         differentiate them only to oocytes, it's that they're there.          You can use that technology to pull the cells out, and then further try         to mature them, see if they are actually functional oocytes, et cetera.                         So we rely in the lab on trying to         recapitulate what has occurred to some extent in the embryo by         providing growth factors that these cells normally see to get them to         enhance, or try to direct their differentiation into the product that         we want.                         We use selection techniques in the         laboratory after getting these mixtures of cell types by different         avenues in the dish.  We then come back using genetically selected         markers, different growth media, cell sorting, which is a fancy way of         sending cells through a beam of light, and if they have a certain         antigen on the surface, you tag it in a way that will put them into         different pots.  And this works fairly effectively for a number of cell         types.  But it's highly inefficient, and we've got to improve         this technology.                         So what have we done?  What have we been         able to do?  We've been able to identify many, many different cell         types in a dish.  We've been able to expand many different cell         types, whether they're insulin-producing cells, dopaminergic         neurons, heart muscle cells, smooth muscle cells, hepatocytes,         we're able to do that.  Human.  And we've been able, in many         cases, to show that they are functional within the parameters that we         like.  And in a few cases we've studied extensively we've been         able to graft them into animal models to show that they will work, and         can ameliorate a condition in the animal, whether it's, to some         degree, whether it's a diabetic animal, or one with motor neuron         loss, mouse models of Parkinson's disease, we can do that at this         point.                         To reiterate, we are concerned about         safety issues.  They go hand in hand with all that we do in the         laboratory.  It adds, again, expense and time, but we want to make sure         we get it right.                         Here's another issue of safety.  We         find that in many of these cell lines, if you're not careful — now         human embryonic stem cells are much more difficult to grow in the         laboratory than mouse, and if you're not careful, this can         overwhelm your cultures very quickly.  This is an example of a         tetrasomy 12p, and also of a trisomy 17, which appear to be fairly         common coming out of the human cell lines for whatever reason.  We         don't know.   But you have to constantly monitor these cell lines         to make sure that they are remaining normal as far as the karyotype is         concerned.  Not an unusual circumstance.                         Rudy, I'm sure, will deal with this.          But we got highly involved with the issue of somatic cell nuclear         transfer, mainly coming in from the desire to have matched tissue for a         patient.  But I want to point out two other issues here that I think,         in my way of thinking, are perhaps more important.  Rudy will probably         disagree.                         Number two on this list, to increase the         diversity of stem cell lines.  Number three, to facilitate the study of         inherited genetic diseases and somatic mutations.  Now, there's         been a lot of talk about, with the justice issues, of diversity of cell         lines.  We now know how many cell lines we need to cover the population         of the United States.  How are we going to get these lines?  We're         not going to get them, if we wanted them, by going out and matching up         people to get embryos, okay, or even assaying embryos in banks.  The         easiest way to do it is you identify a person that has the haplotypes         of class I and class II genes, and take a nucleus out of their cell.          And generate stem cells through somatic cell nuclear transfer.  No         question about it, easiest fast way of doing it.                         The issue of the studying of inherited         genetic mutations and somatic mutations.  It means that we can take         cells from a patient with a disease, some of them not expressing very         much from the standpoint of the pathogenesis of the disease, to others         that are full-blown, to try to figure out why some patients have one         form of the disease, another has the mild form of the disease.  We can         take this directly, and generate stem cells for those studies.  Somatic         mutations, breast cancer mutations.  We can generate cell lines —         it's the only way we can do it — through somatic cell nuclear         transfer.                         And then the issue of being able to         determine mechanisms of nuclear reprogramming.  We would hope that they         would approach normalcy from the standpoint that we may be able to use         that information to convert somatic cells into stem cells at some point         downstream.  This is why I think somatic cell nuclear transfer into a         human are reasons that are quite important.                         Well, I think with the issue of the human         embryonic stem cells, I think they have uniqueness in certain areas,         and I think that what we're going to learn out of these studies is         going to be extremely important in the future, not only for deriving         cell-based therapies, but in getting information that we're going         to be able to begin to instruct our own genes.                       And this is something which hasn't been paid a lot of attention,                but I think even within this Council, it may be a good idea, that                we're on the verge, I believe, of being able to instruct our                own cells.  And I think the ramifications of this are enormous.                 I mean, talk about enhancement.  One could go on the Internet and                get a kit for enhancing any part of your body to a certain degree.                 And this is all going to be done, I think, from information that                we get out of learning about cell differentiation, how these cells                function.  So I think we've got to keep our eye on this for                the future as well.                   Just in closing, the greatest impetus         that I can think of for making advancement in this field is funding         through the National Institutes of Health.  This is the only         information that I could get my hands on.  It's available.          It's for the fiscal year 2002.  You see how much money is being         spent on stem cell research in toto, how much on human adult stem cell         research, how much on animal adult.  And up to this point, $11         million.  On the human embryonic stem cell research, I think this year         it's going to be more, and we would hope in the future, as the         bottleneck for cell lines and more applications come in to the NIH,         that these numbers will become robust.                          And I think this will be the key to the         dreams that we have, anyway, of learning more about how humans are         built, and cell differentiation of human cells on their way to         therapy.  So I hope I've given you enough to think about.  Thanks.                        CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you very much.  Why don't we simply                proceed in order.  Dr. Jaenisch.                  DR. JAENISCH:   Well, thank you very much for inviting me                here.  And I will right away get to the cont roversy. I'm not                going to agree with much you said.                 So I want to try to develop two arguments.  One is reproductive                cloning faces principle biological problems that may not be solvable                for the foreseeable future.  And the other one is therapeutic cloning                poses no principle biological obstacles, only technical problems.                 And this, I think, in my opinion has implications for the status                of the fertilized and the cloned embryo.                   So you need one piece of data.  When we         do nuclear transfer, then it's clear that the donor cell, the donor         matters.  So if we use a somatic donor nucleus, cumulus cells,         fibroblasts, Sertoli cells, the result to get cloned adults is really         low, a few percent.  If you use B or T cells, or neurons, it is very         low.  Only with tricks we were able to get animals.  However, when one         uses embryonic stem cells as donors, it's an order of magnitude         more efficient.  So the conclusion is an embryonic cell is easier to         reprogram to support life than a somatic one.  I will come back to this         later when I make an argument.                         So, let me first come to cloned animals.          If you have an animal born, if you looked at this carefully, you find         that approximately four to five percent of all genes, as done in         percentile, are not correctly expressed.  Still, the animal develops to         birth.  If you look at imprinted genes, it's even worse.  Thirty to         fifty percent are not correctly expressed, regardless what the donor         cell nucleus is.  So from this we would argue that it's amazing         that these defective embryos can develop to birth and beyond.  But you         pay for that.  You pay with abnormalities.                          So my argument would be, and I will         develop this more, that there may be no normal clones.  Of course, we         have the problem to define what we mean with ""normal"".   But         let me then say that faulty reprogramming seems to me is a biological         barrier that may preclude the generation of normal cloned individuals,         at least for the foreseeable future.                         Let me come to therapeutic cloning.  So,         as we heard, cloning would involve taking from a patient a somatic         nucleus and derive an isogenic embryonic stem cell by nuclear         transfer.  This could be used, then, to correct the genetic defect if         it was present.  One has to differentiate these cells  in vitro ,         and then transplant it back into the individual and see whether it         could improve the condition.                         So we have made such an experiment.  I         just want to briefly outline the steps we went through.  As a patient         we used a mouse, which was totally immune-incompetent.  Due to the Rag2         defect, it did not have any B and T cells.  So that was our patient.                         From this, skin cells were removed from         this animal.  They were transferred.  A blastocyst was derived.  And         from this blastocyst, an embryonic stem cell, which of course is         mutant, as the donor.  And then we used just simple homologous         recombination to repair one or two alleles to make a functional Rag2         gene, and then differentiate these cells which had problems into         hematopoietic stem cells, put them back into the animal, and the result         was that these cells could colonize the embryo and repair, in part, the         defect.                          So some have argued that this experiment         really didn't work.  It really only showed that when you have — I         think Dr. Prentice argued that it only showed that one has to use a         cloned newborn as a source.  And this, of course, is not therapeutic         cloning.  I think that is a misrepresentation of those data.                         I would argue that from this experiment         we know that somatic nuclear transfer and therapeutic cloning will work         because it has worked in the mouse.  So only technical, not principle,         barriers exist to adapt it to human use, although these technical ones         may be daunting.  Technical, in contrast to principle ones, which we         see in reproductive cloning.                         So, if I look at the two ways we can         think about cell therapy, then we have the nuclear cloning approach as         I just outlined, which in the mouse we know works, at least for         hematopoietic cells, and I believe will work for other cells.  The         alternative is somatic adult stem cells.  We'll hear later from         this.                         And I believe here there are many, many         question marks.  It is a very young field, very interesting, but we         really don't understand how to really handle these stem cells, how         to propagate those.  And there's really, with the exception of bone         marrow stem cells, not really any proof of therapeutic potential at         this point.  So I think we need much more to learn here, but this we         know will work.                         So I want to come to really two key         questions.  One is can reproductive cloning be made as safe as  in         vitro  fertilization?  And the other one: Does faulty reprogramming         after nuclear transfer, does it pose a problem for the therapeutic         application of this technology?  I think these are the key questions in         my mind.                       So, can reproductive cloning be made safe?  I believe in addition                to the technical problems, which are solvable, there are serious                biological barriers.  And the main one is this one.  The two parental                genomes in all of our cells are differentially modified depending                on where the genome came through the egg or through the sperm.                 They're epigenetically distinct in the adult.  If you want to                recreate that situation, you would have to physically separate the                two genomes and treat them independently in an oocyte- or sperm-specific                way.                 So let me point that out in this very complicated-appearing diagram,                but it's very simple.  So let me just go through briefly what's                happening during normal fertilization.  In normal fertilization,                the egg genome and the oocyte genome are combined.  And they are                differentially modified during gametogenesis.  And this is what                these lollipops here show.  So they're different in the zygote.                 But now something very curious happens.  Within hours of fertilization,                the sperm genome is stripped of all methylation.  The oocyte is                resistant to this not-well-understood demethylation activity because                the oocyte genome has been, of course, together with this activity                throughout oogenesis.                   So then cleavage proceeds.  And the point         I'm making now is that the cells of the genomes in the adult are         different, different because of their history.  It's not only for         imprinted genes, but also for non-imprinted genes.  Now what happens in         cloning?  In cloning, one removes, of course, the egg nucleus and         replaces it now with one of the somatic nuclei.                          Now, both of these genomes are now         exposed to the egg cytoplasm.  So both become really — they're in         identical chromatin state.  So they'll be both modified, and the         difference will be equalized.  So the difference you see in a normal         adult cell will be equalized, tends to be equalized in cloning.  I         think that is a problem among those which we call epigenetic problems.                         So in order to solve that, I think one         would have to separate the two genomes physically and treat one in an         egg-specific appropriate manner, and the other one in a sperm-specific         manner.  I think if we could do that, then I think we would have a way         to solve that problem.                         So the phenotypes of clones, I would         argue, is a continuum without defined stages.  So we know the most         important stages are implantation and birth, and indeed, most clones         are lost at implantation, and then at birth again many are lost.  You         end up with very few which develop to late age.  And we know from most         experiments, even animals which are one year of age, 80 percent of         those die very early with major problems.  These experiments could only         be done so far in the mouse because the mouse is the only organism we         have old cloned animals.                         So I think the problem here is, yes, you         might get — because our criteria are not very good here — you might get         quasi-normal or maybe a normal individual with a certain frequency.          It's very difficult in animals to test, really, because our tests         are limited.  But we cannot predict ever at any of these stages who         will be among those outliers, and who will not be.  There's no way         to select good healthy from non-healthy clones.  I think that's         very important to emphasize.  There's no way we can think of to do         that.  So there's no predictability whatsoever.  So from my point         of view, this doesn't matter, really, whether one or two percent of         potentially normal animals which survive for a long time.  You         can't predict who this will be.                         So, therapeutic cloning.  So, as I said,         cloned animals are abnormal due to faulty reprogramming.  Why is         normalcy of differentiated cells derived from ES cells not affected by         this problem?  There are two reasons.  One is that we don't involve         a generation of a fetus.  And the other one is that the embryonic stem         cells lose what I'm going to call epigenetic memory of the nucleus         they came from.  So let me develop these two ideas.                       So first, it's simple.  In contrast to reproductive cloning,                there's no embryogenesis required to derive functional cells                 in vitro .  So it's totally irrelevant, for example, whether                imprinted genes are reprogrammed or not.  Imprinted genes have a                function only during fetal development, not in the adult.  So it                doesn't matter.  There is one or two exceptions, and those would                have to look at.                   Very importantly is the cells themselves         select themselves  in vitro  for the cell type you are selecting         for.  There's no selection possible  in vivo  after         implantation in a cloned animal.  And then we know that cloned ES cells         form normal chimeras, as do any other ES cells.  So biologically there         is no difference.                         Let me come to the memory question on         this slide here.  So we know we can make blastocysts from a zygote from         a fertilized egg, or by nuclear transfer from these various donor         cells.  Now I would argue the blastocyst remembers exactly where it         came from.  And we know that because we implant this blastocyst,         derived from a zygote, into the uterus, it will with a high efficiency         develop to birth, and will make a normal animal.                         If you derive - take a blastocyst derived         from an ES cell, and implant it, it will develop with a high efficiency         to the newborn stage, but it will make an abnormal animal.  If it came         from a cumulus cell, it would be very low efficiency - I showed you         this on the second slide - low efficiency to the newborn stage.  It         will be abnormal.  If the nucleus comes from B-, T-cells, or neurons,         it will be very low.  And it will be, of course, abnormal, if you get         it.                         So these blastocysts know exactly where         they came from.  And we know this, actually, when we look at gene         expression patterns in clones derived from ES cells, or from human         cells, they're different.  So they remember at birth where they         came from.  That's why cloning doesn't work.  That's why         these cloned ones develop abnormally, too, in the great majority.                         So what about ES cells?  In ES cells,         it's a very different thing.  I would argue you erase the         epigenetic memory of your donor nucleus.  And the argument is the         following.  We know that if you take such a blastocyst, the ES cells         are derived from the inner cell mast cells.  These inner cell mast         cells express certain set of genes, one of those called the Oct-4 gene,         one of the key genes, but another 70.  You put this blastocyst in         culture.  All these genes, all these cells array - silence, Oct-4.          This has been published.  And they don't divide.  They sit there.                       But over the next days or week or so, some of these cells, one                or the other, begins to re-express Oct-4 and another set of 70 genes.                 And these are the cells which would proliferate.  And we call them                ES cells.  It's a total tissue culture artifact of those cells                which can survive under the harsh tissue culture conditions.  So                I would argue ES cells have no counterpart in the normal animal                model.  They are a real tissue culture artifact, although a very                useful one.                   Now the same occurs, of course, with         these blastocysts.  The efficiency is lower.  But once you go to the         selection for the survivors, they're exactly - I think in order to         survive, they have to express the set of 70 genes which we call the         embryonic genes, which are important for the early developmental         stages.  So the point of this slide is really that this selection         process, which selects just for the fastest growing cell, erases the         memory to where the ES cell came from.  And indeed, when you transplant         these cells derived from a B- or T-cell or from a neuron or from a         zygote, they have identical properties.  They form normal chimeras, and         they  in vitro  differentiate indistinguishably.                         I want to summarize this.  An ES cell         derivation selects for survivors.  And I would argue survival depends         on an ES default epigenetic state which needs these Oct-4 like genes         being on.  Selection process erases the epigenetic memory of the donor         nucleus, and the cloned and the fertilized cells form normal chimeras.          So the potential of ES cells derived from an  in vitro  fertilized         embryo and from a cloned embryo is identical by all measures we can do.                         So I would conclude, then, it's         unlikely, if not impossible, to create a normal individual by nuclear         cloning.  The problem of reprogramming may not be solvable for the         foreseeable future because of these principle barriers, but ES cells         derived from clone embryos have the same potential for tissue repair as         those from the fertilized embryo.                          So I think one of the key concerns I can         see of this committee is that the derivation of embryonic stem cells by         nuclear cloning necessitates the destruction of potential human life.          I think that's a major concern.  And if I just compare now, to my         opinion, the difference between a fertilized and a cloned embryo.  The         fertilized embryo is created by conception.  It's genetically         unique.  There's a high potential it will develop to a normal         baby.  The cloned embryo of course has no conception, no new genetic         combination.  It is really the product of a laboratory-assisted         technique.  Sloppily, we could say it's a laboratory artifact.  But         most importantly, it has little or no potential to ever develop to a         normal baby.                         So I think the embryo, the cloned embryo,         lacks essential qualities of the normal embryo, which on this sort of         maybe summarizing my thoughts is on this slide where I think there are         really three possible fates for a cloned or for fertilized embryo.  We         fertilize one of these leftover embryos, hundreds of thousands in the         clinics.  They can be disposed of, they can be implanted to form a         normal baby with a high probability, or they can generate normal ES         cells.  The cloned embryo, three fates.  It can be disposed of.  It can         make normal ES cells, as I have argued, but it cannot make with any         acceptability efficiency a baby, not even a normal one.                         So if this is accepted, instead of         disposing these leftover embryos and use them for normal ES cells,         which could be used for research, as we heard.  This, of course, to my         opinion generates an ethical problem because you destroy potential         human life.  I think this - so if this is acceptable to some, I think         it should be ethically less problematic, because in this case I think         you don't have the potential to form, within acceptable         possibility, a normal baby.                         So from the biological point of view, I         think the derivation of embryonic stem cells by nuclear cloning         develops the structure of an embryo that lacks the potential to develop         into a normal being with any acceptable efficiency or predictability.                          I was asked - and I want to close with my         final slide, which really follows what John said - what are the         potential applications of cloned embryonic stem cells derived from a         cloned embryo.  I think we talked about therapy.  Clearly, I don't         have to dwell on this.  I'm not sure whether this will be really         generally available technology.  It maybe too expensive.  I don't         know.  And I don't know how fast we could solve the technical         problems of adapting this to human medicine.                          However, I think this is the more         important point, which I think John emphasized.  I think it allows us         to derive genetically identical cells from patients with multigenic         diseases, such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, ALS, diabetes.  And         we can now use this system  in vitro  to validate the cellular         defects of these complex diseases.  So compare ES cells derived from a         healthy individual with those from such a patient.  I think there's         enormous potential here if we find a difference, to find out why that         is so, and is it a screen for potential therapeutics, just in the         culture dish.  And as John emphasized, such diseases cannot be studied         in animal models, because there are no animal models for those         diseases.  But you can really make those in the culture if you just use         a cell of the patients.                         So I think this is a very important,         maybe the most important driving issue, to my opinion, to use this         technology.  Thank you.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you very much.  Dr.         Prentice. While we're waiting, Dr. Jaenisch, would you mind just         taking one question of just factual information so that we don't         lose a lot of time.  This last point about the models for multigenetic         diseases.  If someone were to say the same kind of models might be         available through, for example, the multipotent progenitor cells that         Dr. Verfaillie has, where you could go into the patient and get out         progenitor cells.  You might not get all the tissues, but if those         cells could reliably be differentiated into islet cells, couldn't         you do the studies on the pathogenesis of - in other words,         couldn't one, if one had stable and reliable adult stem cell         populations, wouldn't you have the same access to the cells from         the multigenetic diseases?                          DR. JAENISCH:   Yes.  I think if this         would work, if this would efficiently work, I think absolutely I agree         with you.  I think the problem as I see it now is that, indeed, working         with adult stem cells is very difficult.  And the major problem is that         we lack the ability in most cases to, for example, propagate them in         the undifferentiated state.  For example, with bone marrow stem cells,         although they're known for 30 years, this has not been         accomplished.  They are very useful for therapeutic applications         because they select themselves in the patient, but not easily for this         type of research, what you want to do.                         So I think there might, at some point, if         we learn that in this young field, I agree with you.  Then I think         these cells would, if you could differentiate them to dopaminergic         neurons in a way that we can do for now from ES cells, as Ron McKay has         shown, yes I think that would be useful.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you.  Dr. Prentice,         you're all right?                          DR. PRENTICE:   Yes.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:  Good.                          DR. PRENTICE:  I think we're ready to         roll.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I apologize for the delay up here.  I         was fighting off a fever from a respiratory virus, so I probably was in         a time warp.                         One of the main goals of stem cell         research, as you're all aware, is the idea of regenerative medicine         with stem cells, the idea that you might be able to take a stem cell         from some source, for example here from bone marrow, inject that into         an area of damaged tissue in the patient and regenerate or replace the         damaged tissue.                          Now, the interesting, confusing thing         about adult stem cells has been that it defies what for years we have         thought of as the normal developmental paradigm, that as we develop         from the blastocyst stage here, that cells follow one of these main         developmental trees.  And as a cell would become more and more         developed and more and more differentiated, they would end up out here         on the tip of a branch and not be able to back away from that         particular tip; not be able to back down and take a separate branch,         whether it were a nearby branch or one of these main branches.                         A lot of evidence now suggests, however,         that adult stem cells, at least some of them, can actually move from         branch to branch.  Now exactly how they're doing that, the         mechanism involved in these types of differentiation or different         branches of tissues, is still unknown.                          There's several questions related to         adult stem cells, and in fact many of these have to do with the same         questions related to embryonic cells.  What is their actual identity?          How could you identify a particular adult stem cell?  What is their         actual tissue source?  How do they form these other cell and tissue         types?  Do they form actual functional cell and tissue types, as we         look at these organs and tissues?  And what's the specific         mechanism of differentiation?                         They do seem to have some unique         characteristics, such as a homing phenomenon, where they tend to home         in on damaged tissue.  And most of the results that have been seen in         terms of an adult stem cell differentiating into another cell type or         tissue type seem to be tied primarily with injury to a tissue or         organ.  Usually you do not see these types of changes in the         experiments taking place unless there is some sort of damage.  The         other thing would be what type of cellular interactions and signalling         within the target tissue might trigger some of these differentiative         events.                          Now, one way to try and identify a stem         cell is with various markers, and I discuss this at some length in the         paper.  Typically what people have tried to do is eliminate what are         termed ""lineage markers"" for particular blood cells.  Some         people pick a particular marker called CD34, which has been associated         with bone marrow.  But others tend to eschew that type of marker.  And         I mentioned other markers in the paper that might indicate that an         adult cell is a stem cell.  The CD133 marker, or the c-kit marker.                         Several people have begun to undertake         studies of the gene expression within adult stem cells, and compare         them to embryonic cells to see if there is a commonality in terms of         all of the various genes that might be expressed that identify a cell         as a stem cell.  One of the problems that's been faced, though, is         that these markers tend to change over time.  This has been seen in         several studies where actually a marker such as CD34, that might have         been a chosen marker to identify a stem cell, actually might not be         expressed at a later time with that cell.  And then expression of that         gene would re-occur, even within the same cell.                         So it may be difficult to actually         identify one particular stem cell based on some of these markers,         simply because of changes in gene expressions as the cells undergo         changes in environment, as they may undergo changes in their isolation         conditions, and what Theise and Krause simply have called the         uncertainty principle, equivalent to the Heisenberg uncertainty         principle.  You might at one point be able to isolate a cell with a         particular set of markers or milieu of gene expression and say this is         a stem cell, but then as you would try to put it into different         conditions, or isolate it from different tissues, those particular         markers might change, or might be different.                          So it may actually be very difficult with         adult stem cells to particularly isolate a particular cell and say,         yes, this is an adult stem cell.  It may be more a matter of the         particular context of the cell: the tissue they're derived from,         the isolation conditions used, or the tissues that they're put back         into that may determine their functionality.                         In terms of differentiation mechanisms,         cell fusion appears to be one particular mechanism by which an adult         stem cell may change into another tissue type.  Now there were some          in vitro  experiments done approximately a year and a half ago         that indicated this possibility, but the  in vitro  experiments         were unable to verify whether this was actually a particular mechanism         that might be used by an adult stem cell.  More recently, two papers         have verified in mouse systems that bone marrow stem cells, at least in         these experiments, did fuse with hepatocytes and take on that         differentiated morphology and function, even in terms of repairing         liver damage.  So this is obviously one possible mechanism with some         experimental evidence.                         Another possibility might be that a cell         would de-differentiate, actually back down one of those branches and go         up another branch.  This would involve changes in gene expression to an         earlier state, or more primitive type of cell, and then re-expressing         specific genes particular to the tissue into which the cell was         placed.  Another possibility is what's termed         ""trans-differentiation"" in which the cell apparently is not         backing down a branch, but instead simply changing its gene expression         so that it now conforms to whatever tissue or cell population that         it's within.                          In terms of sources of adult stem cells,         not just tissues, but how did they get there?  How did an adult stem         cell get into bone marrow, or brain, or liver?  One theory is that some         of these cells may be leftover primitive stem cells, perhaps embryonic         stem cells, a few that are kept around, maintained in a state so that         then they can differentiate into various types of tissues.                          Another proposal is that there may be a         universal stem cell, an adult stem cell, not a primitive cell, but one         more geared towards maintenance and repair functions in the adult         body.  It may arise in one or more tissues, and then may disperse into         other tissues.                          Other possibilities are that there are         particular tissue stem cells, multipotent, not able to perhaps form all         tissues of the adult body, but a limited subset, and that they would be         resident within a few of these tissues.                          And then I mentioned here transient stem         cells, cells that are just sort of passing through.  And there is the         possibility that, especially if we're looking at this idea of a         universal stem cell, or even a tissue stem cell that can migrate in         some cases, that it may end up passing through a tissue, so you will         isolate what appears to be a stem cell from a particular tissue.  But         it didn't arise there.  It just happened to be passing through via         the circulatory system.                         I might mention, too, that some of the         other challenges for adult stem cells are very similar to some of the         challenges for embryonic cells.  For example, standardization.  There         essentially is no standardization in terms of adult stem cell         isolation, propagation, differentiation into other tissues at this         point.  Long term culture, with a few exceptions, has not been         attained.  Catherine Verfaillie's MAPC cells from bone marrow do         appear capable of long-term proliferation in culture.  And there are a         few other examples, very limited, that I point out in the paper.  But         being able to keep these cells growing in culture for a long period of         time has been difficult up to this point.                         The idea of safety, of course, is always         an issue when we're going to be dealing with patients.  Do these         cells form tumors?  Do they differentiate abnormally so that you         don't get the correct differentiation in the place, in the time, in         the tissue that you need?  So all of these need to be faced.                         Now this idea of a potential universal or         at least tissue stem cell that can migrate primarily has been put forth         by Helen Blau of Stanford, the idea being that perhaps the cell is in         the bone marrow, but then can go into the circulation and then exit the         circulation into another tissue.  Again, most of the studies have seen         this type of phenomenon in response to an injury, not in response to         the normal physiological systems.                         How would we then define a stem cell,         especially an adult stem cell, if we have all of this problem with         changeability of markers, and lack of standardization?  Moore and         Quesenberry have proposed a couple of simple guidelines.  Now         obviously, any stem cell has the ability to continue to replicate and         maintain a population of cells.  And then in response to some signal,         to differentiate into one or more potential tissue types.                          An initial first cut at how to identify a         stem cell in the adult would be, can it take on a different morphology         in a tissue in which you place it?  Can it take on some of the         differentiated cell markers that you would see in that tissue?  Now         this is a bare minimum, and it doesn't really mean necessarily that         the cell is functional, that it can participate in tissue repair, or         perhaps even that it has truly differentiated into that specific cell         type.                         Supplementing that, if you could         demonstrate functional activity, and actual integration into a tissue,         this would be a much better marker of a cell as a stem cell.  And         certainly, if in an injury situation, in animal model or even in human,         you could demonstrate a physiological improvement.  That would be a         good indication that you were seeing this sort of stem cell         differentiation and repair.                         Now, the next set of slides, what         I've tried to do is just condense from that rather difficult mass         to read of all of these various tissue sources, and cell types that         they can turn into, and so on.  I won't spend a great deal of time         on these.  I'll just try and point out some particular points on         each slide.                          With mesenchymal or stromal stem cells         from the bone marrow, we need to keep in mind that bone marrow is a         mixed population.  We've known about hematopoietic stem cells from         bone marrow since the 1960s.  These are well-studied and used         clinically.  The hematopoietic stem cell is differentiating primarily,         at least, into blood cells.                          Another stem cell that's in the bone         marrow is this mesenchymal, or stromal, cell.  As I mentioned in the         paper, one way that this type of cell is actually isolated is perhaps         first by markers, but then also simply by its ability to form attached         adherent layers in the culture dish, once you're putting them into         the dish in the lab.                          Now, there have been various studies, and         I've just tried to collect a number of them here, showing potential         differentiation into different tissue types, either in the lab dish, or         in the animal.  Again, the way they're following this in the animal         is primarily to use a genetic or a fluorescent marker, follow the cell,         see what tissue it ends up in, and look at its morphology, and then         also potentially try to analyze functionality and integration into the         tissue.                         In various disease models, some of these         cells have been used.  For example, in models of stroke.  And I want to         point out again what Dr. Gearhart said.  Animal models are only an         approximation.  This does not tell us the actual situation that we         might encounter in human beings.  But at this point, it's the best         we can do.  We can see if these cells might participate in cell and         tissue repair.  Using rat or human cells, there has been some         therapeutic benefit in some of these disease models in stroke with         animals.  With demyelinated spinal cord.                         Intravenous injection, interestingly         enough, of mesenchymal stem cells in the mouse has shown some         remyelinization in spinal cord injury.  Adult stem cells are not alone         in terms of this ability.  Other cell types have shown this.  And this         does not necessarily mean that you've totally corrected the         condition.  It simply means that you're able to provide some sort         of functional recovering of a bare nerve.                         Another interesting point about this         particular study was that they did not see a large incorporation of         these cells into the spinal cord tissue.  So what benefit they did see         did not appear to be due primarily to the adult stem cells actually         differentiating into the myelinating cells here.  Instead, what         appeared to be happening was the presence of those cells caused a         signal for the endogenous cells to start to re-grow and repair the         damage.                          In fact, Dr. Gearhart's lab just         recently published a paper showing that embryonic germ cells showed in         a particular mouse model the same type of repair phenomena.  The mice         did show therapeutic benefit.  But what they found was that the cells         did not, to a large extent, integrate in and participate in the         repair.  Instead, it seemed to be a signalling phenomenon.  And         I'll point this out in a couple of other examples along the way.                       There has been one clinical trial that I could find in the literature                where 11 patients were treated for Hurler syndrome, or metachromatic                leukodystrophy using allogeneic, and not from the original patient,                but from donor mesenchymal cells.  Now, the study noted that four                out of those eleven patients showed a small increase in nerve conductance.                 One of the problems with these diseases is a decrease in nerve conductance.                 There are other neurological effects, and so on.  So small increase.                                And in terms of loss of bone mass, all 11         patients seemed to maintain, at least for a certain time.  But in terms         of any of the other symptoms in these patients, there was no effect of         the adult stem"
GX069-57-14824523	Kleczka's Korner   A weekly update for Wisconsin's Fourth Congressional District       The Importance of Stem Cell Research   By Congressman Jerry Kleczka    In the coming weeks, President Bush will have to make an important decision that will impact the future of medical research - whether or not to federally fund research using stem cells.  This highly contentious issue has been in the news a great deal lately, and it’s an area of research that merits further exploration.  Wisconsin has been on the cutting edge of stem cell research and development.  The University of Wisconsin has been a longtime leader in the field and it was a UW-Madison scientist who in November 1998 became the first to grow embryonic stem cells in the laboratory.  Stem cells hold great promise for advances in medical treatment.  They are the basic building blocks for all the tissues in the body.   Stem cells are highly versatile, and can develop into bone, brain, muscle, skin and all the other organs.  There are two different types of stem cells that hold a great deal of promise with regard to potential medical breakthroughs.  The first, pluripotent stem cells, which are also called embryonic stem cells, are capable of developing into any tissue in the body.  The second, multipotent stem cells, sometimes referred to as adult stem cells, are found in more mature tissue and are used by the body to replace worn out cells in tissues and organs.  Scientists are still exploring the possible medical uses of adult stem cells, which do not appear to be as versatile at developing into any particular tissue as the embryonic cells.  Stem cells have the potential to help patients by being transplanted into diseased tissue, where they would change into the desired cell type and replace the damaged tissue with healthy cells.  They could also be grown into particular types of cells, such as fully developed lung tissue, for example, in the lab that could then be transplanted into unhealthy tissue to help it regenerate.  Early research indicates that stem cells may prove invaluable in finding ways to treat Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Huntington’s disease, diabetes, stroke and spinal-cord injuries, and that may be just the tip of the iceberg.  Supporters of stem cell research point to these preliminary findings as evidence that this line of exploration is too important to stop pursuing.  In 1999, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) proposed regulations that would permit federal funding for stem cell research with the provision that the stem cells were harvested by privately funded laboratories.  Federal money, then, would be used for the research alone, and not to facilitate the collection of stem cells from embryos.  Without federal support for the research, funding will be very hard to come by and progress will be slow.  The medical breakthroughs that could be made through stem cell research could potentially result in saving the lives and improving the health of millions of people.  Because pluripotent stem cells are extracted from embryos, there are people who have objected to this research because they feel it amounts to the taking of life.  However, a number of prominent members of the pro-life community, including Senator Orrin Hatch and former Wisconsin governor and Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson, have expressed their support for continued stem cell research.  The embryos in question are often donated by couples going through the in-vitro fertilization process that have decided for whatever reason not to use them.  These embryos, if not used for the research, would otherwise be destroyed and discarded anyway.  The regulations established by the NIH in 1999 were scheduled to go into effect this year, and two research projects have been proposed, but the NIH was directed to halt consideration of the experiments until President Bush had a chance to review the NIH’s policies.  It’s up to the President to determine whether the federal government will provide funding for this cutting-edge research.  Until then, these projects are on hold.  There is great potential in this research as those suffering from chronic, debilitating diseases potentially stand to gain relief from this groundbreaking new area of study.  Federal funding will help speed this process along, and federal oversight will allow the government to ensure that stem cell research is conducted in an appropriate and ethical manner.  Hopefully President Bush will recognize the life-saving prospects involved, and do the right thing by approving federal funding.    -30-

In a televised address delivered late August 9, Bush said federal grants may be used to conduct studies on more than 60 existing stem cell ""lines.""  The embryos from which these stem cell lines were created have already been destroyed at fertility clinics.  The president prohibited subsidies for research that involved the creation or destruction of additional embryos.    The president said his decision ""allows us to explore the promise and potential of stem cell research without crossing a fundamental moral line -- by providing taxpayer funding that would sanction or encourage further destruction of human embryos that have at least the potential for life.    ""At its core, this issue forces us to confront fundamental questions about the beginnings of life and the ends of science,"" he said.  ""It lies at a difficult moral intersection, juxtaposing the need to protect life in all its phases with the prospect of saving and improving life in all its stages.""    Bush said he would form a White House council that will monitor stem cell research, recommend guidelines and regulations, and ""consider all of the medical and ethical ramifications of biomedical innovation.""    He said the government would also provide $250 million in funding this year for research on adult and animal stem cells ""which do not involve the same moral dilemma.""    Stem cells are master cells that have the ability to transform themselves into other cell types, including those in the brain, heart, muscles and skin.  As Bush pointed out, most scientists today believe that research on embryonic, as opposed to adult, stem cells offers the most promise because these cells have the potential to develop in all of the tissues in the body.    Scientists generally harvest embryonic stem cells from embryos left over in fertility clinics after in vitro fertilization -- a process used to help infertile couples have a baby.  In the procedure, a woman's egg cells are fertilized with a man's sperm cells in a laboratory dish and a resulting embryo is implanted in the woman's womb.  Extra embryos produced during the procedure may either be destroyed or frozen.  It is these frozen embryos that can serve as a source of stem cells.    Following is the transcript of Bush's remarks:    (begin transcript)    THE WHITE HOUSE  Office of the Press Secretary  (Crawford, Texas)    August 9, 2001    REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT ON STEM CELL RESEARCH    The Bush Ranch  Crawford, Texas    THE PRESIDENT:  Good evening.  I appreciate you giving me a few minutes of your time tonight so I can discuss with you a complex and difficult issue, an issue that is one of the most profound of our time.    The issue of research involving stem cells derived from human embryos is increasingly the subject of a national debate and dinner table discussions.  The issue is confronted every day in laboratories as scientists ponder the ethical ramifications of their work.  It is agonized over by parents and many couples as they try to have children, or to save children already born.    The issue is debated within the church, with people of different faiths, even many of the same faith coming to different conclusions.  Many people are finding that the more they know about stem cell research, the less certain they are about the right ethical and moral conclusions.    My administration must decide whether to allow federal funds, your tax dollars, to be used for scientific research on stem cells derived from human embryos.  A large number of these embryos already exist.  They are the product of a process called in vitro fertilization, which helps so many couples conceive children.  When doctors match sperm and egg to create life outside the womb, they usually produce more embryos than are planted in the mother.  Once a couple successfully has children, or if they are unsuccessful, the additional embryos remain frozen in laboratories.    Some will not survive during long storage; others are destroyed.  A number have been donated to science and used to create privately funded stem cell lines.  And a few have been implanted in an adoptive mother and born, and are today healthy children.    Based on preliminary work that has been privately funded, scientists believe further research using stem cells offers great promise that could help improve the lives of those who suffer from many terrible diseases -- from juvenile diabetes to Alzheimer's, from Parkinson's to spinal cord injuries.  And while scientists admit they are not yet certain, they believe stem cells derived from embryos have unique potential.    You should also know that stem cells can be derived from sources other than embryos -- from adult cells, from umbilical cords that are discarded after babies are born, from human placenta.  And many scientists feel research on these types of stem cells is also promising.  Many patients suffering from a range of diseases are already being helped with treatments developed from adult stem cells.    However, most scientists, at least today, believe that research on embryonic stem cells offer the most promise because these cells have the potential to develop in all of the tissues in the body.    Scientists further believe that rapid progress in this research will come only with federal funds.  Federal dollars help attract the best and brightest scientists.  They ensure new discoveries are widely shared at the largest number of research facilities and that the research is directed toward the greatest public good.    The United States has a long and proud record of leading the world toward advances in science and medicine that improve human life.  And the United States has a long and proud record of upholding the highest standards of ethics as we expand the limits of science and knowledge. Research on embryonic stem cells raises profound ethical questions, because extracting the stem cell destroys the embryo, and thus destroys its potential for life.  Like a snowflake, each of these embryos is unique, with the unique genetic potential of an individual human being.    As I thought through this issue, I kept returning to two fundamental questions:  First, are these frozen embryos human life, and therefore, something precious to be protected?  And second, if they're going to be destroyed anyway, shouldn't they be used for a greater good, for research that has the potential to save and improve other lives?    I've asked those questions and others of scientists, scholars, bioethicists, religious leaders, doctors, researchers, members of Congress, my Cabinet, and my friends.  I have read heartfelt letters from many Americans.  I have given this issue a great deal of thought, prayer and considerable reflection.  And I have found widespread disagreement.    On the first issue, are these embryos human life -- well, one researcher told me he believes this five-day-old cluster of cells is not an embryo, not yet an individual, but a pre-embryo.  He argued that it has the potential for life, but it is not a life because it cannot develop on its own.    An ethicist dismissed that as a callous attempt at rationalization. Make no mistake, he told me, that cluster of cells is the same way you and I, and all the rest of us, started our lives.  One goes with a heavy heart if we use these, he said, because we are dealing with the seeds of the next generation.    And to the other crucial question, if these are going to be destroyed anyway, why not use them for good purpose -- I also found different answers.  Many argue these embryos are byproducts of a process that helps create life, and we should allow couples to donate them to science so they can be used for good purpose instead of wasting their potential.  Others will argue there's no such thing as excess life, and the fact that a living being is going to die does not justify experimenting on it or exploiting it as a natural resource.    At its core, this issue forces us to confront fundamental questions about the beginnings of life and the ends of science.  It lies at a difficult moral intersection, juxtaposing the need to protect life in all its phases with the prospect of saving and improving life in all its stages.    As the discoveries of modern science create tremendous hope, they also lay vast ethical mine fields.  As the genius of science extends the horizons of what we can do, we increasingly confront complex questions about what we should do.  We have arrived at that brave new world that seemed so distant in 1932, when Aldous Huxley wrote about human beings created in test tubes in what he called a ""hatchery.""    In recent weeks, we learned that scientists have created human embryos in test tubes solely to experiment on them.  This is deeply troubling, and a warning sign that should prompt all of us to think through these issues very carefully.    Embryonic stem cell research is at the leading edge of a series of moral hazards.  The initial stem cell researcher was at first reluctant to begin his research, fearing it might be used for human cloning.  Scientists have already cloned a sheep.  Researchers are telling us the next step could be to clone human beings to create individual designer stem cells, essentially to grow another you, to be available in case you need another heart or lung or liver.    I strongly oppose human cloning, as do most Americans.  We recoil at the idea of growing human beings for spare body parts, or creating life for our convenience.  And while we must devote enormous energy to conquering disease, it is equally important that we pay attention to the moral concerns raised by the new frontier of human embryo stem cell research. Even the most noble ends do not justify any means.    My position on these issues is shaped by deeply held beliefs.  I'm a strong supporter of science and technology, and believe they have the potential for incredible good -- to improve lives, to save life, to conquer disease.  Research offers hope that millions of our loved ones may be cured of a disease and rid of their suffering.  I have friends whose children suffer from juvenile diabetes.  Nancy Reagan has written me about President Reagan's struggle with Alzheimer's.  My own family has confronted the tragedy of childhood leukemia.  And, like all Americans, I have great hope for cures.    I also believe human life is a sacred gift from our Creator.  I worry about a culture that devalues life, and believe as your President I have an important obligation to foster and encourage respect for life in America and throughout the world.  And while we're all hopeful about the potential of this research, no one can be certain that the science will live up to the hope it has generated.    Eight years ago, scientists believed fetal tissue research offered great hope for cures and treatments -- yet, the progress to date has not lived up to its initial expectations.  Embryonic stem cell research offers both great promise and great peril.  So I have decided we must proceed with great care.    As a result of private research, more than 60 genetically diverse stem cell lines already exist.  They were created from embryos that have already been destroyed, and they have the ability to regenerate themselves indefinitely, creating ongoing opportunities for research.  I have concluded that we should allow federal funds to be used for research on these existing stem cell lines, where the life and death decision has already been made.    Leading scientists tell me research on these 60 lines has great promise that could lead to breakthrough therapies and cures.  This allows us to explore the promise and potential of stem cell research without crossing a fundamental moral line, by providing taxpayer funding that would sanction or encourage further destruction of human embryos that have at least the potential for life.    I also believe that great scientific progress can be made through aggressive federal funding of research on umbilical cord placenta, adult and animal stem cells which do not involve the same moral dilemma.  This year, your government will spend $250 million on this important research.    I will also name a President's council to monitor stem cell research, to recommend appropriate guidelines and regulations, and to consider all of the medical and ethical ramifications of biomedical innovation.  This council will consist of leading scientists, doctors, ethicists, lawyers, theologians and others, and will be chaired by Dr. Leon Kass, a leading biomedical ethicist from the University of Chicago.    This council will keep us apprised of new developments and give our nation a forum to continue to discuss and evaluate these important issues. As we go forward, I hope we will always be guided by both intellect and heart, by both our capabilities and our conscience.    I have made this decision with great care, and I pray it is the right one.    Thank you for listening.  Good night, and God bless America.

Accordingly, the President's Council on Bioethics makes no representation as to its accuracy.""        THIRD MEETING  Thursday, April 25, 2002     Session 1: Stem Cells 1:   Medical Promise of Embryonic Stem Cell Research (Present and Projected)   Dr. John Gearhart         CHAIRMAN KASS:  Well, I would like to ask Dean         Clancy to officially open the meeting, please.          MR. CLANCY:  This meeting is lawful.          CHAIRMAN KASS:  Thank you very much. Apologies to         our guests and to members of the audience for the late start. Council         Members had to take an oath of office, which should have been administered         to us before our very first meeting.         That has been done and we are now legal in every respect. Welcome to         this, the third meeting of the President's Council on Bioethics. We are         expecting colleagues Krauthammer and George today, and Stephen Carter         will not be with us, and Bill May will join us tomorrow.         I would like to introduce a new member of our staff, Judy Crawford,         who comes to us as the office manager. Judy, would you please rise so         that the council members can know you. We are very delighted to have Judy         with us.         We reconvene as the debate about the cloning legislation heats up around         us, a debate that we did not begin and do not control. We are in the midst         of our own careful and thorough investigation of the ethical, social,         and policy implications of human cloning seen in its larger scientific,         medical, and human contexts.         We have chosen to proceed in a deliberate, collegial, wisdom-seeking,         mode in keeping with our charge to inquire fundamentally into the human         and moral significance of developments in biomedical science and technology.         The most challenging aspect of our inquiry to date has been the moral         significance of cloning for biomedical research, a topic discussed for         the first time at our last meeting, and to which we return later today         in the hope of making progress and clarifying the contested moral issues         at stake, and in articulating the best possible moral arguments for and         again the conduct of such research.         On behalf of the council, I would like to thank the staff for its superb         work in advancing our inquiry, and on behalf of the staff, I would like         to thank council members for their thoughtful comments and responses.         We are in your debt.         The agenda for this meeting brings us into some new, but not altogether         unrelated, areas of inquiry. Stem cell research, a topic of our first         three sessions today.         Second, the question of therapy versus enhancement as a goal for the         uses of biomedical technology, and third, possible regulation of biomedical         technology. These topics have been selected with a view to initiating         one of our obligatory future projects, stem cell research, and exploring         two possible future projects for the council for the rest of our two year         charter.         As everyone knows, in his speech announcing the creation of this council,         President Bush charged us with monitoring stem cell research, embryonic         and non-embryonic, human and animal, in order to assess their progress         in gaining knowledge and beneficial therapies, and in due course to offer         guidelines and regulations for the conduct of such research.         As I indicated at our first meeting, we have begun to collect data that         will enable us to describe, assess, and compare the successes achieved         with both embryonic and non-embryonic stem cells.         As we are doing this, however, it seemed desirable for council members         to learn firsthand, and from some leading researchers in the field, about         the scientific and therapeutic promise of stem cell research present and         projected; embryonic and non-embryonic.         And it also seemed desirable to explicitly begin a disciplined conversation         about the ethical issues of embryonic stem cell research. Our first three         sessions today constitute the official thematic beginning of our project         on stem cell research.         We have of course already been deliberating about some of these matters         in our discussion of human cloning for biomedical research, a topic that         first arose for us as a crucial side question of the larger subject of         human cloning to produce children, what to think about it, and what to         do about it.         This is therefore a useful juncture at which to indicate the distinction,         as well as the connection between these two topics. Many members of the         public, including many of our elected officials who are in the process         of making policy in this area, as well as some members of the media, have         conflated the issue of stem cell research and the issue of cloning.         The issue of cloning comes first to attention as an issue of the ethics         of producing children by novel technological means, and the issue of cloning,         insofar as it has captured the public attention, is primarily about what         to think about the asexual production of new human beings who are going         to be genetically virtually identical to already existing individuals.         And the issues there are in the first instance the questions of the         ethics of, crudely speaking, baby-making. That is quite different from         the question of the ethics of embryo research.         Virtually all embryonic stem cell research now under way, both in humans         and in animals, involve cell lines developed from embryos, whether inner-cell         mass, or from the gonadal ridge of donated fetuses, that originate from         the sexual union of egg and sperm, and very often in the human case using         excess embryos produced in in vitro clinics and in all cases from material         not produced for the sake of the research. The question of Federal funding         of this research that President Bush resolved last summer, this was the         question that was resolved last summer, and the research in this area         proceeds not only with Federal funding under the guidelines that the President         established, but also in the private sector.         The two topics, however, intersect and overlap because cloning to produce         children necessarily proceeds through the production of cloned blastocysts,         which offer special opportunities for embryonic stem cell and other research.         Some proposals to curtail cloning for providing children would do so         by curtailing the initial steps, thus interfering with the possibility         of using cloned embryos for research.         And this has given rise to arguments for and against cloning for biomedical         research proper. This is where the intersection can be made explicit,         and that is where we now are.         In order for us in the other project to continue to make progress, and         therefore in order to see what value added might derive from working with         embryonic stem cells extracted from cloned blastocysts, one needs to know         something about what it would be added to. That is to say, to work on         ordinary embryonic stem cells. And in order to see more clearly what the         ethical issues are that might come from the question of producing cloned         embryos for biomedical research, it would be helpful for us to know something         of the ethical issues of experimenting on human embryos of sexual and         not clonal origin, and of using extra embryonic -- using the extra embryos         or fetuses not created for experimental purposes so we can see what different         questions arise here.         To help us with our scientific and medical education, we are very fortunate         to have as our guests and presenters this morning two distinguished researchers,         one who is a pioneer in isolating and characterizing human pluripotent         stem cells, Dr. John Gearhart, the C. Michael Armstrong Professor of Medicine         at Johns Hopkins University, and the Director of the Institute of Cell         Engineering.         And second a person who is a pioneer in work with human multipotent         adult progenitor cells, Dr. Catherine Verfaillie, a Professor of Medicine         and Director of the Stem Cell Institute at the University of Minnesota.         Each of our guests in separate sessions will make formal presentations,         roughly 30 to 35 minutes, after which time we will have a chance to ask         questions about the scientific, technological, and clinical aspects of         these areas of research.         This is our chance to learn about the wonderful prospects of these investigations.         However, let me say that because our guests are here not only as scientists,         but also as our neighbors, in a morally aspiring human community, we will         perhaps try toward the end to elicit from them their own thoughts about         the ethical issues in their own work.         But the purpose of these sessions is primarily our own education about         the scientific and medical aspects. With that I would like to turn the         meeting over to Dr. Gearhart, and to thank him very much for joining us         this morning.          DR. GEARHART:  I am certainly grateful to have         this opportunity to share with the President's Council my knowledge in         a very tiny area of biomedical research, and it is currently quite tiny,         but if you read and believe the press, it is obviously going to expand         enormously.         Much has been written and much has been said about stem cells, and it         seems every morning in the paper there is some article relating to it         and continuing the debate.         In the scientific literature, we see virtually in every issue of leading         journals a paper dealing with stem cells. An age old dream I think of         mankind or humankind has been to replace damaged or diseased tissues with         functional ones, new ones, and wouldn't it be nice to be able if you had         a damaged liver or kidney to take one off the shelf if you know what I         mean.         And this dream I think is going to become a reality, and with some of         the advances in biomedical research, and one of the ones that we are going         to talk about today, I think this will provide the starting material that         will lead to this reality.         The concept behind cell-based therapies -- and this is what we are talking         about here initially -- is a very simple one, and I think that that makes         it attractive, and it makes it understandable to the public. And that         is that if there is a tissue deficit, why not just replace the tissue.         Now, it is easy to say, and it will be difficult to do, but the concept         is an easy one.         Cell-based therapy has also been called regenerative medicine, and there         are many rubrics for this today. The power of this technology is derived         from information inherent in our genes and in our cells, and the recent         isolation of these embryonic type stem cells I believe is going to provide         the enabling material as I mentioned for this to go forward.         Stem cells are going to serve several purposes, the first of which could         be as a direct source in transplantation therapies. That means specific         cell types will be grown in culture, such as heart muscles, nerves, et         cetera, and transplanted to patients for function.         Or they will be genetically engineered to do exactly what we want them         to do and transplant it to patients; or they will be used by our tissue         engineer colleagues to construct tissues and parts of organs, which would         then be transplanted to patients.         Stem cells will also be used as a source of information, basic science,         and this is really where we are at currently. That could be applied to         a patient's own cells, such that we could remove cells from a patient         and alter them in some fashion to produce the cell types that we want,         and then transplant them.         Or ultimately I feel that what we are going to be able to do from the         information that we are going to learn on stem cells is that we will be         able to work in vitro with patient cells to get them to perform in a manner         that we want without taking them out and putting them in culture.This,         I believe, is the future. The scientific challenges to attain our goal         of producing safe and effective therapies are formidable. It will take         the efforts of many scientists and clinicians, in a variety of disciplines,         to bring this endeavor to fruition.         Now, the stem cells that I am going to talk about today interestingly         really do not exist naturally. That is, they don't exist in embryos or         fetuses. They are artifacts of culture.         But we take tissues from embryos and fetuses and they undergo a type         of transformation in culture to provide these stem cells. And this source         obviously brings with it a number of ethical concerns.         I, as an investigator, who has had to cross this bridge 9 or 10 years         ago when I began this work, believe that the ethical issues are manageable.         I also believe that it is the responsibility of scientists to candidly         and in a timely fashion present the social implications of their research         and its technological applications; to provide assessments on reliability,         and to participate in the establishment of ethical guidelines and to work         within those guidelines.         For the past 9 years at Hopkins, we have been in compliance with all         institutional, State, and Federal policies in dealing with the cells that         we work with.         It has not been easy because the landscape has changed in 9 years, and         every year there have been new concerns raised, and new issues that had         to be addressed, and I think we are keeping up with it.I should tell you         also up to this point in time that no Federal monies, no public monies,         have gone into our research effort. Now that Federal policy has changed,         we do have applications pending before the National Institutes of Health.         I also want to point out something that may be surprising to most of         you; that in our laboratory at Hopkins that we just are not concentrating         on an embryonic or fetal source of stem cells.         We are studying stem cells from adult sources, umbilical sources, et         cetera. This is the only way that we feel that you can have a scientific         advance, and that is to be able to compare and contrast the different         sources of stem cells.         So side by side, in the laboratory, in experimental paradigms, we are         using stem cells from a variety of sources, and this is what I think has         to happen to assess which of these sources are going to prove the most         effective for any specific type of therapy.         Another thing that I want to point out to you is that the work on the         human cells, I do have the questions that came from your committee in-         hand, and many of them are asking what is the status of certain types         of work.         I just want to point out that this work has been ongoing for a period         of 2-to-2-1/2 years, and although we feel that we are making progress,         we certainly are going to come up with, well, I don't know as answer to         some of your questions.         I just want to let you know that we don't have all the answers to this,         and we are very, very early in all studies of stem cells, be they from         the embryonic or adult sources.         I would tell you though that to date the work in our lab and others         on embryonic stem cells and the results of that work is certainly consistent         with the idea that this is going to prove to be a productive line of research.         Well, it is interesting that very few people know you and what you are         about, and I think it is important to point out something. My interests,         or my research interests for decades, have been in the area of developmental         genetics and development biology.         I have been labeled as a human embryologist, and my interests certainly         are in the area of how an embryo goes from a single cell to a multi-cellular         integrated organism.         And this is where our research has been in the past 25 years, and I         have carried this a step further. We are very interested in congenital         malformations and birth defects.         I have had a program project through the NIH for many, many years dealing         with Down's Syndrome, and we are very interested in trying to determine         what the mechanism is that underlies many of the unusual anatomical neurobiological         consequences of this extra chromosome in human beings.         And this is essentially how I got into this work. We wanted to have         in the laboratory a source of cells in addition that we could study at         the site or level of the impact of these extra genes.         And this obviously is a goal, along with a number of other genetic-based         diseases and malformations in the human being. So this is what led to         our getting into this area of research.         Now, I have to say up front that we are now required by our university         to reveal where our monies come from, and these are the sponsors of our         research, and there is one sitting in the middle there that I also have         to show to you that I am conflicted.         And which means that to the sponsorship of this private company, we         have received money for research, for which licenses have been negotiated         between Hopkins and Geron, and that I am a stockholder, albeit a few hundred         shares of something that is trading now at -- and I hate to think about         it.         It is not in our possession as you know. It is held in escrow. But nonetheless         we do have this arrangement with this company. So I would tell you that         this is not the motivation, this connection.         Without the sponsorship of this research, this work would not have gone         forward over the past seven years. We are not in this business as individuals         to make money.         Well, having said all of that, let's talk about stem cells. The first         thing I want to give you is a little bit of a primer on stem cells so         that we are talking the same language, and you have an understanding of         where I am coming from.         Well, what is a stem cell, and basically a stem cell is a cell that         has two properties. It has a property in that it has a capacity for self-renewal,         which means that the cell can divide and produce more cells like itself.         And it has some type or some degree of differentiative capability, which         means that it can go on to specialize into a single cell type, or it can         specialize into a number of cell types.         And in a developmental sense, if we over time at what our research has         told us about stem cells, they fall into a number of categories. Early         on in developmental practices, we have a cell that is totipotent.         It can renew, and it can form virtually every cell type that is present         in an embryo. As development proceeds, its developmental capabilities         become more restricted until we get into different lineages, specific         lineages, and its ability to divide also becomes more diminished over         time.         This has been the classical picture of development. Now, what has happened         over the past couple of years interestingly is we find that these restrictions         in developmental capability are much more plastic than we had thought.         So out here where we thought that these cells are highly restricted,         perhaps they aren't so, and when you remove them from the organism and         culture them, they have capabilities of forming other cell types, and         Catherine will be talking to you about some of these issues.         Well, we are going to be talking about embryonic stem cells, and what         is it about them. Well, interestingly, we know that these cells are capable         of producing virtually every cell type that is present in an embryo, a         fetus, or an adult, except one.         And that one happens to be the trophoblast cell, which I will tell you         about in a moment. So we consider these cells to be totipotent.         They don't have the ability in and of themselves to form an embryo or         an individual, okay? They have this other property of self-renewal, which         basically with respect to embryonic stem cells means that they will expand         indefinitely, and grow indefinitely, and this is a very important property.         It means that within the laboratory from a very few cells that you could         grow a roomful of these cells very easily. But there is an issue here         that we don't know much about, and that is obviously there is a finite         probability that at every cell division that a genetic mutation will appear.         And there was a paper published recently that indicated that indeed         this is the case, and the types of mutation, although the mutation frequency         and the mutation rate is greatly -- by several folds lower than in normal         somatic cells, mutations do occur in these cells, and they are of the         nature of making these cells susceptible to formation of tumors.         The uniparental disomy appears and it is a condition about which we         should be concerned. And up until this point, in the mouse where these         cells were first isolated, and for that work the person who did this,         Martin Evans, was awarded the Lasker Award last year.         We know that these lines forming whole animals, which is what they have         been used for up to this point, in genetic mutations is getting genetically         defined strains of mice.         That there comes a time when these cells are no longer productive in         doing this and that they lose some quality. So we know that there is going         to be a half-life to the use of these cell lines for whatever reason.         I just want to point that out, although they do have this replicative         ability. Well, where do these totipotent cells come from, and two major         sources. The first is this pre-implantation stage which we are going to         talk about, and the second are from specific cells within the fetus.         I also have on this slide, and by the way, I have given you two handouts.         One is the slides in the presentation, and another in a fairly recent         Nature review of this material, that you can refer to.         I want to point out another source of a cell that is very similar to         these two that we have isolated, and that comes as a stem cell for a specific         type of tumor called in the old days teratocarcinoma, and now called mixed         cell carcinomas.         These stem cells, referred to as embryonal carcinoma cells, were first         isolated back in the 1970s when I worked on this, and we thought that         these would be the answer to finding cells that would produce a variety         of cell types that we could work with within the human.         And I should tell you that at this point in time that there is a clinical         trial going on at the University of Pittsburgh using embryonal carcinoma         cells that have been selected for a neural lineage, and so that in culture         you can derive neural cells and that these have been placed in the brains         of 12 stroke patients.         It is a cell that is very, very similar to the two that I am going to         talk about. Well, the first source that you are aware of comes from these         structures here, which are pre-implantation stage human embryos, and I         am sure you are familiar with this.         And where that structure consists of two groups of cells; this outer         layer called trophectoderm, and an ectopically placed inner group of cells         called the inner-cell mass. It is from this group of cells here that the         embryo proper is derived, and it is connected ultimately to this outer         layer, which develops in the placental tissue by connecting stock in an         umbilical cord.         These cells may number only 15 or 20 in an embryo that may consist of         perhaps several hundred cells. And in work in the mouse, and subsequently         done in humans, first by Jamie Thomson, was that these cells were isolated,         placed in a culture condition, which then permits their growth and their         conversion into an embryonic stem cell.         This process of conversion can be highly inefficient, meaning that you         would need a large number of blastocyst and inner cell mass cells to derive         a few cell lines.         In some people's hands, it can be more efficient, but there is an issue         with that. A second source of cells with the same features was identified         in the early 1990s, first by Peter Donovan at NCI.         And what they were attempting to do were to culture long term cells         that are called primordial germ cells. These are diploid cells that are         present in an early embryo that eventually give rise to egg and sperm.         And they isolated, and this is superimposed upon a human fetus, they         isolated from the gonads, the gonadal ridges, these large cells, which         at the time of isolation in humans are about 20,000 of them present in         a gonad, and placed them in culture and essentially ended up with the         same type of cell.         This is what a human EG culture looks like, this clustering of cells         and I want to point out that there are cells in the background here which         are the so-called feeder layers.         All of these cell lines are derived on feeder layers, and all the lines         that were approved by Mr. Bush, and all the lines that we have, are derived         on a mouse feeder layer, and this is a point of contention, meaning that         we are concerned now about the fact of any endogenous viruses being transferred         from other animal tissues into the human cells.         And the FDA must deal with this at this point in time, but we do not         have permission on the use of Federal funds to derive new lines, avoiding         this issue of other animal products.         But they are grown on feeder layers. They are established and grown         on feeder layers of other species. If we compare different properties         of these cell types, and I bring this up -- some of these are of no value         to you immediately, but these are the criteria that one must use to say         whether or not you have a cell line.         It is very important, and of the 80 some lines that are now purported         to be available, I can guarantee you in talking to many investigators         from around the world that only a handful of these are bona fide cell         lines, and/or available to investigators.         Now, this may beg the point and that that may be enough to serve the         purposes in the immediate future. But really the majority, the vast majority         of so-called lines available do not meet the criteria that are now used         to say whether a line is a line.         Now, how do we -- we are very interested then in two things here. One         is the basic science aspect of this, and of course what is driving all         of this is the hope for some type of transplantation therapy.         Let's talk a minute about the basic science. What we have in the laboratory         now are cultures of cells in the plate that can form any cell type in         a human body.         Now, the argument is have we demonstrated that you can get out of these         all 200 and some cell types? No. You only find what you are looking for.         What we have found though are a large number of cell types that are         present in the human body within these dishes. The problem at the moment         is getting homogenous population of pancreatic islet cells or blood cells,         or muscle cells.         This is the real part of the scientific struggle here, and coming up         with the paradigms to say can we take a cell that can form any cell type,         and get it to form but one cell type.         And to do this we have to rely upon our knowledge coming out of molecular         embryology as to the genetics and what not involved in any type of cell         specialization.         And this is really the limiting issue at this point in time, getting         these purified populations of cells on demand. There are strategies that         are used that we do pretty good at, and we will take the initial populations         of cells, and we can change feeder layers, and we can change growth factors,         and we can put them in different types of cultures and force them then         to begin to specialize.         But they are mixed cultures, and within the same dish you are going         to find neurons and muscle, et cetera. And we must then go another step         and begin to sort out either through procedures called flow sorting based         on what is on cell surfaces to get then pure populations of hematopoietic         stem cells, muscle cells, or neuro cells.         And this works fairly well. We can get cultures of dopanergic neurons         that are 80 percent pure, and we can get cardiac muscle that is 97 percent         pure, et cetera.         But we are a long way from isolating in a homogeneous fashion the various         types of cells that we would like to get. Some of them ere doing well         at and others were not.         And it is going to require an extensive amount of research to achieve         this. Now in going to transplantation therapy -- we are going to jump         a little bit ahead here, and if we start, this could be ES.         If we start with this population, we do not transplant into anybody,         or into an animal at this point, one of the stem cells. You don't do it.         The reason that you don't do it is this.         These stem cells are capable of forming a variety of tissues, and they         will form tumors, and these tumors are these mixed germ cell tumors that         contain a variety of cell types.         They are called teratomas in the old literature. Monster. I mean, they         are contained in a mixed array, and you can see teeth, sebaceous glands,         hair, bone, parts of the gut, et cetera.         So what you have to do to make this work is you want to at least get         cells that you have treated somehow in a dish into some of these more         defined lineages that are away from this capacity to form tumors.         So that we then begin to select tissues downstream, all right? Part         of the problem, and you will read this in the literature, is how good         your selection is, is also indicated by whether or not when you take myocardiocytes         that you say, oh, these are all 100 percent myocardiocytes, you transplant         them into the wall of the heart, and you end up with a teratoma.         This happens, and we are into the central nervous system, and you end         up with a teratoma within the brain. So getting rid of those initial stem         cells are essential, and we have ways of doing this genetically, but I         just want to point out that this is an issue.         To say nothing about the fact that we do not know whether any cell downstream         here has the capacity to revert. We know very little about that at this         point in time.         So let me give you an example. There are many of these coming out in         a number of laboratories, most of them in the mouse in which lines have         been derived in different lineages, and they have been transplanted into         animals to show proof of concept, and that you can isolate a specific         cell type, and you can transplant it, and it will function within the         transplant.         I would like to give you now an example from our work at Hopkins. It         is an unpublished work, and it is now under review, but I think it is         important because it really illustrates several points that are critical         here.         We have taken our human cells and grown them under culture conditions         that would select for specific types of lineages, and whether it is neural,         or whether it is muscle, et cetera. And now we have, I believe, in our         laboratory over a hundred a hundred lines like this, of the human lines.         And in the one example that I want to present to you, which was done         with members of our department of neurology, and in collaboration with         our lab, is a model, using these cells in an animal model of the motor         neuron disease.         And in this study, these animals are treated with a virus that destroys         lower motor neutrons, so that animals become paralyzed, and they are paralyzed         because they lose the big nerve muscles that in your spinal cord hook         your muscles up to the central nervous system.         So that in a period of 10 days following the injection of the virus         into the brain, the animals become paralyzed, and we have gone to great         lengths to show that it is really the ventral roots that are involved.         You wipe out these neurons and these animals never recover. They never         recover. So what we have done is to take our human neural cells out of         this and infuse it into the spinal cords of these rats, and to look then         for the recovery of motor activity.         This is a rat out for a mid-morning stroll, and this animal is infected         with the virus, and it is a virus that really leads to an encephalomyelitis,         and within a period of 10 days the animal is paralyzed.         We can document exactly what this paralysis is about. The virus is cleared,         and shortly thereafter we will put a cannula into the lumbar region of         the animal, and infuse 300,000 cells into the cerebrospinal fluid, and         these cells will float all the way up to the hind-brain.         And then we monitor the motor activity of these animals, and within         a period of a few months, we begin to see animals that can now place their         limbs underneath them, and that can draw them up, support some weight,         and begin to push off.         And at the high end, within a several month period, we can have animals         that are now walking. And the issue is why are they walking. And what         we have learned, although it is not as you can see a normal gait, et cetera,         and we have really documented this as well, they are walking.         And why are they walking? Well, initially what we felt was this. This         is a panel showing cells within the ventral horn of those animals and         I want you to look at this cell here.         This cell, based on its marker, and based on its physical characteristics,         and molecular characteristics, is a human motor neutron cell that has         been specialized out of these neural precursor cells, that has sent an         axon out into the periphery at least two centimeters.         And we have been able to cut the sciatic nerve out on the limb of this         animal, place a dye at that site, and that dye is picked up by that axon,         and brought back to the cell body that extended the axon.         And it comes back, and this is the green stuff here, and it comes back         then into the cell body of the human motor neuron. We have gone on to         document how many human cells are present, and what they are as far as         the phenotype is concerned, to see -- you know, yes, they are forming         glia, and they are forming a variety of cell types within the ventral         horn of that animal.         Interestingly, and one of the safety issues that we find is that 50         percent of the cells don't do anything. And we are a little bit concerned         about that.         I mean, is it good to have all these cells in there that aren't doing         anything, but this is an issue that we have got to resolve. Well, it turns         out that this is only part of the answer. It turns out that the human         cells at the same time are producing growth factors that rescue and enhance         the regeneration of the animal's own cells within the ventral horn.         And so this has led us then to set up experiments to try to figure or         try to determine what growth factors it is that is causing the growth         of axons in those mice and in rats in the ventral horn, and it may be         that eventually we can use just the combination of those growth factors         to elicit this response. We don't know.         So these cells are serving in a dual capacity, which is somewhat exciting.         We have taken the human cells and we now have grafted them into monkeys.         They were in monkeys for over a year.         This was a safety study to in fact show that we are not getting tumors         formed. I think you can appreciate one of the major issues here that we         are going to be faced with, with this type of approach, is animal experiments         are of a very short duration. Mice and rats are for periods of several         months.         Monkeys we can go much longer. How much data is going to be needed to         convince the FDA that this is a safe approach, and this is something that         is being debated now within the FDA and it is a difficult issue.         But here we show human cells, and that is these blue ones that have         been in this monkey, and in this case for 180 days, but we are now out         a year, and we can show that these cells are forming specialized structures         and they are non-tumorigenic.         The next phase is to look at a graph model here that is functional.          CHAIRMAN KASS:  Can I just ask a question?          DR. GEARHART:  Sure.          CHAIRMAN KASS:  What has been injected here?          DR. GEARHART:  Oh, I'm sorry. These are the         same -- what has been injected into this monkey are the same cells that         were injected into the rat. The same cells. They were human cells --          CHAIRMAN KASS:  Neural precursors?          DR. GEARHART:  Neural precursor cells. The         same cells, the same culture cells. A major issue that we must discuss         and that we are concerned about is graft rejection. Obviously, anything         that you grow up, unless it matches the patient, is going to be subjected         to that, and now we get into an area which Dr. Kass has mentioned earlier.         But what are our options here? What are the options of being able to         grow these cells into any of these lineages and then to transplant them         and not have rejection?         Well, there is a long list, and it starts with, well, maybe what we         ought to do is derive hundreds of ES and EG cell lines, and then you would         have a best match for a patient. Not very practical.         Can we use the patients own cells, and you will hear about some of this         shortly. Should we use immunosuppressive therapies. We would like to get         away from that.         Can we use what the tissue engineers are referring to as sequestering         grafts, and what this is, is you can take grafted cells and put around         them matrices that will not permit other cells to touch them, but yet         they can produce products, or they can function in a graft.         So you are trying to hide them from the host immune cells. How effective         that is going to be, we don't know.         Can we perhaps come in and genetically modify, which is easy to do in         these cells with the histo-compatibility genes, so we can make them more         like a patient that is going to receive these cells.         Or is it possible that we may end up being able to produce cells that         may be universal donors. Again, we are trying this, and at the moment         it is speculation.         Clearly the one thing that has worked is the issue of nuclear transfer         therapy, the so-called therapeutic cloning, in which as you know the argument         is to take a cell from a patient, and fuse it to an enucleated egg, derive         a blastocyst, recover the inner cell mass, culture it out, and then these         embryonic stem cells would match the genome of the patient.         Is this a pipe dream? The answer is no, and I will give you an example         of that in a moment. To get around some of the issues with the human cloning,         embryonic cloning in humans, you have seen reports in the Wall Street         Journal and other places which I can confirm are real, in which there         are attempts now to take human cells, human nuclei, place them for example         into rabbit eggs, enucleated rabbit eggs, and grow up a blastocyst, and         generate stem cells that have human nuclei and rabbit mitochondria.         And the argument has been made here that, well, these cells would be         perfectly fine for an autograft, and this isn't accurate. We know that         mitochondria produced polypeptides that are integrated into the cell membrane,         and are actually considered to be minor histocompatibility antigens, and         will be recognized and rejected by the host from which the nucleus came         from.         So this really is not getting around the issue of the graft stuff at         all using other animals, and we are a little bit concerned about how this         is being handled.         So, let me give you an example, and one which you should read these         papers if you haven't from Rudy Jaenisch and George Daley at MIT, using         the nuclear transfer therapy, or the therapeutic cloning, to do two things.         What they did was to take a mouse that had a genetic mutation in genes         that are important as far as the immune response is concerned. And they         took cells from this mouse, took the nucleus out of the cell, and placed         that nucleus into an enucleated egg to produce a blastocyst from a cloned         embryo.         They took the inner-cell mass cells out of that, and generated embryonic         stem cells, that then are the same genome type as this animal, and then         went in and repaired genetically the mutation within those cells.         And then differentiated these cells into the hematopoietic stem cell         component, transferred them back into this animal that had the mutation,         and the transplant took, completing the whole hematopoietic system, and         in rescuing that animal.         So this is a proof of concept kind of experiment, and I urge you to         read it. It is an extremely powerful illustration, not only of the therapeutic         cloning end of things, but also the ability then to come along and correct         the genetic mutation and the reference was given to you.         Another argument has been made that we should be using perhaps just         eggs that have been stimulated to form embryos, and these are parthenotes.         And the argument here has been that we can then use these directly into         the female from which the eggs were taken. I just want to point out that         in my opinion that this is going to have very low usage.         You are going to have to recover embryos or eggs from patients, post-pubertal,         and pre-menopause. The window is going to be fairly short, I think, for         many of the therapies that you would want to effect.         And the other issue is that we don't know much about cells that are         derived this way, and how viable, and how functional they are going to         be. But this has been used or promoted also as a source, and this is an         illustration of where you take those cells.         All of this type of technology, I just want to let you know, and I know         that you are grappling with this, but even within the field of the scientists         are beginning to argue about what is an embryo and what isn't an embryo.         So any arguments that you have within your council on this, I will tell         you is also being held among biologists. I think that my own personal         feeling is that anything that you construct at this point in time that         has the properties of those structures to me is an embryo, and we should         not be changing vocabulary at this point in time. It doesn't change some         of the ethical issues involved.         What are some of the problems here, and I will summarize this a little         bit. Current research. Well, we have to come up with better ways of having         high efficiency differentiation protocols resulting in homogeneous cell         populations.         We are dealing with growth environments, and genetic manipulations,         and we are trying to define stages of cell differentiation within our         cultures.         And assessing whether or not the differentiated cells that we are getting         out are normal and completely functional. And this is in a dish.         And let me tell you that there are examples of where you can spend all         of an effort studying something in a dish, only to find that if you pop         it in an animal that it doesn't behave how you think it is going to behave.         We have a lot to learn here.         I think you can imagine that what is going on in a dish is not exactly         what is going on in a site where you transplant. The whole issue of grafting,         and how you put it in, and the safety issues, and that cells migrate away,         and they differentiate, and will they form tumors, and then the issue         of the immune response.         These are all, you know, formidable obstacles that lie ahead. I mentioned         to you that we can use cells individually, and have been used in a variety         of paradigms in our collaborators of single cells, and the tissue engineers         are now taking these different cell types and seeing if they can reconstruct         or construct organal aids or tissues to do in-grafting, and thee has been         some success with this at this point.         Finally, to me, the future is going to be that the basic science coming         out of this is the most important element, and that from that information         we are going to be able, I think, to take patient cells, where appropriate,         and I say where appropriate because if you have autoimmune disease, or         in cases where you have an injury, spinal cord injury, or stroke, or heart         attack, and you don't have time to take that patient's cells, you are         going to have to come up with different paradigms.         But I think we are going to be able to eventually coax a patient's own         cells to behave in a manner that we want to, but we are going to learn         this I think through the study of stem cells.         The last thing I will say is I know that you want to ask, well, what         is the future going to bring, and I am concerned about predicting the         future. I can't even do this on a three year NIH grant and this is what         is expected of us.         You know, what is going to happen here. I certainly think that everything         that has happened up to this point is consistent with success in this         area, and I could get into more predictions in a moment.         But we are always asked when is this going to happen, and it is going         to be I think based on specific cell types, and on, and on, and on. But         the predictive thing is very, very difficult.         Well, I thank you for your attention, and I hope that this was enough         of a primer to add more meat to your discussions. Thank you.          CHAIRMAN KASS:  Thank you very much.         (Applause.)          CHAIRMAN KASS:  We were only physically in the dark,         but we are grateful for your enlightenment, Dr. Gearhart, and the floor         is open for questions, and comment, and discussion. Don't forget that         you have to turn your microphones on to be heard. Jim, go ahead.          DR. WILSON:  Dr. Gearhart, do you foresee         that it will ever make a difference whether cells that are transferred         for human cell regeneration come from cloned eggs, or from the retrieval         from IVF eggs? Does it make a difference what the source is?          DR. GEARHART:  Well, I think in the short term         that it will. I think the only way we have around the immune rejection         story at this point is from cloned embryos.         For a patient in which you can predict ahead of time is going to need         stem cell therapy and you have the time and money available to do the         cloned approach.         I would like to think that this is going to be a transitionary period,         and that we will not have to rely upon this in the long term, and that         we will be able to take for any specific disease a stem cell, or a derivative         of a stem cell that may come from the adult source, the umbilical source,         the fetal source, or embryonic source.         I mean, whichever presents, and that we will have ways of dealing with         this graft rejection story other than through the cloning of human embryos.          DR. WILSON:  If I could just supplement         my question with a related one to which you referred. What is your current         assessment of the value of adult stem cells, as opposed to embryonic ones,         as a source of organ regeneration currently?          DR. GEARHART:  Oh, I think it is a very viable         option and I think NIH should fund it. I think that from what we see in         the work, and Catherine will present a nice overview of this, that this         is going to be a good source of stem cells.         They have some issues that they have to overcome, issues of expandability,         and plasticity, that we feel are -- that have not been demonstrated as         well as embryonic stem cells, but I think that eventually we will be able         to overcome this.         But I think part of the knowledge of overcoming it is going to be coming         from our studies of cells that have those capabilities, and being able         to transfer that information to those other cells.         So I think we are going to come up with -- I believe that in the stem         cells, cell-based therapies, that we are going to identify certain adult         sources that are going to be good for some diseases, some injuries, and         embryonic sources for others.         So I think we are going to mutually proceed on this and benefit from         it.          CHAIRMAN KASS:  Please, Elizabeth.          DR. BLACKBURN:  Dr. Gearhart, you can         give us I think a unique perspective on the comparison between adult,         and embryonic, and fetal stem cells.         And in particular many of us read the recent papers, the scientific         peer-reviewed papers that came out with respect to the adult stem cells,         and the interpretation of their plasticity being cast in some considerable         doubt by the observation that there was cellular fusion of those cells         which had led to in these particular cases examined a mistake in interpretation         of their plasticity.         And I wondered if you could give us your perspective on that aspect,         which extends Jim's question somewhat.          DR. GEARHART:  I will do so in the face of         Catherine sitting back here, who is --          DR. BLACKBURN:  Yes, I am going to ask         her, of course, about this, too.          DR. GEARHART:  -- actually done those experiments.         Clearly the most difficult experiments that we have had to address and         interpret are those utilizing adult stem cells that have been placed into         the blastocyst of mice to create chimeras.         And in those chimeras, we see that the descendants of those adult cells         gave rise to many, many lineages within the embryo, and this was really         the issue. How did we explain this.         And from the studies of Austin Smith and others that you are referring         to, the implication was that when those cells were transplanted into that         blastocyst to generate the chimeras, that a subset of these cells fused         with the hosts own cells and it was those fusion products then that gave         rise to the variety of lineages.         At the moment that is an implication, and that has not been demonstrated         in the embryo. It has been demonstrated in the dish that they had that         capacity.         So we are now waiting and putting pressure on Catherine, and Freizen,         and others to look into those animals to see if they can recover those         specialized cells that were derived from or that had the adult phenotype         if you know what I mean, the marker, to say are you truly of the adult         stem cell lineage, or do you have other markers present, other chromosomes         present, that come from host cells.         So until we see that data -- you know, I will wait. That is something         that can be looked at scientifically, and that is as far as I would go         with you, Elizabeth, at this point.         It is an interesting observation, and we will see if it actually is         the answer.          DR. BLACKBURN:  And just to extend on         what you said, I think what it does now do is to demand that the onus         be put on the researcher to show that there has been a plasticity or transdifferentiation,         and there are other set of criteria, which would be karyotype and multiple         micro-satellite, polymorphisms -- sorry to get overly technical -- and         other genetic markers.         There are clearly tools in hand, and so it seems as if every experiment         can in fact be subjected to those sets of analyses now.          DR. GEARHART:  Right.          DR. BLACKBURN:  And will need to be before         we can get a good view of this.          DR. GEARHART:  Right.          CHAIRMAN KASS:  Rebecca.          PROF. DRESSER:  I have four questions,         and maybe if I say them all it will be possible to answer some of them         together. One, I was wondering if the rats are being given immunosuppressants         in this study.         And then you said a problem with the rabbit eggs is that the mitochondrial         DNA might cause rejection, and so I wondered if that would happen with         a cloned human embryo as well if the egg came from another person, and         if you are trying to do a therapy that is compatible with a patient.         And let's see. The feeder layers, I was wondering if they have available         feeder layers that do not come from animals or what the state of that         development is.         And then finally what about the fact that if you are creating a blastocyst         from a patient's cell, and if the patient, let's say, has cancer or some         condition that could be related to genetics, would the stem cells somehow         perhaps be risky?          DR. GEARHART:  There is no question in my mind         that the possibility exists that if you are doing an egg donor, and nuclear         transfer into an egg, that there possibly exists that that cell -- that         the embryonic stem cells derived from that could be rejected. Absolutely.         Now, how do you test this? I mean, where do you test it. This almost         comes under the same criteria that I have for anyone coming to -- if I         was on an IRB and they wanted to clone a human reproductivity, what data         do you present before you permit it to go.         To me, it is one of these things where you need perfection before experimentation,         or without experimentation, which is something in science is anathema.          PROF. DRESSER:  Well, you could test that         in an animal, right? I mean, you could at least see --          DR. GEARHART:  Well, you can, and we could         set it up in an animal, but the issue is -- I mean, where you are very         defined and to demonstrate it by doing it into a different strain of mouse.         There is no question about it.         But whether or not that would carry over in polymorphisms that exist         in human, again you are still faced with human versus rodent.         The feeder layer issue. It is one that is being taken on, and there         is no banning of this type of work with private money, and clearly there         are a number of investigators, laboratories, working on establishing feeder         layers from human tissue that could be used, and I think that this is         very important.         So those studies are certainly under way. We have used a variety of         different human tissues as well to look at in our studies. Oh, the very         first question that you asked. I'm sorry, it was again?          PROF. DRESSER:  For the rats --          DR. GEARHART:  Oh, sorry. We did animals that         were immunosuppressed and animals that were not immunosuppressed. And         we did not find a great deal of difference in the short term, although         -- I mean, as far as any type of destruction of cells and things like         that, although clearly in the animals that were not immunosuppressed that         you could see reactive cells present.         So clearly in the monkeys immunosuppressed, absolutely, and so we have         done them both. And then the blastocyst question?          PROF. DRESSER:  If it comes from a patient         with a particular disease.          DR. GEARHART:  Yes. Clearly where there is         a genetic basis of any type of a disease, you would be concerned about         reintroducing the same cells that were subjected to whatever the disease         process was.         And I think that this carries over also into, for example, the diabetes         work, where if you have an attack on insulin itself, you know, is this         going to be a viable alternative, and there are some evidence now that         you can alter the insulin molecule to make it not recognized by some of         the autoimmune antibodies.         I should say that there are a number of laboratories -- and this is         one area that is being emphasized in the use of human cells, including         our own, with Mike Shamblott, where we have lines that are -- human lines         that are insulin producing that you can pop them into animals, and demonstrate         that they can produce human insulin.         And we are very encouraged by some of these early results. But I would         still contend that we have a long way to go to carry that into some type         of clinical application. We have a lot of questions to answer.          CHAIRMAN KASS:  Janet.          DR. ROWLEY:  Well, I, too, have multiple questions         and I want to thank you for a very lucid presentation. That helps a great         deal. I would like to first -- and I think I will do these one at a time.         It is a substantial question as to what value the embryos that are left         over from IVF can play in this whole process as compared with embryos         that you develop for either a particular purpose, or just straight off.         And my understanding was that maybe some of the embryos were sufficiently         mature so that maybe the cells derived from IVF would not be useful in         developing, say, cells lines or things. And I would like your comments.          DR. GEARHART:  One of my hats at Hopkins when         I moved there in the late '70s was to develop the IVF program. So we are         very well tuned into the issues of IVF, and clearly in an IVF procedure         the best embryos obtained are those that are used first in first transfers.         So that generally those that are left over are of the ones -- we don't         want to call it a lesser quality, but at least as far as our eye is concerned,         and how we judge grades of embryos, based mainly on morphology to be honest,         and more currently we are looking at biochemical parameters that we can         measure in the media in which these cells are growing that something has         been secreted to have some kind of a measure.         And that clearly those that are the spare embryos generally are those         of -- let's say, what we deem, and knowing what that means, of lesser         quality.         So what does that mean? In most cases, they have not developed far enough         along, which means that if they are left over that you take them back         out of the freezer, and you try in your culture conditions to get them         up to this blastocyst point.         If you can't get them to a blastocyst stage, you can't derive the cells.         If there is no inner cell mass, you can't do it. And you find that you         are compromised there, and that generally these are not very good embryos.         So one could argue that overall that you would expect to have a low         efficiency yield with respect to taking in embryo and deriving a line         from spare embryos in an IVF program. That is in general.          DR. ROWLEY:  Okay. You mentioned modifying         the histocompatibility locus, and I would have thought that there is still         so much that we don't know about the MAC that that would -- I mean, obviously         anything can be done in the future with time, but do you look on this         as practical?          DR. GEARHART:  Well, back in the ancient days,         in the early '80s it seems in this field, Oliver Smithies and others did         do knockouts of Class I and Class II genes, in an effort to determine         whether or not this could prolong grafts into animals without those.         And that depending on the tissue or the organ, there was evidence that         this indeed could be the case, and not that it was an indeterminate thing,         but just by days, or weeks, or months, that this was the case.         What they didn't know about at that time were NK killer cells, and those         kinds of things, and the importance of other determinants which must be         on cells. They wiped everything out.         So some labs are now taking a look at this to see if it is possible         then to rebuild back some of these markets. But it is a matter of speculation         at this point whether or not this could occur.         Now, what we can talk about I think is it possible to take using the         act of transgenesis and things like this, where we could move big pieces         of DNA; of taking part of a patient's chromosome-6, you know, and cloning         that into a stem cell after knocking out some of it, and we may get some         degree closer.         But that says nothing about the myriad of other loci that could be involved         as minor histocompatibility problems. So, some of it is speculation, but         I think it is also testable at this point in time.          DR. ROWLEY:  And my last question is coming         back to the 80 plus cell lines, and you raised concerns, which many of         us have, as to how useful some of those are going to be.          DR. GEARHART:  Right.          DR. ROWLEY:  Could you expand a little bit,         in terms of whether you think they are really not going to be long term         cell lines, and that is your concern, or whether there are other aspects.          DR. GEARHART:  Well, I have many concerns,         and I hope that I can get them all in. I mean, look, we were all thrilled         when Mr. Bush made the decision to move forward with this and establish         cell lines to permit the work to go forward. There is no question about         it.         But as we looked into -- and by looking into, it was a practical matter.         Many investigators around the world, and I have close contacts with colleagues         in Germany, and in France, and in England, and Japan, and Australia, and         on and on, as we compare notes all the time on our results of research,         as well as on practical things like this, and on political issues.         I mean, there is no question that we have to keep abreast, and what         happened, particularly from the German investigators, which is significant,         as you know, in Germany, they are not permitted to derive cell lines.         And for a while they were not permitted to use those that were even         derived, and recently their parliament voted to permit the use of existing         cell lines as of January 2002.         But what happened was that when these investigators set about to import         cell lines, and contacted the registry list at the NIH, which continues         to grow each day, and more lines are added to it as you know, it turned         out that many of the lines were not defined.         Someone just reported that they had a clump of cells growing in a dish,         and they didn't have any of these parameters or very few of them done.         And this reduced the list substantially, quite substantially, down to         -- we are talking about, say, a dozen. And then the issue came up as to,         well, are these -- can they be imported without a stringent material transfer         agreement, and with a reach through clause that would say that anything         that you would do with those lines belongs to the person giving you the         line.         And this reduced the line substantially. And then other lines are not         available because if you needed to get them, you needed NIH funding, and         only NIH funding. You could not use private funding with them, and on         and on.         And so it drastically reduced down the number of lines that are practically         available. Now, whether or not this will have a major impact, clearly         the NIH is receiving grants, and we have been reviewing grants, and using         the existing approved lines, the few that one can get.         And the work will go forward, and whether or not that will be sufficient,         and we recognize that there is going to be a half-life to these lines         for various reasons, and that there will come a time if it proves effective         in the basic science part of this to move forward, that we should be looking         at being able to generate new lines.         And the issue of the feeder cells is a major issue as well, and to begin         to establish lines on human cells so that we are not faced with that anything         that we derive from this now, and it is important to consider, has to         be considered as a xenograft.         Although it is a human line, the FDA requires that if it has seen these         other products, it has to be considered a xenograft, which sets up a whole         new set of criteria for moving this into the clinical applications.         So I think there are reasons why we should eventually be permitted to         derive new lines. Well, I'm sorry. We can do it now on private money,         but anything that is derived cannot receive Federal money for support.          CHAIRMAN KASS:  There are people waiting in line,         but can I get a clarification on this question that came up in your answer         to Janet about the durability and longevity of the lines, and on the one         hand, one says that the embryonic stem cell lines, their great virtue         is that they can be self-renewed indefinitely.         On the other hand, they have a half-life, perhaps because of accumulated         mutations. Could you say a little more? I mean, some people claim these         are eternal lines.          DR. GEARHART:  Right.          CHAIRMAN KASS:  And could you say something about         the possible differences between human and mouse with respect to renewability,         because I think it is an important factor.          DR. GEARHART:  Well, the issue is maybe they         are eternal, but can you still use them. They can still divide indefinitely,         but they may not --          CHAIRMAN KASS:  But they are no longer the same.          DR. GEARHART:  Yes, they are no longer the         same, and they may not give you the biologic properties that you need.         Strangely enough, Leon, there have been very few publications up to this         point, and up to this point there is one that I can cite for you, and         I have it in answer to some of your questions by Joe Stanbrook at -- Peter         Stanbrook, at the University of Cincinnati, in which he looked -- these         were mouse lines.         And he looked at the frequency and rate of mutation within several mouse         lines, and contrasted those with several schematic cell lines that were         in the lab as well.         And he found that indeed the mutation rates -- and what you do is you         pick certain genes to look at changes, and to look at chromosome lost         or gain.         This paper was published in PNAS in the March 19th issue for those who         are interested, and what he found was that the frequency and rates of         mutation were orders of magnitude less in the embryonic stem cell line         than in the schematic cell line.         And you are looking at a rate of generally 10 to the minus 6 frequency         within any mammalian cell as it is divided. But what he did find, and         that was a bit troublesome, was that the type of mutation that appeared         in the embryonic stem cell one led to what is called uniparental disomy,         which is a situation where you end up with homozygosity across a region,         or across chromosomes or regions of chromosomes, that gets rid of really         the dominant tumor suppressor genes, which then raises the issue that         these cells may be more susceptible to tumorigenesis than others.         Now, that is the only report, and I will tell you that in several laboratories         what is being done now with the human lines, and that is using express         sequence tags, for example, and you can use 10,000 of them, they are looking         at mutation rates at 10,000 loci, if you know what I mean, over time in         culture passage, after passage, after passage.         So we will get information on this parameter, and how significant it         is going to be, I don't know, but one would predict that clearly there         is going to be an accumulation of mutations within these cells.          CHAIRMAN KASS:  Okay. Thank you. I have Michael         -- well, also, was that on this point?          DR. BLACKBURN:  Just a very brief clarification.         Did the absolute frequency of uniparental disomy go up? Was it an absolute         frequency increase, or simply did it relatively increase as you looked         at the whole spectrum of mutations in the mouse embryonic stem cells?         Do you see the difference that I am trying to get at?          DR. GEARHART:  Yes.          DR. BLACKBURN:  That if it were an absolute         increase, that is a reason for concern, much more than if it were simply         a relative increase in a number that has already gone down by --          DR. GEARHART:  These numbers are rates, and         so I believe it is an actual number. In other words, it was a real --          DR. BLACKBURN:  An absolute increase?          DR. GEARHART:   Yes, an absolute increase.          DR. BLACKBURN:  So I just wanted to make         sure that I understood the numbers here.          CHAIRMAN KASS:  Michael Sandel, and then Frank.          PROF. SANDEL:  I would like to go back         to the adult stem cell versus embryonic stem cell question, and ask it         in a slightly different, and maybe more pointed, form.         As you know, there are some people who regard embryonic stem cell research         as morally objectionable. I am not asking you or trying to drag you into         that debate. But I would like to know your view on the following scientific         question.         If adult stem cell research in the best case scenario redeems its promise,         what would we lose medically and scientifically if we ban embryonic stem         cell research, or imposed a moratorium on it for a period of time, until         we could assess what adult stem cell research could achieve?          DR. GEARHART:  I personally think it would         be a tragedy, and for the following reason, if this was to happen. I think         the length of time that it is going to take to assess whether the adult         stem cell avenue is going to provide the potential therapies that we are         thinking about, is going to be years.         And I think for us to deny at this point any avenue that has the potential         of the embryonic stem cell story is a tragedy to those people who need         or who will need these cures.         And I think that it is a time element. If this could be done in a year,         I would maybe listen to that argument. But it is going to take years to         really assess any of these approaches.         And I really think they should move forward together. I think we are         going to learn in both directions how to utilize information coming out         of these studies that would benefit, for example, or enable us to understand         more about the adult sources if this is going to be the emphasis, and         to really make them effective in their use.         So I think that it wouldn't be wise to put a ban on the embryonic source         at this point, and wait until another avenue is assessed. The length of         time is going to be too long.          PROF. SANDEL:   Can you be more specific?         Are there certain types of research avenues that you would associate more         with embryonic stem cell research, as against adult stem cell research?         Is it likely that success is in particular areas, or is it just that         you feel that as a general matter it is better to have more avenues rather         than fewer?          DR. GEARHART:  Well, I think that one of the         messages that I hope that I can get across, and maybe Catherine will,         too, is that we are in very early stages in all of stem cell research,         no matter what the origin of the cells are.         And to make a judgment as to which of these is already more advanced         than the other, it would be a tenuous one at this point, because you have         got to remember that there are very few investigators actually working         on embryonic stem cells at this point.         The list on the adult side obviously is larger. I mean, as far as investigators         are concerned. And I don't think that any of us are really showing dramatic         -- you know, utilization in the sense that we can say we are going to         go to any clinical use of this.         It is going to take years for this to occur. We are in the very early         stages and so I would be really hesitant to say that anything is demonstrating         anything better.         All I would say about embryonic stem cells at this point in a very positive         way is that we know that at this point that out of these cells we can         virtually generate any cell type we want in dish and in large numbers.         That is the advantage of this approach. Now, whether this will be surmounted         by other discoveries in adult stem cells to do the same kinds of things,         I don't want to predict. I hope that it happens.         You know, our -- and I also want to emphasize that we -- and although         we are associated with the embryonic form, we are studying other forms         as well. We are not foolish.         As a scientist, you know, you are not going to put all your eggs in         one basket here. And so we are trying to move forward on a broad front,         and I think that this would be the more rational way to proceed in this         arena          CHAIRMAN KASS:  Frank.          PROF. FUKUYAMA:  Dr. Gearhart, did I understand         you correctly that in the experiment that you headed up with the mouse         that it lost the motor function in its rear legs, that you were injecting         human stem cells?          DR. GEARHART:   Yes. Well, if I could correct         you a moment. It was a rat, first of all.          PROF. FUKUYAMA:  Okay. A rat.          DR. GEARHART:  Rat, too, but the issue is please         don't say that you are injecting stem cells. These are derivatives of         stem cells. I mean, just so that we know, but they are out of the stem         cell line, okay?          PROF. FUKUYAMA:  Okay. Fine. But what was         the resulting tissue? It was a mixture then of rat and human neurons,         or do you think it was simply the stimulation of these other factors that         was causing the rat neurons?          DR. GEARHART:   Right. That is a good question.         We still don't know -- I mean, to be honest with you -- what the mechanism         of recovery here is. We know that sitting in the ventral horns of these         animals, and where these big neutrons reside, you now have a mosaic population         of host cells, of neurons, inner-neutrons.         I mean, we all -- I mean, human and rat, or human and mouse, depending         on which one we did. We don't know the relative contributions. We can         count cells, but really what is the functional basis of what occurred         there.         We know that the human cells are also rescuing the other, but to what         degree. This is where the hard work comes in. What was the mechanism,         and what really went on or is going on in that ventral horn.         I can tell you in work that John McDonald has done at Wash U, in which         they generate a contusion injury in the spinal cord of a mouse or a rat,         and then infuse in mouse embryonic stem cell derivatives, and that he         is faced with the same issue. He can see that these animals recover to         a certain degree, but the mechanism of what is it, of what has really         occurred there, is not known.         And I think what we are going to find is a demand that we come up with         mechanism in some of these animal models so that we can completely understand         what that therapy is going to be if you take it to a human.         And this is going to require a lot of work. Now, some of it you could         argue is that you could do it all within animal studies. You know, mouse         embryonic stem cells, and you don't have to put the human in.         But I think we are finding enough differences between species that it         would warrant at least the study also of the human derived cells in the         same paradigms to ask those questions.          PROF. FUKUYAMA:   But I am just curious.         Are you getting actual tissues in which you have cells from different         species that are growing simultaneously?          DR. GEARHART:  Oh, yes, absolutely. Yes, sitting         in the same -- well, you can see in the section here that might be 15         or 20 microns across, you see a mixture of the rat cells or mouse cells,         and human cells, functioning.         You know -- I mean, this isn't uncommon. We do interspecific grafts         a lot in experimental things, and the question is when you do it, and         we see, you know, human cells growing in animals very nicely. I mean,         as long as there is immunosuppression and things like this occurring.          PROF. FUKUYAMA:  But could you go the other         way, also injecting stem cells from other species into human beings?          DR. GEARHART:  Oh, yes. I mean, this is one         of the issues with xenografts. You know, is this something -- well, there         is a report recently about chicken embryonic stem cells, and the fact         that people who had derived these were promoting the use in humans.         Pig stem cells, you know, et cetera, and so it can be done, but a couple         of issues, and one of them is the issue of the xenograft itself, of bringing         in endogenous viruses, and is this a wise thing to do.         And the other thing that I would ask you, and I won't be flippant about         it, is to say that if you -- and one of the concerns that we have that         maybe this council and others would take up, is long term in a neurologic         sense.         If you are putting stem cells in, and you are putting them in between         different human beings, what are you doing to that individual. And I would         say to you that if you have a stroke, and someone comes along and says,         well, we have pig, cow, mouse, human, take your pick, what would you select.         I am not being flippant about it, but I am just saying that I think         that we know that human would be preferable at this point in time.          CHAIRMAN KASS:  Could I ask a question, and just         for clarification again also on your own experiment that you showed us.         You said that some of the rats were immunosuppressed and some were not.         Is that correct?          DR. GEARHART:  Yes.          CHAIRMAN KASS:  And were there functional differences         in the results between those two groups, and would that bear upon the         question of whether or not the major effect was owing to the action of         the human cells, or a stipulation of the endogenous cells?         And lastly, if these animals had come to post-mortem was there a difference?         Was there rejection in the non-immunosuppressed animals of the human cells?          DR. GEARHART:  It is important to keep in mind         the time frame that these experiments are done in. They are of very short         duration relatively speaking, in a period of several months maximum.         In experiments that have been done in our laboratory, principally by         Mike Shamblott, in taking human cells and grafting, and these are insulin-producing         cells, and we have done it in a variety of tissues into rodents, you always         see reactive cells, which means that you are eliciting an immune response.         Again, they are short term, and whether you are getting destruction,         we see cellular debris, and we see this kind of stuff at these sites.         I should tell you a little bit that may be enlightening.         When you do grafts like this, if we say we are putting in 300,000 cells         or we are microinjecting in a lot of these cells, many of these cells         will die at the time of injection, simply because you have taken them         out of one environment and you put them into another, and you see a tremendous         amount of cell death.         Very few of these populations of cells continue to divide. In other         words, it may undergo one more round of division, and they sit there.         You do see when you come in finally to look at where is the human versus         where is the rodent, and you use your human markers. You invariably find         a group of cells that you can't phenotype, if you know what I mean, and         to say what has happened here, and clearly there are cells being destroyed.          CHAIRMAN KASS:  Fused?          DR. GEARHART:  Well, we don't know that. And         one of the arguments for many years has been that the central nervous         system is an immune privileged site. I don't think anymore that this is         something that is believed or subscribed to, and if you have the option         of immunosuppression, or of getting around that, that that would be preferred.         And particularly when you are talking about a graft going into a human         being that may be there for 20 years, as opposed to a matter of a few         months. So I think that this is going to remain a major issue, and there         is no question about it.          CHAIRMAN KASS:  Thank you very much. Bill Hurlbut         and then Paul McHugh          DR. HURLBUT:  John, I hear you saying that         we should pursue all lines of research, but I want to weigh the different         options here and pursue the question of if the lines were restricted what         would be gained or lost.         Specifically, I have several questions that hinge each on the other.         First of all, the cells that were implanted or tested for their tumorigenicity         effect that you spoke of in your paper were the so-called EBDs.         Were those derived only from embryonic germ cells; is that what is implied         there?          DR. GEARHART:  Yes. In our paper, we took the         stem cell itself and plated it out in a variety of culture conditions,         some of which are designed to enhance or select for certain types of differentiation.         And we referred to these as embryoid body-derived cells. They came out         of this little cluster, and in our field it is essential that we take         the stem cell off the dish, and let it form into a little ball, and which         is just a multi-cellular structure, called an embryoid body.         Now, this was an unfortunate name that was given to it by a French pathologist         back in the '30s, but as you can imagine, when someone in a political         sense talks about an embryoid body, they conjure up embryos here.         But these are little clusters of cells, and within those or within that         cluster, the beginning of differentiation begins. These cell-cell interactions         are essential for this. We have not been able to mimic this in a sheep         yet.         So what happens is you get within that ball a variety of cell types         being formed, and all that you want to do is to disassociate that ball         after a period of time, and select out only those that are going in the         direction that you want them to go in.         So this is what we did in that experiment, and so we have now these         EBD lines, and in these lines, in these human lines, and these lines have         been placed in a large number of animals, in the grafts that we have used,         we have never seen a tumor up to this point.         And it may be unique to humans, because human primary cultures are easy         to establish and mouse aren't. I mean, there is an issue here that we         don't know that you can't do the same experiment in the mouse.         So with our experience with the EBDs, we have never seen a tumor. Our         experience in the mouse and using what we thought were equivalent lines,         we have seen too many tumors with respect to grafts into the central nervous         system.          DR. HURLBUT:  Just parenthetically haven't         I been reading all along that embryoid bodies are also formed from ES         cells?          DR. GEARHART:  Oh, yes, absolutely.          DR. HURLBUT:  But the point is that your particular         lines don't produce tumors, and the ones derived from the primordial germ         cells don't seem to produce tumors; whereas, the embryonic stem cell lines         do?          DR. GEARHART:  Well, the only comparison that         we have at this point are mouse ES lines, in which we have derived different         types of precursors under different conditions, have been compared to         human EG lines that have been derived, or which precursors have been derived         in a slightly different manner.         You can't derive them both in the same way. We have seen nothing up         to this point on human ES derived lines transplanted. We just have not         seen any data on that.         So I don't want to make it clear that there is a difference between         the derivation either from a germ cell derived, or an inner-cell mass         derived line. Does that make sense? That comparison is not there yet.          DR. HURLBUT:  Well, obviously what I have been         getting at here is if in fact your cell lines are less likely to cause         tumors, then does that imply that there might be some advantage to using         your cell lines, and if so, would it in fact be the greatest advantage         if a patient's own cell line could be derived from primordial germ cells?          DR. GEARHART:  Oh, boy, this committee would         -- well, wow. Now, think what this means. It means that you would be generating         an embryo, and having it implanted. Now, what you don't know is that our         fetal tissue comes from 5-to-9 weeks post-fertilization. These are therapeutic         abortions.         And which means now that you are way beyond -- I mean, the point of         where a blastocyst is, and obviously way beyond I think anyone subscribing         to that approach.          DR. HURLBUT:  You told us that in your paper.          DR. GEARHART:  Okay.          DR. HURLBUT:  But is it true that maybe there         would be some great advantage if we could find a legitimate way to harvest         tissues generated from a specific patient at a later date?          DR. GEARHART:  Right. Well, I think it would         be terribly risky. We have been asked this question a lot though; is it         possible to do a biopsy on a developing embryo, and to remove just a few         germ cells.         I think at the stage that we are using these embryos are a matter of         -- or fetuses are a matter of maybe 6 or 7 millimeters in length, and         to do the surgery on this I think would just be impossible without causing         harm.         The other issue that I would contend is do you think it would be okay         to go in and remove the germ cells from an embryo and let that individual         go on and say, well, we have taken your germ cells. Now, we have another         therapy for you.         And so I don't think it is a very good thing to do.          DR. HURLBUT:  And that is my final point, and         I wanted to ask you personally in working with these cells, do you see         14 days as some kind of magic marker moment?         Do you see something crucial about implantation? And you spoke of keeping         all options open.          DR. GEARHART:  Right.          DR. HURLBUT:  Why in fact do we allow abortion         fairly late in term, and yet now we are speaking as 14 days as the sacred         moment? I know that I am opening a very difficult issue here.         But in fact wouldn't we gain a lot scientifically from extending that         14 day limit potentially if we could find a culture median that could         sustain the embryo, or wouldn't we gain a lot from implanting, even gestating         and harvesting?         And why do we feel that we shouldn't do those things? And I would also         be interested in your personal response to these ethical issues.          DR. GEARHART:  Wow, you have asked a lot. As         you know, stem cells have been obtained from many stages of human fetal         development, and have been found to be useful in generating various cell         types in culture.         And if we look at a variety of studies, you can find it in the published         literature. We have had a number of requests for fetal tissue at different         stages, and I think legitimate requests of investigators willing to investigate         cell lineages, et cetera, within the embryo.         So people have been thinking about it. I mean, there is no question         about that. We have found it difficult enough to be fortunate enough to         obtain the fetal tissue that we work with.         I mean, there is a consenting process and we have nothing really to         do with other than to make sure that it complies with institutional, Federal,         and State law.         To obtain viable tissue from abortuses of any kind is a major concern.         When we started our studies, we looked into using spontaneously aborted         material, which occurs across the board, but mainly in the early stages.         And we thought that this would be a good source. As it turned out, by         the time that we were notified -- and this occurs in outlying hospitals,         and not at major medical centers, where investigators are -- you know,         a patient presents with a miscarriage, and it is taken care of in the         ER.         And it turned out that it was very ineffective, number one. And, number         two, and then I will get back to your question, we found that most of         the material that did come to us had chromosomal abnormalities that made         it less desirable for use.         Now, the issue of the 14 days, and what does it mean. Well, this was         something that really came into play in the United Kingdom when they were         trying to deal with this issue.         And it was decided at that point that at that stage the embryo still         does not have a central nervous system. It can feel no pain, et cetera.         And this was why basically that period of time was set to be able to grow         them in culture, or to remove tissue.         We, as embryologists, argue the point all the time as to what is going         on in these early stages, and we were always asked these questions. When         do you believe personhood occurs and when is it established, and things         like this.         To me that is not a biologic question. We don't have a means of probing         that. So I think that is why the 14 days was selected, and that's why         it is sort of adhered to in a sense.         Do I adhere to that? Well, to a certain degree, no. We take material         that is later on, and it is cadaveric fetal tissue. I think that we should         be able to utilize any tissue that comes out of abortion if the alternative         is that it is just going to be disposed of, which is what happens.         The pathologist takes a look at it to make sure that all of the parts         are accounted for, and there is an issue about being concerned about what         is left in the uterus.         That is my personal opinion on that. But I don't think that we should         be going and establishing pregnancies, and to downstream then utilize         that tissue.         I mean, to then stop the pregnancy and then to recover it. I mean, that         is my personal opinion. I don't think we should be doing that. As you         know, years ago, President Reagan was faced with this, I believe, when         he heard that families were establishing pregnancies so that regions of         the brain could be harvested to treat Parkinson's disease in the family.         And clearly we don't subscribe to that in any fashion.          CHAIRMAN KASS:  Thank you. We are coming up to the         break and I have Paul McHugh, Mike Gazzaniga, and we are running a little         late because we started a little late. We will take a break shortly. Paul         and then Mike.          DR. MCHUGH:  My point is very brief, John,         because you have touched upon it in several places. But first of all,         I want to thank you very much for that coherent presentation, and I especially         thank you for showing us experimental data.         And that is what of course generates better questions to ask you. And         it is really out of that experimental work that I did have a question.         And that is what you showed us was fundamentally a xenograftic experiment         using human tissue, human cells, in rats.         And the results were very interesting, and not only was there growth         of cells, but you told us that there were trophic factors that were probably         acting in this way.         And I then wondered, and you can answer this, why was it necessary to         use human cells to demonstrate this phenomenon in a rat, and why weren't         you using rat cells to do rat experiments.         And if that is true, that you could do rat cells to do rat things and         the like, the development of the question is would it not be wise of us         to ask you all to go back and work with your rats and your mice, and your         cats and your sheep, and keep going at it, and come back and tell us why         you need human stuff to do this stuff, okay?          DR. GEARHART:  Okay. We did it first with mouse         cells. We don't have rat embryonic stem cells. We did it first with the         mouse and it worked.         And in our exuberance, saying, well, would the human cells work, and         they did. There is no question that I think that the mouse cells worked         better, and the mouse cells were from these neural precursors that we         had obtained that I had mentioned that we had this concern about tumors.         But they did work, and so the only two cell types that we have found         at this point that work have very similar origins if you know what I mean.         Clearly the paradigm has to be extended to other sources of stem cells,         adult and umbilical, and this is planned to say in this particular paradigm         will it work.         So, Paul, the answer is that we did it first with the rodent cells,         and we could pursue that. I mean, as far as looking for the growth factors         and what not.         But we have changed almost completely to the human cells for trying         to determine what those growth factors were that were secreted, but we         could do that again with the mouse, absolutely.          CHAIRMAN KASS:  Mike.          DR. GAZZANIGA:  Just briefly, thank you again         for a wonderful presentation. This moves to another level, and that is         how big is the American biomedical engine.         And I ask that from the sense of having just taken a trip to China and         Japan, and England, and you read that Sweden and Singapore, and India,         and so forth, are going ahead.         If America dropped out of this for legal reasons that are on the horizon,         how big an impact would that have on the overall resolution and development         of these therapies?         In other words, if you just look across molecular genetics and microbiology         now, and prior to this issue arising, what is the size and importance         of the American effort?          DR. GEARHART:  Well, I don't think that there         is any question that the investigators funded through the National Institutes         of Health, and our academic establishments here, are the engine that drives         biologic research, biomedical research, in the world.         There is no question about it. I mean, the volume, the sheer volume         of this, is enormous. And if you look at this compared to even in our         country to what the biomedical industry, or I mean the private industry         is putting into this, it is dwarfed by the Federal funding.         And this is really what is enabling and this is why I think the U.S.         has been so far ahead. So it is essential I think to have Federal funding         into this area really to reach our goals as quickly as possible.         There is one last thing or one thing that I would like to say to the         committee, and it is understandable, but when you are in and start in         a business like this, you don't know the impact of it.         The thousands of communications that we have received from patients,         and patient-based groups, about our work and about moving the work along,         not only is it emotional, it is unbelievable. I mean, from the standpoint         of just pure numbers, sheer numbers.         It doesn't just extend within the United States, but throughout the         world. In 1998 when we published our paper, within a few days we had 10,000         e-mails alone about it.         And every day I still get hundreds of e-mails relating to this. It extends         not only to bona fide -- you know, many people don't understand what this         work is about.         They are contacting you for a brain, or a uterus, or from some countries         we have had requests, hundreds of requests for penises, for example. And         you are trying to figure out why -- you know, what is the issue here.         We need education and we need informing to say that we are dealing really         with cells and tissues at this point. That is what we are really about.         It is going to be years away before it goes beyond that.         And so what I am trying to say is that there are requests throughout         the world. So that is one issue. I mean, the pressure is enormous, and         also people offering you large sums of money to provide them with cells         outside of the arena that it should be done in. Do you know what I mean?         There is desperation, and you see this, and it is tragic, and as a researcher         this is new to you. This is something that you are not accustomed to and         never will be accustomed to handling.         So I just wanted to let you know what that pressure is like. It is enormous.         I have boxes full of these things. I don't know what I am going to do         with them, but you try to respond.         There has been an issue with brain drain. We know that there has been         one investigator from the University of California system that went to         the U.K. and received one-and-a-half million pounds to pursue this work         in the U.K.         Well, this happened here. I will tell you that -- and I am talking to         students in our own group, you know, go to Europe for your post-doc, and         go to England for your post-doc if you want to continue in this thing.         And I think you will see more of this, and whether major investigators         will leave, I don't think so. I think we will get through this, and I         hope that we will get through this period in this country.         There are many, many investigators, many investigators, and I can't         tell you what it is like not to be able to give a cell to the person next         door to you because of a policy.         I mean, this is just an incredible situation. I think we will get through         it, and I think we will be okay. But I am still concerned about it. Sorry         for the editorial, but I think it is important.          CHAIRMAN KASS:  Charles, did you want a quick word?          DR. KRAUTHAMMER : If I could just ask a very         quick question. You said that you would oppose and you supported the opposition         of creating a fetus for, say, harvesting the brain cells, and you talked         about the example in the Reagan years.         On the other hand, there is no difficulty, at least in your estimation,         of using tissue from a discarded fetus already aborted, and tissue which         would otherwise be thrown away.         Would you apply that same distinction to the embryonic stage? In other         words, you now use -- you develop embryonic stem cells from discarded         embryos from IVF clinics, and would you be equally opposed to the creation         of embryos specifically for their use as sources of embryos using that         same analogy?          DR. GEARHART:  No, I would not be opposed to         that. I don't give the same moral status to that entity.          CHAIRMAN KASS:  Well, we have -- let me just make         mention of one matter. Janet Rowley has submitted in writing, and I would         endorse, these questions if we had enough time.         We would like your comments on what kind of regulation you think might         be or should be developed for this area, and what is the status of government         support for what kind of research, and what are the limitations that are         counterproductive.         If we could invite -- if you would be willing, and these are hard questions         and they are big questions, but if you would be willing to respond if         we put these set of questions to you, and perhaps some others to you in         a letter?          DR. GEARHART:  Absolutely.          CHAIRMAN KASS:  I think the committee would be very         grateful for your help in thinking through the regulatory questions, which         are at the moment not what we have here.          DR. GEARHART:  Absolutely.          CHAIRMAN KASS:  I just want to thank you very, very         much, for an instructive morning, and also for the wonderful spirit in         which you presented your remarks and engaged the questions. I am very         grateful to you for coming.         We are running about 15 minutes behind, and we will reconvene at a quarter-of.         We have an hour-and-a-half for the second session this morning as originally         planned.

A very special welcome to Jim Wilson who rejoins us after         successfully completing several months of medical treatment.  He has         escaped from the leeches in better shape than before.                         (Laughter.)                        CHAIRMAN KASS:   Welcome, too, to the members                of the public.                    I note the presence of Dean Clancy, the Designated Federal         Officer, in whose presence this is a legal meeting.                         Jim has asked for a moment to address the Council.                          PROF. WILSON:   I simply wanted to apologize for my long         absence.  I did not realize during my absence that Leon, in the spirit         of kindness to which he is so disposed, had not revealed the reason,         but I had to be at home for 90 consecutive days.                       Ninety consecutive days are over.  I'm fine, and I'm back                to join you as mean-spirited as ever.                   Thank you.                         (Laughter.)                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   That's why I have him close.                         The agenda for this meeting, as you  know, the bulk of this         meeting will be devoted to biotechnology and public policy and our         project to assess the current state of regulation of the technologies         that touch the beginnings of human life with panels this afternoon from         a variety of stakeholders and their representatives and tomorrow         morning with a discussion of the discussion document that the council         commissioned the staff to prepare.                         The first session this morning is separate and is a         continuation of our efforts to fulfill the charge to monitor stem cell         research.  The topic of stem cell research will be the heart of the         July meeting.  We have commissioned five or six scientific review         papers from leading researchers to review the work in stem cell         research, embryonic and adult, that has taken place since August of         2001.                         We also have commissioned an ethics review paper and a         paper that will review relevant legislation, federal and state, that         has been enacted since that time.                         Today, in advance of that meeting, we are trying to inform         ourselves about one crucial challenge to the possible therapeutic uses         of stem cells and their derivatives, the problem of immune rejection.          This, as many of you know, is an area of intense research activity, not         just of stem cells but across the board in transplantation of solid         organs.                         And we are very fortunate to have with us as our guest this         morning Dr. Sylviu Itescu, who is Associate Professor of Medicine in         the Cardiology Division at the Columbia University College of         Physicians and Surgeons and also the Director of Transplantation         immunology at Columbia Presbyterian hospital of the College of         Physicians and Surgeons.                         Dr. Itescu's curriculum vitae is at your place, and the         paper that he has submitted, I think, was delivered to you at your         hotel rooms, and it is, as he acknowledges, a technical paper, but one         I think that will, in addition to the discussion that he's now         going to lead us through, will help us a lot, I think, in thinking         through this particular crucial problem in the area of stem cell         research and regenerative medicine.                         Dr. Itescu, thank you very much for your paper, for your         presence, and we look forward to hearing from you.                                 Session 1: Stem Cells and Regenerative                Medicine:                 Overcoming Immune Rejection                      PROF. ITESCU:   Dr. Kass and council members, I want to         thank you very much for having me at this session.                         I would again like to apologize for the technical nature of         the paper, but please I would really appreciate if anybody has any         questions as we go through even from my slide presentation, just feel         free to interrupt and ask questions freely, and I'll be delighted         to explain in more detail.                         The objectives, I think, are twofold.  Firstly, what         I'd like to do is to give you an overview of the current state of         knowledge and clinical practice in terms of the basic immunobiology of         organ transplantation and methods by which we currently immunosuppress         patients and prevent organ transplant rejection.                         And secondly, I think the objective is to gain an         understanding of those issues as they may relate to the subsequent use         of stem cells for organ regeneration or for tissue regeneration, and so         that you understand the fundamental issues that will be faced by         physicians trying to manipulate or to use stem cells for those type of         strategies.                         But I think of even more interest, towards the end of the         presentation by  understanding the obstacles to accepting a foreign         organ, there are some interesting new concepts and data that have         arisen regarding the use of stem cells to alleviate some of these         issues that I would like to really open up for discussion at the end of         the presentation.                         I'm not sure how to switch the projector on actually.          It may require a  —  okay.                         What this slide shows is that despite the fact that the         number of patients on our transplant waiting lists continue to         exponentially grow year by year by year, what you can see is that there         continues to be a major limitation in the supply of organs.                         In yellow you see the living related donors have remained         minimally pretty  much the same over the years and, more important, the         cadaveric donors have remained the same.  So we have a real problem in         terms of shortage of donors.                         And it is the same for the previous levels for renal         transplantation, and this slide shows the same for heart         transplantation.  Significantly increased numbers of patients were on         the transplant waiting lists.                         And what this results in is a significant increase or         significant rate of mortality of patients who otherwise could be saved         if they had an appropriate organ donor.                         And what you see for kidney transplant patients who are on         the waiting list, the mortality now is fairly low, five percent,         despite a very long waiting time, and that is because we have dialysis         as a modality to keep patients alive.                         In contrast, until the last couple of years, you can see         that for the heart transplant patients on that waiting list, mortality         was as high as 30 to 31 percent, and that is because we didn't have         until very recently any way of keeping patients alive who were waiting         for a heart transplant.                         More recently, over the past couple of years, there's         been quite a significant new development, and that is the development         of left ventricular resist devices.  You can see these type of         artificial devices that are essentially the equivalent for a patient on         a heart transplant waiting list to what is dialysis for a kidney         transplant patient.                         This is an artificial pump that takes over the function of         the left ventricle and keeps the patient alive while we find an organ         donor for the patient.  And this has now brought the mortality rate on         the transplant waiting list back down to almost zero, quite a major         achievement.                         Nevertheless, there are few ways by which we can increase         the ability to have donors.  One is the use of live donor organs.  The         pros of using live donor organs are that they are superior in terms of         outcome to cadaveric.  The costs are much less than cadaveric, and         there are psychological benefits in terms of donor/recipient issues.                       The risks.  There are some small risks to the donor in terms of morbidity                and mortality, inconvenience, and obviously the overall decision                is a voluntary one for the donor.                   The short and long-term risks of a living, related or         unrelated and living donor donation for a kidney, there's a very         small risk of death primarily related to pulmonary emboli.  There are         some major complications that could be seen primarily related to the         surgical procedure.  Approximately one to two percent of donors will         have some degree of clinical complication.                         The long-term risk is pretty low to the donor.  However,         the survival of a living related organ transplant is significantly         superior to a cadaveric organ donor.  You can see that in a kidney         transplant, the living related organ significantly survives for a         significantly greater period than cadaveric organ.                         And interestingly, even a living unrelated donor, in blue,         has a better outcome than a cadaveric donor, and what I wanted to         emphasize here is that a living unrelated donor is typically a spouse,         where genetically completely disparate between the husband and wife.          Nevertheless, the outcome is almost the same as a partially matched         sibling related graft donor.                         The reason for this probably is the fact that you can         prepare the spouse well in advance.  The whole procedure is done in a         convenient way, timed appropriately, with minimal risk to the donor.          But the outcome is significantly superior to cadaveric.  That's         really the point of this.                         And what you can see, there's a change in distribution         in the U.S. in terms of living donors, particularly in terms of spouses         who are now providing organs to their spouse in need, as well as         actually unrelated donors who are now donating organs to unrelated         recipients.                         In contrast to that, you can see that family related         donation has pretty much remained unchanged of these.                         Okay.  I'd like to move on to some of the immunologic         issues that primarily a cadaveric or unrelated donor recipient pair         will undergo when an organ is transplanted.  The primary difference         between individuals is at the level of a certain complex called the HLA         complex or the MHC complex.  We're talking about genes that         incurred a protein on the surface of all of our cells that are called         HLA genes.                         HLA genes or HLA molecules, two types, Class I and Class         II, and these Class I and Class II molecules you can see in blue are         two-chained molecules that serve to present a foreign protein or         antigen to our own T cells so that they can be recognized as foreign         and rejected or removed from the circulation.                         This is the fundamental basis of how our immune system will         recognize bacteria or viruses and eliminate them from our circulation,         and typically what happens is that if this a virus  —  consider this to         be a virus  —  taken up by these cells which are called antigen         presenting cells, but otherwise known as macrophages, the virus is         taken up in a vesicle.  It's then broken down into little pieces or         little peptides, and the peptide in yellow is then assembled in the         cytoplasm of the cell together with an HLA molecule in blue, and the         complex of a piece of the virus plus the HLA molecule is then shuttled         up to the cell's surface, and as a complex is presented to this         structure over here, which is called the T cell receptor on the surface         of the T cell.                         Typically this is a CD-4 helper T cell, but the key issue         is that this T cell receptor structure recognizes a three dimensional         structure between the peptide antigen and the HLA molecule, and the         whole thing activates a whole pathway in the T cell that then results         in removal of the whole invading antigen or invading virus or         bacterium.                         And this is a typical immune recognition reaction that         occurs throughout life, throughout our blood systems and, you know,          our immune organs.  You can imagine, therefore, if this now becomes a         foreign organ, the HLA molecule on the surface of this foreign cell         will be viewed as totally different from all of the HLA molecules of a         given individual by our own T cell receptor.  It will no longer.  It         will no longer be seen as a non-molecule.  It will be seen as foreign.                         And the fact that the HLA molecules on a foreign cell, this         structure itself is different from the HLA molecules of a given         individual always will trigger a reaction as though this whole         structure was a foreign structure.                          What I have just outlined to you is actually a very complex         immunological phenomenon.  So if anyone has any questions, I'm sure         this is not a straightforward issue to understand, but please, just         feel free to ask.                         Can we just focus that a little bit?                         Okay.  So with the notion that if this is now the  —          consider this to be the foreign cell from the foreign organ that has         been transplanted.  Understanding that the MHC or the HLA molecule on         the surface of this cell is totally foreign to the recipient, it can         trigger two types of an immune response.  It can trigger what's         called a direct immune response and an indirect immune response.                         The direct immune response is when the foreign HLA molecule         as a total structure is seen as foreign by the T cell receptor of the         recipient T cell.  So under normal circumstances, as I've mentioned         to you, the T cell receptor will recognize a little peptide that should         be here, not the HLA, just the peptide.                         In this scenario, the T cell receptor recognizes the whole         HLA as a foreign piece, and so this is called direct recognition, and         it allows the immune system to be activated and attack this cell         entirely.                         A second process of immune recognition, the indirect         process, is one where this HLA molecule is internalized in the cell of         origin, and a little piece is secreted, and you see there is the little         piece of the foreign HLA molecule, and it's just this little piece         that then comes up.                         And this cell now is the recipient cell, if you can         imagine.  It's the recipient antigen presenting cell.  And so this         little yellow piece, which is a component of the original foreign HLA,         is now presented as an antigen by our own HLA molecule.                       And so this recognition is the more classic form of immune recognition                the same as you would recognize a virus or a bacterium.  You not                only recognize a little piece of this entire structure, and this                is called an indirect allorecognition.  But it's two different                types of recognition directed at the foreign HLA molecule of the                donor.  Both of them drive the immune response against the donor                graft.                   This is the basis actually of an immune assay called tissue         typing or mixed lymphocyte reaction, which allows us to test how         different the HLA molecules of one donor are in terms of recognition by         the HLA molecules of the recipient.                         And so what we typically do is take cells from a potential,         let's say, kidney allograft donor, and this really is done in terms         of selecting a potential living related donor.  We want to know really         how different is the potential donor to the potential recipient in         terms of those HLA molecules.                         So we'll take cells, blood cells, from a potential         donor.  We'll know the typical type of HLA molecules on the         surface.  We mix them with the HLA molecules or with the cells of the         potential recipient, and we look for the type of reaction.  We look to         see whether the recipient cells proliferate and become activated or         don't proliferate and don't become activated.                         And essentially the degree of proliferation and activation         is a measure of the difference between the HLA types on the surface of         the donor and on the surface of the recipient, and what you don't         want to be doing is transplanting a potential donor whose cells         stimulate very vigorously a proliferative response in the recipient         cells.                         Okay.  Now, in terms of once you have selected your donor         for living related, for example, based on as good a matching as you can         get at the HLA locus or for a cadaveric kidney transplant we also do         HLA typing.  We try to minimize the differences in HLA molecules         between donor recipient.                         For cardiac transplant actually we don't have the time         to do that.  In fact, for cardiac transplant recipients there is no HLA         matching.  We take whatever comes because of the severe shortage of         donors.                         But essentially once you've actually bitten the bullet         and you've accepted a particular donor, there's a variety of         types of rejections that can occur, and those are defined based on both         the immunobiology  of the type of reaction and the time taken  to         induce the rejection process.                         And there are at least four types of rejection processes         that I'd like to talk about.  One is called hyperacute.  One is         accelerated.  One is acute, and one is chronic, and as indicated,         hyperacute happens within minutes to hours, and the fundamental issue         here is that unbeknownst hopefully to the transplant physician, the         recipient had what we call pre-formed anti-donor antibodies in his         circulation, and as soon as the organ gets put in these, if you've         got this type of a serum, you will reject the organ immediately, within         minutes.  It is a horrendous outcome.                         So we always try to exclude the possibility that a given         recipient has antibodies that might destroy the organ, and we do         what's called a donor specific antibody cross-match prior to any         organ being transplanted.  This is both for kidneys, hearts, and lungs.                       Assuming that this doesn't occur, and I'll show you an                example of this in a minute, but assuming that this doesn't                occur because you've been diligent and have excluded this risk,                the typical type of rejection that would occur in the absence of                immunosuppression is an accelerated or an acute process which happens                within the first six to seven days primarily.                 And this is a result of either reactivation of T cells that have                previously been activated by some type of similar HLA, such as blood                transfusion or primary activation of T cells, that the natural process                by how the  T cells will recognize the foreign HLA, and it will                take them about seven days to recognize them, and you will get an                acute rejection process.                   And we understand that, and this is what we have tried         always to prevent by treating with a number of immunosuppressive drugs         at the same time.                         In addition to this, and while the patient always remains         at risk of recurrent episodes of acute rejection, there is another         process called chronic rejection of the graft which happens within         months to years, and we'll talk about that in more detail, that         causes a very complex and unclear, but this really is the major         limitation of long-term survival of the graft at this point in time.                       Just an example of what I was talking about in terms of the hyper                acute form of rejection.  If an individual has pre-formed antibodies                against the HLA of that particular donor, as soon as the blood comes                into contact with the foreign allograft or the foreign organ, those                antibodies will bind to the surface of the organ.  They'll recognize                the foreign HLA immediately and activate a whole complex that results                in a clot formation in the blood vessel and occlusion of the blood                vessels to the organ.                   This is what it looks like.  This is a classic hyperacute         rejection of the heart, where you can see swelling of the heart,         hemorrhage, and then within minutes the heart goes black and you've         lost the organ and the patient really is in extremis, and often dies in         surgery.                         So in this day and age, it's very rare to see that type         of hyperacute rejection, and we try to minimize the risk of that by         screening and doing a variety of assays.                         Assuming that you've gone through that first couple of         days, what happens is through those two processes I talked about,         indirect; so direct recognition of the foreign HLA and the indirect of         the HLA, the CD4 T cell, helper T cell is the orchestrator of the         immune response, is activated by the foreign HLA molecules.  The CD4         cells start to divide and proliferate, and they then help these cells         called CD8, or cytotoxic T cells, to become activated.  These are the         effectors of the rejection process.                       They also help B cells make antibodies, and the antibodies provide                a second barrage, second attack against the graft.  So these are                the two effector arms that cause the rejection process, particular                CD8 cytotoxic cells.  But the CD4 cells are the primary cells that                recognize the foreign HLA and orchestrate the whole process.                   And you might recall that CD4 cells, which are the primary         orchestrators of all immune responses, are also the targets of the HIV         virus.                         This slide is a little complex, but just to show you that         the cytotoxic CD8 cells that I mentioned ultimately destroy the graft         by secreting a variety of factors that punch holes in the graft and         cause it to leak and explode pretty much.                         We'll just keep going.                         Okay.  So that complexity in terms of cellular activation         has defined multiple targets for immunosuppression.  You can inhibit         the ability of the CD4 T cell to recognize the HLA molecule directly.          You can inhibit T cell activation and secretion of cytokines, and         we'll talk about that in a minute.                         The most important cytokine here is IL-2 because IL-2         activates the whole downstream pathway of CD8 cells and other T cells         that are important in the rejection process.  You can then try to         suppress activation of other T cells and B cells, and then we have         drugs at all of these points that synergistically will inhibit the         immune response.                         The axioms of immunosuppression, three major things to         think about.  You want to have an immunosuppressive effect of the drug         that you're giving.  You want to minimize the immunodeficient         complications obviously, and you want to minimize the non-immune         toxicity.                         And the best way to do these, to maximize the         immunosuppressive effect and minimize these two other issues is by         combining drugs that work at different sites of the immune response.                         And so you see, for example, if we only treat with one         agent, and cyclosporin is our example here, we have a fairly minimal,         specific immunomodulatory effect, and a fairly high range of         nonspecific or immunosuppressive effects.                         But if we now add two drugs working at two different sites         of action, we maximize or optimize our immunosuppressive effect at a         selective level, while minimizing our undesirable side effects, and         that's the rationale for combining immunosuppressive therapies.                         In addition to that, you want to use drugs that act on         different arms of the immune response and at different time points in a         synergistic fashion.  So all patients are routinely treated with         glucocorticosteroids, which are essentially nonspecific inhibitors of         most arms of the immune response, and they act very early to switch         everything off.                         Now, what you don't want is to continue to have to be         using high doses of steroids because they're associated with lots         of side effects, most notably global immunosuppression.  So you want to         use steroids early on and be able to switch the steroid usage off.                         We also now use cyclosporin or FK506.  These are related         agents.  These have made probably the biggest difference in the         transplant survival over the past 20 years by acting directly on T cell         activation to prevent IL2 and other cytokine production.                         And then there's a bunch of other drugs that alone or         in combination are  used to prevent the second stage of immune         activation, other cells, the recruitment of other cells, the         differentiation of other cells, and the prototype of this is         azathioprine.  Now the most commonly used drug in this group is MMF, or         mycophenolate mofetil.  And then there's a bunch of other         experimental approaches to prevent other aspects of the immune         response.                         What this slide shows you is the impact of cyclosporin on         allograft survival here in kidney transplant.  You can see that prior         to the early '80s  —  actually cyclosporine was introduced, I think,         around 1978, and you can see the difference in survival of kidney         allografts.  This is graft survival as opposed to patient.                         Patient survival is not the issue.  If the graft is         rejected, it dies, and the patient goes back on dialysis.  So what you         see here is in the late '70s, early '80s, our one-year graft         survival was as low as about 50 percent for kidney allograft.  It's         now much higher than this actually.  It's about 95 percent one year         survival, and it's the same for cardiac allografts.                         So this drug, when this drug came in, it revolutionized the         treatment of solid organ allografts, and the way it works, let me just         go very quickly.                         Cyclosporine binds a calcium activation factor in the         cytoplasm called calcineurin and turns on a whole cascade of events         that in the DNA and in the nucleus of the activated T cell inhibits the         ability to activate various genes of cytokine production, such as IL-2         and interferon gamma, which regulate immune cell divisions.                         If you don't make these cytokines, you do not get         immune cell division.  That seems to be a critical component of         preventing rejection.                         However, despite the fact that we understand this process         of immune activation and were able to prophylactically treat patients         and prevent acute episodes of rejection, we clearly have improved         short-term allograft survival.                         Despite all of that, there is a second process that kicks         in some time during the course of the recipient's life span, and         what you see is that, for example, with cardiac transplants over time,         over a five-year course, there's a cumulative loss of as much as 40         percent of the allografts in heart transplant patients.                         And with kidney transplants, this curve is pushed forward,         but you still have about a 50 percent loss of allografts at ten years.                         So the question is:  if we're able to reduce the         incidence of acute rejections, why are we still getting a limited         long-term survival of the graft itself?                         And the reason is this pathologic, unusual lesion that         happens in actually just about every graft that's  put in whether         the heart or the kidney or the lungs.  You get a lesion like this in         the blood vessels of the allograft.  It's very unusual.  It's         proliferating the lesion where you can see that the lumen of the blood         vessel is almost occluded by these proliferating cells.                         And this is in the heart.  This is called accelerative         transplant related vasculopathy.  In the kidney, this is, again, a         chronic vasculopathy.                         And the cause of this is not clear, but it probably is due         to  —  much of that, as I suggested, is due to an ongoing immune         response against the foreign HLA antigens, which are expressed here on         the luminal side of the blood vessel.                         And even though the patient is not experiencing major acute         episodes of cellular rejection, there is an ongoing subclinical level         of rejection process going on that damages and causes these vessels to         close off.                         The causes of this process really is multi-factorial, but         HLA, attack against the HLA of the donor continues to be the number one         cause of this.                       And you can see that chronic rejection — this is in our cardiac                transplant population at Columbia — chronic rejection accompanies                those patients who had many more episodes of acute rejection.  So                for every hit that you have, for every acute rejection episode that                you have, you'll destroy a little bit more of your heart, and                you're more likely to go on to get chronic rejection as opposed                to those individuals in blue who have less episodes of acute rejection.                              So fulminant episodes of acute rejection, even though you survive                them and your graft continues to work well and we can reverse them                will predispose to chronic rejection and even in the absence of                fulminant episodes of acute rejection, ongoing immune reactivity                against the donor HLA will also predispose you to chronic rejection.                                As you can see in this slide, these are patients who         actually have not had episodes of acute rejection over a number of         years, but make antibodies against the foreign HLA.  In yellow are the         kidney patients or heart patients.  Antibodies against the HLA         antibodies, in yellow the HLA of the donor, have a poorer outcome in         terms of developing graft failure.                         So even in the absence of acute episodes of rejection, an         immune response that results in anti-HLA reactivity causes graft loss,         and this shows the same.                         So what that means is that we need to be vigilant.  We need         to monitor the patients very closely.  We can't just expect that a         combination immunosuppressive regimen that is used initially is going         to keep all patients in check and all patients quiet.                         We have an active immunologic monitoring of particularly         our cardiac transplant recipients who are much more prone to having         rejection episodes, and we actively on a weekly basis measure         antibodies, T cell function.  We identify patients who are at high risk         of cellular rejection.  We have a whole algorithm that allows us to         study these patients on a weekly basis, and you can see that this         algorithm allows us to be very flexible and change the type of         therapies that we use so that if at a particular time point certain         test number one plus test number two in terms of immune activation         become positive, we know that we need to change our immunotherapy.                         In contrast, if these assays remain negative or perhaps         revert from a positive to a negative, we can reduce the type of         biopsies that we do.  Instead of doing a biopsy every 30 to 60 days, we         may reduce our biopsy frequency to every 90 days.                         And this is the type of dynamic approach that we use to         monitor our patients and to modify the type of immunosuppression         that's required.  It's not a static process.                         And I think what I'm trying to emphasize is that the         recipient's immune response continues to be a major obstacle in         terms of accepting and long-term survival of the graft.  And so since         these issues are so complex and so difficult, the Holy Grail really of         transplant immunobiologists has always been to try to induce a state of         transplantation tolerance, in other words, a permanent acceptance of         the graft that can allow the recipient ideally actually to not require         any type of immunosuppression.                         And the definition or criteria of transplantation tolerance         are outlined here:  specific immunologic unresponsiveness to         alloantigens, otherwise known as HLA antigens, of the donor, of the         graft, in the absence, total absence of continuous immunosuppression;         prevention of acute rejection and promulgation of graft survival;         acceptance of a second test graft on the same original donor strain  —          this is for experimental tolerance in animals  —  and the specificity is         then confirmed because the recipient will reject a third party graft.                         In other words, tolerance is defined as being absolutely         tolerant only to the organ that you've received or that you've         seen, but not tolerant to an unrelated donor.  This type of tolerance         has been extremely difficult, if at all possible, to detect or to         attain in humans, although many studies have suggested that perhaps a         term called microchimerism or chimerism may actually reflect a state of         tolerance in organ transplant recipients.                         And what chimerism relates to is the presence in your         circulating blood of at least five percent of your circulating cells         being of donor origin.  Whether that, in fact, really does induce         tolerance is really not clear, but the concept is that if five to ten         percent of your circulating blood pool comes from the donor,         essentially what's happened is that the passenger cells from the         graft that was placed into the recipient, the passenger cells left the         graft, circulated to the lymphoid organs, particularly the bone marrow         and the thymus, engrafted in the bone marrow and the thymus, and then         have maintained their own essentially self-renewal capability, and         continue to be shed and secreted into the circulation to essentially         make the recipient think that cells of that HLA type are the same as         oneself.                         Again, in experimental models, you need to attain at least         five to ten percent of your circulating cells being of donor origin in         order to have a so-called chimeric state that may reflect tolerance.                         And so what are the mechanisms by which tolerance might be         attained?  And again, all of this we're talking about now has not         been defined in humans, but is based on experimental models in both         small animals and larger primates.                         The mechanism includes clonal deletion, clonal anergy, and         perhaps development of regulatory cells that change the type of         cytokines that are produced.                         Clonal deletion refers to the ability of the thymus to         regulate the type of T cells that we produce that reject the organ.  In         other words, if we know that CD4 T cells in our blood recognize the HLA         of the donor, why are they not deleted or why are they not removed by         mechanisms in our body that can actually do that to our own T cells         that attack our own grafts?                         And so the function of the thymus is to actually remove         self-reactive T cells that we all have at various time points, and if         our thymus can remove our own autoreactive T cells, could we perhaps         induce our thymus to remove those T cells that are reactive to the         graft?                         And so this process of clonal deletion or how do you induce         clonal deletion is one mechanism by which tolerance might be attained.                         Clonal anergy does not involve the thymus.  Clonal anergy         is the same sort of concept:  can you remove those deleterious clones,         but this happens in the periphery, in lymph nodes, similar mechanisms         but in a different location.                         Regulatory cells that change your cytokine profile  —  let         me just go to the next slide  —  it's well known that the type of         cytokines that induce an acute rejection process, Interleukin 2 and         interferon gamma, and I've already mentioned that cyclosporin         primarily inhibits the production of these cytokines, but these         cytokines are made by certain types of T cells called TH-1 cells.  It         has been shown that if you can prevent the development of these TH-1         cells and instead skew the immune reactivity towards what's called         a TH-2 type of T cell that produces a totally different repertoire of         cytokines, this type of T cell preponderance and this type of cytokine         preponderance appears to switch off the immune response and allow         engraftment and allow a tolerogenic state.                         And this switching between a TH-1 and a TH-2 phenotype of         cells can be attained, again, by a variety of experimental approaches,         but if we can drive to this preponderance of cells, we might be able to         prevent allograft rejection.                         Other novel experimental approaches include inhibition of         co-stimulatory molecules on the surface of the graft.  We know that HLA         was  —  well, HLA is the primary antigen that drives the T cell immune         response.  There are other molecules on the graft that help         deactivation of the T cell, and these are called CD28 and CD40 ligand         at least.  There are many others as well.                         If you don't have molecules on the surface of the         graft, an HLA, foreign HLA molecule by itself may not necessarily         activate the T cell.  So there are ways of perhaps altering the graft         so that it doesn't express these co-stimulatory molecules, that may         induce a tolerogenic state.                         Other approaches include the use of MHC or HLA peptides         that can mimic the foreign HLA and bind to the T cell and switch it         off, and perhaps also induction of death, artificial induction of death         of the T cell that mediates rejection.                         Another molecule that's important in this pathway is         called Fas ligand that could be over expressed, again, by genetically         altering the organ, over expression of Fas ligand to kill the T cell         that recognizes Fas ligand instead of allowing it to become activated.                         These are all experimental approaches, none of which have         yet been proven in men.                         Let me just keep going.                         This is one approach that I would like to just touch on         very briefly.  Amongst the co-stimulatory molecules is the IL-2         receptor, IL-2 to IL-2 receptor, and you can see that if you don't         express a functional IL-1 receptor on your T cell, the T cell is not         able to then proliferate and become activated.                         So we said that cyclosporin is a very active drug by virtue         of the fact that IL-2 is inhibited.  However, how about if we can         inhibit the IL-2 receptor rather than inhibiting IL-2?                         And that has led to a strategy from a number of the large         pharmaceutical companies that have developed anti-IL-2 receptor         monoclonal antibodies, and here's an example of one where in         conjunction with other immunosuppressive agents you can see that it         delays the onset of kidney allograft rejection.                         However, what's interesting here is that as soon as the         antibody treatment is stopped at around day 180, you can see that the         rejection process starts to come together again.                         In other words, what this tells you is that this type of an         approach of an antibody to block a surface receptor that may be         considered important for the immune response does not lead to a         tolerogenic state.  It simply leads to an inhibition of the immune         system.                         Because when you stop that treatment, you should continue         to have an inability to reject the organ.  Because these rejection         rates come together, it means you have an induced tolerance.                         And so we get back to what I was just talking about, which         is can we artificially allow the thymus to delete cells that would         otherwise be alloreactive.  And the way we can do this experimentally         is to use a drug called cyclophosphamide.  It is yet another         immunosuppressive drug, but what this essentially does is it activates         a pathway in the thymus that causes T cells that would reject the organ         to explode or die through a process called apoptosis.                         And what you see here is that if we actually treat  —  this         is now in patients  —  if we treat patients with cyclophosphamide to         induce apoptosis in the thymus of alloreactive T cells, we inhibit the         rejection process very significantly relative to patients who are         treated with another combination of drugs.                         And so this is a major clue to the fact that the thymus can         be manipulated to enable a tolerogenic state to occur.                         And that leads to this.  This is really my last slide.          This leads to understanding a phenomenon that was described quite a         number of years ago in kidney transplant recipients where blood         transfusion that preceded the kidney allograft, and this is blood         transfusion of the same donor type infused peripherally prior to         actually putting the kidney transplant in, significantly prevented the         rejection of the organ.                         And this phenomenon has now been known for many years,         although it has been poorly explained.  Many variations of this have         now taken place in clinical practice, trying to define the cells that         most likely prevent allograft rejection.                         And we have moved from using whole blood because it's         very difficult to know exactly how many cells.  If you actually give         too many cells, you can actually induce an immune response.  You can         induce an accelerated rejection process.                         It seems to be very critically linked to how many blood         cells are actually transfused, which means that if we don't         understand which cells are doing this effect, you really haven't         got a handle on the process.                         So now people are looking at other subpopulations, and         since the whole field of stem cell transplants and bone marrow         transplants have moved along pretty dramatically over the past few         years, people have tried to now look at whether cells in the adult bone         marrow, particularly stem cells in the adult bone marrow, may have this         effect when transfused prior to an organ transplant.                         And what I'd like to just quickly do is to sort of         shift  —  that is my last slide  —  but I'd like to just quickly         shift into some aspects of my paper, which I think addressed the         current state of knowledge in terms of how cells from the bone marrow         or from other sources might actually do this sort of thing, induce a         tolerogenic state and prevent organ rejection.                         In order to  —  if we could just switch off the —  thank         you.                         In order to understand the type of tolerance that we're         talking about, we need to understand a little bit about the         characteristics, particularly the immunogenic characteristics of stem         cells, both embryonic and adult stem cells.                         Embryonic stem cells have been known for a number of years         in murine models and recently in human cell lines, but adult stem         cells, a population of adult stem cells has recently been described to         be present in the adult bone marrow that has many features and many         characteristics that seem to be shared with embryonic stem cells.                         So I'd like to sort of combine the discussion in terms         of the characteristic of both these cell types because they're         fairly similar.                         Both embryonic and adult mesenchymal type stem cells do not         express HLA Class I and Class II molecules and demonstrate reduced         surface expression of co-stimulatory molecules required for T cell         activation.                         When one transplants either embryonic stem cells or         mesenchymal stem cells from the adult, one finds long-term graft         survival of the cells despite the fact that these cells to acquire HLA         Class II antigens after  in vivo  differentiation.                         A striking recent observation of the mesenchymal stem cell         population has recently been noted that they broadly inhibit T cell         proliferation and activation by various types of antigenic stimuli,         including those from HLA of foreign donors.  Mesenchymal stem cells         have been shown to inhibit both naive and memory T cell responses, to         affect cell proliferation, and to reduce the number of interferon gamma         producing cells.                         And we actually know more about mesenchymal stem cells,         their ability to escape immune surveillance, than we do about embryonic         stem cells at this point in time, but nevertheless, there's some         information that both when they're transplanted are able to escape         immune surveillance.                         Extending the observations of donor derived blood         transfusions to induce a tolerogenic state.  Several groups have tried         to reproduce this type of an approach using embryonic derived stem         cells or mesenchymal stem cells.                         The two underlying mechanisms by which creation of a mixed         chimeric host results in tolerance as I've mentioned are, one,         thymic deletion of potentially donor specific alloreactive T cells and,         two, non-thymic peripheral mechanisms as we've mentioned.                         The theoretical advantages of either of these cell types is         that because they don't express HLA Class I or Class II, they might         be able to migrate to the thymus, might be able to reeducate the thymus         so that the thymus then thinks that these cells are part of its own         normal repertoire, and the thymus will then eliminate potentially those         type of T cells that could reject these type of cells.                       And, in fact, in experiments where either embryonic or mesenchymal                stem cells from the adult have been injected intravenously, we know                that long-term acceptance of these cells has been accompanied by                the presence of large numbers of these cells in the recipient thymus.                              And in a particularly interesting study using rat embryonic stem cells                recently, it was demonstrated that intravenous injection of rat                embryonic stem cells in the absence of any type of immunosuppression                resulted in long-term engraftment, as well as the thymus, and resulted                secondarily in the recipient rat being able to accept a cardiac                allograft of the exact same HLA type as the embryonic stem cells,                but not a cardiac allograft of an unrelated donor, which meets all                of the criteria of tolerance induction.                   In the only study to date using mesenchymal adult derived         stem cells, what we have been able to see is that a similar type of         long-term engraftment in the bone marrow in the thymus can be achieved         with adult mesenchymal stem cells, and I think it's reasonable to         anticipate that a similar experiment would likely also demonstrate,         although obviously it still has to be done, that the engraftment in the         thymus might lead to long-term tolerance and acceptance of a graft of         the same HLA type.                         So I think those type of experiments are very exciting and         raise the possibility that stem cells might have, by virtue of the fact         that they do not express high levels of HLA, and even when they are         induced to express HLA molecules, might have very special         characteristics that allow them to evade immune surveillance and, even         more importantly,  might actually allow them to re-educate the host to         accept a different type of donor tissue.                         And perhaps the hope would be the induction of tolerance         might actually obviate the need for all of the stuff that I just told         you about this morning, all of those complexities in terms of         immunosuppression.                         And I think I'll stop there.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you very much.                         Since my guess is that for at least the non-medical,         non-scientific members of the house, this was complicated.  Let me see         if I could try to formulate something of the nub of this and ask you to         elaborate.                         I think the large part, the preliminary part of the talk         indicates the enormous complexity of the immune system and the         difficulties of getting especially long-term graft survival and also         the need for long-term immunosuppressants, which have risks and harms         of their own.                         And the strategies for inducing tolerance have up until         this point tried to attack various parts of the host response,         immunological response.                         But if I understand the most exciting part of this, the         last part of this discussion, the suggestion seems to be that the use         of stem cells, mesenchymal or embryonic —  this is now the concept and         not the data — that such cells, first of all, to begin with lack the         HLA provocative antigens so that they are not themselves immediately         rejected;                         Second, that they can apparently take up residence in the         thymus and, if given from the same donor, if given from the individual         who is then to serve as the donor of a particular organ, that increases         the survival of a solid tissue donation from that person.                         Is that correct so far?                          PROF. ITESCU:   That would be one potential use of such         cells, yes.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   And let me draw out an implication for         regenerative medicine using stem cells or their derivatives.  Again,         just the concept now, not the evidence.                         The concept would be that because these are immunologically         unprovocative materials, original stem cells introduced into a patient         which presumably would take up residence in the thymus and perhaps, as         you suggest, re-educate the immune response even after the HLA antigens         appear in those cells; re-educate the immune response to no longer         regard those cells as foreign; might make the host now receptive to         even the introduction of differentiated cells derived from those stem         cell lines.  One could put in heart cells taken from these stem cell         lines and have them not seen as foreign.                         Am I understanding the concept correctly?                          PROF. ITESCU:   Yes, I think that's actually correct.          In fact, it's almost a beneficial aspect.  The stem cell that is         initially infused does not express HLA, takes residence in the thymus         in the absence of HLA expression, and then is induced to express HLA at         that site because it's the actual expression of the HLA molecule         that allows a re-education process and tolerance induction to that HLA.                         So that if it didn't express HLA at all, at any time         point, you would not develop tolerance to that HLA molecule.  So it         doesn't get rejected in the first instance because it doesn't         express HLA.  It enables engraftment in the thymus long enough to         up-regulate its HLA molecule, and then it re-educates the thymus to         accept that HLA molecule.                       So you can then come along with a differentiated tissue or organ                which now does express that same HLA and it will be de-rejected                it from the outset.  That's right.                    DR. KRAUTHAMMER:   So it essentially causes a change in the         immunological identity of the recipient.                          PROF. ITESCU:   And that's the concept of chimerism.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Right.  So it's a magic bullet if it         works.  Would be.                          PROF. ITESCU:   It would be, yeah.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Paul McHugh.                          DR. McHUGH:  That was a splendid presentation with very         exciting prospects in the future, and of course, the most exciting         prospect to any of us who have followed the transplantation business         from the time when — I was an intern at the Brigham in the 1950s.  So         I was there in the beginning —  is the possibility and the prayer of         xenotransplantation.                         But you know all about that.  Will this bring to bear the         possibility that we'll be able to use animal tissues ultimately for         transplantation of these vital organs and the use of animal stem cells         and, therefore, animal organs will spare us not only this problem you         have here of people in need and the lack of donors, but also much of         the ethical problems related to stem cells?                          PROF. ITESCU:   Well, my laboratory actually was very         heavily involved in trying to understand the rejection processes of         disparate xenografts, and we have tried to develop a variety of         immunologic strategies to try to overcome that.                         At this point in time I actually am much more hopeful that         regenerative medicine using adult stem cells is much closer to reality         than xenotransplantation for a number of reasons.                         Most importantly, I think, is the fact that the differences         between animals and humans is a wide array of antigens.  HLA is just         one antigen, and the fact that we're all so closely related as         humans is simply the fact that the only thing that differentiates us is         the HLA structure from individual to individual.                         However, between species not only is HLA different, but         there are many other structural genes, and I, frankly, am fairly         pessimistic actually that those differences are likely to be overcome         between species.                          So I would emphasize actually the human stem cell         regenerative possibilities rather than xenotransplantation.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Rebecca Dresser.                          PROF. DRESSER:   Two questions.  I was wondering how long it         takes for this re-education process of the immune system after the         first inducing of the stem cells.                         And the other question was exactly where is this in terms         of laboratory data theory, human data, animal data.  How much of this         is hope and how much of this is demonstrated?                          PROF. ITESCU:   Sure.  The chimerism concept all comes from         human data.  In other words, for many years people have looked at         whether donor cells continue to circulate in the recipient's blood         stream or organs, months, years, many years after a transplant.                         And so this concept that the recipients who do better are         those who have the higher percentage of donor cells circulating has         been around for many years, and it is data from humans.                         In terms of proving that that has anything to do with         tolerance, you have to go back now to the animal models.  The         experiments that I've outlined to you are actually recent         experiments in the last 12 months primarily using embryonic derived         stem cells where those embryonic cells were able to be engrafted from         one rat to another rat type, induced chimerism, induced tolerance to         those cells, and subsequently were able to induce a state of         nonresponsiveness to a heart transplant of the same donor.                         Now, the experiments with adult mesenchymal stem cells are         also within the past 12 to 24 months, and what we know about adult         mesenchymal stem cells is that if they're injected at a time of          in utero  —  the experiments that I was referring to where these         cells were injected  in utero  in developing fetuses — and those         cells can then engraft and survive for at least one to two years after         birth.  This is human cells actually in an animal model, and those         cells survive, are not rejected.  They're found in multiple organ         types, including the thymus.                         What we also have learned in the last 12 months is that         these same adult mesenchymal stem cells which do engraft  in         vitro  are able to actually inhibit immune responses from other         human T cells against themselves and also inhibit the immune responses         of other T cells against other antigens, including HLA antigens.                         So we have a lot of information  in vitro  that         mesenchymal adult stem cells are functional.  We know  in vivo          they're able to engraft in a similar way to the way that the         embryonic stem cells can engraft and not get rejected.                         And so the only experiment that's missing is that same         other experiment that has been done with the fetal cells, and that is         can actually induce a tolerogenic state to allow a solid organ graft to         be put in.                          PROF. DRESSER:   And how long does it take to induce that         state?                          PROF. ITESCU:   In small animal models, we are talking about         probably weeks.  To translate that to man, you know, is a guess, but I         would think weeks to months would be the objective.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Bill May.                          DR. MAY:   You said that adult stem cells from the bone         marrow may significantly reduce organ rejection, and later you said         adult stem cells have many characteristics shared with embryonic stem         cells.                         I'm interested in the policy implications of this.  Do         you feel that we should simply follow out, play out the line of         exploration with adult stem cells and delay explorations with embryonic         stem cells, or should we be following both tracks at the same time?                          PROF. ITESCU:   I think what we know at this point in time         about both cell populations, and again, what one calls a stem cell in         the bone marrow differs from experimental group to experimental group.          There are many types of stem cells in the adult bone marrow.                         But there are a number of well defined stem cells, and         I'd talk about mesenchymal stem cells.  There's another group         of perhaps an even earlier progenitor cell type to the mesenchymal stem         cell, but what I think most people will agree on is that the stem cells         defined in the adult bone marrow have many features that are similar to         true embryonic stem cells in terms of surface markers and in terms of         the way they behave, but there are some differences as well.                         So, in particular, what we know is that at this point in         time I think the adult stem cells probably do not have the same range         of differentiation capability that an embryonic stem cell does in terms         of their ability to become almost any organ in terms of         differentiation.                         Nonetheless, the differentiation capability of adult stem         cells at this point is quite remarkable.                         Secondly, the self-regenerating capacity, meaning how many         times can the cell continue to divide before it stops dividing, and         that's one of the fundamental features of any stem cell.  The more         division it can undergo, the more likely it is to then differentiate         and become a useful clinical entity.                         The self-renewal capacity of most of the adult stem cells         that have been defined to date probably it's fair to say are not         quite to the same degree as great as the self-renewal capability of an         embryonic stem cell.                         I would say at this point in time it remains an open         question as to whether these differences are at a clinical level, and I         think I would support continued research in both cell types to         understand (a) whether these differences are relevant; (b) whether the         diverse functional capability and range of differentiation exhibited by         the adult stem cell is sufficient in many cases.                         In the work that we're doing with respect to the         cardiovascular system and the heart, we have found that so far there         are certain stem cells that are terrific in terms of their ability to         improve cardiac function.                         So I would view these fields as overlapping and say that at         this point it's far too early to decide which field is going to be         the right way to go for every type of regeneration strategy that one is         looking for.                         But I think that there's enough hope in the adult stem         cell area that it may be sufficient to go down that path.  I would at         this point continue research in both areas.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Dan Foster.                          DR. FOSTER:   I have two questions in regard to possible         downstream effects that might be difficult, and the first question, I         presume that the injection of the stem cell of one sort or the other to         protect against the donor's solid organ transplantation would be         that the immune inhibition there would be, the tolerance there would be         restricted to the donor.  It would not, in other words, in your view         interfere with immune responses to infectious agents or anything else.          I presume that's correct, right?                        PROF. ITESCU:   The hope would be twofold.  To                call this tolerance, it would have to be a tolerogenic state induced                only against the inducing cell and antigen and a continued responsiveness                to any other antigen.  That would be the hope of the whole process.                 Otherwise you would have global immunosuppression.  That's right.                                 DR. FOSTER:   The second question is probably unimportant to         somebody who needs a heart or something of that sort, but if you're         look in simple terms at the immune system, it does two things.  It         fights off invaders, as you say, viruses and bacteria and so forth, and         it surveys for cancer.  I mean, so that in one sense anybody who gets a         cancer has had in some way a failure of the immune system to see the         oncogenic antigens and as a consequence not to delete it.                         I mean, a lot of people think that all of us are forming         cancers all the time, and that the failure is the immune system.                         I presume that there is at least a theoretical possibility         that since even donor tissues or other tissues might get a malignancy         that that might be impaired with the tolerant state that was there so         that you might be at risk for malignancy, even early malignancy.                         I mean in some ways tumor suppressor genes, you may get         very early things.  I think if I needed a heart I wouldn't worry         about that, but just in theory that might be something that we would         have to worry about even if there was not a defect against the one wing         of the immune system that fights off against infection, but might make         us vulnerable to the other thing that's devastating.                          PROF. ITESCU:   No, I think that's actually an excellent         point, and that's right.  So in other words, if a cell is so         primordial and so early that it confers some type of protection against         itself being rejected, it's also that same cell type that is so         plastic that it has the ability to differentiate into so many different         lineages that it also has a high rate of becoming cancerous.                         Typically the embryonic stem cells obviously have the high         risk potential for teratoma formation.  Again, if you then think about         the adult mesenchymal stem cell versus the embryonic stem cell,         there's a tradeoff between these two.  So the embryonic stem cell         is the most pluripotent, has the highest rate of proliferation and cell         divisions.  The mesenchymal stem cell has a slightly more         differentiated, let's say, than the embryonic stem cell.  So it has         a less likelihood of — it has less cell divisions left and maybe a         little bit more of a restricted differentiation pattern.                         But if you then take these two cell types and if they are         both able to induce a state of immune nonresponsiveness, the one         that's less likely to induce a neoplastic transformation, I think,         would be the adult mesenchymal stem cell.                         So from that point of view there would be a preference to         that versus the former.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Could I ask just a technical question?          This so-called re-education process that stem cells might induce in the         host thymus, could that process persist even if the mesenchymal cells         disappear?                         In other words, if the adult cells are not         self-perpetuating and, therefore, die out as a population, could a         short term residence in the thymus be sufficient to confer a long-term         tolerance for a subsequent graft?                          PROF. ITESCU:   Yes, I think so.  And examples of that are         many experiments in transplant immunobiology where people have directly         injected HLA molecules into the thymus using specific HLA molecules of         the subsequent donor organ to induce a state of immune         nonresponsiveness.                         The organ is then transplanted and long-term tolerance has         been achieved.  Presumably the injection of the HLA molecules resulted         only in a transient expression in the thymus.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you.                         Janet and then Michael Gazzaniga.                           DR. ROWLEY:   I wanted to ask several questions.  Going back         to the mesenchymal stem cells, I assume that they are a related type to         those that we heard about earlier from Catherine Verfaillie.  They may         not be quite as primitive as the ones she's been able to identify,         but it is the same lineage.                          PROF. ITESCU:   That's right.                           DR. ROWLEY:   Now, going on into the real world, and         let's say it's a kidney transplant, you would then get bone         marrow mesenchymal cells from the donor.  So it would be cultured to         identify the stem cells.  Those would be injected into the potential         recipient, and then at some point later you would take the kidney from         the donor and hope that you had induced tolerance.                          PROF. ITESCU:   Yes.  I think that's about right.  Now,         to be fair, you know, to try to do that in the setting of an acute         process, such as, for example, when we have a cardiac transplant donor,         we are talking about hours from the moment of identification to actual         transplantation.                         To be fair, I think in that type of scenario it would be         extremely difficult to then isolate bone marrow stem cells, purify,         inject, and hope to achieve tolerance all in the same space of time.                         I think this type of a strategy and approach is much more         amenable to living related transplants and would really increase the         survival and success of those type of transplants.                           DR. ROWLEY:   Part of the reason for pursuing this is to         show that this may be potentially useful in a subset of patients, but         as you just said, for cardiac transplants this approach is limited and         maybe not even be feasible.                          PROF. ITESCU:   Well, let me extend the thought.  If you         needed to use — at this point in time, I think, with known technology         of how to immunoselect and how to get hold of these cells, I think it         would be a little bit impractical in the situation of a cardiac         transplant patient.                         I think there is the possibility that you could potentially         use mesenchymal stem cells of an unrelated donor that could potentially         enhance the ability of the thymus to be nonresponsive at the time that         a graft was implanted and induce tolerance to that graft through         mechanisms other than simply the HLA molecules that the stem cell         itself expresses.                         Do you see what I'm saying?                           DR. ROWLEY:   Okay.  What occurs to me is why don't you         then get hyperactive response to those rather than suppression.                          PROF. ITESCU:   Well, for reasons that are unclear at this         point, stem cells do not seem to induce an active immune response to         themselves.  They seem to down-regulate immune responses to —                           DR. ROWLEY:   In general.                          PROF. ITESCU:   In general.                           DR. ROWLEY:   Right.                          PROF. ITESCU:   So there may be a possibility of the         potential of using unrelated stem cells plus a third party graft and         you induce tolerance to that particular graft, but not to another graft         because the immune system has seen only that graft in conjunction with         the stem cells that were infused.                           DR. ROWLEY:   Okay.  Now, but following on with this, I         guess in terms of the use of embryonic stem cells, unless it's in         this same context of a neutral or an unrelated stem cell affecting, in         a sense, general immune unresponsiveness, you're not going to take         an organ from the embryonic stem cells and transplant it into a donor         as you would with the adult stem cell scenario that we just pursued.                         So I guess I'm a little bit confused as to how you         foresee embryonic stem cells in the sense of organ transplantation or         is it in the example you just gave?                          PROF. ITESCU:   Yes.  The ideal scenario would be to have         mesenchymal stem cells obtained from the same donor where the organ is         coming from.  So I think in that type of combination, the embryonic         stem cells would have no role.  I think a second scenario would be         where stem cells of whatever source you want could potentially be used         as a local immunosuppressive agent for that particular organ that's         used at that time point.                         And, again, we're talking about a tolerogenic induction         to the HLA of that organ.                         A third possible use of stem cells in this way might be,         again, irrespective of whether you're talking about adult stem         cells or embryonic stem cells, to induce a state of tolerance by         injection of the cells followed by a more differentiated set of cells         for organ regeneration.                       So as a strategy to prevent rejection of stem cell derived tissue                regeneration.  So, for example, if we wanted to improve cardiac                function using adult stem cells and we would take, let's say,                adult mesenchymal stem cells, differentiate them  in vitro                 into cardiomyocytes, we would be concerned that if we took those                cardiomyocytes now and injected them directly into the heart they                might get rejected.                   So what we might want to do then is take our source of         mesenchymal stem cells from a given individual with heart failure,         let's say; take those mesenchymal stem cells, set aside a number of         them and try to differentiate into cardiomyocytes, take the first batch         of mesenchymal stem cells from the same patient, infuse them back,         allow that patient to develop a tolerogenic state, and we're         talking about mesenchymal cells from a different donor, not from         obviously the same, where we're able to have a larger bank of cells         to provide back to the first recipient.                           DR. ROWLEY:   Okay, and my final question is:  do you have         to worry in this situation about graft versus host disease?                          PROF. ITESCU:   That's a very good point.  In fact,         that's, again, an advantage of using stem cells for this process.          Whereas whole bone marrow transplantation or whole bone marrow used to         try to induce tolerance runs a risk of graft versus host disease.                       As you probably know, bone marrow transplants, I think, in general,                allogeneic transplants keep something like 20, 25 percent incidence                of graft versus host disease.  The animal treatments with to date                only embryonic stem cells that has been published has not resulted                in any type of GVHD, as you would anticipate that you wouldn't                get if these cells, in fact, inhibit rather than activate immune                responses.                    DR. FOSTER:   But in fairness, in the bone marrow         transplantation, a low level of graft versus host disease proves to be         advantageous, I think.                           DR. ROWLEY:   Well, that's true if you're doing it         with leukemia because then you get a graft versus leukemia.                          DR. FOSTER:   I'm talking specifically leukemia, yes.                          PROF. ITESCU:   But we don't want it to happen if         we're trying to induce tolerance.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Michael Gazzaniga.                          DR. GAZZANIGA:   I should remember the answer to this, but         is there an interesting variation in tolerance to grafts?  In other         words, there's a subpopulation that seems to just take it and all         of the tricks in the medical bag don't seem to be that necessary?                          PROF. ITESCU:   There's no question there are some         patients who do wonderfully well with minimal immunosuppression for         many, many, many years, and absolutely I would be the first to say that         we have no idea why some people accept the graft so well.                       So that clearly a mechanism of tolerance induction in some individuals                works beautifully.  I would suspect that it's the same type                of mechanisms we're talking about today that take  for whatever                reason in some individuals better than others, but it will be the                same mechanism.  It won't be different mechanisms, I think.                                 DR. GAZZANIGA:   Is there any way that you could predict         that?                          PROF. ITESCU:   Yeah, and what I was alluding to earlier,         the type of chimerism approaches.  What people do is using genetic         probes or genetic markers, you can look for the amount of donor cells         or donor tissue in the blood or in the ingrafted in various organisms,         the lymph nodes or bone marrow.                         You can do these kind of fancy tests, and you can certainly         predict that if there's a high percentage of donor cells that         continue to be present two, three years  out, actually two or three         years — if the patient has already gone two or three years, you know         it has done well, but let's say in the first three to six months         which is the highest risk of rejection.                         If you see a high rate of persistence of donor cells, you         can predict that this patient is going to do better.                          DR. GAZZANIGA:   So could you use that as information in         maybe jumping the patient ahead on the transplant list because you         think there's going to be a —                          PROF. ITESCU:   Well, you don't know that until the         patient has already been transplanted.                          DR. GAZZANIGA:   I was asking if there were predictors.                          PROF. ITESCU:   No, there are no predictors prior to a         transplant as to who's going to accept the particular donor at a         given point in time.  There are no global — what I was trying to         emphasize is that the exquisite response, the exquisite specificity of         the immune system here dictates that there's going to be a very,         very close and tight response between the donor's immune system and         the particular genetics of the host.                         And those two are so specific that they cannot be predicted         globally, and that forms the basis for why we actually monitor each one         of our patients very closely and we tailor our therapy on an individual         basis.  You just cannot make global decisions like that.                        DR. GAZZANIGA:   And one final thing.  Maybe it was on your first                graph, but I didn't catch it.  If you were to say what the survival                rate, transplantation survival rate in 2003 versus ten years ago                was, how much has it changed with all of the new technologies?                    PROF. ITESCU:   The most dramatic leap was probably about 20         years ago, as I mentioned, with cyclosporin coming in from 50 percent         one year survival to about 80 percent.  We've now gone from about         80 percent ten years ago to I would say 95 to 100 percent one year         survival for kidneys and for hearts.                         You can't get any better than that at this point in         time.  The biggest problem right now still is that five and ten-year         survival rates, and those are the issues that I was getting at.  I         think still donor-recipient immune activity is the problem, that we         cannot induce tolerance.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Janet.                           DR. ROWLEY:   I'm not sure whether people have questions         along this line because mine is a different question.                          So coming back to the first slide where you show the great         disparity between the number of people who need kidney transplants and         the number of potential donors and cadaveric donors, and your data on         cadaveric donors would suggest that that's not necessarily an         avenue to pursue actively because the results are so much poorer in         terms of response.                         The question I have, and that we've had minimal         discussion on this, is whether we should change the strategy of         obtaining donors, and I'm interested in your view on whether there         should be a program for paying donors for their organs.                         It has been pointed out to us that everybody in the system         makes money except for the donor, and the donor is the essential         individual in this whole chain of events, and I'm curious as to         your perspective on this.                          PROF. ITESCU:    Okay.  I think that it's clear that         we're not increasing the donor pool.  I would disagree.  I think         outcome with cadaveric transplants is excellent.  My only point, that         was with living related is even better, but there's nothing wrong         with our current outcomes with cadaveric donors.                         And I wish that we would be able to increase our cadaveric         donor pool.  So if question number one is should the families of         cadaveric donors be appropriately looked after, I think the answer         should be yes.  I think that the families need to be involved in this         whole process.                         In terms of the living related and whether there should be         issues with reimbursement, I would strongly oppose that.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   We've got time just for a couple of         questions.  Michael Sandel, Bill Hurlbut.                            PROF. SANDEL:   Why do the cadaveric organs not work as well         as living ones?                          PROF. ITESCU:   For a number of reasons.  First of all,         because the living ones you've got more time to select on the basis         of how well the donor-recipient are matched, number one.  I mean,         that's the objective.  You find the best match, and that's the         one that's going to be the best in your family pool.                         And you're already starting out with related         individuals who are at least going to be 50 percent identical, you         know, because you inherit 50 percent from your mother and 50 percent         from your father.  So you will share at least 50 percent of your genes         with siblings, et cetera.                         So we're starting out with a closer pool, and then         you're looking for a perfect match.  That's the number one         reason.                         But interestingly, as I mentioned, spousal related grafts         which are HLA completely unrelated generally also do better than         cadaveric.  So the answer is more complex than that.                         It's also probably because if you can perfectly plan         and coordinate the surgery so that everything goes according to         schedule, you've minimized all of the potential risk factors, et         cetera.  That obviously impacts on the outcome.  You can, you know,         organize your timing and the spouse will be there exactly on time and         provide the organ, et cetera.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   There's no chimerism there.                          PROF. ITESCU:   You know, that's a very interesting         question.  It may very well be some other interesting immunologic         issues that may also explain this.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Yeah.  Bill Hurlbut.                          DR. HURLBUT:   Two parts to my question.  First, can you         make some comment about the effect of mixing of peoples from diverse         geographic regions and how it may be making more complex the search for         a compatible donor and increasing the reshuffling of HLA types?                         I assume that in a specific population there would have         been a greater match.  Whether that's making it more difficult, but         softening the immune rejection because people are mushing towards the         middle, if you will or if it's diversifying a complex mismatch         problem.  That's the first question.                       Second, if, in fact, it's possible for the marrow cells, mesenchymal                stem cells or the ES cells, to induce a kind of generalized inhibitory                response or lack of response that makes tolerance of a completely                different third party organ donor, then would it be reasonable to                say that it might turn out that you only needed one or a few lines                of these, let's say, ES cells for the moment, these ES cells                or would you need many that would be a better match for the situation?                                Do you get what I'm getting at?                          PROF. ITESCU:   Yes, I know.                          DR. HURLBUT:   Because the argument will be made that the         few stem cell lines that are currently available either might be         adequate to that task or that we need many more.                          PROF. ITESCU:   No.  So let me address the question number         one first.  I think clearly that as you're getting mixing of         populations, it's making local identification of appropriate donors         much harder.  Actually there's much more diversity.                         It's not going to make inhibition of rejection easier         because the type of exposure to antigens, that takes generations.  What         you're talking about essentially from a practical point of view, it         makes selection and identification of a matched donor much harder.          More homogeneous populations have a much easier time of finding matched         donors.                          DR. HURLBUT:   So we're heading for a worse problem with         rejection.                          PROF. ITESCU:   Absolutely, yeah.                         And in terms of your second question, if we're talking         about an unrelated stem cell inducing tolerance to an organ transplant,         it's essentially, I think, pretty much irrelevant what the HLA type         of the stem cell is.                         And so rather than needing a wider pool of stem cells, you         probably can get away with a more narrow stem cell population because         you're not specifically  trying to induce tolerance to HLA antigens         that that stem cell expresses.                         It's the ability of that stem cell to switch off the         immune response to HLA antigens on the organ that is seen at the same         time as the stem cell is present.  So you potentially would not need         many cell lines, whether we're talking about embryonic or whether         we're talking about adult stem cells.                        DR. HURLBUT:   So just to clarify, if, in fact,                there are stem cell lines not grown on mouse feeder cells, even                just a few of them, that might turn out to be the central resource                to effect these ends.                    PROF. ITESCU:   Potentially.                        CHAIRMAN KASS:   Before we close, I                want to be somewhat flat-footed here so that as we hear the presentations                in July I know what I'm supposed to think about the immunological                aspects or prospects of stem cells for regenerative medicine.                   You seem to be suggesting the following, and this was, in         fact, the reason for the invitation, to learn what we could from         experience with immunological problems in the transplantation of solid         organs to anticipate the possible obstacles to the uses of stem cells         in regenerative medicine.                         We've heard something surprising here in a way, that         stem cells, both embryonic and adult might actually hold some promise         for making the immunological obstacles to the solid organ         transplantation less than they now are.  That would be the first point.                         And that second, if this matter of education of recipient T         cells by some kind of chimerism works, there may not be as large a         problem in the use of stem cells for regenerative medicine as has been         anticipated, and in fact, just to make a footnote, it might not be         necessary as some people have argued that only by cloning can one get         immunologically compatible stem cells for therapy.  Is that correct?                          PROF. ITESCU:   I think that would be the natural extension         of the argument, although I think at this point in time far too few         data are available to be able to make those kind of conclusions, but I         think that's right.  The surprising evidence to date, I think, is         that even when stem cells of either source are enabled to differentiate         sufficiently to up-regulate their HLA molecules, they still seem to be         able to engraft, and they still seem to be able to regulate immune         responses in a downward fashion.                         So potentially what that does suggest is that these cells         may be less immunogenic than other cells in our body and might produce         to requirement for cloning even when used therapeutically, yeah.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you very much.                           DR. ROWLEY:   Can I just interject though?  You said in your         presentation that the data all come from experimental animals, and so         this last exchange, in fact, we don't know whether the data from         the animals are applicable to the human system.                          PROF. ITESCU:   Absolutely.  I agree entirely with that,         too.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you very much, Dr. Itescu, for an         interesting and enlightening presentation and discussion.                         We'll take a break for 15 minutes.  Come back at ten         minutes of 11.                               (Whereupon, the foregoing matter went off the record at 10:36         a.m. and went back on the record at 10:54 a.m.)                                 Session 2:  Medicalization :                Its Nature, Causes, and Consequences                 CHAIRMAN KASS:   All right.  In this session we                move from the scientific and medical to the sociological and philosophic,                the question of so-called medicalization, making medical some aspects                of human behavior not previously regarded as medical, and the question                before us is what is medicalization and why might it be important                to our enterprise as the President's Council on Bioethics.                   And I'm going to make some semi-coherent, I hope, at         least semi-coherent remarks to introduce this, just to indicate why         we're talking about it.                         We have touched on this topic implicitly in many of our         discussions of beyond therapy, whether using biomedical technologies to         satisfy personal desires or to achieve some form of behavior control,         and we have sometimes tried to get at that question by distinguishing         the medical from the nonmedical, say, and the distinction between         therapy and enhancement of the use of medical means for nontherapeutic         or nonmedical purposes.                         The topic also came up in the last meeting in the         discussion with Steven Pinker, where the issue was not so much the uses         of biomedical technologies as the question of the assignment of guilt         and responsibility in a world in which behavior is understood largely         biologically.                       Some observers of the work of the council have concluded, I think                falsely, from random remarks made in these discussions that the                council has doubts about the existence of genuine mental illness,                such as schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder, or that it                means by raising these kinds of questions to object to the treatment                of these disorders under a medical model using psychotropic drugs.                                I think that is a misreading of what we have been doing.                         But rather than shy away from this subject, it seems to me         that we would do well to try to clarify this matter of medicalization         by actually treating it thematically rather than as an adjunct to other         matters, to see what it is, what causes it, and whether and why it         might be important.                         And one of the reasons for doing so is it provides us with         at least one look at the larger social, cultural context that shapes         almost all of the bioethical issues that we have examined or might         examine.  For example, ethical issues raised by preimplantation genetic         diagnosis or even prenatal diagnosis are really unintelligible save         when seen in the context of the fact that pregnancy and childbirth have         already been pretty much completely medicalized, or the ethical issues         that would be raised by the uses of psychotropic drugs in children         would be unintelligible except if we recognize the degree to which         behavioral problems have been medicalized and taken out of the moral         realm and brought into the therapeutic, or even any discussion of the         regulation of the use of biomedical technologies must begin with the         fact that uses of approved remedies are, by and large, left to the         practice of medicine and the standards of care.                         Now, medicalization is a sociological concept that's         been around for some 30, 35 years, and it has been a matter of interest         and concern to sociologists for some time, and its scope is much         broader than questions just of behavior control or mental diseases.                         The background paper written by Peter Conrad that we         circulated is a review essay by a person who is one of the first to         write on this subject, and he discusses the concept of medicalization         and shows how widespread is its reach, beginning with discussions of         the medicalization of deviant behavior from alcoholism to compulsive         gambling, to child abuse, to the medicalization of natural life         processes  of childbirth, child development, and the end of life, and         going on to women's issues, from eating disorders, birth control,         premenstrual syndrome, menopause; children's issues of learning         disabilities, behavior problems.                         And as this little clip at your place from the  Wall         Street Journal  from yesterday indicates, now shortness of stature         is about to become a medical problem, to old people's issues of,         alas, forgetfulness and growing kinds of weaknesses.                         And I think that Conrad's essay points out, I think,         quite nicely how these are matters partly of conceptualization, partly         matters of institutional rearrangements, and also when the doctors are         actually involved of direct medical implications for the human         relations whenever people bring these matters to the physicians.                         And he also points out how the development of effective         technologies to intervene in a whole range of areas also increases the         tendency to make more and more aspects of human life matters of medical         concept and medical approach.  And this is meant to be said simply         descriptively.  You know, there's no prejudgment, although some         people talk about medicalization with a negative connotation.  We         simply mean it at least at this point to be descriptive.                         Three things I would like to in my own name sort of put         before us that seem to me to be of special significance before         introducing the materials that Paul McHugh has especially prepared for         us.                         First, the matter of surveillance and how many, many more         things are now coming under the medical gaze, where the medical view of         this, that or the other is now kind of commonplace.  The medical view         of marriage and its benefits for health, a recent bit of discussion.                         And this medical surveillance, I think, now is something         that should concern us especially with the coming of the powers of         genetic screening which will, I think, soon be a major issue in which         not only will child birth be under the medical gaze, but so, too, the         necessary conditions for thinking about what are the criteria         sufficient to warrant entry into life.                         So the whole question of surveillance is one of the things         that's important.                       Second, there are economic questions that I think are worthy of                our attention, and he points out very nicely, Conrad does, that                if the only way to get reimbursement for gaining help with life's                problems is through medical insurance, there is a high premium on                having all kinds of things declared medical in order to get the                help that you need.                   And the corollary of that is this, of course, drives up         medical costs and places enormous burdens on the health care system as         more and more things, whether medical in the narrow sense or in the         broad sense, now come to the doors of hospitals and clinics.                         Finally, in a most abstract way, this question of         medicalization bears really even on the business of bioethics because         it finally bears on what constitutes a medical or biological phenomenon         and what is an ethical one, as our friend Michael Gazzaniga will be         quick to tell us, especially if and when we come to begin to think         about ethical sensibilities in terms of their underlying biological         basis and substratum.                         So that even the very activity that we're engaged in is         affected by the rise of the medical and biological model for thinking         about behavior, including even ethicizing.                         Now, with this as a background and presupposing the Conrad         material as read, I want us to turn to the material especially prepared         for this meeting.  Although the areas of human life that have been         medicalized are many, the area of behavior is, in fact, of special         interest, especially as behavior at least as we've always         understood it has some kind of biological or natural substrate, but         also a human and moral meaning.                         And staff has asked Paul to help us think about this larger         topic by reflecting on the phenomenon of medicalization in the domain         of psychiatry, a subject that has been one of his professional         interests really for decades.                         And I think before we start that one should simply declare         for the record that there should be no mistake about this.  Neither         Paul nor I nor the council means in any way to cast doubts on the         existence of these mental illnesses or the urgency of caring for the         thousands who suffer from them or the families who are also devastated         by these illnesses.                         There is no hidden agenda here.  We're simply trying to         understand this phenomenon and what it might mean for the work of this         council.                         Paul chose to develop his thoughts in epistolary form, and         we decided that it was less work to synthesize his two letters as if         they were a seamless document than to allow the things to appear         actually as the conversation went between us, and we put those         materials before you for discussion.                         Paul, do you want to say anything by way of start?                        DR. McHUGH:   No, Leon.  I'm very grateful                to you for having this epistolary discussion with me.  I enjoyed                it.                 I would like to — I think the stuff rather speaks for itself.                 There is a subtext, I'm sure you see, that is, that Leon asked me                to do a little something about medicalization and psychiatry.  I                wrote the first letter, disappointing him.  He wrote—                   (Laughter.)                        DR. McHUGH:  — a letter reminding me that                I could do better, and I tried harder the second time, and I want                you all to know that I'm aware of that subtext and want you                to be as well.                   (Laughter.)                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   If others would like to begin, please do         so.  If not, I would in a way put a question to you, Paul, as  away of         continuing the conversation.                         I'm very excited, as you know, by your attempt to go         beyond the merely symptomatic classification of human troubles, to         provide what you call the reference classes of diseases, of aberrant         behaviors, of what you sometimes call dispositions and sometimes you         call — I've lost the other term for it — and then finally the         sort of life experiences problems.                       And the first of the three is the only class that you see as being                somehow on the model of ordinary somatic disease, but all of them                legitimately come to the healer of the soul for help.                   And I guess the question is:  why isn't that part and         parcel, in fact, of the growing medicalization, in fact, of all of         those other things even if our approach to them is not exactly the         same?                         Maybe you could elaborate on the value of these kinds of         categories for leaving the things to Caesar that are Caesar's and         the things to God that are God's.                          DR. McHUGH:  Well, it's a long story at one level, and         I'll try to make it brief.  What it amounts to is that psychiatry         is a discipline of medicine.  It is a medical discipline, but people         come into your office just like they come into any doctor's office         with complaints and with plenty of psychiatric complaints.  The         conditions from which they spring don't necessarily seem directly         medical, and a psychiatrist has to decide where they belong.                         Prior to DSM-III, the dominant approach to dealing with         people's complaints was to try to fit them into an ideological         scheme.  In America the dominant one was, of course, Freudian thought         and a subdominant one in plenty of institutions was the Skinnerian         behavioral one.                         The great advantage that the classifications developed by         DSM-III were that patients' complaints were subgrouped according to         which complaints the patient brought forth and which symptoms could be         recognized out of an examination.                         The problem with that though is that by classifying things         by symptoms and complaints, psychiatry was condemned really to stay at         the level that 19th Century medicine was when we classified people         according to the fever charts and the characteristics of their pain.                         And no director of a department, such as I was, that hoped         to achieve a coherent discourse with his group, direct research, and at         the same time care for patients could be satisfied with simply that         classification.                         And so what I have been writing about and I have been         proposing for a long time is to see different reference classes of         patients just as medicine does.  After all, medicine talks about         infectious disorders, neoplastic disorders, congenital disorders,         genetic disorders, and the time has come in psychiatry to move towards         that kind of classification.                         But when you think about psychiatry, it's quite clear         that there are plenty of conditions that go beyond because of human         kind and the particular features that the human brain brings into play         that give other reference classes for disorders.                         And so I was interested in my department and in my work to         separate the things which are diseases, where everyone could see that         these are a breakdown of cerebral faculties, straightforward losses of         the capacity to think, to perceive, to remember, to emote         appropriately, to have executive control from a second group of classes         that are the abnormal behaviors in which what are the rhythms of our         ordinary behaviors fall awry sometimes because of injury to the brain,         sometimes because of conditioned experiences, the behavior disorders,         in other words.                         The dimensional disorders in which our psychological         characteristics are dimensions of human variations just as our physical         characteristics are, and so some people can be in distress not because         they have anything broken like a disease would imply, but simply         because they are at some extreme along a dimension of human variation,         the most obvious one being mental retardation, but others being         excessive neuroticism, excessive extroversion or introversion.                         And then finally, the conditions or the complaints people         bring me or any psychiatrist that fundamentally come out of their life         experience, what they've encountered in life and what assumptions         they're making about that.                         These four reference classes, what I refer to in my books         as the four perspectives of psychiatry, obviously interrelate.  They         all, of course, depend upon a brain.  You can't have any of this         without a brain, but the brain, the human brain does all kinds of         interesting things, and a psychiatrist in interacting with such people         does different things.                       He tries to cure diseases.  He tries to interrupt behaviors, to                guide the individuals that are often some extreme in human variation.                 He tries to help, essentially rescript assumptions that lead people                into encounters with life that will distress anybody.                   And when you ask me about how to think about psychiatry in         these terms, those were the things; that was my natural place to go.                         I think the question that you could ask is:  well, by doing         this kind of an approach and, by the way, then generating — let me         just spell out briefly that this would mean that any department of         psychiatry would have in it individuals, for example, who are skilled         at brain imaging and the recognition of certain breakdowns of faculties         out of the generation of molecular abnormalities, genetic abnormalities         and physiological abnormalities.                         The disease model that is clear in medicine should be found         in psychiatry departments and representatives of that would be there,         but also psychiatry departments should have people who are very         interested in the life story of individuals, the narrative and how the         narrative reveals sometimes the natural wellsprings of disorder.                         And such a broad psychiatry department would be open then         not only to the medical departments that surround it in any university,         but it would also be open to the public at large that wonders and wants         to find not only help for, but some kinds of understandings that could         make sense out of current problems, current sets of assumptions and the         like.                         Your question that started me off on this little preamble         was, well, does this make medical everything.  Well, no.  In my         opinion, although a psychiatrist is often the person that people come         to now at first with a concern, like feeling sad or feeling disrupted         in their plans of life or disappointed in what they had hoped for, he         or she might come to a psychiatrist first to make sure that the         psychiatrist in evaluating the person didn't find something else         more fundamental wrong, but the psychiatrist at the end might well say,         ""Look.  This complaint that you have, this demoralized state, this         state of discouragement or depression is, in fact, something that         derives from who you are and what you're thinking and lots of         people besides me can help you with that, and I want you to be able to         turn to those other people to think about what you want to do.""                         In that way, you see, I feel I would like to move         psychiatry where medicine or surgery is today, namely, to the point         where the patient can be really on all fours with me in discussing the         implications of not only the symptoms that they have, but the treatment         that they might accept.                         Prior to this or often with simply a categorical diagnostic         system, the patient comes to a psychiatrist and then has to say,         ""Well, you're a person with all of this experience.  You must         know better than I do about what counts and the way I ought to live and         all of that because you know the secrets.""                         And this way you'd say, ""No, I don't know the         secrets.  I think you belong in this kind of problem.  Let's find         out who might know better and who might open you and me, by the way, to         a better understanding of what you've encountered and how that         encounter has shaped your reaction.""                         I can assure you right now that the problem here is not         that you've got some twisted neuron or a twisted molecule.  I'm         good at that.  I want to open you to the idea that maybe you have a         twisted thought that somebody else as well as me might help you with.                         And that's a long answer to your brief question.  I         have to say that it has been the story of my life, trying to make this         clear to as many people who will be willing to listen.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Do you want to follow up on this, Frank?          Because I had Gil and then — Gil, then go ahead.  Sorry.                          PROF. MEILAENDER:   Yeah, I mean, I am following up on this         if that's okay with you.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Well, sure.  Yeah.                          PROF. MEILAENDER:   I just want to try to figure out, Paul,         and I have to sort of direct it to you though someone else may have         insight.  What difference this really makes, the kind of distinction         that you're trying to make.  All right?                         And I have in mind a sentence that comes on page 9 of your         now published correspondence where you say near the top, ""But the         claim that alcoholism, narcissistic personality, and stage fright are         sicknesses of the same kind as schizophrenia cannot be sustained just         because these people walk into our office and we help them.""                         Okay?  Now, it's evidently okay with you that they         continue to walk into your office, people who have stage fright or         these obnoxious narcissists.  It's okay that they come in, and you         think that on a number of occasions you are able to do something or         other that helps them.  It might be pharmacological in some cases.  It         might just be conversation on other occasions.                         So that in terms of the points that Leon raised before,         these can still come under medical surveillance, and they can still         find ways to be reimbursed through insurance and so forth for the costs         of this.                         So what difference does it make that some of these things         don't fall into the category of brain disease, but they fall into         one of the other categories?                         I mean, I understand that, and it certainly makes some         difference just in the sense of conceptual clarity, but in terms of the         practice of medicine, it doesn't seem to make much difference other         than, I guess, the person with the brain disease.  You wouldn't         say, ""Go talk to your friends about this,"" but with the         narcissist you might say there are some other people, too.                         But, you know, it's appropriate that they come into         your office.  There are things within your armamentarium that you can         use to help them.  So what's the difference finally?                          DR. McHUGH:  Well, let me say, first of all, Gil, that         nobody comes into any doctor's office usually with a diagnosis         attached to him.  He doesn't come in and say, ""Guess what I         have.  An aortic aneurism, and it's causing me pain.""                         (Laughter.)                          DR. McHUGH:  He doesn't do that.  He comes in and says,         ""Listen.  I've got belly pain, and I don't know.""                         Of course, it could be nowadays when you read the magazines         that you could do that, and occasionally I can tell you in psychiatry         people come in and tell me they've got adult ADHD and I'm to         give them Ritalin and let's get on with it.                         But for the most part people don't come in to a         doctor's office with that.  They come in with complaints and         wonder, appropriately, whether the doctor can help them.                         And the difference that we're making here amongst them         is to say that there are different sources of these complaints, and         psychiatrists have greater or lesser capacities to help them, and by         making these differentiations and differentiating things according to         their essential differences, I think, not only do we serve that patient         well, but we ultimately serve the public well who want to ask us         appropriately who and whether the patient should get help from you or         from other people, and ask us exactly how we give them help.                         So first of all, the differentiation is very helpful to the         public, in my opinion, by enhancing the differential, enhancing the         discourse on the differences in natures about conditions that cause         people to suffer.                         Yes, I think that I often tell people with stage fright who         come into me and say, ""Dr. McHugh, I have stage fright, and guess         what.  I saw at the Super Bowl that Paxil is very good for this and         you're to give it to me.""                         And I tell them, ""No, I'm not going to give you         that.  I don't think we have to go that route.  Why don't you         find another way to practice and then come back and tell me whether by         helping you practice will help you do better?  Okay?""                         So I will ask them to go back to their teachers.  I mean, I         get this question of stage fright from high school students, you know,         who are working, and I'm telling them, ""No, I'm not going         to give you a medicine now.""                         It may well be that when I see a person who has more         difficulty, for example, a violinist who has problems with trembling in         their hands, I  might and I often do recommend, as a lot of people do,         Propanolol to help them from those trembles, help them with the         physical condition, but I will debate with all of them what they're         doing.                         And by showing them the nature of what they're asking,         I think I enhance their understanding, my understanding, and the         public's understanding of my role.  Okay?  Which is not to be the         only arbiter of how life should be led.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Gil, do you want to follow or not?                          PROF. MEILAENDER:   Well, no one else is champing at the         bit?                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   No.  Well, I mean, if —                          PROF. MEILAENDER:   I'll wait.  I'll wait.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Okay.  I have Frank and Robby George and         Michael.                        PROF. FUKUYAMA:   Well, I enjoyed the exchange                of letters between you and Leon.  I think we ought to do all of                our reports henceforth in epistolary form.  I have a question about                the underlying biology, which maybe you could help me with it, Michael                Gazzaniga or other scientists.                   Now, in somatic medicine, as I understand it, there's a         fairly clear, you know, model for what a disease should look like.          There's a clear etiology.  There's a causative agent.  So we         have this thing calls SARS.  We believe that there is actually         something that you've going to find, a virus or whatever that will,         you know, cause it.                         Now, in the world of psychiatry, I assume that there are         diseases in that somatic disease sense, but actually the vast majority         of the phenomenon that you deal with is this very large category of         things called disorders, all of which have biological correlates.  I         mean even the most fleeting thought or emotion is going to have some         biological correlate, but that there are degrees of biological         causation, and there are certain disorders where the biological         determinants, you know, are relatively more important.                         I guess what I'm getting at is that it seems to me         within this category of disorders what makes it so squishy is that a         very large number of them are basically, you know, normally distributed         behaviors, and that what you're classifying as a disorder is simply         something that's out in the tail of the distribution.                         And so the question is:  if your project is to try to move         your discipline towards a more, you know, biologically grounded         categorization of these different things, you know, your four         categories, what are the prospects of doing this in terms of the         underlying biology?                         For example, is it clear in all cases which of these are         simply points on a distribution as opposed to, you know, things that         will have a different kind of biological, you know, correlate?                         And what are the prospects of, you know, moving the field         towards a system of classification that is grounded, you know, more         firmly in the underlying biology?                          DR. McHUGH:  Well, first of all, my aim was not simply to         move the field into a more biologically based classification, although         I support biologically based opinions about certain disorders.                         My effort was to say which ones in which I thought a broken         part played the major role, that is, the classical disease concept in         which an etiology, a pathology lied underneath an expressed clinical         syndrome.                         I also wanted to say, as everyone would, that you can't         have anything in mental life without a brain.  We're not angels.          We all do that.                         On the other hand, I also want to acknowledge that there         are things about the human brain which are at least to all of us         mysterious as to how the brain itself as mechanism causes the problems         that the patients bring.                         For example, the issue of jealousy.  You can find jealousy         as a symptom of a disease, that is, a disease like schizophrenia or         manic depressive disorder or Huntington's disease or         Alzheimer's disease.  All of those conditions have been described         in some of its classical forms as presenting with a jealousy.                         On the other hand, much jealousy comes out of dispositional         characteristics of an individual in relationship to a life circumstance         that they find themselves in, and that their assumptions coming out of         their dispositions and the interactions with that environment produce a         jealous response.                         I want to be sure that people who want to talk about         psychiatry would want to differentiate those and appreciate the place         of other forms of therapy than a strictly biological form of therapy         for that.  Okay?                         And, please, press on.                          PROF. FUKUYAMA:   I mean, if I can just follow-up.                          DR. McHUGH:  Yeah.                          PROF. FUKUYAMA:   I mean, I'm not  asking to make these         distinctions so that we can then discard everything that doesn't         have a very strict biological, you know, cause.  That's not my         purpose.                          DR. McHUGH:  No, that's right.  No, that's right.                          PROF. FUKUYAMA:   I accept fully that you also want to treat         that vast realm of things where the cause is squishier.                         But it does seem to me that — and in a way, this gets to         Gil's point about why these differences are important, you know.          If something is simply caused by a virus, you don't expect anybody         to do anything about that other than, you know, get treatment for it,         right?                          DR. McHUGH:  Right.                          PROF. FUKUYAMA:   On the other hand, there's a whole         range of behavioral and mental phenomena where, you know, there may be         a biological component to that behavior, but the other component is         what we traditionally think of as kind of moral behavior that is the         result of self-discipline, education, you know, thinking things through         and so forth.                         And I think that the thing that troubles me and probably a         lot of other people about the progressive medicalization or this         expansion of the domain of the therapeutic is that it tries to move         things that are within this traditional moral realm into a realm of,         you know, biological causation where, you know, you're basically         telling the patient, well, you can't do anything about it.  So you         know, you just have to take your medicine and the like.                         And so even if you can get money for being treated for         that, you know, what used to be treated by the priests and counselors         and so forth, it's still a helpful distinction to be able to say,         ""Well, look.  This thing is, you know, 90 percent biological.  You         can't do anything about it,"" whereas another category of         disorders actually does have this very large component where individual         responsibility and, you know, so forth plays a large role.                         And so I guess the question is:  does the state of the         science give you any help in trying to make that distinction?                          DR. McHUGH:  Well, I think it does, and I think the         advantage of having separate reference classes or separate perspectives         of disorder is to see that with each separate class there is a separate         understanding of what constitutes disorder within this class, and I         think the science does help us a tremendous amount in this.                         Well, let me just talk about, for example, what the         science, essentially epidemiological science, did to help us understand         psychotherapy, and in this case we're talking about the         psychotherapy of people that come to us with things like ordinary         grief, demoralization, jealousy.                         The epidemiology showed us that in contrast to what was         expected at the time of the Freudian dominance, that all of these         patients would have similar sources of their problems, namely in their         libidinal conflicts.  It turned out that these people had very         different sources of their problems.                         What was common to the psychotherapy patients is that they         all felt over mastered by something in life and were discouraged about         being over mastered by that rather than that they had a common sources         for their problems.                        And so that immediately opened up psychotherapy and psychotherapists                tomore individual understanding of lives rather than trying to dig                deeper for some problem in infantile or early childhood life in                relation to their libidinal problems.                   But as well it said, well, since the problem here is         feeling over mastered, a psychiatrist can help you maybe, but         they're going to help you in the same way as other counselors,         friends, people of that sort, priests, and the like have previously         helped people and open the door to that.                         Now, when you bring in, as you did, as Gil did and you did,         this idea that we want to be paid for it, I just want to be paid not         necessarily for my treatment.  I just want to be paid, I think, for my         time like other people, and I want to be sure that I am offering some         kind of help.                         Sometimes the help is not therapeutic in the sense of         actually correcting a disorder, but it is reassuring to people and         things of that sort, the same things that other professional people         like lawyers do.                       And at some level the work is of that sort.  But just to come                back to the main point, to express my reference classes could from                one point of view be seen as extending medicine out beyond its boundaries.                  On another way of looking at it, it could be, and the way I look                at it, it would be by defining these reference classes.  People                could look at what places — the medical doctor would be primary                in the care, and in such classes lots of other people would be able                to be on equal standing in that care, and that, I think, would advance                us in all kinds of ways, including, by the way, being able to give                parity to the mentally ill for the conditions which are most like                medical conditions and not clamor for parity for individuals for                whom some aspects of their condition, their over mastery, could                be helped by others.                    CHAIRMAN KASS:   To this?  Mary Ann  Glendon.                          PROF. GLENDON:   I just need a little help understanding the         distinction between your Class I and Class II, and maybe I'm just         wrong in what I've read in the popular literature, but is there not         some scientific support for the idea that, say, alcoholism — that         there are some people who are more prone to that through brain         characteristics than others?                         So that your boundary between one and two doesn't seem         to me to be quite clear.                          DR. McHUGH:  Well, the boundary only relates to what leads         to the course, not that there — by the way, again, there are going to         be brain things behind everything, including, by the way, behind         jealousy.                         Your question is a frequently asked question, namely,         don't you see that certain people, perhaps because of their         make-up, have more temptations to sustain a behavior like alcoholism         than others.                         For example, oriental people often are sickened by alcohol         because of an Antabuse-like reaction that they have.  This is very         protective for them from taking up this conditions and carrying it         further.                         It's also probably true that some people get more         aroused by a glass of alcohol than other people do and, therefore, find         it more rewarding.                         Both of those things are true, but in contrast to a disease         like Huntington's disease, you will advance in that condition         steadily forward regardless of whether you are able to move about or         not.  You cannot advance in alcoholism unless you choose to drink, and         that choice is, after all, a matter of deciding one way or the other.                       That there is a vulnerability behind that choice does not change the                fact that it's still a choice, and ultimately the Alcoholics                Anonymous that wants to clamor for the concept of disease here as                though it was a broken part ultimately does say that, you know,                you have to choose to live a different life and acknowledge.                   You know, it doesn't matter whether you acknowledge         that Huntington's disease has a power over you or not.  It will         carry itself through, but it does make a difference if you acknowledge         that you are powerless against alcohol and, therefore, avoid it.                         And since there are those elements to it, the therapies         change.  The responsibilities change, and ultimately the outcome.                         Just as a final thing, I might have mentioned this to you         before, Mary Ann.  About once a year I get someone coming to my office         and saying to me, ""Dr. McHugh, I want you to come to court with me         because I've been arrested for driving while intoxicated, and I         want you to tell the judge that, of course, I'm an alcoholic and,         therefore, should get off.""                         And I always tell them, ""No.  I want you to go and be         punished for driving while intoxicated because my friends and my         children and everybody else are driving, and I don't want that to         happen.  After you are punished, I might be able to help you with this         conditions, but I might not be able to help you either, depending upon         what you're after.  It seems to me today that what you're after         is some license and not the appropriate contrition.""                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   I have Robby George.                          PROF. GEORGE:   Paul, I have two questions.  I think         they're only remotely related, and the first one you may have gone         far toward answering, but it would just help me to get a little firmer         grip on it.                         I want to sort of follow up.  What I took Gil's         question to be, which is really about when are you as a psychiatrist in         and when are you out.                         Now, from what you've said in response to Gil and Frank         and now Mary Ann, I take it that the situation is a little like the         separation of powers, if I can use an analogy from my own field.          There's an old line that says we don't have so much a         separation of powers in our government as having separate institutions         sharing powers, and I take it from what you're saying what we have         when it comes to treatment of certain sorts of things that are         problems, but they're not like Huntington's disease, we have a         kind of sharing of authority, sharing of roles where the psychiatrist,         the priest, the dad, all might be dealing with the same problem, and         you wouldn't want to carve things up such that you would have         strict boundaries where you say, ""Ah, this counts as the         psychiatric problem.  This counts as the spiritual problem.  This         counts as the moral problem.""                         Am I right so far?                         Okay.  But that leaves us where I think we were left after         Gil's question.  There must be some criteria by which you as a         psychiatrist and others in the field decide, look, this just isn't         appropriate for me to deal with.  If I did that I would be practicing         priestcraft without a license.                         Let me just try and example or two.  I mean, if a corporate         CEO comes to see you and says, ""Look.  I've got a great         career.  I'm making a ton of money.  My business is going well.          Everything is great, but you know, I find myself getting involved with         the secretaries romantically, and this could wreck everything.  Doc, I         want you to help me.""                         Would that be the kind of case in which if you didn't         detect some pathology, what you detected is a guy who's prone to         this kind of —                          DR. McHUGH:  Fall in sin, yeah, right.                          PROF. GEORGE:   Would you say, ""Look.  You've got         the wrong place.  I mean this is not something that I as a psychiatrist         am qualified to deal with""?                          DR. McHUGH:  We certainly recognize incontinent behavior         and call it just that and say, ""You don't have a disease,         pal.  You have become incontinent in your sexual behavior, and I can         tell you what I think about it, and I can tell you some of the things         that might help you stop it, but you need lots of other forms of help         in the process.""                         Because they often come with this and say, you know,         ""I just can't help it, Doc.""                         And I say, ""Can't means won't, and you         won't help it,"" and I begin to talk about drawing in these         other people to help  them.                          PROF. GEORGE:   Well, now he said, ""Well, Doc, look.          Don't get me wrong.  I'm an enlightened guy.  I don't have         any moral problems about what I'm doing.  I just don't want my         career — I know that the world is such that my career and my company         and my business is at risk here.  I just want a fix so I won't do         this.  You know, I'm not religious.  There's no clergyman I can         go to.  If I told my pals that this was a particular problem I had,         they wouldn't consider that to be a problem.  I need you to fix         this.""                         Now, do you now because you're the only game in town,         you're the only person he can go to, do you now say, ""Well,         look.  This isn't psychiatry.  I'm now functioning as some sort         of counselor to you, but I'm going to stick with you and see if we         can save your professional life""?                          DR. McHUGH:  Always the beginning of building up a         hypothetical case, you gradually get to the point where you might be         imagining pigs with wings, you know, and what are you going to do with         this flying pig.                       But look.  In my opinion, the kind of case you're drawing,                Robby, is not at all unusual for many psychiatrists to say, and                they, at least as far as I know have not given up on the idea that                this kind of behavior is destructive to the milieu in which the                person is living, as well sa the character of the person who is                involved.                   Some of them will use the word ""sin"" and         ""adultery.""  Others will say this is corruption and the like,         and begin from that position, not from the position that your patient         that you've imagined said, that is, ""Listen, Doc.  You and I         are guys together, you know.  Aren't we having fun?  And I just am         afraid that his having so much fun is going to get me into         trouble.""                         If someone said that — no one has ever said such a thing         to me — but if they said that, I would say, ""No, we aren't         guys together.  We are people in this society, and there are certain         things not only which are against the law, but which are against our         ethical posture towards this.""                         Now, this is to take in some situations a judgmental         stance.  Okay?  And, by the way, in my opinion, because psychiatry is         the kind of discipline it is and it moves up through these reference         classes or up a hierarchy, ultimately we do make judgments and         acknowledge that those judgments are derived from the world in which we         live.                          DR. KRAUTHAMMER:   If I could just say, Robby, we had a         recent case of that, and the attempted intervention was not psychiatry,         but impeachment.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   I have Michael Sandel and then Jim Wilson.                          PROF. SANDEL:   The question that occurs to me                in this discussion, and, Paul, I'm constrained to more general                territory and the general question of medicalization, is why we                worry about it or if we should worry about it.                   Why should we have an impulse to try to limit the scope of         the medical?  But what is the source of that impulse and is it         justified?                       And in listening to the discussion, it seems to me there are two different                kinds of reasons to worry about the expansion of the medical.  One                of them, the one we tend to focus on for the most part is a worry                that the biological will colonize the ethical and crowd it out;                that the therapeutic will displace the moral.  That's the worry                that comes to the fore when we worry about diminishing the responsibility                people have for their own conditions if they come to see those conditions                as subject to remedy by a pill or by surgery or some kind of medical                intervention.                   And so we wrestle with cases like narcissism or child abuse         or the drunkenness of the driver or the squirminess of the child in the         class, and realizing those kinds of things will crowd out or diminish         moral responsibility for one's conduct.  So that seems to be one         set of reasons to worry about medicalization.                         But it seems to me there's a different set of         considerations that have nothing to do with whit worry about the         biological displacing the ethical, but instead have to do with the         range of cases, Leon, that you mentioned at the beginning having to do         with medicalizing shortness or the kind of medicalization that         accompanies more and more cosmetic surgery.                       And this worry has nothing to do with disputing the biological                character of these conditions.  No one disputes that shortness is                a biological condition.  No one says, ""Well, if we medicalize                shortness, then people will no longer take moral responsibility                for being so short,"" as in the other cases.                   Or if we medicalize the question of someone who has a         prominent nose and wants to have cosmetic surgery, we don't say,         ""No, that's troubling because we want people to pull         themselves up by their bootstraps and deal with this themselves, not to         pretend that it's just a medical problem that needs to be taken         care of.""                         So it's not that issue at all.  Here it's not the         worry about the displacement of moral responsibility, and yet there is         still a worry about medicalization in this other domain, and it comes         closer to the enhancement cases we were discussing.                         And then I think it has to do with another feature of the         medical, the reason we want to cabin or confine the medical, and that         has to do not with its concern with the biological, but instead with         its orientation to fixing rather than accepting.                       And so because it's a feature of the medical that it attends                to disease.  The telos of medicine, traditionally understood at                least, is to attend to disease, which is to say to attend to things                in need of fixing.                   And so we worry here in this second domain that we will         redescribe conditions like shortness or like having a prominent nose as         diseases when they're not properly regarded as diseases, and one         way of expressing this worry is to say that medicalizing these kinds of         things will stigmatize people who are short, let's say such that         beforehand we might not have noticed it as much, but now that it         becomes something that's routinely subject to a medical cure we         notice and worry more when people are short or when they have prominent         noses or when they have teeth that aren't perfectly white and         aligned or whatever the case may be.                         So it's the fixing part of medicine here that wants us         to rein in the scope of application of the medical lest we consider         more and more conditions as things to be fixed rather than as things to         be accepted or, for that matter even appreciated.                         I don't know if that's a helpful distinction.  The         one final thought about the second category is we could deal with that         problem, the problem of medicalizing conditions like shortness and so         on in one of two ways.  We could say, ""Well, all right.  We will         expand, as implicitly we must, what counts as a disease to include         that, but that seems bothersome.""                       Anther way of dealing with it would be to say, ""Well, maybe                medicine should be detached from that.  Maybe we need to enlarge                the telos of the medical so that we no longer regard it as concerned                with curing disease.""                   What do we call the people who do cosmetic surgery for a         living?  Well, they're engaged, we would say, or are they, in a         medical practice.  Well, here let's talk about just purely         elective, or would we say we should detach the medical from the notion         of curing disease so that at least we don't taint all sorts of         conditions with disease and just say, ""Well, maybe medicine         isn't solely about curing diseases.  Maybe it can be for fixing         things that people simply want to fix, even if there is no         disease.""                         But that seems also to carry a certain kind of cost or at         least there seemed to be reasons.  I think a lot of people would         resist.  So enlarging the medical by detaching it from curing or         attending to disease, but it seems to me in any case that these are two         very different reasons to worry about medicalization.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Does someone want to join in on this before         we move on?                          DR. KRAUTHAMMER:   Yes, I would.  I would  like to add a         third reason, I think, and it might actually be the reason why society         decides that it's going to have to act on it, and that is the         economic cost, that apart from the moral cost of expanding the medical,         the economic cost would be huge.                         There is a sense that we have, and I think it's         correct, that if you suffer from a medical condition, society has a         kind of obligation to help you in coping, and that if you're poor,         you shouldn't have to suffer in a way that a rich person would not,         and that's why we have this idea of Medicare-Medicaid and expanding         social help.                         It's inexorable.  In Europe, of course, it's         universal.  Here it's expanding.                         Now, as you expand what is legitimately considered medical         you will expand the realm in which society is seen as required to         contribute to your assistance, and as that area expands, it's going         to create a huge social cost, and I think that in the end may be the         reason why there are attempts to contract it.                         We see the argument acutely in whether or not a psychiatric         illness, mental conditions should get the same kind of coverage as         so-called physical illnesses.  That's the most obvious and acute         example of this, but I think it's going to expand as the range of         the medical expands as well.                            PROF. SANDEL:   Could I give a quick reply to that?  I         don't think that the economic reason is a third reason independent         of these two.  To the contrary, I think it's parasitic on one or         the other of these two for the following reason.                         If it were just a matter — if worries about medicalization         were just a matter of society having to bear too great a financial         cost, it can't just be that because the reason — suppose the         reason that things became very expensive is simply because we got very         good at transplants, and so people in need of hearts and kidneys on a         much larger scale were able maybe because the immune problem were         overcome to have them.                          We wouldn't regard that — it would be an economic         challenge, but it wouldn't be a challenge of the kind that we worry         about when we object to medicalization because it's not         controversial that a heart or a kidney transplant is a medical         procedure.                          DR. KRAUTHAMMER:   What about orthodontics?                            PROF. SANDEL:   What's that?                          DR. KRAUTHAMMER:   What about orthodontics?                            PROF. SANDEL:   Well, the reason that becomes controversial         is it falls into one of the two reasons we have for questioning the         scope of the application of the medical.                         So the economic issue only arises against the background         assumption that we as a society agree that genuinely properly medical         needs are covered, and so we worry about medicalization under these two         other headings — maybe there are others — because in both of those         cases we have reason for questioning whether the scope of the medical         isn't being expanded in ways that are objectionable, whether         because it crowds out the moral or whether because it tries to fix what         should be accepted.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Gil, did you want a small thing on this,         too?                          PROF. MEILAENDER:   Yeah.  I think that finally there's         not such a large distinction between your two categories, Michael.  I         mean there is an obvious on the face of it distinction between your         accepting moral responsibility and what medicine ought to do.                         But as you yourself recognize, if it turns out that there         are some things that people want and that we can do, but that don't         seem to constitute fixing in the sense that medicine traditionally         fixed things, then we have a couple alternatives.                         We could expand the realm of medicine and say doctors         didn't used to do this, but now doctors do it, or we could say,         ""Well, but people still want it done.  So proctors should do it.          Yo u know, they've got a lot of the same skills that doctors do and         they should do it.""                         And if you want to resist that, whether you want to resist         the expansion of medicine or you want to resist the notion that kind of         somebody else should do this, what you're going to have to say is         this is something that should be accepted, that should not just be         fixed.                         And we're beginning now to do talk that though granted         it grew out of a different issue is rather like the moral         responsibility talk.  So I don't think that there is finally quite         as wide a gap between them, though I agree that the second kind of case         you raise grows out of the question of what really constitutes health         and what really constitutes disease or medicine, but it finally drives         us back to assert what we do or do not take responsibility for.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Briefly Michael and then .-                            PROF. SANDEL:   They're both normative question I agree,         but they're different normative questions.  One has to do with what         should people be held  morally responsible for, and the other has to do         with what do we consider should be accepted rather than fixed.                         I agree they're both normative.                          PROF. MEILAENDER:   Well, people perhaps should be held         morally responsible for learning to accept certain things about life.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Jim Wilson will now make trouble.                          PROF. WILSON:   I think the problem that Paul has addressed         under the concept of medicalization is much broader than the problem as         he sees it in psychiatry, and my views on this are, in part, an effort         to answer Gil's question what difference it makes.                         Medicalization to me as a non-real scientist, but a fake         political scientist is a synonym for causation.  Now, all behavior is         causes, and there is an effort in not only our society, but most         societies around the world to extend the concept of cause so that         everything is caused in a way that crowds out the moral, as Michael         said.                         Let me give you the case from criminal justice, if Mary Ann         Glendon will overlook the many mistakes I will make in this brief         summary.                         Somebody shoots another person by firing a gun.  The person         is brought to trial, and there are a variety of arguments a person can         use.  One is that he is a victim of epilepsy.  Admiring a gun that is         part of his collection, he had a seizure and his finger squeezed the         trigger and fired a bullet at somebody else.                         The next level is he's insane or, to put it bluntly, he         is crazy.  He doesn't know the difference between right and wrong         and thinks the voices of Satan are directing him to do it.                         The next level is duress.  Someone pressed a gun to his         temple and said, ""If you don't shoot this bullet through this         window and hit this person, I will blow your brains out.""                         The next level up is diminished capacity, which is kind of         an adolescent version of insanity.  They're kids.  They're not         quite sure what they're doing.  They're 14 years old.                         On the next level up is prior abuse or neglect of the sort         pled by those two wealthy, young Beverly Hills men who pumped 12 rounds         of 00 buckshot into their parents and watched them die because, as         their lawyer later claimed, they had been the victim of abuse when they         were ten years younger.                         And then the next level up are life experiences generally,         in which you could put alcoholism.                         And then finally at the highest level — I'm skipping         several — is pure choice.                         Now, defense lawyers will go into court and try to  push         the argument back toward causation, and prosecutors will go into the         court and try to push the argument back towards pure choice.                         Now, in this case, there is a solution to the problem.          That is to say a judge and a jury must make a decision that is either a         yes or no decision.  The person is guilty or innocent or possibly not         guilty by reason of insanity.                         And in making their judgments, they asked the question:  to         what extent was the person able to control his behavior?  And the         control judged by a contemporary social scientist may not be very         large, but though they would probably excuse epilepsy and insanity and         perhaps duress from diminished capacity all the way up to pure choice,         they tend to collapse it into the category of pure choice.                         Now, what evidence do they have to back it up?  I think the         evidence they have, which the judges sometime state and sometimes not,         is that we can think of people who had the same prior abuse, prior         neglect, diminished capacity, alcoholism, et cetera, who didn't         shoot anybody, and since people with these conditions can avoid         shooting other people, the fact that you chose to shoot somebody else         means that whatever your circumstances may be, you made a choice that         you didn't have to make.                         Now, this is not the problem that society faces because         society does not have a judge or a jury, and society increasingly, in         my view, over the last half century has begun to say that social         controls, society's effort to judge somebody as innocent or guilty,         have been profoundly weakened because to judge somebody as guilty,         society must use such things as shame or stigma, and increasingly we         are told that shame and stigma are a bad idea.                         And, indeed, the people who go to Paul and say,         ""I've got stage fright,"" or, ""I am sexually         incontinent,"" or the other will hear from him a response that         says, ""This isn't a medical condition. You should be ashamed         of this.""                         And what they're going to do is drop Paul as their         psychiatrist and go to somebody else, and they will find other people         who will say, ""Yes, we certainly mustn't use the word         'shame' and 'stigma.'""                         Society does not want to be judgmental.  Being         nonjudgmental is a good thing.  So I think the problem that the         exchange between Leon and Paul raises should not be limited to the         definition of what is medical in the eyes of a medical professional,         but rather should be viewed as the general social problem of how we         define personal responsibility and the fact that in my opinion, which         could be wrong, we have changed profoundly the extent to which we judge         people as acting improperly, and we are reluctant to impose social         rewards and punishments to induce them to act properly.                          PROF. GEORGE:   Leon, could I ask a question of Jim?                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Please.                          PROF. GEORGE:   Jim, I followed that, I think, completely,         and it certainly sounded right to me, but I just wondered about a         statement you made very early on in the presentation and its         compatibility with what followed, and that was the statement that all         human behavior is caused, unless you mean by that simply that there are          empirical conditions of all human behavior, including choices that         constrain the options for effective choice.                          PROF. WILSON:   Yes.                          PROF. GEORGE:   Is that all that that meant?                          PROF. WILSON:   Yes, I probably shouldn't have used the         phrase, but behavior is caused in the sense that some combination of         biological imperatives, cultural traditions, personal choice, and the         nature of immediate circumstances leads persons to exercise Option A         rather than Option B.                         I mean nothing more profound than that, and you can strike         the word ""cause"" if that seems to become a motive.                        PROF. GEORGE:   No, in philosophy there's a big                literature about the distinction between reasons and causes.                    PROF. WILSON:   I understand.                          PROF. GEORGE:   And I was just wondering whether you were         rejecting the idea that there could be reasons that are something         independent of the causes.                          PROF. WILSON:   No, no.                          PROF. GEORGE:   And I take it you —                          PROF. WILSON:   I am not rejecting the notion that all         behavior is caused and part of the causes are the reasons people         developed to make a point.                          PROF. GEORGE:   Yeah.                          DR. McHUGH:  And if I could just enter, too, into this very         interesting comment you've made, Jim, and it's this issue of         stigma.  And it is often said that psychiatrists and doctors and all of         us should give up on stigma, and that is certainly true for the         diseases in psychiatry.  We want to give up on stigma.  In epilepsy we         want to give up the stigma on bipolar disorder.                         But everyone knows that no one is giving up the stigma on         certain behaviors.  Smoking behavior is the most stigmatized behavior         right now in our country.  It's stigmatized and not tolerated.                         In point of fact, your other statement that if I did         stigmatize this to a person — again, we have to remember that we made         a pig with wings here with Robby — that he would run away.                         In point of fact, that's not my experience.  People who         come in with the concern that, gee, my behavior is liable to get me         into trouble and hear from me that, yes, it will get you into trouble         and it should if you continue it would then ask me and do ask me not         only how they can avoid it, but how they might look at it in a         different way, stigmatizing it appropriately and thinking about it in         its relationship to its effect on others.                         And, by the way, most of them stay with me and say,         ""You know, I never thought of that before,"" when they give as         their cause that they're doing this because their feelings matter         and their feelings are driving them, and their feelings are the cause,         and they hear from me and from other psychiatrists that, you know, when         you grow up your feelings don't matter to most people.  It's         just your behavior that does.                         And they always say, ""That's a very remarkable         statement to hear,"" and stay with me as their behavior gets         better.                          PROF. WILSON:   People keep coming back to you, Paul,         because you have such an engaging personality.                         (Laughter.)                          PROF. WILSON:   You can stigmatize them without using the         word ""stigma.""                         (Laughter.)                          DR. McHUGH:  Well, that's —                          PROF. WILSON:   But I would be willing to bet you that the         search for non-stigmatic relief is more widespread than your own office         experience would be.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Alfonso and then Bill May and then Janet         and then Bill.                          DR. GÓMEZ-LOBO:   This is going to be a very brief and         perhaps minor remark.  I'm just trying to think for my own benefit         about the more general context, and I tend to think that this is a         really particular case of something much deeper and much more pervasive         in Western culture and Western history.                          What I have in mind is something like this.  I would bet         that 30 years ago most people made financial decisions on their own,         you know, whether they were going to buy stocks or bonds, et cetera.                         Nowadays, I think most people would deeply hesitate to do         this before consulting an advisor, financial advisor, or I found this         out some time ago.  People who are going to send their kids to college         now can go to a college choice counselor.                         Now, what does this mean?  It means that socially we have         tended to parcel reality and to assume that there are people that         within a domain have something close to an algorithm to make the         decision.                         The reason why we go to a physician is because we trust         that the physician is going to have symptoms, et cetera, in front of         her and then come to the conclusion, oh, you have pneumonia, and then         the solution is going to come.                         So I'm not surprised at all about the medicalization,         this tendency to reduce things to treatment that can be controlled         because this tendency in our culture is a tendency to find areas of         control, and naturally enough to displace the prudential approach to         those fields, which I think is what Paul is alluding to, and also the         moral deliberation, the moral reasoning about those fields.                         If a field is dominated by a specialist, of course, we can         withdraw and say, ""Well, that's where the responsibility         lies.""                         So what I'm just suggesting is that we really immerse         in a much broader thrust of our culture to control certain areas of         behavior by handing them over to people  who would know how to decide.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Bill May.                          DR. MAY:   Well, it's very interesting hearing you,         Alfonso, talk like Ivan Ilyich, the broader professionalization of life         in all aspects.                          DR. GÓMEZ-LOBO:   My source is actually Aristotle.                          DR. MAY:   Yeah.  Well, the pathology, however, is a very         large and growing, modern one.  You know, professionals hang out a         shingle, and in doing that it specifies a little further and you invite         certain strangers in to deal with, but at the same time, of course, off         the streets comes an awful lot of things that are unbidden and not         asked for.                         And now you end up.  You've got a moral alternative         there as a professional.  You can preserve the purity of your         specialization and say, ""But I don't deal with that,"" and         therefore refrain from medicalizing everything or lawyers legalizing         everything and so forth across the board in the professionals.                         But on the other hand, at the same time, you happen to be         neighbor to the problem because they've come in and you're         nearest to that problem, a little bit like 19th Century doctors who         became aware of the problem of sanitation even though they were not         sanitary engineers.                         Of course, in that case you saw the social remedy, and that         led to important improvements in health care that were not available         directly through the efforts  of the professional, but you are neighbor         to the problem, and it may be a rather privileged moment for that         individual.                         She can't talk to her husband.  The relation is frozen         in all sorts of ways.  They've moved at least once every five         years.  Other forms of help and larger family and so forth are quite         distant, and so forth.  And he or she has come to you with a problem.                         Now, have you medicalized everything by not simply turning         attentive ear?  It's a moment that may pass, and you have further         responsibilities.  It seems to me that you may not be fully paid for if         you stick simply to treating disorders, but in your ascending scale         interrupting behaviors, guiding dispositions, and reframing life         stories, you're moving farther away from the medical, but humanly         you have certain responsibilities.                         And how can we sort this out in such a way that one does         not escape ones responsibilities as human being in order to preserve         the purity of professional identity?                         High school teachers or junior high teachers maybe even         more than senior high are in a position of privileged neighbor when         things aren't working out well with mother and father and so forth,         and that's not what they teach, but they have a privileged position         close to that problem.                         Now, we have — and this is where Leon's economic         issue, concern here.  It's easier to get compensation for this kind         of time expended in life if one can define it as medical, and so we end         up medicalizing an awful lot through the economic pressure here, but we         don't want excessively to shrink responsibility simply in order to         avoid medicalizing problems.                          DR. McHUGH:  And I think, Bill, if you look at the history         of some of the great advances in psychiatry over the last several         decades, it has been just exactly this being neighbor to a certain         problem and then helping the society, the culture, the school and the         like to enhance what it's doing for the betterment not just of this         particular patient, but for people in general.                         I mean, much of the advances, for example, in child         psychiatry have been in relationship to speaking to the schools,         offering a wide spectrum of opportunities for children to succeed in.          Once it was recognized that it helped children to become adults if they         had had some kind of success earlier in life that came out of first         looking at the individual patients, but ultimately it spoke to the         public at large as to how a school should have a variety of things,         from athletics out to scholarly work, to give more people a chance to         succeed.                         And I think that the place, it is a very privileged place         to be close or neighbor to it.  I think that's a wonderful metaphor         you draw there because it does speak to many of our situations to which         we become responsive by calling attention to the patient and to the         society that this is the place where they could work together.                          DR. KRAUTHAMMER:   Could I make just one interjection on         this?                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Yes.                          DR. KRAUTHAMMER:   Bill, you brought up an interesting         example of the person who comes into you and you feel a responsibility         to respond humanly, even though it may not be a medical problem.                         The complication here is that she came into you because you         hung a shingle and you are a doctor.  She didn't go to the         bartender or the man on the street.                         And I felt this acutely.  I quit psychiatry exactly 25         years ago this month, an anniversary that I celebrate every year.  One         of the reasons is that I always felt that uneasiness, a sense to         respond humanly, but I was doing it because of her illusion that as a         psychiatrist or as a doctor I had a special insight or wisdom or         secret, as paul phrased it.                         And I found that by actually using that misconception on         her part, I could actually do good, essentially produce a placebo         effect, but it was under a false premise.  I knew that there wasn't         a secret, and it was in a sense a Wizard of Oz operation.                         So you've got an obligation as a human to respond, but         given the context, you're doing it under the rubric of having         special medical powers, and that creates a real complication and a         contradiction in some sense.                          DR. MAY:   Yes, although the way Paul has described his work         as a psychiatrist, he takes advantage of that in order to clarify         instead of remain behind the vail.                          DR. KRAUTHAMMER:   Well, he gives it up in the first half         hour.                          DR. MAY:  Yes.                          DR. KRAUTHAMMER:   I found out if you didn't you could         actually get a real placebo effect, and that would actually help the         patient, particularly in changing behaviors like smoking or excessive         compulsive behavior.                         I mean, hypnosis essentially, which is one of the things I         practice, is essentially a way of using that aura as a way to achieve         the results, and it actually does work remarkably.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Janet Rowley.                         DR. ROWLEY:   Well, first I have to express my                surprise when I was reading this interchange of letters to note                the comments about a lecture that I gave at Hopkins, and I certainly                want to thank Paul for his very generous comments.                  I'd like to take a different track, and Paul McHHugh also                mentioned the analogy of psychiatry being in the 19th Century as                compared to many aspects of medicine.  One could certainly see now                that we've moved to yet another century that it's in the                20th Century and not in the 21st.                   And I think that psychiatry, as well as many areas of         medicine are  both a moving target and clearly even better defined         diseases are very heterogeneous.                         I guess the concern I have about this discussion is to what         extent are we mixing medicalization with increasing scientific         understanding of the biological basis for behavior, and certainly in         many aspects of understanding brain function and interneuronal         connections and the importance of that, we're only on the         threshold, and this increasing understanding of a very complex system         is certainly going to  change both our understanding of behavior, but         also a possibility of modifying behavior.                         Now, certainly one modification of behavior can just be         learning to take advantage of other aspects of the nervous system so         you control unwanted behavior, but again, in a heterogeneous situation         where there are tails of behavior, it may well be that some additional         form of treatment might be helpful.                         But I think that it is very important that we keep         understanding that we're pretty ignorant about behavior.  We just         had a lecture on the immune system and the complexity of the         interaction of cells, B cells, T cells, antigen presenting cells, and         antigen.  The nervous system has been likened to the immune system in         that there are these multiple cellular interactions, which we are very,         very ignorant of.                         And just as cells communicate by releasing substances which         tell other cells to do other things, this is certainly true in the         nervous system as well, and we're early on in, say, understanding         homosexuality.  Some of this is almost certainly going to be due to the         lack of receptors on critical cells or the lack of ligands so that the         kind of behavior that we accept as normal does not occur in these         individuals because of these biological differences.                         And we will some time in the next several decades be able         to sort this out.  So as I say, I have concerns about worrying about         some of these things.                         Amongst the things that are listed as being medicalized are         childbirth.  I think that it's pretty clear as you look at the         statistics for maternal deaths and fetal deaths in the black population         that their lack of health care emphasizes that childbirth is not just         something that you can go off in the corn field and everything goes         well.                         And I think we also have to recognize that very soon         obesity is going to become a very serious medical problem which will         have many complex aspects of it, genetics as well as the total change         in life style, our lack of exercise, our exposure to foods that are not         good for us.  All of these things are going to be important.                         But we have to then look at a very complicated response to         this major health problem, and one response may well be some aspect of         involving medicine or drugs at the same time as we also try to help         people understand how they can change other things so that we don't         have this problem, which leads to very serious, fatal medical         consequences.                         So this is a long winded expression of concern that we look         at this in a broader context and are sort of cautious as to coming back         to Michael Sandel, is this a problem or why is it a problem or what         problem might we as a council be able to provide advice and guidance         on?                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Okay.  We are late in the hour.  I have         just — Frank, did you want a very quick thing?  Bill is in queue.                        PROF. FUKUYAMA:   I mean, Janet, it seems to me                that that doesn't really — it fails to recognize how politicized                a lot of this is, and homosexuality is a perfect example of that.                                As I understand it, homosexuality used to be classified as         a psychiatric disorder, came out of the DSM at about the same time          that ADHD went in.  All right?  We know about both of those         conditions.  Actually fairly similar.  They had biological correlates.          Over time there's been growing understanding of the biological         bases of both of those disorders, but you know, the only way that you         can actually understand the actual outcome, I think, is in terms of the         politics and the sociology of the way the society, you know, constructs         one as a disease and the other as not.                         So I think that is is true that we are .- I mean it would         be nice if there were this correlation between our understanding of the         biological causes and the way we classify these things, but there's         a huge element of social construction, I think, in the way we         understand these psychiatric disorders.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Bill —                         DR. ROWLEY:   Well, all I'm saying is I think                it's very important that we first understand that it's heterogeneous,                and that we be very cautious in how we as a council, separate from                society and politics, how we think about the broader issues.                    CHAIRMAN KASS:   Bill.                          DR. HURLBUT:   It's interesting Janet because as I         ponder the emergence of scientific knowledge as you say, I feel what         you mentioned, the possibility of interventions at various levels and         the possibility that things that we attribute to some kind of         construction of personal identity as being, in fact, driven by         underlying chemistry.                         But what impresses me even more is that our notion of cause         is changing.  We've talked here about how medicalization is really         a shift in the notion of causation, but what I would add to it is also         a shift in our sense of what is appropriate by way of cure, if you         will, for a given condition.                       When I ponder what science is teaching me as I see the underlying                processes by which the person emerges, if anything cause is becoming                more complex and instead of labeling something biological versus                whatever you call it, moral or personal character, it's beginning                to seem more and more, as it should obviously, that the emergence                of the person within the phylogenetic process was, in fact, a biological                phenomenon with significance.  In other words, if you look at all                of phylogeny, you see the steady assent from physicochemical determinism                up to an increasing sense of genuine freedom, distancing from determinism.                                So that the person actually makes a difference, has a         meaning, and allows a specificity of response that you can't get         with a chemical, and I think Paul's early letter actually had a lot         of good things about this with psychiatric treatment, is that it's         often directed at symptoms.  Symptoms are very broad, and the drugs         lack the specificity of actually remediating an individual person.                         And Charles' comment about the placebo effect and so         forth is an interesting one because at least the placebo effect engages         the reality of the person.                       The problem, it seems to me, is that a simple, materialistic cause deletes                the complexity of the cause and also the sense of solving something                with a chemical erodes the engagement of the full human person and                the manning of the human process.  So that it actually operates                too low in the chain of causation.  Therefore, it's not specific                enough.  It doesn't operate at the real level of what is causing                things, which is both chemical and at the same time the convergence                of chemistry with ideas, attitudes, memories, beliefs, and in other                words, chemistry and the underlying chemistry and the overarching                cognition that's actually part of human existence, and the proper                approach to a real human problem, not a problem that has a genuine                underlying medical or physical cause that probably is properly treated                by medicine, but the problem is that medicalization is delivering                into the medical hand and the medical gaze and the sense of where                the cure should come from, those things which are actually humanizing                in their way of being dealt with properly.                 In other words, what I'm saying is that in a sense those fullest                extensions of human nature, what you might call a mental spiritual                psyche are actually extensions of more fundamental biological agencies                so that what really makes a person a full person and a more effective                person is not just physical, but what you might call the realm of                philosophy and faith, a true integrated personal identity operating                within a cosmology, which is at once deeply humanizing.  It both                upholds the person and the process of the person alike.                   I mean, in the final end what's going to happen with         this medicalization is we're going to medicalize morality itself so         that we think that there isn't really any free agency.  There is         victimhood.                         And this is what is the most corrosive quality of         evolutionary psychology.  It essentially deletes the higher order         meaning of human consciousness.  It actually converts ultimately         everything to a simplistic medical explanation, deletes human fullness,         and in the process converts everything into what you were calling         earlier a libidinal problem just driven by unconscious drives and         desires over which we have no agency.                         In the final end then all of criminal behavior, all of         behavior will be simply medical problems deleting the person and the         meaning of life itself.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you.                         We are at 12:30.  We have guests coming at two         o'clock.  The hour is late.  I'll spare you a summary.                         Please be prompt for our guests.                        (Whereupon, at 12:29 p.m., the meeting was recessed                for lunch, to reconvene at 2:00 p.m., the same day.)                                   CHAIRMAN KASS:   This afternoon we turn our attention to         biotechnology and public policy, the regulation of the uses of         biotechnology, the domain of activities touching the beginnings of         human life.                         Although we will be at this topic for the next four         sessions, I would like at least to set the stage with some general         remarks so that council members will be reminded of what we're         about and that our guests might understand also perhaps more clearly         than they would have beforehand what's going on here.                         The council at its very first meeting signaled an interest         in exploring how, if at all, the existing regulatory mechanisms in the         United States addressed the ethical, moral and social issues that arise         from advances in biomedical science and technology.                         Some members of the council suggested that perhaps new         regulatory institutions might need to be devised.  Others were         skeptical, especially in the absence of knowledge of how well the         current arrangements worked; in fact, first of all, what they were and         then how well they worked, and also which principles should guide any         such new activities.                         In the council's 2002 report, ""Human Cloning and         Human Dignity,"" a suggestion emerged for pursuing this interest         regarding regulation in the context of a specific domain larger than         cloning itself.  Members observed that for the activities at the         intersection of assisted reproduction, pre-implantation, genetic         diagnosis, and human embryo research, and I quote the report:                         ""We lack comprehensive knowledge about what is being         done, with what success, at what risk, under what ethical guidelines,         respecting which moral boundaries, subject to what oversight and         regulation, and with what sanctions for misconduct or abuse.  If we are         to have wise public policy regarding these scientifically and medically         promising but morally challenging activities, we need careful study and         sustained public moral discourse on this general subject and not only         on the narrowly defined pieces of the field, i.e., cloning.""                         And not long after the release of the report, the council         members agreed to undertake a thoroughgoing inquiry into the current         regulation of those biotechnologies that touch the beginnings of human         life simply to inform ourselves of what the current situation is on the         ground.                         And the staff has been preparing materials on this, and         tomorrow council members will be discussing the discussion document         that comes out of, is in response to the council's charge.                         In the process of doing this work, we thought it absolutely         imperative that various stakeholders and their representatives in this         field, which ethical principles and which human goods were important to         them and deserved to be either promoted or protected in this activity         sine, after all, one cannot devise regulatory activities, and one         certainly can't evaluate them if one doesn't know what it is         one is seeking either to advance or to safeguard.                         And we thought that our work would be incomplete and         improper if we didn't actually hear from the various people who had         an interest in this, whether scientists and physicians or patients and         their advocates, or public policy people or bioethicists and the like.                         And we requested submissions, and we received quite a         number, and from that group of submissions, we have invited a group of         people to join us here today, and on behalf of the entire council I         want to thank all of you here for your written submissions and for your         willingness to come and join us today.                         The two major questions on which, as you know, we want your         help on are:   what are the human goods and values that should antimate         monitoring the regulatory activities in this area or things that should         be promoted or protected?                         And then, secondarily, how well do you think current         practices are succeeding in promoting and protecting these goods and         values?                         In short, what do and should we care about in this domain         and how are we doing and, implicitly, what might we do to do it better?                         The two sessions this afternoon, although they have no         absolute division and people are free to say whatever it is that         they're prepared to talk about, we have more or less tried to         organize them so that the first panel will be to discuss more of the         reproductive side of this activity, that is to say the assisted         activities that help people produce children augmented by — and I want         to emphasize this — augmented by the growing powers of genetic         screening and selection.                         That's really in a way what's new, the major new         thing in the area of assisted reproduction.                         And in the second session we will attend more to the         research side, including also the commercial aspects of this activity.                         A couple of words of explanation because I know that when         people talk about regulation everybody gets nervous.  We should make         quite clear what we are not doing.  We are not here with any         preconceived plan that anything beyond the status quo is necessary or         desirable, and we do not constitute ourselves a body to design new         regulatory activities.  That's not our mandate.                         At the moment, we are interested in getting information and         some diagnosis with some evaluation of the status quo.  What you see is         what you've got.  There are no hidden agendas.                         People say that in Washington.  In this case it's true.                         Second, the council staff has prepared a discussion         document which we have withheld from you, from the presenters, partly         because we didn't want you to react to what it was that we had         found, but we waned to hear your presentations fresh as you see it.                         The document will be available tomorrow here, posted on our         Web site, I think Monday at the latest, perhaps even tomorrow         afternoon.  It is not a council report.  It is a discussion document         prepared by staff for the council members, and we certainly hope to         have your reaction to this document in addition to the benefits of your         presentations today.                                 Session 3: Biotechnology and Public                Policy:                 Assisted Reproduction and Reproductive Genetics                    CHAIRMAN KASS:   The procedure this afternoon, although many         of you have submitted things which are longer than what could be read         in five minutes, we will stick to the five-minute allotment of         presentation.  We will then have the presentations, all five in order.          Council members have seen and read your submitted statements.  So you         can presume them as part of our understanding, and then we will have         discussion.                         And the order is slightly different.  We listed you in         alphabetical order, but we'd like to go in the following order, and         let me introduce people so that you all know who's here, and then         we'll just proceed.                         First, welcome Pamela Madsen, who is the Executive Director         of the American Infertility Association, to my left.                         Mary Mahowald, who is Professor Emeritus of the Department         of Obstetrics and Gynecology, McLean Center for Clinical Medical Ethics         and the Committee on Genetics at the University of Chicago.                         Dr. Robert Brzyski, President of the Society for Assisted         Reproductive Technology.                         Kathy Hudson, who is the Director of the Genetics and         Public Policy Center at Johns Hopkins University.                         And David Smith, the Professor of Religious Studies and         Director of the Pointer Center at Indiana University.                         Welcome to you all.  Thank you in advance, and we look         forward to hearing from you, and we'll start with Ms. Madsen,         please.                          MS. MADSEN:   I was third, but that's okay.                         Well, good afternoon, Dr. Kass, and —                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Excuse me.  Might I ask you to move the         microphone a little closer or else have someone to amplify this a bit         more?                         Thank you.                          MS. MADSEN:   There we go.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Yeah.                          MS. MADSEN:   All right.  Good afternoon, ladies and         gentlemen, Dr. Kass.  I'm honored to speak on behalf of the         estimated six million Americans whose lives are compromised and         sometimes devastated by infertility.                       As the Executive Director of the American Infertility Association,                one of the nation's leading patient advocacy organizations and                a personal veteran of the infertility wars, I can assure you that                our vast community is deeply concerned about the issues raised by                this council.                   What is at stake here is nothing less than the quality of         our lives and for those of generations to come.  This is why any policy         discussion of bioethics and regulation of assisted reproductive         medicine must have at its core the welfare of the people most         affected:  the patients, our children, and the children that we all         hope to have.                         As a group, we are educated, reasonable, and well informed,         and we are persistent, determined to overcome the cruel twists of fate         that leave us unable to reproduce without medical intervention.                         We would prefer to have what is usually a private matter         between consenting adults remain a private decision.  It's our         believe that no governmental or religious body should control these         uniquely individual decisions.                       In my case, it was a leap of faith that gave my husband and me                two boys, both IVF babies conceived through assisted reproductive                technology when it was in its early years.  Our 14 year old was                made the new old-fashioned way, with Mommy's egg, Daddy's                sperm, no micromanipulation, and a fresh embryo transfer.                 Our ten-year-old grew from a cryopreserved embryo, held over from                one of our previous cycles at a time when freezing and thawing were                considered newer technologies.  It was an informed choice, and we                knew the success rates at that time were not very encouraging.                   Our tenacity paid off with a healthy baby boy who hit is         first home run last week in Little League.                         We have our family precisely because my husband and I were         able to make that most private choice unencumbered by any government,         social, and research policy.  The science was sprinting.  This country         had taken the lead in finding new ways to outwit, if not vanquish, the         disease of infertility.                         The technology was available.  It cost, but it was there         for us to use, and for that we are eternally grateful.                       The freedom to avail ourselves of progressive techniques is what                we need.  For those afflicted with infertility, assisted reproduction                transcends ideology or electorial politics.  It is about the opportunity                to realize the possibility of family.                   Yet to our dismay we have been drawn into battles far from         our own immediate struggle, and it is the belief of the American         Infertility Association that productive medicine is being dragged most         unwillingly into abortion politics.                       Why?  Because our treatment results in the creation of an embryo.                                 However, we all must remember that these embryos are a part         of our medical treatment to combat our infertility.  We take issue with         the presumption that others can lay claim to what is rightfully ours.          We are incensed that we become the lightning rod of often vicious         political debate around what some refer to as, I quote, ""excess         embryos.""                         Medical investigators want them for stem cell, DNA,         research, disease cure research.  Anti-abortionists want our embryos to         be donated to others who want to experience pregnancy.                         And those are all perfectly reasonable options, but they         are options that belong to us, the individuals who created those         embryos.  Every decision about their disposition is emotionally         fraught, even the choice to do nothing.  To keep them suspended in         liquid nitrogen is hard.  Trust me.  I have four.  They're         sitting.  It's hard.                       Those of us who have gone through the unimaginable, life-altering                experience of assisted reproduction have and should have the right                to determine the fate of those three or five cells because their                fate is bound with ours.                   Unfortunately, we must depend on the intellectual and         scientific creativity of researchers and clinical practitioners to         develop the technologies that we need.  We expect our elected and         appointed officials to help insure a hospitable environment for         research and clinical practice of integrity.                         We expect our government to take an enlightened approach to         the science and encourage it, not impede it.                         And we expect those who are weighing in on the most         intimate part of our lives to please respect the intimate nature of the         infertility experience.                       Further, we demand unimpeachable ethical behavior from all because there's                nothing on our agenda but children, healthy, normal children, regular                boys and girls who make it into this world because we can pursue                and should have equal access to a constantly evolving and expanding                array of therapies.                   To date, more than one million IVF children have been born,         and they, for all intents and purposes, are indistinguishable from         everyone else, and that is what we want.                         You will find few others as keenly aware of the ethical         ambiguities of assisted reproductive technology than the infertile.  We         struggle with the large and the small philosophical, religious, and         moral implications of treatment even before we walk in the door.                         We analyze and carefully weigh the risks we knowingly         assume before undergoing sometimes still experimental procedures.                       How we resolve these dilemmas is as personal and singular as DNA.                 We, the infertile, object to the manner in which our disease and                the outcome of our treatments are increasingly depersonalized, treated                as commodities, as things apart (from) who we are.                   Even the language to us is really troublesome.  We hear         about patentable human goods when what is really under discussion are         patentable technologies.                         We hear about embryo adoption as if it was an acceptable         legal term, when what really is under discussion is embryo donation.          We worry about the government impinging on individual liberties, our         religious and cultural beliefs, by determining for us what hundreds of         years of philosophical and scientific debates have not when life         begins.                         And once again, the infertile have no wish to be roped into         that particular debate.                         Certainly the infertile community — I'm wrapping up —         the infertile community welcomes the help of a compassionate         government.  We would deeply appreciate a government commitment to         health coverage for infertility treatment for all that need it.                         We believe federal funding for research is essential to         safely expedite the process and defray the financial burden that now         falls squarely on mostly uninsured patients.                         And we need solid, long-term studies of the welfare of         infertile couples, the impact of the disease on parenting after ART         that track the health and development of our children, that yield         dependable data from large samples, and still protect privacy.  That is         how the government can protect the general good.                         We advocate the rigorous oversight of the development and         application of assisted reproductive technologies.  Indeed, we have         paid richly for the regulation already in place.                         However, it has yet to be determined that heaping on more         regulations would improve the ethical landscape.  Rather, we believe         that government participation in a joint committee of physicians,         psychologists, theologians, lawyers, as well as other professionals,         and patients, we can strengthen existing mechanisms.                         Let us have standardized informed consent and institutional         review boards for all institutions involved with experimental         infertility protocols.  Let's strive for transparency and openness,         and hold people accountable.                         We are not naive.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Ms. Madsen.                          MS. MADSEN:   Infertility patients —                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   I'm going to have to stop you.                          MS. MADSEN:   Just my last two sentences.                         We know that there are no guarantees.  We adamantly oppose         additional regulation without a concomitant throw of federal funds to         underwrite research and support access to care.                       We don't want you to slam the doors on all of those who are                happy, wanting to have children, and I apologize for speaking too                slowly.                   Thank you.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you very much.                         Professor Mahowald, please.                          PROF. MAHOWALD:   First of all, thank you for inviting me.          I really have looked forward to meeting some people that I've known         a while and admire a great deal and meeting a few others whose work         I've admired but not have had the pleasure of meeting.                         In the E-mail inviting me to this, Dean Clancy articulated         a little differently than you did, Dr. Kass, but I think the same         questions that you began this session with.  He said:  what values and         principles currently do and which ideally should guide the regulation         of assisted reproduction in the United States?                         Now, this is, in fact, two questions, one mainly applicable         to the self-regulation that prevails — that's a descriptive         question, I think — and the other applicable to government regulation         which would presumably have the force of law.                         Now, I was asked to bring to the discussion, and I'm         quoting again from Dean Clancy, the perspective of someone who's         concerned about the ethical duties owed to women and children to be in         the context of assisted reproduction.                         So with these concerns in mind, my answers to the questions         posed can be put very succinctly.  The principle that guides current         practice is the right to have a biologically related child, and the         principle that should ideally guide regulation is the principle of         justice.                         Now, in the longer piece that was distributed to you, I         talked about these themes a lot more, although I would not say         adequately in less than 3,000 words, but today I just want to highlight         some of what I wrote there, and also on the outline that I think you         have, I've identified some areas that deserve more regulation than         currently exists, and I hope we can discuss some of these later.                         In her presentation to the council, Sandra Carson         identified three values as central to professional self-regulation:          safety, efficacy, and privacy.  Now, these are necessarily addressed         through the basic bioethical principles of respect for autonomy,         non-maleficence, beneficence, and the right to have a biologically         related child is attributed to potential parents on grounds of the         first of those, respect for their autonomy.                         Justice, the fourth basic principle of bioethics, serves a         mediating or balancing function when other principles or values cannot         simultaneously be upheld.                         Now, regarding my first answer, the right to have a         biologically related child, this is a relative and negative right.          It's relative or contingent rather than absolute because its         exercise depends not only on the cooperation of others, but also on         factors that may prevent its expression even then.                         It's a negative right rather than positive because it         only obliges others not to interfere with its expression.  It does not         oblige them to positively assist or facilitate its exercise.                         The right to have a biologically related child is usually         asserted with a crucial caveat that the child be healthy, and in her         presentation to the council, Dr. Carson made it clear that the         potential child's health is a goal of infertility treatment.                         But the right to biological progeny doesn't necessarily         entail the right to healthy progeny.  Some patients give priority to         health by undergoing preimplantation or prenatal diagnosis to avoid         having children who are unhealthy or disabled.                         For the potential child it's seldom, if ever, better         not to be than to be unhealthy, if these are the only alternative.                         Regarding my second answer, even a minimalist approach to         government regulation should be based on some conception of justice.          The conception that I would propose draws on the work of Nobel Laureate         Amartya Sen.  This view eschews a policy of political correctness that         ignores differences, insisting instead on attention to differences that         provide advantages to some while disadvantaging others.                         It starts from the premise that people are of equal value         despite our differences, and it calls for efforts to reduce inequities         that are often associated with the differences among us.                         Differences that need to be examined to develop just         regulation of assisted reproduction include those based on gender,         class, age, marital status, sexuality, ability, ethnicity, and moral         beliefs.  I won't bother trying to give you examples of all of         these, but regarding gender, for example, women obviously incur risky,         invasive, and uncomfortable or painful procedures that men don't         experience even when the treatment is for male infertility.                         Accordingly, women's decisions should generally have         priority over those of their male partners if these are at odds, and it         should not be assumed without question that the priorities of both         members of a couple are always the same.                         Regarding class, economically disadvantaged women and         couples often don't have access to medical treatment for         infertility or they only have access to suboptimal treatment.  The         recent cases of octuplet and septuplet births are probable examples of         suboptimal treatment.                         If the right to have a biologically related child is         fundamental, then justice demands that infertility treatment not be         withheld from                         individuals solely on grounds of their ability to pay for it.                       Regarding age, the right to have a biologically related child                is more compelling for those who are in their reproductive years,                than for naturally and healthy post-menopausal women.  Moreover,                if as a society we regard all children as of equal value, a recommendation                that supports the right to have a biologically related child should                be articulated in the context of a broader and more basic right                of children to be parented.                   On grounds of justice, the right to have a child already         born, regardless of whether the child is biologically related, is more         compelling than the right to have a biologically related child who has         not yet been conceived.                       In a pluralistic society such as ours, justice demands attention to                moral differences, and with regard to infertility treatment, many                of these stem, as you said, from different positions on the moral                status of the embryo.                   But U.S. law is clear that a woman has a right to abortion         which entails destruction of embryos at least until fetal viability.          If moral differences ought to be respected, clinicians may be, I think,         required to offer alternatives consistent with their patient's         moral beliefs, and researchers should be encouraged to develop more of         these alternatives.                         In sum, and to repeat my answer to the question I was         asked, the right to have a biologically related child is the main guide         to current treatment of infertility, and the principle of justice is         the ideal guide for regulation.                         Both principles should be supported, I think, in the         council's recommendations.  In cases of conflict though, justice         should have priority.                         Thank you.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you very much.                         Dr. Brzyski.                          DR. BRZYSKI:   Dr. Kass, members and guests, I appreciate         the opportunity to speak on behalf of the Society for Assisted         Reproductive Technology regarding the regulation of ART.                         By way of introduction, let me provide some background         about the society, SART, as we refer to it.                         The idea for SART began in 1985 with a group of         professionals who convened an effort to foster development of the field         and communication within the field.                         One of their first efforts and priorities was to publish an         annual report of IVF technology to foster that communication         development.                         In 1988, the society was founded formally, and that first         annual report was published as it has been every year since then by the         society.                         Today there are approximately 370 member programs of SART         that are responsible for the vast majority of the 100,000 cycles of ART         and 35,000 babies that are born annually in the United States.                         SART's mission is to promote and advance the standards         for the practice of assisted reproductive technology for the benefit of         our patients, our members, and society at large.  I would state that         the explicit benefit we seek for our patients is healthy children.                         To meet this mission, SART's activities comprise         several varied efforts.  First, the registry oversees the collection of         annual clinic-specific data for publication by the Centers for Disease         Control, and in fact, the registry was responsible for the development         of the current data collection software program that is the basis of         that system.                         SART provides the validation process which reviews the data         quality and accuracy submitted by the programs.  Not just SART members,         but any IVF program is required to submit data annually, and that         validation occurs by state visits of peers to the programs with chart         reviews and reviews of the medical records and laboratory data.                         Quality assurance efforts by SART provides a process for         assessment and promotion of member performance through consultative         services provided by SART members.  The Practice Committee continually         develops and reviews guidelines and all aspects of ART, and all members         are expected to abide by those guidelines, which include ethical         guidelines as developed in conjunction with the American Society for         Reproductive Medicine.                         I have reviewed the current regulatory landscape as I see         it in my invited written comments to the council in April.  This slide         shows a summary.  Here I will just emphasize again that today as we         meet that there are a variety of regulatory processes operating at the         federal, state, and professional level.                         In the short time I have, I'd like to point out some         characteristics of professional regulations as I see them and provide         some observations on the principles that I believe should inform         regulation.                         First, I would argue that the peer dialogue that is the         basis of professional regulation promotes engagement and investment in         the issues at hand by all of the parties involved.  Attitude and         environment for professionalism fosters commitment to professional         objectives.                         Second, in contrast to legislative mechanisms of         regulation, professional regulation and professional regulatory         mechanisms support timely engagement of new issues.  This is important         in fields such as assisted reproduction when progress is so rapid.                         A final comment I would make is that associating         professional performance with economic consequences creates, I believe,         an opportunity to influence behavior.  For example, tying participation         in a large insurance program by an IVF practice to board certification         or professional society membership provides leverage to those boards         and those societies to regulate and influence professional behavior.                         That being said, I'll just make a few comments         regarding principles of regulation which I touched upon, again, in more         detail in my written comments in April.                         First, I think beneficence considerations obligate an         analysis of the cost and benefits of any regulatory schema because in         the current environment, patients are the primary bearers of the cost         of care.  These costs entail terrible burdens to patients and prevent         many from ever receiving the necessary care.                         Justice considerations require that regulation not         discriminate against individuals based on their inability to reproduce         without assistance.  Given the vital importance of reproduction and         human life, justice and regulatory objectives are both served by         promoting expanded insurance coverage for ART.                         Likewise justice and beneficence would be served and a         significant regulatory infrastructure would be brought to bear if         federal support for ART research were promoted.                         Finally, the principle of autonomy requires that         reproduction be recognized as fundamentally private, and that this most         intimate relationship between couples should not be unduly scrutinized         or compromised by regulatory interventions.                         As to the future, SART will continue to foster and promote         collaborations with various professional organizations, government, and         bureaucratic organizations, such as collaboration with the Centers for         Disease Control for data collection, collaboration with the Food and         Drug Administration regarding  guidelines to inform their oversight         efforts, a collaboration with the Joint Commission for Hospital Review         and their efforts to oversee laboratory regulation in the IVF field,         and collaboration with our patient advocacy groups with whom we have         had a rich and successful history.                         The final comment I would make is I want to thank the         council for bringing this social dialogue to the forefront.  I think         that's probably the most important effort that you could pursue,         and it's the fundamental basis to make ethical judgments that we         understand the social environment, that voices are heard, and that         information is collected so that informed decisions can be made.                         I thank you again, and I look forward to further progress         in the field.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you very much.                         Dr. Hudson.                          DR. HUDSON:   Dr. Kass, members of the council, thank you         very much for the invitation to speak before you today.                         I'm Kathy Hudson, the Director of the Genetics and         Public Policy Center at Johns Hopkins University.                         The center is a little bit over a year old, and we were         created to build tools and resources to help policy makers and the         public address issues emerging from advances in human genetics.                         Our first project is on reproductive genetics, funded by         the Pew Charitable Trusts.  As this committee knows and has discussed,         the fusion of advances in genetic science and advances in human         reproductive medicine have brought forth new technologies that give         parents unprecedented new powers to identify, select, and perhaps in         the future to modify the genetic characteristics of their children.                         The specific aims of our attention to reproductive genetics         are listed here.  We want to understand what the public is thinking         about reproductive genetics.  We want to engage them in a conversation         about reproductive genetics.                         We would like to create objective, comprehensive, and         hopefully comprehensible information resources, and ultimately to         develop a set  of policy options that can be considered by the public         and its representatives.                         We will not be creating individual recommendations, but         rather, an array of options with robust underlying analysis that can be         used by others in making decisions.                         Dr. Kass, in the center's written comments, we         responded to the council's request for information about the         current regulatory and legal landscape.  This morning I would like to         make two points.                         The first is that I think it's quite clear that         safeguarding and improving human health is the key motivation and key         principle that guides genetics not only in the research laboratory, but         in the clinical context, and similarly reproductive medicine research         and its practice.  And yet I believe there are weaknesses in the         current system.                         Second, I'd like to point out that public participation         must be a core principle that guides policy development, process, and         choices.                         So of the core values or principles that should guide         reproductive genetics policy, safeguarding human health is perhaps the         easiest to identify, to understand, and ostensibly to address, and yet         there are weaknesses in the current system of policy, and I use the         term ""policy"" quite broadly to include research policy, that         have significant implications for human health.                         As Pam addressed, as did Robert, there are now over a         million babies that have been born worldwide through assisted         reproductive technologies.  And yet in the United States, we do not         have an effective system to monitor the health and developmental         outcomes of these children.                         There have been a number of studies that have produced         sometimes confusing, sometimes contradictory, and often incomplete         information about the health status and developmental outcomes of these         children.                         To make sense of this information, the center this week         convened a panel co-sponsored by the American Academy of Pediatrics and         the American Society for Reproductive Medicine to evaluate the current         medical knowledge and to make recommendations for future research to         resolve uncertainties and fill gaps in our knowledge.                         The second example of a weakness in the current         reproductive genetics policy is the absence of a well paved and clearly         marked road that genetic tests must traverse in moving from the         research laboratory into widespread clinical use.  While the accuracy,         reliability, and interpretability is important for all genetic tests,         it is particularly critical in the reproductive genetic testing         context.                         There are now over 900 genetic tests that are available         clinically or that are in development, and it's possible to do         genetic testing at virtually every point in the human reproductive         cycle.  We can test parents.  We can select gametes based on the         presence of sex chromosomes.  We can test embryos, fetuses, and         newborns.                         In the reproductive context, it is often the genetics test         alone that is the sole clinical information available for making         important decisions.  Attempting a pregnancy or not, implanting an         embryo or not, continuing a pregnancy or not, these are profoundly         important decisions, and thus we need to have the very highest degree         of confidence that the genetic test results and their interpretation         are accurate.                         So I believe there are weaknesses in the current system of         oversight and policy that result in an inadequate understanding of the         health risks of these technologies and an inadequate assurance of the         health and safety of their use.                         Briefly, on the second point, I would like to propose that         a fundamental core principle that should govern the process by which         policy decisions about reproductive genetics are made in the United         States, and that principle is the public's participation.  The         public should have a voice in public policies about reproductive         genetics.                         The goods and values that are advanced and embodied by         policies governing reproductive genetics should be the goods and values         that are held most dear by the citizens in this democracy, and yet we         have only the faintest glimpse of what our citizens hope for and fear         in this new realm.                         We don't know largely because we haven't asked.  As         you have heard from other speakers during the course of your         deliberations, other nations when trying to develop a regulatory         framework for these issues have turned to its citizens.  Both Canada         and the United Kingdom consulted with tens of thousands of citizens in         their consideration of human genetics policies.                         The Genetics and Public Policy Center is engaged in a         modest effort to understand and listen to the voices of the public.  We         took an initial pulse through a survey last fall.  We recently         completed 21 focus groups with Americans in five cities around the         country, and we're now conducting over 200 interviews with         individuals who have special experience, expertise, or perspective.                         The themes and hypotheses emerging from this work will be         validated and tested in a very large survey of citizens this fall, and         in addition, this winter we will be engaging groups of citizens to         learn about genetics, to learn about reproductive medicine, to learn         about governance, and then provide to us their ideas and input about         how we should move forward.                         The center will use this input along with our extensive         policy analysis to construct an array of options that can be considered         as society grapples with the development and use of these technologies.                       In closing, I'd like to quote Thomas Jefferson, who certainly had                some interesting perceptions of genetics and the nature of families,                and he said, ""I know no safe depository of the ultimate powers                of society but the people themselves, and if we think them not enlightened                enough to exercise their control with wholesome discretion, the                remedy is not to take it from them, but to inform their discretion                by education.""                   Thank you for your attention.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you very much.                         Professor Smith.                          DR. SMITH:   It's an honor to be asked to be here, and         I'll promise nothing but brevity, and I'll be rather         conclusory.                         I'm going to talk very briefly about two things.  One         is parenting and the importance of children, and the other is embryonic         life, which I think are issues the council has obviously addressed, but         seem to me to be central.                         I'm going to say four things about parenting and the         importance of children.  The first is I think it's correct to say         that having biological children is a good fortune, a gift, or a         blessing rather than a right.                         Secondly, I think adoption is an option that should always         be presented to and be considered by parents seeking fertility         services.                         Thirdly, techniques, such as prenatal genetic diagnosis         that select among gametes or embryos, may, I think, appropriately be         used so long as they're proven safe and respectful of embryonic         life.                       Fourthly, my intuition is to support regulation by interdisciplinary                boards with a professional as well as a lay component, whether they                be local or regional.  More general regulations seems to me to be                very likely to get things wrong.                   With reference to embryonic life, I take the view         theologically that it's a kind of vestigial image of God.  It's         not to be created to be sacrificed, but unlike those of us sitting         around the table, it's usable for research when there's no         prospect of implantation or development.  They are, as others have         said, potential people, but not possible people.                         And I'll stop there and make up for some other time.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you very much.                         Let me start.  I think there are lots of people around the         table with questions of their own.  Let me put a couple of questions         forward.                         This one, I guess start with Dr. Brzyski, if I might.                         I'm interested in how the professional standards,         especially the professional ethical guidelines established by the         society and by SART are forced.  I mean it in the broadest sense.  As I         understand it, these guidelines are mostly hortatory, but it's not         obligatory that people who are members in good standing, in fact, obey         them.                         An instance known to both of us, at least one member of the         society that advertises publicly that they, in fact, engage in PGD for         nonmedically related sex choice.  And yet this is an activity         discouraged in the society's own guidelines.                         I don't want to argue through that particular case, but         if one wanted to trust to professional self-regulation and that there         were certain kinds of values or concerns that the profession itself         had, how does the profession see to it that its own recommendations are         effective or does it and what can it do and what might it do better?                          DR. BRZYSKI:   Well, I think that I touched upon a thought,         an idea briefly in my oral presentation that I think might need to be         explored more, and that's the issue of professionalism and the         attitude of professionalism that promotes an environment where         individuals are sort of exhorted to participate and to achieve the         expectations of their professional colleagues, and that's a rather         vague way of accomplishing something, but I think it's something         that can't be ignored; that the dismissal of an attitude of being         part of a profession as opposed to having a job or having a business; I         think that those values and attitudes that go along with the membership         in a profession need to be emphasized and form more of a basic attitude         and principle with which to deal with each other.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Well, let me pursue this a little bit.  I         mean the American College of Surgeons, the American College of         Physicians have certain kinds of norms and guidelines that people who         accept membership agree to uphold, and at least in some cases, although         it doesn't happen that often, people who sort of flaunt those         recommendations, given several opportunities to reform their practice,         but since fellowship is a privilege and not a right, the colleges are         certainly free to say, ""Look.  I'm sorry.  We recommend, for         example, that ICSI is a new, relatively unstudied procedure for use in         male infertility, but we find it odd that there are some clinics now         using it at, say, 85 or 90 percent of cases not related, and that we         think that's unreasonable.  Either show cause for doing it, change         your practice, or we might have to reconsider your membership in the         society.""                         And the other professional societies, while being         collegial, nevertheless exercise more than ""please do this,""         and I wonder whether — I mean, you're a young society relative to         those others, and the guidelines are being developed as the field         grows, but certainly the coming of preimplantation genetic diagnosis         and the uses of those things beyond just reasons of the health and         prevention of serious diseases, and sex selection is just the         forerunner of this.                       It does seem to me that there are things in which the whole society                has a stake.  If it is to leave the regulation of this in the hands                of the professionals, it wants at least to have some sense that                the professionals will see to it that those kinds of norms are,                in fact, observed.                   If that sounded too much like a lawyer's brief, I         apologize, but I'm trying to sort of push the question about what         are the limits of professional self-regulation here, not in those cases         where, you know, it's certainly obvious that those things should be         followed, but in cases where some fellows think, look, the parents want         to have a girl child now.  Why not?                          Or they say, ""Look.  We want to increase our batting         average here.  So we'll use ICSI rather than something else or         we're going to start doing this kind of practice though it's         relatively untested,"" and the couples don't mind and         they've been properly informed of the risk.                         Those are the general areas for sort of professional         self-regulation and, generally speaking, enforcement or adherence.                          DR. BRZYSKI:   Well, I would say that I would agree that         this society is young, and part of the process that we go through as a         society is to plot a course of development that will cement our         recognition as setting the standards in ART as we have put as our         mission.                         And I think there's a growing collaboration that's         developing over time among several aspects of the ART field.  When it         becomes important economically, as I mentioned, for members to be         members of the society, then that's one way to leverage behavior,         and there are cases now where as I mentioned, insurance programs         require that if you're a patient and you're going to seek         assisted reproductive technology services, that those be provided by a         member of SART.                          That's I would say a minority of individuals that are         covered by those sorts of benefits, but if that became more widespread,         then that would provide some impetus for individuals to maintain         participation.                         I would say that the society believes at this point that to         try and maintain a communication with members and maintain a membership         that could be potentially influenced in the future would be more         important than taking a strong stance and depleting the membership         based on those stances which have no potential impact on behavior.                          DR. FOSTER:   Can I just ask a question in follow-up to         this?                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Dan Foster.                          DR. FOSTER:   Has ever anybody, since this is a young         society, has ever anybody who is a member of the society where peers         believe that there has been a practice that's not in accord with         the standards, been in any sense counseled or dismissed?                         As an aside, as I know you know, the residency programs in         this country are controlled by the ACGME, and in internal medicine         where I work, for example, there were strong standards about what you         had to do to trai"

Good morning.  Welcome Members of the         Council to this, our twelfth meeting.  Welcome also to members of the         public.  I'd like to recognize the presence of Dean Clancy, our         Executive Director, the Designated Federal Officer, in whose presence         we have a legal and proper meeting.                         And I would also like to take this         opportunity on behalf of the Council to express our congratulations to         Jim Wilson who yesterday received the Presidential Medal of Freedom.          Congratulations to you, Jim.                         (Applause.)                         A word of thanks to Council Members for         your loyalty and devoted service and especially this time for the         heroic amount of material that you have, I would assume, read or will         have read before long.  I warn you there is more to come, but we are in         your debt for your attention and comments, of course.  Welcome.                         The first session of this meeting,         ""The Research Imperative:  Is Research a Moral Obligation?""         does double duty in this Council.  First, it's part of our ongoing         effort at what we call a richer bioethics and second, it does have         something to contribute to the on-going discussions of the ethics of         stem cell research.  It will continue our effort to lift up to view         some of the unstated assumptions that lie behind the debates, say about         stem cell research or cloning for biomedical research, assumptions that         rarely get the attention and scrutiny that they deserve.  We've         paid some attention to the assumptions about the moral status of the         human embryo.                          At the next meeting we want to look at         the ethical and political meaning of funding or not funding ethically         controversial research in a pluralistic society.  And today, we're         going to look at the so-called imperative of research, especially         research in biomedical science that could lead to cures for diseases.                         No one doubts the great value of such         research and no one should have anything but admiration and gratitude         to the generations of scientists who have pushed back the frontier         against ignorance and who provide knowledge and techniques fruitfully         used to alleviate human suffering.                          The question is, rather, what kind of a         good is such research and what kind of an obligation do we have to         pursue it?                       Is it an unqualified obligation, a so-called perfect duty that                takes precedence over possible objections and concerns, especially                ethical ones?  Such seem to be, at least the implicit view of at                least one scientist who presented to this Council, who in so many                words indicated that this Council would be held morally responsible                for any lives that were lost should we erect any legal barriers                to cloning for biomedical research and similar opinions have been                voiced many times in the public debate in recent years.                   Others have argued that there is no moral         or social obligation to medical research at all, even if such research         were a social good and good for us, but rather an optional goal to be         pursued, one among many and by no means supreme.                         To help us continue to think about this         question, is there an imperative to research and if so, of what sort?          We're very fortunate to have with us Daniel Callahan, the         co-founder and for 27 years the Director and President of the first         bioethics think tank of the United States, The Hastings Center.  Dan         Callahan has a nose for all the tough big questions in the field, as         the titles in his résumé will show.  And moreover, the courage to try         to make other people face up to them.                         It is the tough question of the research         imperative that is the topic of his forthcoming book,  What Price         Better Health:  Hazards of the Research Imperative  and that makes         him the perfect person to get us thinking about this today.                         If I might add a note of personal         pleasure, I was a young researcher at NIH almost 35 years ago when Dan         Callahan was starting The Hastings Center and he invited me to the         first organizing meeting of what would become that center and in an         ill-fated writing venture Dan and I were co-editors of a volume called          Freedom, Coercion and the Life Sciences  for which I had written         a chapter on ""Freedom, Coercion and Asexual Reproduction""         whose arguments I've been cloning ever since.                       Dan, it's a great pleasure to have you here.  We look forward                to your presentation and discussion.                                SESSION 1: ""THE RESEARCH IMPERATIVE"":                IS RESEARCH A MORAL OBLIGATION?                   DR. CALLAHAN:   Leon and I have worked         together for a long time and I can remember my first discussion with         you, I think, at my house on Summit Drive, and we talked and you seemed         exactly the sort of person I was looking for.  You were suggested to me         by Paul Ramsey who many of you knew.                         It's a double pleasure being here         then to be with Leon and this particular Council and also because I         think I know at least two thirds of the people on the Council and         it's so nice to see you collected here.                         The term research imperative first arose         for me with an article that was in The Hastings Center Report and Paul         Ramsey used the phrase.  He engaged in really a most interesting debate         with the Jesuit theologian Richard McCormick on the question of human         subject research on children, particularly what's called         nontherapeutic research, for the sake of knowledge, rather than direct         therapeutic treatment of children.                         And McCormick argued that children should         be available for nontherapeutic research.  Their parents should be         willing to make them available as a sort of a noble sacrifice for the         good of humanity and the advancement of research.  Paul Ramsey rejected         that notion altogether, felt children should not be used in that way         and accused McCormick of falling prey to the research imperative.                         I had no particular interest in research         at that time and it had passed out of my head, but shortly thereafter I         did run across Joshua Lederberg, Nobel Laureate, former President of         the Rockefeller University who said to me at a meeting, I gather         something similar to what Leon quoted at another meeting saying         ""If we don't carry out research, the blood of those who die         will be on our hands.""                         I wondered at the time whether that was         true, but again had no particular interest in research and didn't         pay much attention to it, so it faded away.  But in recent years, all         of that sort of came back to me for a variety of reasons.  I got         interested in the whole enterprise of biomedical research in this         country, particularly in this country, although obviously it goes on in         other countries as well.                       And there were a number of things that caught my eye.  First of                all, the NIH budget is something of a federal marvel.  So far as                I know it is the only budget that hasevery year without fail gone                up rather than down.  A researcher went through all the transcripts                of hearings of the National Institutes of Health and it has always                had complete bipartisan support.  There's never been any serious                dissent of any kind.                  There has been some discussion in recent years about the priorities                of NIH, but basically no objection to an increased budget and typically                the President each year, whether Democrat or Republican, has put                in for a certain amount for the budget.  Congress has always found                that inadequate and forced the NIH to take more money and they were                happy enough, of course, to take it.  So the NIH budget caught my                eye as an interesting phenomenon in American life.                   I got interested also in the escalation         of what I think is escalating history of medical research in this         country where research was a worthy cause in the late 19th century when         it first was taken seriously in this country, particularly in medical         schools.  But the kind of shift from a worthy cause to a kind of         imperative, necessary cause which really came into play after the         Second World War and I suppose nicely symbolized by President         Nixon's declaration in 1970 of a ""War Against Cancer.""          And thereafter, language of the imperative of research became stronger         and stronger.                         More recently the stem cell debate caught         my eye since many people have argued and you may hear it in your         discussion, but a moral duty to pursue such research.  Simultaneously,         more or less, the pharmaceutical industry, for those of you who follow         it you can't help following it a bit these days, pharmaceutical         industry has long claimed that they, the main reason they need the high         profits is in order to carry out research which is going to save future         lives and relieve future suffering.  Hence, they have used a very         strong research imperative argument in justifying their drug pricing         and the like.                         Now to me, the interesting question is,         why has this happened?  What has been the reason for this kind of         increased interest?  It's rather striking, if perhaps unusual, that         health care, I suppose — particularly NIH research, but it is a budget         that has gone up despite the fact that health is getting better.  It         seems to me there's some straight line correlation between the         better health we have, the more money we spend on health care and         particularly the more we think we ought to spend on research and the         argument there is, of course, the prospects of new breakthroughs are         greater than they've ever been historically and therefore we should         go after them.                         In any case, as health gets better, the         budget goes up and spending on health care continues to go up as well.                         Now I think that there are a number of         things culturally that have happened.  First of all, I think         there's a very strong feeling in this country that illness and         disease, which have always been considered human evils have taken a         kind of transcendent status as evils in our country.  They are seen as         among the worse things that can happen to people, one of the most         important things we can spend money on, and that there is really         nothing better we can do for each other than to invest money in         research to promote better health.                         I think also, as part of that, is that         one shift that I think has taken place since the Second World War has         been a kind of abolition of fatalism.  It's been argued that in the         past we reconciled ourselves to aging and death simply because we could         nothing.  People could do nothing about it and then it had to be         rationalized, it had to be given a place in human life, but fatalism,         many would, in effect, argue should be put behind us.  Now we can do         something about the evils of illness and disease.                         The political scientist, Michael Walzer,         I think very perceptively made this point about 20 years ago when he         said, ""What has happened in the modern world is simply that         disease itself, even when it is endemic rather than epidemic, has come         to be seen as a plague.  And since the plague can be dealt with, it         must be dealt with.  People will not endure what they no longer believe         they have to endure.""  That was from his book,  Spheres of         Justice .                         I think it's also the case that the         pursuit of health through research is seen as not only a good in         itself, morally and socially, but also of great economic benefit, both         in the lives saved and the future productivity of those lives, but also         in the jobs and profit that research generates.  A strong argument         behind the annual NIH budget is that the research is exportable.          It's one of America's great products.  People need it.  They         love it.  And they will spend money for it.                         Most importantly, I think, and an issue         that's worth a side discussion, but we won't have time to get         into today, a strong argument that medical research offers the greatest         promise of eventually reducing our escalating health care costs.  A         number of economists, David Cutler and the new Commissioner of the Food         and Drug Administration, Mark McClellan, have argued very strongly that         research and biomedical investment is the greatest investment that has         been made on anything in this country, that has been worth trillions of         dollars to our economy.  And both the pharmaceutical industry and from         time to time the NIH itself has argued that better research is what         will beat the problem of rising health care costs.  I would add as a         footnote, it hasn't happened yet.  It seems to me a wonderful idea,         but the historical record is not encouraging.  Anyway, the argument has         been made.                         Now I want to really make three basic         contentions in this talk.  I'm going to make them and let's see         if I can defend them and make them quasi-persuasive.                         First of all, I want to argue that, in         general, there is no moral research, no moral imperative or duty to         pursue medical research, or in particular, to pursue any specific line         of research.  Research, I want to argue, is a moral good to be weighed         against other human goods, but not an overriding moral obligation.          That's the first contention.                         The second is that in the absence of what         I will call a common metric, there is no rationally justifiable or         viable way of balancing the moral good of research against other         claimed moral goods.                         And my third contention is that in the         legal and ethical policy, international policy now in human subject         research that has developed since the Nuremburg Trials in 1947, the         principle of informed consent for competent patients has come         decisively to overcome any and all claims of research benefits that         could come from violating the principle of informed consent.  I think         this has great historical significance.                         Let me go to my first contention, why is         there, with one exception I will shortly mention, no moral obligation         or duty to carry out biomedical research, but at the same time one can         say that research is clearly a moral good?  I offer you three         considerations for that.                         First of all, this is a point that         philosophers sometimes make about the very notion of obligation.          Philosophers distinguish between  perfect and imperfect obligations.  A         perfect obligation is one which is based on a specific promise we have         made.  We're then obliged to keep it.  Or an obligation that flows         from certain types of roles we take on such as doctor, policeman,         lawyer, what have you, obligations that typically are called role         obligations and they go with the carrying out of particular         professions.                         So an imperfect obligation by contrast is         one where no one in particular has any obligation to carry it out.  We         talk about it as an obligation, but one cannot say that any given         individual has a duty to carry out the obligation.  In that sense,         it's a very weak kind of obligation.  Indeed, it's not clear         when you talk about imperfect obligation whether you ought to use it at         all, talk about obligation at all, but nonetheless that has typically         been done.                       And here I would want to argue that medical research falls in the category                of an imperfect obligation, imperfect in the sense that it's                not clear whose duty it is in particular to carry out such research.                 One can't even claim that of the researcher.  If a researcher                decides to do basic research with no interest in therapy, one would                hardly accuse that researcher of being irresponsible or to say that                any given researcher had a particular obligation to pursue this                or that line of research.                   So in that sense, medical research itself         would be a classic case of an imperfect obligation.  Now it might well         be the case that someone in say the field of genetics who took on         particular issues pertinent to society or therapy would have some moral         obligation to carry through on that if the person had chosen to do that         research it would then begin to take on some of the characteristics of         a perfect obligation.  But there's no obligation in the first place         that a person become a particular kind of researcher.                         Now this may seem like a rather         technical, indeed, precious point, the kind of thing philosophers have         lots of fun with, but don't persuade many others.  I think the         question is pertinent because if we're going to talk about a duty         to carry out research, and obligation of research, we really then have         to ask, in what sense are we supposed to carry out research and what         moral sense is there a claim upon us?                         I simply want to argue that it is         perfectly possible to talk about it as a good.  It's an ideal of         our culture, a very strong ideal.  It is based on the notion of a duty         of empathy, mercy, of the relief of suffering, the virtue of         beneficence, the virtues of mercy.  And in that sense, one can make a         very strong case that it is a good thing to do, but not necessarily a         strict obligation.                         Now by calling it a good thing to do, it         seems to me one then has to raise the question well, how does it         compare with other good things we might do?  As an economist might say,         what are some of the optional ways we might spend a similar amount of         money?  How do you compare the value and need for man's educational         needs, national defense, jobs, all sorts of other things that societies         need in order to function well?                         It seems to me then once one has said it         is a good, and simply a good and not necessarily the highest good, then         one is in a situation of trying to juggle budgets, juggle moral         priorities and make a determination of where we want to locate health         over against other things we might do with our money and with our         aspirations.                       I think it is fairly obvious in this country, as at least symbolized                by the NIH, that we have given it an uncommonly high status and                this is clearly not the case in other countries.  The British, the                French, the Germans all spend money on medical research, but they                don't put nearly the amount of money into it as we do in this                country.                   But I would point out that we don't         consider it morally objectionable that they spend less money on         research and more money say on other things, since it seems to me once         one begins talking about comparative goods for society, this will be         determined by the politics, the values, the history, culture and a lot         of other things.                         So basically, I have a very modest kind         of goal here, which is simply to use an old fashioned term from         theology, demythologize the notion of a research imperative by simply         saying sure, it's an absolutely good thing to do, but once         we've said it's a good thing to do, then it has to be compared         with and compete with other goods in society, whereas to talk about it         as a duty seems to act for many as a kind of a trump care which then         allows people to not only ask for more money than they might for other         things, but also to argue that somehow we have an inescapable duty and         I want to argue with that.                         Now I would make one exception which I         think is important in our world.  I think one can make a very strong         case that there is something pretty close to a duty when you're         talking about infectious diseases and particularly disease such as         AIDS; diseases that don't simply kill people, but mainly kill         younger people and in particular kill those who are responsible for the         running of the society.  And one of the great problems in sub-Saharan         Africa is not simply a high death rate although that, of course, is         horrible, but the point is that what we're seeing is the         destruction of the health care workers, the police force, government         administrators, all the people that make society run, and of course,         leaving thousands of children as orphans.  So it's very destructive         on the family.                         So it seems to me that plagues and         particularly those that affect younger generations and affect the         infrastructure of society and not simply the death rate stand out as a         particular exception, which is only to say in a way that there is a         difference between what was called the endemic diseases, cancer, heart         disease and the like and contagious diseases that seem to fall into a         different category.                         Now let me respond to the Lederberg         argument.  I think when we think about the Lederberg argument, the idea         that somehow it's a sin of omission not to support research and         therefore we will bear responsibility for the results of failing to         support the research, this will certainly be true if we consider a very         hard and specific obligation a duty, therefore, we will have seen,         failed in our duty and thus to be condemned.  But it seems to me one         has to really ask about all the other needs of society and ask is it         really wrong to decide in a given society, at a given time that         education, say, is more important than health care.                          In this country, we have more or less         spent around 6 percent of our gross domestic product on health care for         nearly 30 years or so.  We now spend about 14 percent on health care         and around 3 and 4 percent on defense.  Thirty-five years ago we spent         about 6 percent on each.  So one can really raise the question whether         it makes a great deal of sense or there leads to a balanced society to         allow one sphere, namely health care to so remarkably outpace all of         the others, as if somehow our education system is terrific, we         needn't put more money in that, but only health care deserves the         constant escalating budget that it typically gets.                         Now I think in trying to ask the question         of research as a good and comparing it with other goods, we really are         forced to ask what kind of an evil disease, suffering, and death are.          Clearly, they are very important evils.  All societies have considered         them evils.  As I suggested maybe earlier fatalistic societies had to         develop rationalizations and ways of making sense of them.  Many of         these, I believe, still make sense, but we have at least entered a         period where there is not much pleasure taken in arguments that seem to         have a fatalistic flavor to them.                          So that pushes us really back to the         question of let's take, for instance, the question of death.  I         think it's very pertinent to ask what kinds of death are comparably         more or less evil.  There's death by disease.  There's death by         social violence, war, domestic violence and the like.  There's         death by accidents.  There is death by poverty.  Can we rank in some         sense, even if very crudely and roughly, can we rank those deaths in         terms of evils?  I myself would say that the greatest, the worst kinds         of deaths are those that come from social violence and deaths that are         unexpected, unnecessary and are a function of human evil, rather than         biological evil.                         We can obviously argue about that matter,         but it seems to me it's important when we begin thinking about the         comparative good that medical research can bring, what are the         comparative evils we are trying to overcome and how do we want to         understand and rank those evils?                         To my mind, premature death is something         to be worked against.  Threats to public health are to be worked         against.  This would particularly include infectious diseases and         threats to sanitation, air and the like, and I suppose anything that         threatens the ability, particularly of people in their adult years, to         run families and to manage societies.                         I would want myself to classify the         endemic diseases of modern society, particularly those that primarily         affect older populations, as comparatively low priority.  That is to         say they are terribly important.  People — it would be a good thing to         cure cancer, heart disease and the like, but it seems to me in terms of         social priority, I would want to argue that they have a comparatively         low priority and it's very difficult, I believe, to say that we         have an obligation to overcome cancer and heart disease as much as they         cause individuals suffering.  I use that as an example because my         family has a history of cancer as a cause of death and certainly that         brought suffering to our family as to many other families, but I think         if one takes a social perspective on, say, death from cancer, one would         have to say that while a source of great pain and suffering for         individuals, it is not a disease that threatens the very structure of         society or the overall functioning of society.                         I might mention a very interesting quote         by Harold Varmus.  Harold Varmus, many people will recall, was the         Director of the National Institutes of Health, a Nobel Laureate and I         think considered a particularly effective Director.  He retired — he         left that position in the year 2000 and is now president of Memorial         Sloan-Kettering in New York.  In his last talk he gave to the staff at         NIH, he said something very interesting that was not picked up by the         press, but I thought was very radical for a Director of NIH.  He said         first of all, he said I think we pay too much attention to health in         our society, an interesting thing for an NIH Director to say; and the         second thing he said was he was concerned that too much of the research         they were carrying out was going to produce products that Americans         would not be able to afford to buy.                         And it seemed to me that was what I         thought was the very first time that anyone in a position like that         began to question some of the very basic work that the NIH has been         doing.                         Now let me bring in a third consideration         here.  It seems to me that if one cannot say that health is an         overriding good as I would want to say, but it is one of many goods,         then the question is really how do we balance the ensemble of human         goods necessary to make up a society?  Obviously, a society where you         have a very low death rate from the endemic diseases, but is one marked         by social violence, corruption and other things will be a lousy society         to live in, however healthy physically people may be.  And for that         society a priority would want to be given to dealing with the social         problems of the society.                         The question always would be, if one         wants to say health is a basic necessity for human beings, obviously         the same thing can be said for food, clothing and shelter and maybe a         slightly less sense of the importance of jobs and other things for         society.  So the question then is to find a way to decide what priority         to give to health compared to the other goods and at the same time to         recognize that the aim of a society is to find a way to get a good         balance between all the needs and not just one.                         I am particularly interested in this         issue because while the research drive has received an awful lot of         money and great attention, we have done less well with the delivery of         health care in this country.  We've spent a lot of money on         research, but we have spent less money doing research on how to better         deliver health care and there has been far less public debate, much         less agreement on the value of say achieving universal health care in         this country.                         Harold Varmus said something rather         radical for somebody in his position.  Floyd Bloom, who is the recently         retired President of the American Association for the Advancement of         Science and before that editor of the journal  Science , said very         interestingly he thought we should spend less money on medical research         and more money on the delivery of health care, because we have a         paradoxical problem in this country.  Namely, we have a research agenda         that's going forward to find cures for disease, but there is by no         means any guarantee that all Americans will be able to receive the         results of those disease.  There are some 41 million uninsured in this         country.  There are many people who can't afford the drugs that are         coming out of the research enterprise, the pharmaceutical industry and         yet somehow we can't seem to find unanimity to deal with that         problem the way we can in putting money into research itself.                       Okay, so much for my thoughts on the obligation to do research.                 Let me turn to the issue of balancing research against other goods                and values.  Here I mean to talk very generally about balancing                research against other human needs and goods, but here I want to                particularly look at the language of balancing when, in the moral                debate, because it is often said and has been said in many government                reports that we must balance various considerations.                   Let me give you some obvious examples.          In the human subject debate, the question has been one of balancing         potential, harm to subjects against potential research benefits.          I'll come back to that issue.  In the stem cell debate, a very         common use of balancing language there; namely, the destruction of         balancing the destruction of early embryos against the potential         benefits of stem cell research.  A third area that has received some         attention lately, the protection of privacy against the public health         benefits that would come from epidemiological  and collecting         information on people's health behavior and other items concerning         their health.                          In short, in each of those debates, the         issue has arisen, how do we balance the potential harms of doing the         research and what harms of different kinds over against the potential         values.  Now I find this very interesting, first of all because it         seems to me one can't really use the language of balance in any         meaningful way unless one has a kind of common metric, that is to say,         it's the old question of sort of comparing apples and oranges.  In         that case, the issue you can talk about is the fruit, but in many of         these other cases, the differences are very great between the values to         be pursued.                         Now it seems to me that unless you have a         common metric, you really can't do that in any meaningful way.  For         instance, by a common metric, I mean if your physician says look, you         have a very painful condition, we have some surgery that will relieve         the condition, but the surgery is very painful, then, of course, you         have a common metric of pain and you can do some serious balancing.          But in the cases I've mentioned, the human subject research stem         cell debate, protection of privacy, we don't have anything that         works in such a tidy manner.                         Now my own observation is that, lacking         this common metric, and despite the language of balancing, the de facto         results of efforts to do so have pretty much reflected the ideological,         prior ideological commitments of the people doing the balancing.  I         look at the language of balancing in previous national commissions         beginning with the National Commission for the Protection of Human         Subjects in the mid-1970s through three other federal commissions and         finally this President's Council, I'll leave out this one, but         the other ones use the language of balancing, but pretty much the         balancing would typically go in the direction of the known policies,         attitudes, ideologies of the Commission Members.                          And it seems to me there's probably         no other way of doing it.  People will bring to bear on balancing         questions their previous commitments.  Hopefully, they may have been         influenced by arguments and debate they heard, but nonetheless, they         are likely to act out some of their deepest values and that will tip         the balancing one way or the other.                        And of course, one way you achieve balancing, there are a variety of                ways.  One is simply decide that on the balancing of a see-saw,                one value really isn't such a high value after all and you get                rid of it entirely and thus getting rid of the problem or you find                some way to make one of less value than the other, but in point,                all I want to argue is I don't think there's any very rational                way of doing this.  It ends up a matter of politics, maybe in a                good sense, but still politics rather than any form of rational                calculus.                 The third issue I'd like to look at is that of human subject research.                 I think the history of human subject research offers a very interesting                perspective on the question of balancing and also on the research                imperative.  Although the famous physician William Osler, at Johns                Hopkins over a century ago insisted on the importance of gaining                informed consent from human subjects, and even a German Commission,                interestingly, in the early 1930s made it a moral requirement, it                was only slowly and fitfully accepted by medical researchers.  Their                objection over the decades, as one might guess, was that research                requires human subjects, that medical progress cannot take progress                without the use of medical subjects and that the cure of disease                took priority over any claimed rights of subjects to be free of                having their bodies invaded by researchers.                   In short, there was an effort — an effort         was made to look at the problem of balancing, but by and large, in         earlier decades, probably the Second World War, the balance was always         typically in favor of the researcher and again, the arguments are         rather familiar ones.  You can't do the research unless we go         forward without the consent and in any case the saving of lives and the         relief of suffering is something that is of higher value than the         protection of human subjects.                         A friend of ours, Leon remembers him         well, Robert Morrison, a physician, said of his medical training in the         1930s, it was hard to take the idea of informed consent seriously when         so many of our patients were dying all around us, particularly young         people.                         Well, all of that changed with the         Nuremburg Trials in 1947, trials of the Nazi doctors accused and         correctly indicted for many horrible medical crimes, particularly         crimes involving human subject research.  Out of that trial came the         Nuremburg Code which at its very core had the idea of informed consent         as a necessity.                         Nonetheless, despite the blessing of the         Nuremburg Code, it took many years for the report really just to sink         in and again the arguments against it were the necessity of the         research, the value of the research, and one that became increasingly         common, the fact that your average lay person would simply be too         incompetent, too ignorant to make informed judgments.                       In any case, over a period of time, by virtue of the Nuremburg                Code, and by other codes that were developed, the principle of informed                consent was accepted and accepted in the face of many rationalizations                to evade it.  And it's very interesting because I think the                rule at present, in effect, says competent subjects have a right                to make, give informed consent and without their informed consent,                no research may go forward, regardless of how many lives might be                saved, how much suffering might be relieved.  It is a hard and fast                rule.  We basically get rid of the problem of balancing all together                and said this is not an area where balancing is appropriate, patients                must be protected.                   Now this was, I think, a very important         precedent.  It said something about the research imperative.  It said         something about the competence of people, even lay people, to make         informed judgments and it certainly said something about the necessity         to bring in regulation of something very important.  A number of people         who believed in informed consent such as Henry Veatch, one of the         people who blew the whistle in the mid-1960s on the problem, said it         would be certainly important that there be a moral requirement for         informed consent, but the government ought not to enter in and try to         regulate this area.  It should be left to the integrity of the         researcher.  Well, that view was rejected.  The institutional review         boards were born in the late 1960s and it is now a firm regulatory         requirement that research be protected by informed consent.                         Now I might mention that, of course, as         many of you are familiar with earlier Commissions, the issue never gets         totally solved.  Efforts to this day still go on to evade informed         consent.  The work of institutional reviews is endlessly being         reviewed, criticized.  Nonetheless, I think it very striking that this         one principle did endure a lot of criticism and particularly criticism         from those who argued for a research imperative to do the research.                         Let me end — I'm not charged to say         anything about the stem cell debate, but let me try to make a few         applications of what I've said generally to that debate.  First of         all, if there's anything to what I've said, it is not         appropriate to talk about a duty to carry out stem cell research, even         if you believe it extraordinarily valuable, even if you believe there         aren't any terrible moral objections against it.  It seems to me         inappropriate to talk about it as a duty.  It certainly doesn't         meet the standards I've suggested.                         Now even if we want to say, however, it         is not a duty, but simply a high good, then the question is high how a         good and how are we to think within that context.  The thing that has         certainly caught my eye is that it is claimed to be promising         research.  But I'm struck by the fact that the National Institutes         of Health over the past few decades has spent literally hundreds of         millions of dollars on other promising research for the very same         diseases that stem cell research is supposed to help.                         In the case of Parkinson's disease,         an article a couple of years ago listed 10 different research lines         being pursued for the cure of or relief of Parkinson's disease and         certainly that's the case with heart disease, spinal cord injuries         and lots of other things as well.                         Therefore, one can hardly argue that stem         cell research is the only possible way of — unless someone once said         the NIH has been wasting lots of money on everything else over the         years, I don't think they would want to say that.  One would have         to say the stem cell research is promising, but other things are         promising as well and that this might be even comparatively more         promising, but promising in and of itself is not enough to constitute a         duty to carry it out, particularly when there are alternative lines of         research.                         I would notice something else that people         haven't noticed which I found at least amusing.  Christopher Reeve         who has been a great proponent of stem cell research, as you know,         there's been a couple of stories about him over the past year, one         that he is now able to have some movement in his limbs that he         didn't have earlier and this came from recent research on         rehabilitation.  And secondly, that he is gradually being weaned from a         ventilator and this was cited as a sign of research progress on weaning         people from ventilators.  In short, some of these other alternative         lines of research are working on his very condition and bearing some         fruit.                         I think on the question of balancing and         here, this is where the balancing issue has come in very strongly, how         do you balance the claims of an embryo against the potential of         benefits from the research itself?  Well, I guess the question is one         thing is pretty clear, embryos are killed in order to carry out the         research for research that is promising,   its hypothetical benefits         over against at least some real harm.  Now unless one believes that         embryos have no moral standing whatever, which some do, of course, one         is then left with — or believes that they have such moral standing that         they shouldn't be used at all, but if you're like many of us in         sort of muddling around in the middle there, then the question is how         do you balance off the decisive harm done to embryos against         hypothetical benefits?                         It seems to me that at least from the way         I think about the issue, there is one kind of common metric here, that         is to say we're talking about the potential value of the life of         the embryo over against the lives of future victims of disease.  But it         seems to me the question is again, it's not a very good metric         because it's still a hypothetical benefit.  We don't know the         stem cell research will, in fact, work.  We do know that lots of harm         can do lots of harm to embryos to get there.  So I suppose I would want         to try to think about the matter in terms of how likely are the         benefits and even if we don't believe that there's full human         life present in embryos, what do we mean when we say, as many former         Commissions have, that embryos deserve respect.  I think that is a kind         of way on the part of the embryos a certain insecurity about the way we         talk about embryos, even among those who don't believe embryos         should be considered a full human life worthy of full protection.  I         think the language of respect has been invoked as a kind of middle         level term, if you will, to help us say well, we don't think         they're nothing, but at the same time we don't think they have         quite enough standing to merit their non-use for the sake of research.                         I suppose I would want to end by saying         on this issue and here I will simply end by saying this, I think         embryos have a fairly weak moral claim, but on the other hand I think         the research claim is even weaker.  Thank you.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you very much, Dan.                         Let me just simply throw the floor open         for comment.  Elizabeth, is that half a hand, Elizabeth Blackburn?                          PROF.BLACKBURN:   I would like to         address the points that you raised in the last part of your         presentation.  With respect to stem cell research, you point out that         the NIH has, of course, spent very much more money on different kinds         of research avenues from stem cell research.  But I think we should         acknowledge that the reason for that has been partly because there has         not been the possibility to do very much stem cell research because of         the situation being so limited right now.                         So it's not that the stem cell         research has been abandoned.  It's being sufficiently useful         compared with other avenues to pursue it.  It's simply that we at         this stage haven't had the opportunity, we as a society, to look         into it.                         I think it's early days.  And you         pointed out that there hasn't been a whole lot of evidence about         how useful it can or could not be, but again, the only way to find out         that is to gain the knowledge.                         So I think I was getting from you words         somewhat of a sense that you were thinking that extensive research was         the inferior mode of research.  And I was just going to point out that         we really don't know that at this point because we have not had the         opportunity.                         Another quick point I wanted to raise         about Christopher Reeve.  I think that the news is wonderful that the         injuries that he had were in some way not completely irreversible, but         I think that what he acknowledges is that he was in a rather unusual         position of having a lot of resources.  And he could devote enormous         resources, financial, into having the very, very intensive sorts of         effort put into his rehabilitation, which I think is not commonly the         situation for most people.                         And so if there were alternatives to this         route that he was able to take, which was heroic and very encouraging,         I think that would be better because these people do not have         Christopher Reeve's large amount of resources that he could sink         into his rehabilitation.                         So those are the couple of points I just         wanted to raise.                          DR. CALLAHAN:   Well, let me first point         out I in no sense meant to imply that stem cell research is inferior,         in fact, it may be superior to all the others.  I was simply making the         point that NIH already is pursuing other things that they consider very         promising as well.                         Stem cell would be one more thing added         to the list.  It might be better than the others, but unless we think         they have been wasting money over the years, the NIH has believed that         other things are valuable and worth pursuing as well.                       With Christopher Reeve, you may well be right, but much of that                research, the benefits came out of NIH-sponsored research.  How                it got paid for with him, I haven't the faintest idea.                 But, again, this gets back to Harold Varmus' point.  It may well                be that a lot of the research will develop things that only well-positioned,                affluent people will be able to afford.  But that is a side issue.                                 PROF.BLACKBURN:   I think the point         was that his current one was such an expensive kind of therapy.  And if         there were cheaper ones that might be more readily accessible, that         would be —                          DR. CALLAHAN:   Sure, sure.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   At the risk of perhaps         deflecting people from where they would like to go, it seems to me the         real challenge that Dan's paper and presentation throws out for us         is to think really about the large theme, which is the moral imperative         to research.                         And I wonder what people think of the         general thesis of the presentation as stated.  And the use also of         informed consent at least indicates that, if I understand Dan's         argument, there were certain kinds of trumping limitations that         indicated that the imperative to research, if there were one, or at         least the pursuit of research, if there were one, simply wasn't the         sort of thing that trumped all other kinds of considerations, including         moral considerations.  I wondered what people make of the general         thesis that has been presented.                         Frank Fukuyama?                          PROF. FUKUYAMA:   Well, I appreciated         that presentation because it really made me think about a lot of         things, but it does seem to me that fundamental to your argument is         actually not the question of the value of research per se, but the         value of biomedicine directed towards basically curing diseases in old         people that will add, say, another five years of life expectancy to a         population whose life expectancy has already been pushed to a fairly         high limit.                         And the value of that compared to other         things because you are willing to say, well, infectious diseases that         affect younger people I guess in your mind actually do trump quite a         lot of other moral considerations.                          DR. CALLAHAN:   Not informed consent,         however.                          PROF. FUKUYAMA:   Not informed         consent, but you're willing to concede that.  So it seems to me         that that is really the focus of the issue, the relative value of         biomedical research directed towards that particular population.  And         that becomes, then, a kind of metric by which you can value one type of         research over another.  Isn't that the basic —                          DR. CALLAHAN:   I guess to me the         fundamental question is, what are appropriate goals of medicine at this         stage in history given the fact that we have already made great         progress, given the fact that most people now die in old age, rather         than as young people.  Where ought we to be going?  That's the         basic question.                         And at the same time, though, I want to         say that I think it's been given an excessively high evaluation.          And I would simply want to bring it down a little bit and put it on a         par with a lot of other things we could usefully spend money on.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Frank, do you want to         pursue that?                          PROF. FUKUYAMA:   Yes.  I think that         that's really in a way a core issue that we ought to discuss much         further.  I remember once hearing the director of HHS saying that heart         disease is down, mortality from heart disease is down, and a number of         other diseases, but, unfortunately, mortality from these other diseases         is up.                         Now, it seems to me even the director of         HHS should be able to figure out that the total of mortalities from all         diseases have to sum to 100.  So that if you actually cure some         diseases, you will be raising the rates of mortality from other         diseases unless you can presume that they are not going to die.                       So, really, what you are talking about is, in a way, this whole                life extension issue and the kind of value that.                    DR. CALLAHAN:   Implicitly, that certainly         arises, yes.  Well, it's also there's another issue, which I         have written about in another case and gotten in trouble for writing         about, namely, what is our obligation to the elderly given the fact         that the average age of cancer deaths is at age 69 or 70 now.  So it is         clearly a disease of the aging.                         Should we continue giving it the high         priority it had by virtue of the fact that it's mainly older people          who have it, as with spending on money on young people to improve the         schools?  Which is the greater social contribution?                          PROF. FUKUYAMA:   And I would just         point out that among the complexities of that, you get into all of         these quality of life issues.  One of the reasons that there has been         this explosion in rates of Alzheimer's is that you have actually         succeeded in other areas of biomedicine, keeping people alive long         enough that they can get to an age where they are much more susceptible         to that.                         So it seems to me the total good that is         being delivered to society by some of these advances is much more         problematic.  And I think that's a perfectly reasonable issue to         raise.                        CHAIRMAN KASS:   Alfonso Gómez-Lobo and then Bill May.                    DR.GÓMEZ-LOBO:   I have a concern and a         question, but I would like to preface that with a broad agreement on         your approach.  I think there's deep wisdom in placing the question         within the ranges of goods.                         And I totally agree.  I seem to see an         emphasis on health, which may not be reasonable in the long run.  I         mean, we are surrounded by other goods.  And we may be neglecting lots         of other social goods by emphasizing that.                         Now, what I think is very important is to         say there is a limit to the balancing.  In other words, that balancing         goods is something that is reasonable when the pursuit of those goods         is morally permissible.  And there I think — and I totally agree with         you — the notion of informed consent plays a very important role         because that's the nonnegotiable limit, right?  You don't         balance that in any way.                         Now, here is my concern and my question.          I have seen since I have been on the Council and reading some stuff         that informed consent is sometimes extended to the treatment of         children and then also to the disposal of, say, frozen embryos.                         What I am doubtful about here is whether         there can be valid informed consent for actions that will not benefit         the subject.  And I would love to hear some clarification of that.                         And, of course, that ties into your last         remark, the remark about the embryos having a weak moral claim.  And I         want to ask you, what does that mean?  And if it's weak, how does         it become stronger and say how strong would that be in an infant?  In         other words, does the notion of varying moral claim for drastic action,         like the action of killing, really make philosophical sense?          That's the question I would like to raise.                          DR. CALLAHAN:   Well, your last question         bears on the whole discussion, the rest of this meeting.  I mean, I         could say a lot, but let me say very briefly I think by ""weak         moral claim,"" I mean a claim where we are uncertain about the         moral status and we are uncertain about how great the harm being done         to that moral status might be.                          By ""weak claim,"" I mean a claim         somewhere in between saying embryos are worth nothing and embryos are         full of life we claim is one that is somewhere in between.  It is         something.  It has some value, but we are not quite sure how much         value.                         And we may on occasion be willing to say         it might be overridden by other considerations.  That's all I will         say on that.  I would just as soon not have to get further into that.                       I'm sorry.  You're first —                    DR.GÓMEZ-LOBO:   The other point was         about consenting to an action performed, say, on a child or on an         embryo that would not benefit that child in —                          DR. CALLAHAN:   Well, that's a hot         area that has been disputed ever since the Nuremburg trials because         there are incompetent people doing research and somebody with         Alzheimer's disease doing research and children, people who are not         in a position.                         I think it's generally agreed that         you may have to indeed do the research, it's valuable research, but         there you have to depend upon a surrogate giving you permission,         somebody you believe is competent and capable of giving permission for         the research to be carried out on that person, the condition being that         the person is not able to carry out the research and that the research         would be beneficial.                       Now, on your question of non-therapeutic research, I don't see any                reason why a competent person can't agree to be part of research.                 It is not going to particularly help that person.  I was part of                a research project on amphetamines myself at one point.  It had                nothing to do with my health at all.  And I think I was able to                give informed consent on that subject.                   So the question of consent for embryos,         well, that's a whole totally murky kind of area.  I don't think         obviously you can give consent for an embryo because you have no idea         what that embryo might have wanted, where it's going, or anything         else.  I am going to put that question aside and not even try to mess         my way through that, which would be a confusing business anyway for me.                          DR.GÓMEZ-LOBO:   Yes.  I'm a little         bit disappointed, because that is exactly the kind of guidance —                          DR. CALLAHAN:   That's not my charge         at this meeting.  And I will give you references I have written on         that, but I can't do it in three or four quick sentences.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Bill May?                          DR. MAY:   The paper and the presentation         are offered with your characteristic reasonableness.  I would simply         like to explore the question of the place that you give to research         imperative in the setting of a metaphor, a fight against death and         understanding of death as a contingent, accidental fact and, therefore,         the tension between that research imperative driven by that military         metaphor with what you call the clinical imperative, at least the old         clinical imperative. You're talking about an imperative directed at         doctors.  I'm not sure if that is what you mean or patients where         the imperative is to accept death as a biological fact.                       Now, it seems to me what this leaves out, that gives heft to the research                imperative, is a further structural characteristic of death, that                death is uncertain but uncertain as to time when—  Heidegger                worked all of that out.  And behind that was Kierkegaard.                   Uncertain as to time when creates a huge         opening that allows one to give the impression that one is fighting         against death.  But one really creates space for the avoidance of         death.                         We send people to hospitals so often         because that is where the battleground is located and where we have got         people equipped to fight against that.  And if they don't have all         the resources behind them, it's research so that if it isn't         successful with this patient, it will be successful with future         patients, all of that.                         But the other deep response to death is         not simply fight but flight or avoidance.  And so the military         establishment fighting against death offers an important psychological         service to patients.                         Yes, it's certain but in a sense         uncertain as to time when this is going to happen.  And there are still         tricks that the doctor will have and so forth, so that push in the         direction of orienting even what goes on in the clinical setting, to if         not curative efforts, delaying efforts and so forth.                         Now, what this leads me to think about is         a huge shift in the religious landscape from earlier centuries, a West         shaped by a notion of a creative and nurturant God.                         And purportedly the authentic life was to         be open to this deity and then two forms of reaction to this deity,         which were defined as sin, fighting against God, Luciferian revolt         against God, and avoidance of his presence.  That was Philistine         flight.  So you had a fight and flight response in relationship to the         deity.                         One might argue that the religious         landscape of the last couple of hundred years has shifted over that the         encompassing reality is not a creative, nurturant God but what James         Joyce referred to as dio boia in ""Ulysses,"" the hangman God,         or Camus said, ""The whole world is organized by death.  In the         end, we're all done in.""                       And then you get people like Kubler-Ross saying, ""Hey, let's                be open to this.  And, indeed, being open to death, finally we're                open to ourselves at our deepest level.""  And she gave, in                a way, Heidegger-on-the-cheap there.                   But, on the other hand, the terrific         attraction of fighting against death and, further, the compounding of         that that you set up an apparatus of fighting against death that offers         people the sense that we don't get heft to face it.  So avoidance,         at a deep level, helps drive and give heft to the research imperative.                       The way you have written this chapter, it seems as though the research                imperative is driven by the military metaphor and then spills over                into the clinical setting when I think the existential setting is                quite the reverse for people, that it is certain but uncertain as                to time-when.  And there were things to be done in the hospital                that I can't do at home.  So you put them there and so forth.                 So it allows one not to have to face it yet.                   Now, yes, medicine ought to recover that         old, old imperative, learning how to accept finitude and death.  It was         very difficult to do in a setting where one really feels that         ultimately one is facing a hangman God.                         The kind of religious background, it         seems to me, would ask one to talk about the drive behind the research         imperative.  That may be at a deeper level and more complicated level         of our attraction to it and the temptation to it.                          DR. CALLAHAN:   Well, just a quick         response.  It seems to me that, even if one accepts the reality of         death, it's seemingly understandable that we would like to stall         things a bit, take our time.                         But this is true of a lot of things that         are rather unpleasant.  We avoid and we flee.  When the doctor says,         ""Well, you have to have your tooth pulled,"" we say,         ""Well, how about next week, rather than tomorrow?"" and so         forth and so on.                         I think the question of the research         imperative is — the way I like to put it is whether we ultimately         believe that death is kind of a biological accident, a contingent event         that ultimately can be overcome as distinguished from simply         forestalled.                         And it seems to me that the whole         trajectory of modern medical research has been basically to treat it as         if it were an accident.  As far as I know, there are no fatal diseases         that the NIH finds acceptable.  The NIH is not in favor of immortality,         at least officially, but there are no diseases that kill people that it         is prepared to tolerate.  And it puts money into research, any and all         lethal diseases.  So the logic of that whole movement is —                          DR. MAY:   Long before there was modern         research, you got Frazer and ""The Golden Bough"" talking in         traditional societies, a tendency to look upon death as an accident; or         in Freud, the eagerness to find out the cause of death because it is an         accident that befell somebody else and not me or you get the same thing         again in Tolstoy's ""Death of Ivan Ilych.""                          DR. CALLAHAN:   But I think with         contemporary medicine, we get a new plausibility to thinking that way.          That's the difference.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Rebecca Dresser, then         Paul.                          PROF. DRESSER:   I share many of your         views and concerns.  And I think I am so happy that you are writing         about this in your usual eloquent and elegant way.                         I had two questions.  One is, you alluded         to this but didn't speak to it directly.  Something that I think         goes on is the equation of provision of proven health care with money         for research in the political setting and sort of public ethical         debate.                         I take it you would see those both as         goods.  And so then the question would be weighing and saying which         should have priority, but I wonder if you can comment on how you might         weigh those two, the provision of proven health care to more people who         don't get access to it, versus money for research that might         improve the health care we have available now, but at the same time         leaving more people without it.                       And then my other question was about procedures, sort of at a practical                level.  If we are to try to make progress toward revising priority-setting                in these social programs, any ideas how we might go about doing                that and the role of lobbying and all of this?  Any thoughts in                that direction?                  DR. CALLAHAN:   Well, let me begin with your second question.                 I like the system used by the British government.  Of course, they                have the National Health Service.  It's financed by the government                and run by the government.  But I gather that a part of their annual                budget-setting is that the different social areas have to compete                against each other.  They have an open debate:  education versus                health versus economic development.                   I would love to see that.  Even if done         informally, I think it would be terrific if somebody could have a great         television program getting people, leaders from the different sectors         and say, ""Okay.  You want more money for education.  Are you         prepared to say less money for health?""  That would really put         everybody on the spot.  I think if we could get that in open debate, it         would be very valuable.                       I think on your first question, I think one major reform that I am in                favor of in the priority-setting area and in support of research                is that we really now need to look very carefully at the economic                consequences of research.                   Right now recently Medicare had some         hearings to look into new heart technologies that are going to very         radically increase the costs of treating heart disease.  And the         question is, which ones should Medicare cover?                         Now, typically that is done more         informally, rather than as a public debate.  I would like to see that         done openly.  I suppose my most radical suggestion would be that those         companies that manufacture new devices and new drugs must, at the same         time as they are doing safety studies and efficacy studies, be doing         economic studies and saying, ""This is our projection of the         economic impact of doing this"" and before the technology is         released.                         The typical procedure now is technologies         are developed.  And they're sort of thrown out of the window.  And         they say, ""Okay.  You health care administrators sort of deal with         it.  That's not our problem.""  And I would want to say we         should make it their problem.                         And I suppose if you want to go really         far, you would say no technology or at least to be reimbursed by the         government until it has had a very solid economic analysis and debate         and some consensus on whether this is economically worth advancing.                         Now, the typical attitude of researchers         is, well, a) that's not really their problem; and, b), after a         while, we find ways to pay for things anyway.  And this will hold up         research.                         Well, it probably would hold up research,         but, an issue that didn't come up at all, I happen to believe that         research is one of the main things that drives up costs, that right now         we are seeing cost inflation 10 to 15 percent a year.                         The estimate is 40 to 50 percent.          It's coming from new technologies or intensified use of old         technologies.  If that's the case, then I think we have to very         squarely face the problem of the research behind those technologies and         learning how better to evaluate the new technologies that come on         line.  And all of that is set within the larger context of comparing         health with other things in society.                       But I think more generally, it seems to me a really tragic situation                when we have — to me, the worst arguments around are those                on the part of the pharmaceutical companies that say, ""We need                these high profits to save future lives"" when, by God, if they                bring the price down, they could save lots of lives here and now                in Africa by making their drugs available.                   So that this notion of these wonderful         lives in the future somehow comes at a discount rate for the future.          They're basically saying, ""Oh, no.  These lives are worth more         in the future than the present lives we could save now.""  And the         drug companies simply dodge that issue altogether.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Paul McHugh?  I have a         long queue.  I will try to get to everybody before the break.                          DR. McHUGH:   Well, I also want to thank         you very much and was looking forward to your presentation because I         have read your work for a long time and expected, actually, to find         just what I found this time, that I agree with so much I am surprised         at what I disagree with.                         Let me develop my disagreements, at least         to the point of talking about them in practical terms.  I speak now as         a person who has run a laboratory and also a person who has been a         director of a clinical academic department.                         In this arena that you have laid out for         us of discussing the value and the value of research in relationship         to, is it a moral good, or is it an imperative, you first wanted to         talk about it in relationship to cost.  And it's that point I want         to bring up first, that even if it's a good, just a small good,         anyone who has had any experience with research, basic science research         or clinical research, knows what the problem for our country is in         relationship to its financial support.                         The growth of investigators and the         growth of reimbursement is a Malthusian problem because laboratories         grow and replicate themselves with their students in an exponential         geometric way.                         And anyone who has run a laboratory         begins to notice that he or she has many of these wonderful         postgraduate students.  They grow.  They become directors of their own         departments.  And they become steadily more expansive in bringing many         more opportunities to our world because of that.  But tax money and         money from the country can only grow arithmetically.                         So there is always going to be this         problem that you raise.  Why is it that the legislature, the things         closest to the people, closest to the citizenry, will always overrule         the executive, ask for more money because more money is going to be         needed for whatever, whether it is an imperative or a good, only to do         that to our country?                         On the other hand as well, it may just be         my perspective about your work and your presentation here, and it might         be just a prejudice on my part.  And so we'll accept that at the         beginning, but you've got to begin somewhere with a prejudice.  And         that is, how would I, who think of research as an obligation, a moral         obligation, approach that from my experience?  And what is research or         why research or how to judge research are the issues before us in         relationship to is it a good or a moral obligation?  And I would like,         of course, as you would, to produce, for example, one piece in this         scale, namely the achievements in research over these years.                         Now, you mentioned the wonderful         achievements we have had, at least in recognizing the cause of the AIDS         epidemic and developing very effective medications for them.  I lived,         like any doctor who has lived, with the AIDS epidemic from its earliest         beginnings right now, when everyone thought that nothing could be done         because it was a viral illness, and now out to a place where I am         taking care of a vary large number of people who carry the HIV virus         but are protected from the things which were discovered.                         In my area of work, of course, in         psychiatry, the results have equally been remarkable, really, with         research that is sometimes developed by accident but sometimes         developed out of reason.                         Those results are not just the reason for         wanting to speak about it.  I also feel that both attitude and         educational communities do not thrive unless there is research going on         within them.                         Again, I ran a clinical department.  And         the very great importance of mingling investigators with the clinicians         was to raise the standards of care offered to the patients and very         much raise the standards of discourse amongst the clinicians about what         they were doing and why they were doing it.                         Now, in psychiatry, we have this in vivid         terms described to us, demonstrated to us by the neglect of research         during the psychoanalytic era, what Ed Shorter has referred to in his         book on the history of psychiatry as the great hiatus in psychiatry         when during the psychoanalytic era, essentially no research was done         because everybody thought they knew the answer.  Okay?                         The result of that era was the neglect of         patients, the development of snake pits, the concentrations purely on         the worried well, and the loss of opportunities in neuroscience and         pharmacological work to do it.                         And for psychiatrists like myself, I have         come to believe that there really is an absolute moral obligation to         have this in our discipline and in our departments.                         And, finally, the very attitude that all         of this ultimately produces for us is an attitude of not only optimism         for the future but also an attitude of criticism for our views at the         moment.                       So for all of that, I think you have laid out a very interesting point.                 I have to say that there are some fairly fundamental disagreements                that I have with the conclusions you came to draw.  I hope you will                accept it in —                 DR. CALLAHAN:   Well, I guess if you want to continue to                use the word ""obligation,"" fine.  But then I would ask                you, is the obligation to do research in your field — and                it is not a coincidence that you feel it in your field and not my                field.  I feel an obligation for philosophical research probably                as strongly as in psychiatric medicine.                  DR. McHUGH:   Oh, I think that —                   DR. CALLAHAN:   I put that aside.  But how         do you compare with the obligation better housing, community, national         defense, safety nets?  I mean, my question is, do you want to give it         an overriding priority?  Do you say that this is worth far more money         than anything else or it ought to be put on the scale and compared with         the other obligations?                          DR. McHUGH:   Well, you know, once again,         in a democracy, we have issues of competing obligations, competing with         values.  And my assumptions are going to be that we should be trying to         meet all of those obligations as we see them and as we interpret them.                         That is how I am going to do it.  And         that is why I am in America, where we can earn the money to do it.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Michael Sandel?                          PROF.SANDEL:   Well, this follows,         Dan, on your discussion with Paul just now.  I think there is something         needlessly puzzling, confusing about the pieces you present that         obstructs what I think is really a very important insight that you are         directing us toward.                       So let me first say what I take to be one of the really interesting                directions that you have given us and then say what I think is puzzling                and wrong-headed about the way you have put the thesis.                   By calling into question the research         imperative, you have raised a bigger question lying in the background,         which you mentioned at the beginning of your talk, about the inflation         of health as a moral and social good in our society.  And Bill May gave         I thought a fascinating interpretation about the existential landscape         that might partly account for this dynamic.                       There may also be — and this is just a speculation —  a                shift in the moral and public culture that contributes to this.                 It might be that the more reluctant we become to pass judgment or                publicly to affirm what makes lives worthy or good, the more likely                we become to affirm what we take to be all-purpose means to any                lives.                 So the inflation of health may be a reflection of a non-judgmental impulse                that has entered into the moral and public culture over the past                40 years, roughly the time that you detect this inflation of health.                                Health is something we in a pluralist         society can agree on because we take it to be necessary to the         realization of just about any ends that people might pursue, against         the background desire not to affirm any particular ends as aims of         lives.                         And you have directed us to this whole         question.  That may not be the best or the only explanation.  But you         have directed us, I think rightly, to this very important phenomenon         about the inflation of health as a social and moral good.                         The thesis, what makes the thesis         confusing and puzzling, even to those of us who want to sympathize with         it, is that you really, as I understand, are saying two things.  First,         there is no moral obligation to pursue medical research.  That seems to         me wrong.  There is a moral obligation to pursue medical research.                         Then you are also saying another thing,         which you take to be the same, which is medical research is not an         overriding good.  It doesn't trump all other goods.  It has to be         balanced.  Well, that is surely right.  And I suspect everyone would         agree with that, but those two claims aren't the same.  It's         perfectly possible for something to be a moral obligation and still, as         Paul says, for there to be competing moral obligations.                         Consider other examples outside of         medical research.  There is an obligation to educate the young, to         prevent starvation, to save innocent lives where we can, to oppose         injustice, to protect the security of the country.  Those are all         obligations.  But to call them and to recognize them as such isn't         to say that any of them is an overriding good in the sense that its         pursuit trumps all other considerations.                         So I think that you could win wide         support for your thesis that medical research is not an overriding         good.  It has to be balanced against other competing goods without         making what seems to me a puzzling and unnecessary claim that it is not         a moral obligation.                          DR. CALLAHAN:   Well, the reason I was         trying to deal exactly with that confusion, which is the difference         between a perfect and an imperfect obligation, when people say there is         a duty to do stem cell research, they're giving it a very special         status.  They are saying that somehow: a) we ought to do it; and b)         others can make a claim against us that they have a right that the duty         be exercised.                         I would want to say most of these         obligations are rather nonspecific.  Yes, we have an obligation to         raise children well.  We have an obligation to our national defense and         so forth and so on.                         But I guess I want to say that you         can't use the language.  You can't make it a very specific kind         of obligation because you then have to say, who is the one who has to         carry it out?                         If you want to say there is an obligation         to carry out research, who has the duty to do that research?  Do we as         citizens have a duty that we must put up the money for it?  Does the         researcher, young researcher, have a duty that he must go into the         field that will deal with XYZ problem?                       It's narrow and very specifically goal-directed.  The imperfect                obligation it seems to me is the more general one.  So I put it                in the category of the imperfect, not the perfect.                    CHAIRMAN KASS:   Very quickly, Michael,         we're at the break time.  Let me ask the remaining people.  Dan,         are you okay for another ten minutes?  I know you have a plane to         catch?                          DR. CALLAHAN:   Yes.  Unfortunately, I         came from vacation on an island in Maine.  You can't get there from         here or back to there from here without leaving soon.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Seven minutes?                          DR. CALLAHAN:   Yes.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   We'll ask people not         to run over so the people in the queue can speak.  I have Gil, Mary         Ann, Janet, and Dan Foster.                          PROF. MEILAENDER:   Just quickly, Dan,         I wonder if I can get you to think with us just a little bit about the         structure of your argument because it seems to me there are a couple of         aspects to it.                         The one aspect that flows out of the         language of imperfect obligations is to start from goals, really,         aspirations that we seek to realize.  And there are many such goals         that we think of as goods.  And we often, contrary to Paul's         American optimism, we can't fulfill all of them.                         That in some ways becomes a process of         political argument, then.  And that's, in fact, what you have         advocated.  You would like to see more overt political argument.  There         is not necessarily any single answer that has to be given to how we         should weigh defense and medicine and education and so forth.                         It is also true, your talk about informed         consent suggests that in terms of the means to those goals, that there         are occasions when, even when a clear good could perhaps be realized,         one has to forego it simply because the means to it is prohibited.  And         that's what the principle of informed consent accomplishes.                         I just wonder if that doesn't need a         little more emphasis than you gave it, in a sense.  If there is not a         research imperative, to use that language, then I don't think the         primary reason is that we have a number of goals which we have to weigh         and that sometimes health care might come out not at the top.                         The primary reason is that we have         accepted, and I think in some ways the research community has accepted,         the fact that there are certain things that ought not be done even to         achieve a certain kind of undisputed good.  That's where you simply         can't claim that there is an imperative to do it because there is         some other imperative that really does trump it and is overriding.                         So, insofar as there is not a research         imperative, it seems to me that that fact grows primarily out of         prohibited means, rather than simply out of conflicting ends or goals.          Doesn't it?                          DR. CALLAHAN:   Well, it seems to me that         you can say that informed consent itself is a kind of moral         imperative.  And it's over against the research imperative.                         I guess I want to argue that the research         imperative is troublesome when it is taken to have the power to         overcome those moral obstacles.  That's when it seems to me it         causes trouble, moral trouble.  And it basically says it is such a high         goal that the means don't matter, that it is worth achieving         because what you are doing is of such ultimate good.                          PROF. MEILAENDER:   But you've         actually got a duty of perfect obligation in the requirement that you         respect informed consent.                          DR. CALLAHAN:   Well, in that particular         case, because you have a trust relationship between a doctor and a         researcher and a research subject, in that case, you have a situation         of perfect obligation because it is a much more narrow contractual         relationship of —                          PROF. MEILAENDER:   Not just because         of the narrow relation.  Because every human being has a right to claim         that over against potential researchers.                          DR. CALLAHAN:   But that's exactly the         point.  They have a right to claim it against researchers because we         agree that there is a particular relationship that ought to obtain         between researcher and subject.  And we, therefore, have put it into         the category of a perfect obligation; whereas, earlier, I think it was         not seen that way.  That was what the whole debate was about.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Mary Ann and Janet.                          PROF.GLENDON:   I want to thank you         very much for giving us your expansive vision of bioethics as         including, among other things, the ethical dimensions of the choices we         make about what social goods to pursue, and I just want to see if I can         make a little extension of your argument.  You have told us that         research is a good to be pursued among other goods and that there are         difficult problems of choosing among those goods.                         The extension I would like to make is         that in setting priorities among those goods, if you don't set them         thoughtfully, and after deliberation, then they are going to be set by         default or by the influence of special interests.  Would you accept         that as —                          DR. CALLAHAN:   Oh, absolutely.                          PROF.GLENDON:   And so some of the         references you made to what happens in other countries suggests that         there is more of a process of deliberation and balancing in some other         countries than there is here within the democratic forum.                         Of course, a cynical side of me says,         ""Well, yes, European countries can, just as they do with defense         spending, let us spend the big bucks on medical research.  And then         they have the luxury of democratic deliberation about education,""         et cetera.                         Nevertheless, the question I come to is,         why do you think it is that it is so difficult in these discussions to         get a public debate or even a legislative debate of the type that you         mentioned happens in England, a discussion of the pros and cons of         pursuing the various good things in a world of scarcity?                          DR. CALLAHAN:   Well, to me the great         difference between Europe and the United States is, at least as far as         health is concerned and a lot of welfare programs, the government         actually runs everything.                         They either control the financing or         financing and delivery as well.  And that means they have to work         within a closed budget.  And once you're forced to work within a         closed budget, you then are forced to deal with priorities.  You're         then forced to deal with rationing, saying some things are         comparatively more or less important.                         By virtue of our strange mixture of the         public and the private, we have no way to have a rational discussion         because you have so many different actors with different rules of the         game.                         I mean, the whole private sector can go         out and develop all sorts of things medically and technologically,         which are absolutely beyond the control of any government or any         regulation; e.g., private stem cell research, private human cloning if         they want.                         Under those circumstances, it is very         hard to set a budget.  It is very hard to have a rational discussion.          And it is very hard to have any kind of unified outlook that enables         you to set priorities.                         Now, the National Institutes of Health         has set a priority discussion and for a very simple reason.  They have         to live within a budget.  They get a certain amount of money.  And they         then have to decide how to spend that money.  So priorities are forced         upon them.  But we don't have a country that is run like the         National Institutes of Health.                         So that's why I happen to think         government is a good thing in this area because the market does not         enforce discipline.  The market forces profligacy; whereas, it is the         government's and closed budgets for discipline and         priority-setting.  We don't have it.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Janet Rowley and Dan         Foster.                          DR. ROWLEY:   Well, I appreciate the         thoughtfulness with which you have prepared the material.  I have to         say that I have very serious reservations, some of which were already         expressed in a sense by Paul.                         To me, the use of research imperative         implies that there is some direction of this imperative and an         agreement to its goals, even unstated.  And it seems to me this does         not reflect the real world of science or biomedical science as I have         lived it for over 40 years.                         Your statement just now about who is         going to tell a scientist to do stem cell research, that is not the way         science is carried out at all.  It is true it is carried out that way         in companies, but in the academic world, which is where fundamental         research is really flourishing, the scientists are the ones who have         the intellectual curiosity and the creativity to say, ""Isn't         this an interesting question?"" and to follow up on it.                         I think Liz Blackburn is a wonderful         example of somebody who was studying how the ends of chromosomes in         yeast were formed and maintained and discovered the enzyme telomerase.          And now this turns out to be a very important enzyme in cancer.  But         who would have expected research in yeast to then have that kind of         applicability?                         So there is no direction necessarily in         medical research.  It is what scientists find interesting.  Now, it is         absolutely true that many of the interests are channeled by research         questions that are considered to be very important or research areas         that are the hot topics.  And if you are a young scientist, that is         what you want to do because that is where the action is.                         But I just don't think that there is         a research imperative.  So I think that your example of NIH and their         following many different ways of Parkinson's, in part, that is         because there is no good answer.  So you try all of the options, hoping         that one or a combination of options will really give you greater         insight that will allow you, then, the next step to go beyond.                       And I realize you have a plane to catch, but I want to come back to                Alfonso's question of non-therapeutic research on children.                 I want to point out that our understanding now of how babies learn,                of how infants learn, of how different aspects of the nervous system                mature at different stages and allow infants to gradually respond                and observe, is all done by research, non-therapeutic research.                 And it has led to enormous changes on how we look on babies and                how we look on intelligence.                   So you have to put these in the context         of what it is that you are doing, what is the goal.  It may not benefit         that baby, but it sure is going to benefit babies down the line.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Dan Foster.  Why         don't we take both questions, Dan, and then we'll let you         comment?                          DR. FOSTER:   Well, I will give it to you         that the Council seems to have their loquacious genes fully on this         morning.  As a consequence, I am going to bring it back towards the         mean by depriving the Council of my remarks, which were really of         eternal significance, but I am not going to —                          (Laughter.)                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Do you want to follow         that?  Why don't you respond to Janet?                          DR. CALLAHAN:   Okay.  I certainly         wasn't claiming that the research imperative has goals.  The         research imperative in its benign sense I simply mean has a very strong         sense within the scientific community supported by the American public         that research is a good thing that ought to go forward.  And we ought         to put money into it.  And that's what I mean by the imperative,         that this is a valuable thing that should be carried out.  That's         all.                         The goals are all over the place.  People         have different goals at different levels and so forth, so on.  And, of         course, you are someone who spoke for the research imperative.  Your         scientific colleague said exactly sort of what I was saying.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Council members, we have         run over.  We have a guest waiting to speak.  Let's return at five         minutes of 11:00.  Dan Callahan, thank you very much for being with         us.  We're adjourned for 15 minutes.                         (Applause.)                        (Whereupon, the foregoing matter went off the record at 10:41 a.m.                and went back on the record at 10:58 a.m.)                                   SESSION 2:  STEM                CELL RESEARCH:   CURRENT ETHICAL LITERATURE                   CHAIRMAN KASS:   This is the second session, ""Stem Cell Research:                 Current Ethical Literature.""  As Council members surely recall,                the formation of this council was connected to President Bush's                decision announced in his address to the nation in August of 2001                to permit for the first time the use of federal funds to support                research on human embryonic stem cells, this despite the existence                of congressional statute, the Dickey-Wicker Amendment that prohibited                the use of federal funds for research in which a human embryo or                embryos are destroyed, discarded, or knowingly subjected to injury                or death, risks of injury or death, greater than that allowed for                research on fetuses  in utero .                   Among its other functions, this Council         was charged with monitoring stem cell research; that is, following and         keep abreast of all developments, scientific, medical, ethical, and         legal, in this exciting area of research, embryonic and adult.  The         rest of today's meeting is given over entirely to helping us         fulfill that charge.                         We are following and monitoring         developments in the ethical argumentations on stem cell research,         developments in the basic scientific research and clinical application,         developments in the state laws, as these have taken place over the past         two years under the current federal policy.                         To aid us in these monitoring tasks, we         have commissioned seven review papers:  one on recent developments of         the discussions of the ethics of stem cell research, five on recent         scientific and clinical developments in five separate areas of         embryonic and adult stem cell research, one on recent developments in         state law regarding stem cell research.                         The ethics review paper was prepared by         our guest for this session, Professor Paul Lauritzen, who is professor         of the Department of Religious Studies and the director of the Program         of Applied Ethics at John Carroll University in Cleveland.  Speaking         only for myself, I would note with gratitude that Professor Lauritzen         has tried in his paper to expand our horizon of the relevant ethical         issues to include matters beyond the one that has so preoccupied us,         namely the important issue of the moral status of the embryo.                         I would like to welcome Professor         Lauritzen, who will offer a beginning presentation, after which both         the presentation and his paper will be open for our discussion.  Thank         you very much for joining us.  We look forward to hearing from you.                          DR. LAURITZEN:   Thank you.                         Let me begin by saying I made the mistake         of sending the slide show ahead of time and got a call from Dean Clancy         last night wondering what the slide show and my presentation had to do         with my report because I had decided not to simply summarize my report         but to just highlight a few themes in my presentation.                         And I suspect that Dean is a better and         keener observer of human nature because he pointed out that perhaps not         everyone would have read the report as carefully as I might have         assumed.  But I wasn't going to write another presentation at nine         o'clock last night.  And so I am going to give the one I wrote,         which really takes some themes of my report and tries to highlight them         by way of some additional data.  Mostly I am just going to read this.                         Several people who have read the draft of         my report have commented that for someone who argues that we should         move beyond the debates about embryos and the status of the embryo, I         spend a lot of time in the report talking about embryos.                         At the risk of inviting that objection         today, I want to begin with of slide that reproduces data reported         recently from a study conducted jointly by the Society of Assisted         Reproductive Technology and the RAND Corporation on the number and         dispositions of frozen embryos in the country.  Forgive me if you have         already considered this data, but it wasn't clear to me whether you         had.                         As you can see from the slide maybe and         based on a survey of 340 of the 430 assisted reproductive technology         practices in the United States, the documented number of embryos in         frozen storage as of April 11, 2002 is approximately 400,000.                         Moreover, the study was able to document         the use to which these frozen embryos were designated by the IVF         couples from whom they came.  Indeed, one point of the study was to         determine how many frozen embryos are, in fact, available for use in         the derivation of stem cell lines.                       Despite the fact that many advocates of stem cell research call for                deriving stem cells from embryos left over from IVF procedures,                the authors of the study contend that so-called ""spare embryos""                are not a ready source of stem cell lines.                   Of the nearly 400,000 frozen embryos in         storage, apparently only 11,000 are available for possible use in         deriving stem cells.  Although this seems like a large number of         embryos, according to the authors, in fact, it is not.  And they break         down that 11,000 along these lines.                         Of those 11,000 or approximately 11,000,         only 65 percent will survive the thawing process, leaving roughly 7,000         embryos.  Only 25 percent of that 7,000 will develop to the blastocyst         stage, leaving roughly 2,000 blastocysts.  And only 15 percent of those         blastocysts will yield viable cell lines, leaving roughly 275 cell         lines.                         According to this study, then, despite         the large number of embryos frozen in this country, the number of         potential stem cell lines available from their use is relatively small.                         This is clearly an important study.  For         one thing, it gives empirical grounding to the claim that we can derive         stem cell lines from frozen embryos.  It is less likely to be widely         cited.                         My reason for beginning with it, however,         is quite different.  I wish to highlight not the number of frozen         embryos cited in the study but, rather, the date of the study's         publication, namely May 2003.                       As the study points out, the first live birth in this country                from a cryo-preserved embryo was in 1986.  That means for nearly                20 years, we have had almost no idea of the scope of embryo cryo-preservation                in this country.  Let me make two observations about this fact.                                First, I believe it supports my claim         that talk about respecting the embryo from conception is frequently         more rhetorical than anything else.  If the early embryo is really to         be treated as a being who deserves serious respect, you would think         that we would at least know how many embryos are routinely frozen,         discarded, or otherwise lost through IVF.  Not to put too sharp a point         on it, but if each embryo were equivalent in value to a dollar bill, we         would have lost track of nearly half a million dollars.                         Second, the fact that until recently we         knew almost nothing about the numbers or the dispositions of frozen         embryos highlights just how unregulated the world of reproductive         medicine is.                       As this Council knows well and as the staff working paper to be discussed                tomorrow highlights, the world of reproductive medicine is almost                entirely unregulated.  Cryo-preservation of embryos is just one                of the many developments in reproductive medicine that has been                introduced as therapy without any sort of clinical trials and without                any real oversight.  The significance of this fact in relation to                stem cell research is that we have in reproductive medicine a model                for what happens when commerce is wedded to desperation, when research                is privatized, and when there is essentially no regulation.                   More than one commentator has invoked the         image of the Wild West to capture this scene.  The image strikes me as         particularly apt, not least because the wild West was notoriously         dangerous, at least as it has been conceived in the popular         imagination.                         There are clear dangers in the         unregulated world of reproductive medicine.  I know there is some         controversy about this point, but consider the report in the  New         England Journal of Medicine  last year on the risks of major defects         after ICSI and  in vitro  fertilization.                         According to this study, infants         conceived of reproductive technology were more than twice as likely as         naturally conceived infants to have major birth defects diagnosed         during the first year of life and were also more likely to have         multiple major defects.  These were the odds ratios after the numbers         were adjusted for maternal age, multiple births, and other factors that         might have skewed the data upward.                         Moreover, the increased risks were not         confined to just one organ system.  They were found in cardiovascular,         urogenital, musculoskeletal, and gastrointestinal systems.                         Again, my point is not to focus on         specific problems with reproductive medicine, as it is currently         practiced, but to highlight a pattern.  Just as opposition to embryo         research has led to the privatization of work on  in vitro          fertilization, with virtually no oversight or regulation of IVF, so,         too, has it led to the privatization of stem cell research with similar         results.                         This is one reason I have noted the         relation of IVF and stem cell research in my report.  The other is that         I do not think we have fully appreciated the deep tensions between the         widespread acceptance of IVF and a widespread profession of respect for         the early embryos.                         A foolish consistency may be the         hobgoblin of little minds.  And Emerson may be right that such a         consistency is adored by statesmen, philosophers, and divines.  But         consistency in ethics is rarely foolish.                       I have no quarrel with Emerson's advice to speak your mind forcefully                today, even if it flatly contradicts what you thought and said yesterday.                 My concern is that we speak out of both sides of our mouths simultaneously                when we say that destroying an embryo is killing a person or that,                indeed, the early embryo deserves profound respect and also say                or act as if discarding embryos in IVF is non-problematic.                   I tried to illustrate this point in my         report by drawing attention to the cartoon comparing reactions to a         stem cell clinic and an abortion clinic and then asking the reader to         imagine that an IVF clinic is substituted for the stem cell clinic.          Here is the cartoon.                       As you can see, the cartoon depicts protesters in front of a stem                cell research lab, condemning those who worked there as being anti-life.                 Down the street at the abortion clinic, the workers are noting how                quiet things have gotten at the facility since the stem cell lab                opened.                 The point of the cartoon, of course, is that opposition to stem cell                research appears to be almost as passionate as opposition to abortion                and that there is perhaps an irony in the fact that pro-life advocates,                thus, appear to be committed to demonstrating against research being                done to find treatments for Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and                other devastating illnesses.                   Now, try to imagine protesters standing         outside an IVF clinic or, even better, outside maternity wings,         condemning couples who use IVF as murderers or at least complicit with         murder.  It is almost impossible to imagine this scene.  And it is         worth asking why.                         If the early embryo is fully a person,         shouldn't we condemn IVF and work to prohibit it?  Is condemning         stem cell research but accepting IVF not inconsistent?                         Of course, one response to this alleged         inconsistency would be to say that we should, in fact, be consistent in         trying to prohibit both IVF and embryonic stem cell research.  I do not         subscribe to that position myself, nor do I think it is a politically         viable option.  But it would at least be consistent.                         Notice, however, that a ban on embryonic         stem cell research will not eliminate the many issues raised by the         prospect of regenerative medicine.  And that is another theme from my         report that I wish to highlight.                         Although the ethics debate has mostly         focused on the status of the early embryo and has, therefore, tended         almost exclusively to issues raised by embryonic stem cell research, we         need to take a closer look at issues raised by the prospect of adult         stem cell research as well.                       I have discussed some of these issues in my report.  And I merely                list some of them here.  They include issues of social justice;                of commodification or of commerce; issues about the conception of                nature and what nature might mean; issues about human embodiment;                issues raised by the erosion of species boundaries, so-called hybridization;                and issues for implications of personal identity and moral responsibility.                                Worries about eroding the boundaries         among species, about destabilizing the concept of nature, and about         treating human bodies merely instrumentally are related.                         I believe that this cluster of issues         deserves special attention going forward.  And, again, my point is that         it's a cluster that is raised for adult stem cell research as well         as for embryonic.  So that while we ought to continue debating the         status of the embryo, we also ought to move beyond that debate to focus         on these other issues as well.                         I also think that we might do well, at         least initially, to think about these issues outside of the contested         question of human nature.  For example, I wonder whether there is some         merit in considering the pervasive human manipulation of nonhuman         animals.                       For example, it may be useful to take as more than a curiosity                the so-called transgenic art of Eduardo Kac.  Several years ago                Kac made headlines around the world with his public art intervention                that included Alba, the green fluorescent protein bunny.                   As you may recall, Alba was an albino         rabbit that glowed green under certain light because it had been         genetically altered and carried a gene from a jellyfish.                         Kac defined transgenic art as ""a new         art form based on the use of genetic engineering to transfer natural or         synthetic genes to an organism to create new living beings.""  And         here is a slide of Kac with Alba.                         Many people were outraged at Kac's         creation.  And many dismissed his work as a publicity stunt.  But, in         fact, part of the point of the Alba project was to generate a public         conversation on the cultural and ethical implications of genetic         engineering.                         According to Kac, ""The creation of a         chimeric animal forces us to examine notions of normalcy,         heterogeneity, purity, hybridity, and otherness.""  Here is Alba         glowing green.                       The claim that I just read is a bit too jargon-filled for my taste.                 That he did not use ""alterity,"" instead of ""otherness,""                is astonishing.  But Kac's work invites us to reflect on the                implications of turning nonhuman animals into artifacts.  Of course,                we have been doing that for a very long time.  Still, it's worth                thinking carefully about our reaction to the creation of Alba.                   It is worth asking whether our reaction         to Alba is different from our reaction to, say, the creation of the         Harvard oncomouse and if so, why.                         I began my written report with a passage         from C. S. Lewis.  And so it's perhaps fitting to draw my         presentation to a close with another passage from the ""Abolition         of Man.""  Lewis writes, ""Now, I take it when we understand a         thing analytically and then dominate it and use it for our own         convenience, we reduce it to the level of 'nature' in the sense         that we suspend our judgments of value about it; ignore its final         cause, if any; and treat it in terms of quantity.  The repression of         elements in what would otherwise be our total reaction to it is         sometimes very noticeable and even painful.  Something has to be         overcome before we can cut up a dead man or a live animal in a         dissecting room.""                         Although it is perhaps justifiable to         reduce the world of nature to mere nature, as Lewis puts it, I am         inclined to agree with him that something is lost when we do so.                         When I reread the ""Abolition of         Man"" in working on this presentation, I was struck by the fact         that the sort of dynamic Lewis describes here is very close to that         recorded in Jonathan Glover's impressive work ""Humanity, A         Moral History of the 20th Century.""                         Glover writes, ""Human responses are         the core of the humanity which contracts within humanity.  They are         widely distributed.  But to identify them with humanity is only partly         an empirical claim.  It remains also partly an aspiration.""                         As Glover powerfully argues, morality         must be rooted in human needs and values.  And these needs and values         are both rooted in human nature and grounded in human aspiration.                         As we move forward to wrestle with issues         of stem cell research, we ought to be conscious of what is at stake in         the possibility of redefining either our natures or our aspirations,         for, as Glover makes clear, the inhumanity of humans is a frightening         and all too familiar thing.                         Thank you.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you very much.  I         assume, Professor Lauritzen, that both the presentation and the paper         are fair game in the discussion.                          DR. LAURITZEN:   Sure, absolutely.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Does someone want to         start?  Jim Wilson, please?                        PROF. WILSON:   I wanted to be clear, Professor                Lauritzen, in your views.  You displayed the differences in the                cumulative prevalence of diagnosed major birth defects singled in                infants resulting either from natural conception or IVF and pointed                out that the data suggest that that incidence is roughly twice as                high with IVF as it is with natural conception.                   Do you conclude from that that we should         be opposed to IVF?                          DR. LAURITZEN:   No.  I mean, first let me         say that data is somewhat controversial, I gather, in that there are         other studies that don't show that kind of risk.  Rather, my point         is that we don't have the data.  I mean, that is part of the issue         here.                         I have to go back and look, but I think         that data actually came from western Australia.  So it doesn't even         reflect data in this country.  I think that is right.  I would have to         go back and look.                         The point is we are not tracking the         potential health consequences of  in vitro  fertilization in         anything like the way we should.  And it seems to me part of the reason         is that this is an area, reproductive medicine is, which has almost no         oversight.  And it obviously also has almost no federal funding.                         Had there been federal funding, there         might have been more oversight.  But even apart from the issue of         federal funding, it is an issue of one area of medicine where the move         from a novel idea, like intracytoplasmic sperm injection, moves very         quickly into clinical practice when it is really a therapeutic modality         that has been largely untested.                         And then it is offered as a therapy when         it is really, in fact, experimental and not tracked in any significant         way.  So we don't know, long term, what the genuine health risks         have been.                       So that one of the issues here I think a staff working paper —                the Council may have flagged that.  The little regulation there                is tends to be sort of consumer protection regulation so that prospective                couples using IVF should be protected in some way, get adequate                information about success rates of clinics and things of that sort                when, in fact, there may be larger public health issues about the                long-term implications for women and children, for the women undergoing                high-dose hormones to induce hyperovulation and for the children                to see if there are long-term health consequences or, for that matter,                short-term ones.                  PROF. WILSON:   Could I make one follow-up?                    DR. LAURITZEN:   Please?                        PROF. WILSON:   I certainly agree with you about                the unfortunate lack of longitudinal research that will track babies                from these processes.  My view is that we should encourage this.                                But let's suppose there is this         longitudinal research to the extent that we can.  And let's         suppose, in effect, it replicates the data you have presented for the         United States over the long term.  Would such data lead you to question         the value of IVF?                        DR. LAURITZEN:   Well, I think it raises certainly issues about                which there is a significant literature in the philosophical side                of things about so-called harm to future children.                   And there are folks like John Robertson         who have argued a variation of the point that essentially you can't         harm by bringing that into existence because without the technology,         this child would not exist or the adults that might come from the         child.                         So that even if it turned out that there         were significant health risks, much higher rates of cancer in children,          in vitro  fertilization procedures, that you haven't, in         fact, harmed those children because they wouldn't have existed         otherwise.                         My own view is that that is not the right         approach to frame it entirely in terms of harm to the specific child         and compare that to nonexistence, which obviously is a difficult         comparison.                         So I'm dodging your specific         question, I think, a bit except to say we ought to sort through it.  I         mean, obviously there is no regulation preventing couples to reproduce         who are carriers of known genetic effects with a certain percentage         likelihood of problems for their children.                         So I am not saying necessarily that that         would mean we should shut down IVF programs, but it's information         we need.  It's, frankly, information that ought to be a kind of         obviously a fairly detailed part of the informed consent process for         couples considering using IVF.  And I don't think that any of those         things are true now.                        PROF.WILSON:   Thank you.                    CHAIRMAN KASS:   Janet Rowley?                        DR. ROWLEY:   I would like to follow up on both your comment and                then Jim's question because I think that it is extraordinarily                important that we emphasize, as we have in previous Council meetings                and in the document we have under consideration, the lack of reliable                long-term data on the outcome of IVF and ICSI and other procedures.                                I think we have to emphasize that that is         because there has been no money available to gather such data.  And         such data is going to be very, very costly to obtain.                       I know just in terms of our own research projects of tracking                down cancer patients and what's the long-term outcome of their                treatment, that to try to find these individuals is extremely difficult.                                The laws have just been changed, the         Privacy Act.  So I would think that before you can contact any         individual, you have to go to the clinic.  The clinic has to go to that         patient and say that they're trying to collect information and         would the patient be willing to provide that information before you can         even begin the collection process.                       So this is no small task that we have set and that apparently CDC is                embarking on because it is a two or a three-stage process before                you get it.                   And you say research is privatized.  This         is the only area of medicine in which research is privatized.  And,         again, that leads to the problems that we are currently facing.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you.                          DR. LAURITZEN:   Can I just make one         observation on that?                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Please?                          DR. LAURITZEN:   I think there is going to         be that difficulty of getting consent.  There is also I think in the         case of reproductive medicine the additional difficulty that the         prospective parents in giving that consent would have to be         acknowledging in a way that is different from cancer, where the         expectation is that there is going to be certain morbidity and         mortality.                       Well, the assumption that most infertile couples have is that                if we go forward with this, we are going to have a healthy child                and there aren't going to be long-term problems.  So I think                to some degree, reproductive docs are going to be a bit reluctant                to raise the specter of potential long-term harms going in.                    DR. ROWLEY:   Can I make two comments?          One, my impression is that most infertile couples who live in states         where there is no insurance and, therefore, they are paying 30 to 50         thousand dollars for this procedure are pretty sophisticated and, as a         consequence, know the risks that they face.                       What we are trying to get is data on children 5 or 10 years old or older                now and what is their status so that the individuals involved in                IVF 5, 10, or 15 years ago gave no such consent for this follow-up                information.  And that is the first step of running a survey, to                get their permission to even contact them to get the information.                                 CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you.                         Just as one fact, I understand that the         NIH is gearing up for a massive study on children, a prospective         study.  And it might be of interest to us to explore the ways in which         some of the things that we would be interested in might be incorporated         in the planning of this study as it goes forward.  But that's for a         later discussion.                         I had myself in the queue.  Let me deal         with things in the paper, rather than in the presentation.  A couple of         comments and then a question.  First, I guess it's fair to say you         criticize what you take to be the excessively individualistic treatment         of the ethical questions, especially as they are concerned with the         matters of the embryo or even the language of rights in this area.                         I would simply observe that in questions         of life and death, which, after all, are things that befall         individuals, a certain individualistic focus ought not to be pejorative         but is somehow necessary, that there might be other kinds of goods that         are here that don't concern individuals, but the people who care         about whether or not embryonic life is destroyed will, in fact, care         about the death of individuals.  And that can't be avoided.          Whenever you are dealing with a question of death, you can't sort         of avoid that.  That would be an observation.  I don't imagine you         would dissent from it.  I would take that as a friendly amendment.                         Second, on the questions of economics and         commerce, it seems to me there are three things potentially that are         bothering you here.  One is the notion of commerce in the body         altogether.  Second are questions having to do with distributive         justice and unequal access to the benefits that are available.  And         third is a kind of faint whiff of a dislike of profit, although it         doesn't come out very strongly.                         These are questions that have come up         around the table before.  And I am sometimes sympathetic to these         arguments, but reading your paper made me less so for these reasons.                         It seemed to me that the mere assertion         of inequality is not ipso facto a demonstration of injustice, though         the question of equal access is important.  The remarks about the truck         company said, after all, why should they be able to profit from the         embryos when the people whose embryos they were don't?  The answer         to that is they have mixed their labor with it extracting the stem         cells.  The embryos as such are not by themselves valuable until         somebody has done something to them.  So at least there is a prima         facie case for saying that there is some claim for profit.                         And then on the question of commerce in         the body, I am not so sure whether it is the money changing hands that         bothers us as much as it is sort of the free alienation of body parts.          We don't object to people selling their labor, although people have         done so.  And, therefore, I wonder whether what might bother us is even         —  if there was something that was somehow disquieting simply about the         giving of an embryo for research, we would be bothered by the fact that         someone might be paid for it.  I think the commercial aspect of this is         a sign that there is something beneath the commerce that is troubling         to us.                         I have got more, but that is too much.          Let me stop.  I would be interested in your comment, really, on this         nest of the economic questions.  It's not the first time that we         have taken them up, but we haven't taken up in the stem cell         context.  And I think it would be useful to spend a few minutes on         that.                          DR. LAURITZEN:   Sure.  Well, my first         reaction is to say that I'm not sure your nose for the smell of the         concern about profit is on target.  I would be happy to accept a larger         stipend for my work here.  So we can talk about that afterwards.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   People make exceptions to         their own case.                          DR. LAURITZEN:   I mean, I do think         it's a fair observation.  And it depends, I suppose.  One point         about the embryo, the difference between the researcher who mixes his         or her labor to produce the product and the embryo is going to depend,         of course, what stage we're talking about with embryo research.                       And, arguably, women have mixed the labor of their body in producing                either the eggs and going through the hormone regimens to generate                the embryos or if we're talking about an embryo then subsequently                brought to term, obviously there is the work of gestation, though                I don't like that kind of language particularly.  And that may                just be my anti-profit convictions of some sort.                   As you were talking, I was trying to         think of some comparisons.  Here I am just trying to mine an intuition         in a way that as I thought about surrogacy, for example, in the past, I         have always found the prospect of surrogacy more troubling in a case         where there is a paid surrogate than in a case where there might be a         family member who has stepped forward to carry a child.                         So I am not sure quite how you put the         point, but there is something about the commercial aspect of paying the         surrogate that seems problematic in a way that a sister or a cousin or         something who might offer to gestate a child doesn't invoke.  So I         am not sure —                           CHAIRMAN KASS:   Why is that?                          DR. LAURITZEN:   Yes.  I think it is a         good question.  In part —  well, I'm not sure.  Let me say that my         inclination at this point is to draw on the story of the minister who         had gone to seminary and had training in doing sermons, which I         haven't had the benefit of.  This guy was giving a talk at the         university.  And he had a written text.  I went up afterwards.  In the         margin throughout, there were a couple of marginal notes that were         ""PP.""                       So I was puzzled by this.  And I asked him what they referred                to.  And he said, ""Pound the pulpit.""  So he always pounded                the pulpit at the weakest point in his argument.  And I'm inclined                to pound the pulpit here.                   I'm not sure that's the best         response, but it may be all I can come up with right now.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Gil Meilaender and         Alfonso.                          PROF. MEILAENDER:   At the risk of         dismaying our chairman, although perhaps not to your surprise, I want         to come to a question about the structure of your paper, the way you         work it out, where you suggest that there has been too much attention         paid to the embryo status question and not enough to this other range         of things.  Leon congratulated you on that, and I want to worry about         that a little bit.  Well, okay, Leon, I am just having a little fun         with you.                          I haven't at the moment come up with         a great analogy, but if in the instance of warfare, for instance, we         were using all sorts of very large, powerful weapons with very little         concern about the collateral damage that came to people apart from the         military targets themselves and I was worried about that and you said,         ""Well, yeah, but let's don't focus too much on that.          Let's worry about the fact that we are probably stereotyping our         enemies when we think we can do this to them,"" that we may coarsen         our sensibilities in pursuing warfare in this way, that acquiescing too         quickly in this may keep us from developing other better kinds of         weapons and those are the things that we really ought to worry about         while proceeding to bombing the living daylights out of them in this         way, it would strike me that —  and you will recognize that this is a         version of a different formulation —  that would be an argument for         sort of unlimited casualties always with tears.                         We should always feel bad about these         casualties because of all of these other reasons involved while we         continue to inflict them.  It seems to me that that is sort of the         structure of your argument.  And while I don't wish to deny that         one or another of the issues that you raise might be important to think         about, indeed, that they are all important and that taken as a package,         they bear considerable weight, I can't imagine that we would worry         so much about them if we had entirely set aside the issue that you say         we have worried too much about, namely what we ought to think about the         embryo.                         And so I guess what I want to know is,         will you accept my description of the structure of your argument as         sort of unlimited stem cell research always with tears?  And if you         will, are you really prepared to defend that kind of moral argument?                          DR. LAURITZEN:   What you need to know is         that Gil has accused me of this once before.  I think I denied it in         that context and will probably deny it again here.                         It seems to me that in urging in some way         the expansion of the moral discussion, I don't want to suggest that         we not attend to the status of the embryo.  There may be a way in which         I put my point too rhetorically sharply to try to suggest that.                         So I don't want to suggest that we         stop talking about the embryos, the status of the embryo.  We are going         to have sharp disagreements around the room.  And there is a sense in         which what I said in the report was suggestive of the fact that, look,         it's hopeless.  We're never going to make any progress on         this.  So let's just stop talking about it.                         And I may have come close to saying         something like that.  I didn't mean to.  After all, we have made         progress on moral status questions in the past.  I mean, we certainly         in this country have made progress with regard to African American         status and the status of women historically.                         I think there is some reason to suggest         that we have made at least some progress with regard to thinking about         the status of nonhuman animals.  So I think their status questions are         important and we should continue to talk about them.                         But my point, instead —  and I suppose         this is something of a structural issue.  My point is to say, why         don't we bracket for a moment that which divides us and focus on         that about which we are united?  There may not be universal agreement         about those thing we're united about, but I think we would find         more commonality around the table if we started focusing on some of the         issues that I identified that apply to both embryonic stem cell         research and adult stem cell research, which might, in fact, lead us to         hesitate to do embryonic stem cell research, not because we share the         conviction that their early embryo is a person with a full moral status         but because we agree on a cluster of other values.                         So that I don't think I am         necessarily suggesting that we continue doing, necessarily doing,         embryonic stem cell research and just wringing our hands about it,         though I do say in the end, just to try to weigh my own position out,         in fairness, that I think it is justified to go forward with both         embryonic stem cell research and adult stem cell research in a         carefully regulated way.                          PROF. MEILAENDER:   As long as         we're haunted by it.  Is that the language?                          DR. LAURITZEN:   Yes, that we will be         haunted by it, we will be wringing our hands about it and I will be         crying and tearful.  But I could easily be persuaded that part of the         regulation would be, for example, moratorium on embryonic stem cell         research until we do more adult stem cell work but, even there, be         awfully careful about how we are doing it.                         So I don't entirely accept your         characterization, but it's not entirely unfair either.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   I have Alfonso.  Bill, do         you want on this point or —                           DR. MAY:   Not directly.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Okay.  Then I'll put         you on the queue.  Alfonso?                          DR.GÓMEZ-LOBO:   I'm going to refer         to the paper as well, but I'll preface that by saying that,         unfortunately, it seems to me on certain moral issues, we just have to         have sharp disagreements, the idea focusing on what we have in common.          That papers over the deeper question, will it not serve the American         public?                         I read your paper over a couple of times         because I don't see in the paper the presentation of the         arguments.  I see descriptions.  I see appeals.  But, for instance, to         put embryonic stem cell research and adult stem cell research as         closely connected it seems to be obscures an argument that some of us         have against one and in favor of the other.  That's why, for         instance, I would say I am all for stem cell research.                       My only concern, my single concern is that we not use, destroy,                or instrumentalize human beings to do that.  That is why, for instance,                one of the great challenges I see for the scientist is just try                to figure out how to get those stem cells without destroying the                organisms.                   It's a challenge from someone who is         viewing this from the point of view of moral philosophy.  And         that's why I am very interested in your arguments for your final         statement that you think that an embryo is not a person.                         And just to go out on a limb, let me give         you an argument.  And you please try to refute it.  I would say the         following.  I have a twin brother.  I was conceived 64 years ago.  I         got my genetic inheritance from my father presumably at the time.                         Genetically I am the same individual I         was back then.  And spatio-temporally also, I have the relationship of         saying this with that early embryo.  If you pursue me in time and         space, it turns out that I am the same individual.                         And then my second premise, well, I am a         person now.  I am a human being now, and I should be respected now.          Why should I not have been respected then?                          DR. LAURITZEN:   Well, a couple of things,         first about your earlier point.  I guess what I want to press you on is         why your only concern about stem cell research, adult or embryonic, is         that it may destroy human beings.                         I think there is certainly a range of         issues that I think have come up in other Council deliberations that I         would urge you to take up going forward about the social implications         of profoundly enhancing human characteristics in various ways, perhaps         radically increasing the human life span.  Whether that is realistic or         not is another matter.  But if, in fact, it is, it seems to me to raise         important moral issues.                         Already this morning we have had some         discussion.  Dan talked about Harold Varmus' concern about access         to therapies.  All of those issues are I think terribly pressing moral         ones.  And they don't have anything at all to do with destroying         embryos or necessarily destroying human persons.                         So in a way, that's what I mean to         say.  I think we would have a very interesting conversation about that         when we didn't talk about embryos at all.                       The second part has to do with embryos.  There is some material                in the report that I think is at least intriguing to talk about                the developmental potential of that early embryo as if it was, in                effect, a kind of little homunculus that just is going to develop                in a set way is just biologically inaccurate, that it's the                interaction of a complex set of systems that in your case, in fact,                led to an arc that 64 years later is you.  And you can trace back                that arc.  But that doesn't mean that there was the potential                in that early embryo or only one natural kind of teleology that                leads to you.                   In a different environment, it would have         led to some other.  Well, if we derive stem cells and then grow an         organ from them, say, well, we say that heart, we can trace back to         that embryo that was then disaggregated to produce the stem cells.                       I didn't jot down everything you said but genetic relation,                spatio-temporal relations, you could trace the same arc backwards                if the environment were such that it produced something else.                   This is a fairly common argument, but I         don't find it compelling.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   I'll give you one         more round briefly.  You see the incorrigibility of this.  One more         shot.                          DR.GÓMEZ-LOBO:   I'll follow the         rules.  A heart is a part of an organism.  It's not a complete         organism.  And what matters, really, is the entity through time of the         complete organism, it seems to me.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Michael Sandel, Bill May,         and then Rebecca is what I have.                          PROF.SANDEL:   I liked your paper         very much.  I was just going to offer a brief reply that you might         offer to Leon, but while I'm at it, I could also offer you a brief         reply to Alfonso.                          DR. LAURITZEN:   That would be great.                          PROF.SANDEL:   That would be that         it's also true that every oak tree was once an acorn, but it         doesn't follow that acorns are oak trees or that we should regard         the loss of an oak tree as the same as the loss of an acorn.                         The reply to Leon, do you want to hear         that now?                          DR. LAURITZEN:   Absolutely, and anybody         else.                          PROF.SANDEL:   The reply to Leon         might be that the reason that commerce in the body is objectionable in         a way that is independent from the giving, as in your surrogacy case,         the reason there may be a difference is that to support your intuition         that there is something objectionable to commercial surrogacy that         might not be the case with gifted surrogacy, say, of a sister, for         example, that the ground for that intuition might be that the body         isn't private property, open to any use that we may desire or         devise, but, instead, is a gift with a certain telos.  This should         appeal to Leon, in fact, a natural telos, which means that it's not         open to use for other lesser purposes, like making money.                         So that in the case of commercial         surrogacy, this would be a case of using the body or selling oocytes,         for example.  This would be a case of using the body for a purpose at         odds with its telos, namely making money.                         But to donate or to gift without any         commercial transaction for one's sister, say, to carry her child         wouldn't be objectionable in the same way.  It would still be in         accord with the natural telos of the body.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   I won't say more than         it's an odd natural telos to say that one woman's uterus is to         carry the child of someone else, even out of love.  I mean, that's         a new kind of natural teleology.  We would have to argue about it.                          PROF.SANDEL:   But you would agree,         wouldn't you, that it's in line with the natural purpose in a         way that selling it to make money clearly isn't?                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   No.  It's a nice         try.  But I think that if there weren't something disquieting about         the thing itself, the fact that money changed hands wouldn't even         occur.  The same thing is true about prostitution.  The same thing is         true about a whole range of things.                         I am not saying it is wrong, but we are         not, most of us are not, upset with the fact that people sell their         labor.  And the money changes hands.  And it may distort human         relations profoundly, but we don't regard that somehow as a deep         violation in the same way as a lot of people seem to regard the selling         of body parts as a violation.  And that must mean it has something to         do with the alienation of one's body from one's self to begin         with.                          PROF.SANDEL:   It's use, rather         than alienation.  The intuition at odds with this is kidney fails, a         lot of people that object to a market in kidneys who wouldn't         necessarily consider that our position requires you to say that there         is something objectionable to a kidney transplant as such.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   I said,         ""disquieting.""  I didn't say, ""objectionable.""                          PROF.SANDEL:   Well, even         disquieting.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   There is.  There is         something to begin with disquieting about taking an organ from one body         and putting it in another.  I think it's terrific that we do it.          It's not a question of an objection.  But it's odd.                         I'm sorry.  I'm not on trial         here.  It is Bill May.                          DR. MAY:   I hadn't planned to say         anything on surrogacy, but it seems to me not simply the question of         the telos of the body, but it's different.  Gestating is different         from manufacturing, where you can distinguish the process from the         product.  But in gestation, there is a kind of bonding to what is         within you.  And the releasing of that child to another because         it's a bond ought not simply to be based on commerce.                         The early court case on this said they         tried to distinguish process from product, you know.  And merely buying         the process misses what is going on for the woman and bonding and why         it should not be an enforceable contract.  It can only be a gift         because a kind of bonding has gone on.                         I was interested in another issue, and I         will take advantage of my opportunity here to say you and Dan Callahan         have brought up front the issue of access to benefits in a way that it         seems to me we have not as frontally discussed that topic.  It has come         up from time to time, but it really hasn't been as openly discussed         across a couple of sessions.  And I wanted to deal with that issue.                         There might be a way of talking about the         status of the embryo but relate that issue to the import for access to         product.  Some of us in this group did not agree with the idea of a         total ban on cloning for research purposes.  We talked about the         intermediate status of the embryo, that it is not fully there with the         claim of the human.  And, therefore, we were not ready to talk about a         ban.                       On the other hand, it is not nothing.  It is not yard-lot materials.                 It has a kind of intermediate status.  And that has implications.                 Most of our time was spent on the issue of how you do the research                and respect for this pre-implanted embryo.  Most of the discussion                was in that area.                 But it seems to me if you use the pre-implanted embryo in research,                one has to talk about regulations that not only constrain how you                conduct that research, let's say the 14 days before the neural                streak an all of that, but if you are using this human source and                you are removing it from life, you are not removing it from the                circle of human indebtedness.                   And that is a consideration that is not         simply individualism.  It's that you are conducting research on         something that doesn't have the full claim of urgent human needs of         extant human beings.                         But, on the other hand —  and I would not         want to use the word ""resource.""  I would call it         ""source,"" a human source.  And if you are conducting this         research and removing it from life, you are not removing it from the         circle of human indebtedness.  And that has consequences not only in         how you conduct the research, but you structure the results in such a         way that all of those who are in need have access to the benefits of         that research.                         Otherwise one creates I think a lack of         respect for what one has used.  And that doesn't mean you don't         pay researchers and so forth, but you think through the problem of the         health care system.                         I think Dan this morning talked about and         you yourself talked about expanding the issues.  We're concerned to         talk about are we going to produce a lot of products that would be         available only to the few and not to all of those in need.                         And it may be the status of the embryo,         this intermediate status, is not simply individualistic reflection but         forces us to think about the communal significance of what we have done         and the necessity of honoring it in such a way to make sure that it         reaches not just the few privileged but the many.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Gil, do you want —                           PROF. MEILAENDER:   Yes, just really         quickly.  Bill, this is a question for you.  We're letting Paul off         the hook.  I know you have made this argument before.  And I am sort of         afraid I may be asking the kind of question where I am just asking you         to repeat yourself, but I really don't understand that argument;         that is to say, the ""circle of indebtedness"" language.                         So that if we use some embryos and         distribute the knowledge gained unequally, we have somehow not honored         those embryos that we used; whereas, if we distribute the knowledge         equally, we have honored them.                         Now, I just don't understand.  I am         prepared to grant that it would be better to distribute the knowledge         equally than unequally.  I just don't see what in the world this         has got to do with whether we have honored the embryo as a human         source.  Can you help me?                          DR. MAY:   I'm not sure that I can do         it in a form that doesn't realize your fears.  It just seems to me         that in making use of this to produce this benefit, one has to insist         that it reach the many.  And that is not simply some principle out         there separate from, indeed, what has been done.                          PROF. MEILAENDER:   May I try once         more?                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Briefly, yes.                          PROF. MEILAENDER:   So we honor the         slave better if we distribute the cotton garments equally than if we         distribute them unequally.                        DR. MAY:   Well, you have assumed that I have equated the                pre-implanted embryo with an extant human being.                    PROF. MEILAENDER:   Well, it was a         human source.  That's all.                        DR. MAY:   That sets me up for an equation that I am not                prepared to assert.  I already began with the notion of the intermediate                status.  And the slave does not have an intermediate status.                    CHAIRMAN KASS:   Mr. Lauritzen, do you         want to respond to the original comment?                          DR. LAURITZEN:   I was hoping Michael         would do that for me, but let me say just a couple of things.  In the         past, I have tried to weigh out a position that tries to avoid         understanding the early embryo as a person with a full set of rights         and to use language that is common and controversial about respecting         this as a source or whatever precise language we use and that one way         to do that would be, in fact, to do the research on adult stem cell         first, see what we can learn there as a last resort and perhaps         invoking fairly explicitly just war theory to do this deterrence of         using embryonic research if we hit dead ends.                       There are some issues about scientifically whether that is a viable                strategy, I understand.  But over time, I have come to be a little                concerned that —  and this is I think reflected to some degree in                the report.  I have become somewhat suspicious of the language of                respecting the early embryo.  And this I think partly goes to Gil's                point, while, nevertheless, destroying itregularly, et cetera.                 Perhaps the better way to proceed here would be to talk about                a slightly different frame for thinking about this, the way in which                we have increasingly kind of instrumentalized everything about our                world.  I mentioned before the instrumentalization of non-human                animals so that they're simply now artifacts that we create                with different traits without any concern for their value as independent                organisms.                   And I think we see the same dynamic with          in vitro  fertilization, frankly, with regard to embryos.          Whatever we happen to think about their status, I think there is little         question that  in vitro  fertilization has led to the kind of         instrumentalization of embryos that ought to give us real pause so that         we get some new idea about how to create an embryo.  Somebody dreams up         ICSI.  Oh, I know.  We can do that this week.  And we don't         hesitate.                         So I think the danger here is a danger         that is difficult to appreciate when you throw it into a certain         context where the frame of the debate is largely about protecting         individual rights and individual autonomy.                         So a John Robertson is going to say,         ""Who is harmed?""  Well, unless you give some account of the         early embryo as capable of experiencing harm, there doesn't seem to         be a good answer, at least in terms of the objects or subjects         direction.                         But it may be that we are harmed when we         so approach the world around us as something that we ought to be         utterly controlling in every aspect so that everything turns into a         human artifact, including humans.                         So that's a very different tact on         the issue that to some degree could remain agnostic about embryo         status, I think.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Let's see.  Rebecca?                          PROF. DRESSER:   I liked the way that         you are trying to bring in other issues because I do think this is a         complicated area.  And I think, especially when we are talking about a         topic that has public policy implications in a pluralistic country like         ours, we should think more broadly.                         So I wanted to mention a couple of other         points that maybe you might want to think about that I have talked         about and that bother me about the stem cell debate.                       One is the area of what I would call truth-telling and the way                that both adult and embryonic stem and all other kinds of stem cell                research is being discussed in terms of the exaggeration I think                of promise.  I don't know about exaggeration of promise but                exaggeration of speed with which this is likely to develop into                therapies, the likely success of any therapies, degree and percentage                of people it is likely to help, all of those kinds of things.                 I think in bioethics, we started with informed consent and we                went along with a focus on truth-telling to patients about a serious                prognosis and terminal prognosis.  And now in the United States,                at least, there is a strong belief that physicians should be honest                with patients about a prognosis that may not be very optimistic.                 So I think that we need to talk about research of all sorts in those                terms.  And I really see a violation of that in this area.  So that                is something that I think might be worth mentioning.                   The other is, is it worthwhile to think         about an ethical value of deliberation, accommodation, and compromise         when we are talking about issues like this that, as I said, have public         policy implications.                         And knowing that we live in this nation         where people have very strong beliefs on different sides, how should we         think about the problem and the activity of coming together to try to         work out policies, of course, in different areas?  But should we give         ethical weight to the idea that perhaps I will give a little on my         favorite outcome in order to reach an accommodation that might be         acceptable to more people?                         And, again, that's something I have         personally felt in working with this issue and something that might be         worth separating out and talking about on its own terms.                         Thanks.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you.                         Shall we collect a few or do you want to         respond?                          DR. LAURITZEN:   That's fine.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Let me collect a couple         of others and see.  I have Bill Hurlbut and then Mary Ann.                          DR. HURLBUT:   I want to return to the         idea of commodification.  I think it's very helpful to what you         said earlier about reflecting back on the embryo in light of these         other categories of consideration.                         When I think about the issue of         commodification, I am naturally drawn to thinking about, well, what is         it that you are commodifying or selling, commercializing even.                         And when I think about the body parts or         associated body realities that could be commercialized, I think of         people selling their hair for people to make wigs.  That doesn't         bother me very much at all, maybe none.                         Blood, that's a little more something         there, but that seems okay to me.  Sperm or ova, that troubles me a         little.  There's more going on there, and maybe troubles me a lot.          Selling a kidney definitely bothers me.                         And then selling your whole life really         bothers me if you know what I mean; in other words, ""I'll give         up my life.  I'll sell you my life.""  Okay?  Somebody might         sell their life so that their children got money, for example, to         survive.  That bothers me a lot.                         So there is a spectrum going on there.          On the one hand, something seems simple, trivial, and okay.  On the         other, it requires highly significant justification to even give up         your life or to give up a significant part of it.                         What is it that bothers me at the far end         of that spectrum?  What is the key here?  I think it has to do with         something that you would call integrated organismal integrity,         identity, or continuity that we can give up something that doesn't         challenge those three, but if we give up something that does, we have         to have a really good moral reason for doing it.  So commodification of         an expendable part is completely different than commodification of a         whole human life.                         And then when I reflect on it, what         bothers me about sperm, for example, is not just that it's giving         up a part of the being.  In this case when you give it up, it         doesn't hurt the static reality of the organism.  It's that         you're giving up a part of what you might say is the dynamic of an         integrated identity and continuity.  You're giving up a relational         dimension of being.                         There is no significant disruption of a         relationship to sell hair, but selling a sperm or a womb, use of a         womb, is not just part of the static being but parts of dynamic         relational being.                         So it seems to me that the key here is         that the moral meaning is in identity with the integrated organismal         integrity and the integrated of dynamic process or continuity or         overall purposefulness.                         This brings me back to the point that         Michael Sandel and I think it was William May and Leon were in a few         minutes ago.  What is the difference between selling and giving?  Well,         it seems to me that giving can sometimes be justified, even at the loss         of something, integrity, identity, and continuity, because it is an         adult form of voluntariness.                         You are doing something that is a very         high order act of hopefully consciousness, which preserves the fullness         of being of the individual as a moral entity.  This, in turn, brings me         back downstream to your comments that these larger issues of         commodification and so forth can inform our understanding, not just of         the absolute total landscape but can actually focus back down on the         status of the embryo.                         For me, as I read your paper, I thought         yes, yes as I went all along.  And I got to the end.  And I thought,         every one of these categories makes me more concerned about the moral         status of the embryo.                       Obviously commodification of the embryo violates the things I                have been talking about; whereas, selling or giving a body part,                let's say giving, is a high order of self-donation.  Relegating                an embryo to research is exactly at the opposite end.  It really                is commodification.  It doesn't have the voluntariness of giving                in it at all.  It's a violation of something that is fundamentally                human in the process.                   So what seems to me is going on here, at         least from my perspective as I looked at all of this, is all of your         categories, commodification or, worse, at the level of the embryo,         justice, giving something its due, is worse at the level of the embryo         because it's not taking something from anything that has a choice.          The idea of natural embodiment, the embryo, everything we are is         deeply, inextricably in continuity with that embryo.                         The erosion of species boundaries raises         a specialized dilemma here, violation of integrity, which is at the         concern of that ethical consideration.  And, finally, the implications         for personal identity and a deeply rooted thing that it is.                         So I don't know if this at all makes         the point, but what I would like to say is that I think these issues         are of one piece and that organismal integrity and identity and         continuity seem to focus all of your higher concerns right back down         again, I mean, both directions, of course, but there is a whole package         here that is inextricably related.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Do you want to take both         of these together?  I mean Rebecca Dresser's earlier comment.          Please respond if you wish.                        DR. LAURITZEN:   Well, let me just respond to the last part.                                 CHAIRMAN KASS:   Okay.                        DR. LAURITZEN:   Then I can go back to Rebecca's.  It                just suggested some friendly directions in which it might be pursued.                 I actually think that is a very interesting observation.  And I                want to think fairly carefully about that because I think that you                may be right about this.                   It may provide some language for actually         teasing out some of the concerns I want to articulate about adult stem         cell research and then rethink their implications for embryonic stem         cell research.                         I forget the exact language you used.          What did you say, the organismal integrity?  I wonder if that isn't         threatened in some significant ways, not by selling parts of our bodies         but purchasing new possibilities for our bodies in a way that might         fundamentally change who we are.                         I have thought about this a little bit.          I got married when I was 24 and have been faithfully married to my wife         now for quite a few years.  And at 24, I promised to be faithful until         death do us part, but that was a commitment of about 50 years.  And if         we doubled the life span, I am making that commitment for 100 years or         something.  What would that commitment look like and whether it would         fundamentally change how we thought about an institution like marriage         and things of that sort?                         I think it would have implications for         personal identity and responsibility over a very extended period of         time.  So there would be questions about purchasing as well as selling.                         My initial reaction, going back to the         embryo, is mixed.  On the one hand, I want to think more carefully         about this notion of eroding the sense of a kind of natural trajectory         because if there isn't that kind of natural trajectory, then I         don't think what is threatened with the embryo early on is that         unity that you describe because it has got multiple possible         trajectories depending on the environment, the interaction, et cetera.          But I want to think about that more because I think it is a very         interesting observation.                        DR. HURLBUT:   One little brief follow-up on that.  I think that,                actually, what you said has a power to it, but I see it at the other                end of life.  I think the embryo is not as contingent as the full                human being who has a sense of real opened determinacy and contingency.                                I mean, sure, environment is going to         affect things a lot for sure, the final trajectory.  I think it is more         determined early and less determined later.  And so if the criterion of         expendability is in determinacy, it wouldn't be the embryo.  It         would be the up and breathing, bubbling human beings.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Mary Ann?  We will break         in about three minutes.                          PROF.GLENDON:   I'm going to         follow Dan Foster's illustrious example except just to say that Dr.         Lauritzen I think has responded in his last remarks to the concern I         was going to raise that what I think we're getting at when we use         terms like ""instrumentalization,"" ""commodification""         is really a deep concern about what kind of people we are becoming when         we make certain decisions.  And so I think this has been a really         fruitful discussion.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Yes.  I would like to         take at least one minute to add one thing to underline something that I         thought was fairly good in the paper.  It ties in with things that we         didn't talk very much about in Dan Callahan's presentation.  I         found the two papers very nicely complementary.                         That really has to do with the questions         of the goal of stem cell research, combining both the embryonic and the         adult and thinking through the purposes for which these are used,         purposes which I think all of us at first glance will simply endorse         what we endorse for generative medicine.                         But the question about the limits of that         and whether or not that really isn't also using things at the         beginning of life to transform not just the trajectory but also the         question of whether there really ought to be an end or a completion I         think is a very important issue here.                       I've got sort of half-baked notes for an essay called ""The                Old Man and the Embryo,"" in which it's at least paradoxical                that one comes to look upon these cells, which are in some ways                part of the seed of the next generation, to come to see them as                the salvation for those of us who are getting close to the end.                                And if you want to present yourself with         a kind of parable in stock terms, imagine Abraham, the biblical         Abraham, and Sarah in a desolate world except for an IVF clinic.  And         they manage themselves.  I guess I've got to make two embryos.          They manage a couple of embryos.  And the question is whether the         embryo ought to be Isaac or ought to be the cure for Abraham's         Parkinson's disease.  Then you take that and universalize the         matter, and I think you see something of the difficulty here.                         This is not an objection to stem cell         research.  I want to underscore that.  But there is something going on         here about the way in which we think about the things at the beginning         of life in relation to things at the end of life.  And they're         becoming somewhat unmoored.                         I think your paper I think highlights the         importance of thinking about those things and the powers, what         we're going to use these powers for, as well as the questions of         the ethics and the means upon which we for the most part so exercised         ourselves.  So I'm in your debt for that and for much else as well.                        CHAIRMAN KASS:   Council members, show up at five of. Thank                you very much.                  (Whereupon, at 12:25 p.m., the foregoing matter was recessed                for lunch, to reconvene at 2:00 p.m. the same day.)                               SESSION 3: STEM CELL RESEARCH: RECENT                SCIENTIFIC AND CLINICAL DEVELOPMENTS                                 CHAIRMAN KASS:   Could we come to order,         please?  The third session of this meeting is on ""Stem Cell         Research: Recent Scientific and Clinical Developments.""  The most         challenging aspect of trying to fulfill our charge of monitoring stem         cell research is the monitoring of the scientific research itself.          There is so much of it, it's very diverse with many sources and         types of stem cells, and many types of research.  Things are changing         amazingly rapidly, and we are trying to monitor a moving target.  The         material is highly technical and hard, even for scientists outside of         the field, let alone a layman, to evaluate carefully.                          ""The Isolation of Human Embryonic         Stem Cells,"" and, ""Human Embryonic Germinal Cells,"" by         James Thomson and John Gearhart respectively was reported only five         years ago.  The obvious promise of these cells both for gaining         knowledge of development, both normal and abnormal, and eventually for         regenerative therapies with hundreds of thousands of patients with         degenerative diseases or injuries has produced great excitement, much         fine work, and to be frank, more than a little hype.                         At the same time, reports of previously         unknown and unexpected multipotent or stem cells in various tissues of         children and adults has produced enormous interest also in so-called         adult stem cells, with similar promise, and to be frank, also more than         a little hype.                         By almost all accounts we stand today in         the infancy, not to say embryonic, stage of these researches, and it is         surely too early to answer the questions that the layman wants         answered.  How soon, for which of our diseases, from what sort of         cells, at what cost, and at what risk will the cure be available?                        Yet it is not too early to learn where we are in fact in this                rapidly growing field, to try to separate fact from fiction, true                promise from hype.  And to do this we have gone to the experts,                commissioning review essays, essays that would review for us the                published literature over the past two years since the August 2001                decision, covering work in five areas according to the origin of                the cells.  ""Human Embryonic Stem Cells,"" a paper by Tenneille                Ludwig and James Thomson, ""Human Embryonic Germinal Cells,""                a paper from John Gearhart, a paper on cloned embryonic stem cells,                a paper by Rudolph Jaenisch, a review of the adult stem cell research,                a paper from David Prentice, and an update on the work with her                own multipotent adult progenitor cells from Catherine Verfaillie.                 The papers have been sent out with the briefing books, and I assume                that they've been read.  We are thinking about another paper                on mesenchymal stem cells.                  We're very fortunate and grateful to have with us this afternoon                three of the authors, Dr. John Gearhart, Dr. Rudolph Jaenisch, and                Dr. David Prentice, who will, in brief presentations, highlight                their own papers, after which we will have questions and discussion.                                 I would remind Council members that the         purpose of this session is wholly scientific.  We want to learn as much         as we can about the current and projected state of this research.  This         isn't the time for ongoing ethical arguments about the moral status         of the embryo, the research imperative, or equal access for the current         funding policy, important though these issues are.  And I will simply         say I'll use the authority of the Chair to see to it that we try to         stay on the topic.                         Dr. Gearhart has kindly agreed, by the         way, to field questions pertinent to the review essay submitted by Drs.         Ludwig and Thomson.  Gentlemen, welcome to you all.  Thank you for your         papers, your presence, and in advance for your presentation and         participation.  And we will proceed in alphabetical order with John         Gearhart first.                          DR. GEARHART:   Well, I can't say         I'm delighted to be back, but I'm happy to be back.  And to not         really dwell on the research that's going on specifically in our         laboratory, but to give you a bit of a general overview of where the         work is in this field, and I think there will be ample opportunity from         some of the things that I say that you can ask questions about it.                         I think the first question, and judging         from some of the morning topics, that I would like to address is the         one before you now, which is, why study these cells?  And what we have         heard most frequently are the issues, well, this is going to be the         most versatile source of cells for promised cell-based interventions         for various therapies.                        But I came at this at a different angle.  I am an embryologist                by training.  I've been a student of human embryology for 28                years.  And I'm extremely interested in knowing how we are put                together.  What are the events, what are the mechanisms that lead                to the formation of the human being?                And over time, as you can imagine, we've studied fruit flies, we've                studied mice, we've studied rhesus monkeys.  And I think one                of the major, and perhaps the most important bit of information                that we're going to get out of embryonic stem cells are going                to be the issue of how we are formed.  And this is going to involve                cell biology, genetics, on and on and on.  But this is what is going                to enable us.  And I think with this information, which at the moment                is under the heading of Fundamental Science, or Fundamental Discovery                in Basic Science, this, I think, is going to be the lasting contribution                of studies from embryonic stem cells.                   They're going to have applications,         obviously, with that information, and the sources of cells.  And         we're going to apply those to birth defects.  We're going to         apply it to injuries and disease, because many of the processes are         similar.  And we're going to be able to draw on that information in         trying to correct diseases and injuries.                         True, I think out of this we're going         to get sources of cells which, in the short term, are going to be used         directly for the cell-based interventions.  And I think through the use         of these cells, we're going to discover other important things         about these cells, and some in our research we've learned, which we         can apply in therapies.                         But I want to emphasize one point, and         this is my belief, that this period of time that we're going         through in studying embryonic stem cells is going to be transient.  And         I want to emphasize that I believe it's the information we're         going to get out of these cells that are going to be used in the longer         term to restore function, to regenerate tissues within the bodies of         patients, without the use of these cells.  And that to me, as I look         downstream, is going to be the most important outcome of this research.                         Now I realize that this quote is taken         out of context for these essays that were written, and what was being         questioned here.  But I want to make some comments which are important         when we consider the use of human embryonic stem cells directly.  And         that is, we are finding enormous differences between mouse embryonic         stem cells and human embryonic stem cells, not only in practical issues         within the laboratory from the standpoint of cell cycle times, et         cetera, but also, as we begin to differentiate these cells in a dish,         we find some very subtle and some very not so subtle differences         between the mouse cells and the human cells to get us to the         differentiated functional tissue that we need.                         So I do believe it's time that we         work directly on the human embryonic stem cells if we want to gain this         information on embryogenesis, and if we want to move forward with         developing cell-based interventions.                         So, the sources that we're going to         talk about in general deal with this very early stage here derived from         the IVF-donated embryos, and from tissues collected within the early         stage of fetal development, the germ cells.  These cells have many         things in common, and we've published on this.  You've seen         this, probably.  And so we look at them as a group.                          There's a third member of this group,         which is embryonal carcinoma cell, depicted here on the right, which         has very similar properties to these two other cell types.  In fact,         it's the only cell type from which any cell has been derived         that's being used in a pre-clinical trial.  And this is on stroke         patients at the University of Pittsburgh.                       I want to spend time now, or my brief time, on three slides to                give you an indication of where the human work is on this class                of cells.  What are the questions that are being asked, where are                we on some of this stuff, et cetera?                So here now are issues around human embryonic stem cells, or embryonic                germ cells.  One of the first questions that's being asked about                the stem cell itself is what is meant by ""stemness""?                 And obviously this, at the molecular level, gets us into genomics,                proteomics.  And so there is a major effort around the world at                trying to determine the genetic basis of a stem cell.  And the human                cells are being used extensively for this purpose.  How many genes                are involved, what genes are involved, what signaling pathways,                on and on and on.  So stemness is an important issue within this                research.                   Now, it's a comparative thing.  We         can do it also with mouse cells.  We can do it with adult cells as         well, trying to find commonality.  What is it that makes a cell a stem         cell?  That information will be vital, I believe, in the future, in         converting virtually any cell to a stem cell, if we want to go that         route.                         The second major issue currently are         characterizations of existing lines.  As you may know, there's no         standardization within the field as to what constitutes a human         embryonic stem cell.  We talk about developmental potential.  We talk         about molecular markers, biochemical/antigenic markers, this is now         being taken up by an international committee under the auspices of the         MRC in London to try to get an agreement on these issues from stem         cells around the world, human embryonic stem cells around the world.                         There's also the issue now of whether         or not we should be deriving new stem cell lines.  And in many         countries, this is indeed happening.  There are a number of new cell         lines coming online.  And what is the importance of this?  Now, many of         you have heard at least from what the Europeans refer to as the         presidential cell lines, those that are eligible for funding in this         country.  Should we have cells that are only grown on human feeder         layers?  Most of the cell lines that have been derived are on mouse         feeder layers, and there is a concern about infectious agents passing         into the human cells.                          I think there's a misconception out         there that these lines will be ineligible for any kind of therapeutic         use.  I think the FDA has made it very clear that they're certainly         willing to consider those grown on mouse feeder layers if they meet         certain criteria to also be eligible for use in the clinic.                          But there are a number of lines now that         have been derived on human feeder layers, and there are lines being         derived that are feeder layer independent, which means it makes it much         easier to work with in the laboratory.  You don't have to worry         about these other cells that are present in your cultures.                          And there's an attempt now being made         to derive these lines in defined media, which means there are no other         animal products, no serum, that you can control very carefully the         differentiation of these cells by adding specific growth factors in a         sequential fashion.                         The most important element to this,         though, is this top line here.  Many of you may not realize it, but         when we say that routinely three or four different mouse embryonic stem         cell lines have been used for the last 20-some years, what's the         problem here, why can't we use just a few of the human.  Those         lines have been selected from a hundred and some cell lines that were         made as to being the best cell lines to use for those purposes.  And so         I think we're still in this phase of trying to determine what are         really the good cell lines, human embryonic stem cell lines that are         available.  And thus the issue of generating more.                       For the use of these lines, emphasis in the lab now is in the                following area.  We're trying to work up high-efficiency differentiation                protocols that result in homogenous cell populations of functional                cell types.  That is, can we in the laboratory come up with protocols,                growth conditions, that are going to get us 10 million dopaminergic                neurons, and only dopaminergic neurons?  Most of the protocols we                have now result in a mixture of cell types within a dish, and we                go in and select out the ones we want.                   So there's concern about the         heterogeneity of the cells, and the fact that we can't at this         point have a high efficiency in getting the cell types we need.  We         manipulate the growth environments, and we manipulate the cells         genetically to accomplish this goal.                         Once we differentiate these cells, and         we've had some success in certain pathways which we can talk about,         we are very concerned about what we refer to as the authenticity of the         derived cells.  That is, is the dopaminergic neuron you've formed,         the insulin-producing cell you've formed, the cholinergic neuron,         the cardiac muscle, are these actually functional cells that are the         equivalent of those that you normally find in the adult?                          So a great deal of effort, both in the         dish,  in vitro , is being made in different parameters to measure         whether or not these are authentic cells.  There are many protocols, as         you can imagine, that lead to cells that look like something, but         they're not functional.  And this is a major concern.  The other         side of this is, the golden test is can you transplant these cells into         an animal model of some kind and see that they assume the function that         you're hoping that they would.                          But again, these are human cells going         into rodents, primarily.  Do we have every reason to believe that         they're going to function appropriately?  We don't know that         yet.  We're also putting cells into non-human primates to get that         kind of a measure as well.                         We are in the laboratory contrasting and         comparing among various sources of stem cells.  In our laboratory, we         work on human ES, human EG, umbilical cord blood, et cetera.  And the         importance of this is that you are able to compare and contrast in the         same paradigms the sources of these cells to see which ones are going         to be appropriate for which tasks.  And I think this is extremely         important.                         We're also very concerned, as you         know, if these cells are going to be continuously grown in the         laboratory, there's a finite possibility that you're going to         get genetic mutations.  We're interested in the frequencies of         this, and the types of the mutations that occur in these cells.          It's a safety issue.  But with our genomic and proteomic studies,         we can get a good handle on this at this point in time.                         When we get into the grafting issues,         which is obviously a desirable endpoint, both in the basic science         side, to say you have a functional cell, and then transitioning into         any use of these cells in cell-based therapy, we have a number of         issues here.                         The first, and I think you have to         realize this.  There is virtually no appropriate animal model for any         human condition.  That's the fact.  We approximate it.  We do the         best we can.  But under those limitations, we do the best we can.  And         you have to be aware of this.  There's a concern about what animal         models you're using for what test.                         The issue of what stage of cell         differentiation in any of these cells do you use for a specific graft?          We are finding that many things within the central nervous system, you         want to use something that is fairly undifferentiated so that the cells         can interestingly migrate to where they're supposed to go, set up         the appropriate connectivity.  And so if you are working with a motor         neuron, you'd like to use a motor neuron precursor.  If you put in         a fully differentiated motor neuron, nothing works.  I mean, when you         think about the nervous system, it's not surprising.                         With insulin-producing cells, we find         that you want the terminal cell, at least in the experiments that we         are doing.  But for each of the cell types you're working with,         we've got to determine this, as well as how do you want to deliver         it to those animal models.                         The last two are extremely important.          What are the fates of these cells that you've grown in a dish,         selected for in a dish, once you graft it into an animal paradigm?  We         know these cells like to migrate.  Do they differentiate         appropriately?  Do they form tumors?  I remember a few years ago when I         was all puffed up that our cells were working so wonderfully, and I         went to the FDA for this meeting I thought was going to be one-on-one         with members of that group.  And it turned out that there were 40 of         them and one of me.  All their questions were about safety issues.  We         now spend as much time on these safety issues as we do at looking at         differentiations of these cells in a dish.                          Why?  Well, what have we found?  Indeed,         in the early mouse work with embryonic stem cells the rates of tumors         were extremely high.  Formation of teratocarcinomas, mixed germ cell         tumors.  We have at this point, though, grafted well over 3,000 animals         with our human cells, and we haven't seen a tumor yet.  And maybe         we're just lucky, maybe there's a difference between mouse and         human cells.  We don't know that.                          But these experiments are extremely         expensive because you've got to serial section through the whole         central nervous system if you're putting cells in there.          You're putting them in IP, et cetera.  It's a lot of work.  The         FDA, ideally, would like to know if you're putting 300,000 cells         into an animal, they want to know where all 300,000 cells went.  This         has gotten us into extremely expensive experiments in labeling cells,         developing labels for cells that you could follow for a year or more         later.  You could go back and find those cells.  So we've employed         radiologists, and chemists, et cetera, to help us with these kinds of         things.  So it is a major issue.  And in all of our experiments, we         look at this.                         The last issue, on immune response graft         rejection, is obviously to some extent the Achilles' heel of this         work.  If we can't provide tissue that's going to be accepted         in a graft, then all this work has gone for naught.  So there are         issues of active experiments now going on in tolerance, in genetic         alterations of cells, the consideration of cell banks, how many         different stem cell lines would you need to cover certain populations         of people, and something you'll hear about probably from Rudy on         nuclear and cell reprogramming, so-called therapeutic cloning.  Is this         one of the avenues that we can approach?  So all of these are very         active research elements going on with respect to the human embryonic         germ cells and stem cells.  We can't divorce them.                         Now, in this cartoon, what I've         depicted here is one of the more difficult scientific aspects of the         research.  And that is that you have in a dish — now this is a bit of a         repeat, but it's important to mention — you have in a dish these         cells that are capable of forming any cell type that's present in         the body.  The major problem here is how do you get them only to form         hepatocytes, dopaminergic neurons, heart muscle, blood cells,         pancreatic islet cells, solely.  How do you do that?  This is where the         real issues are within the laboratory.                          And we try to recapitulate, as I showed         you this before — oh, and finally, the issue of — I put this little         thing down here to remind me.  Some of you have seen this report         earlier this year from Hans Schuler's lab at Penn, that he's         been able to find oocytes within embryonic stem cells derived from the         mouse.  Now, he did not — now keep this in mind, he did not         purposefully differentiate these cells into oocytes.  He came up with a         neat little trick of identifying them once they were present in the         plate.  Okay, so it's not that he's worked up a condition to         differentiate them only to oocytes, it's that they're there.          You can use that technology to pull the cells out, and then further try         to mature them, see if they are actually functional oocytes, et cetera.                         So we rely in the lab on trying to         recapitulate what has occurred to some extent in the embryo by         providing growth factors that these cells normally see to get them to         enhance, or try to direct their differentiation into the product that         we want.                         We use selection techniques in the         laboratory after getting these mixtures of cell types by different         avenues in the dish.  We then come back using genetically selected         markers, different growth media, cell sorting, which is a fancy way of         sending cells through a beam of light, and if they have a certain         antigen on the surface, you tag it in a way that will put them into         different pots.  And this works fairly effectively for a number of cell         types.  But it's highly inefficient, and we've got to improve         this technology.                         So what have we done?  What have we been         able to do?  We've been able to identify many, many different cell         types in a dish.  We've been able to expand many different cell         types, whether they're insulin-producing cells, dopaminergic         neurons, heart muscle cells, smooth muscle cells, hepatocytes,         we're able to do that.  Human.  And we've been able, in many         cases, to show that they are functional within the parameters that we         like.  And in a few cases we've studied extensively we've been         able to graft them into animal models to show that they will work, and         can ameliorate a condition in the animal, whether it's, to some         degree, whether it's a diabetic animal, or one with motor neuron         loss, mouse models of Parkinson's disease, we can do that at this         point.                         To reiterate, we are concerned about         safety issues.  They go hand in hand with all that we do in the         laboratory.  It adds, again, expense and time, but we want to make sure         we get it right.                         Here's another issue of safety.  We         find that in many of these cell lines, if you're not careful — now         human embryonic stem cells are much more difficult to grow in the         laboratory than mouse, and if you're not careful, this can         overwhelm your cultures very quickly.  This is an example of a         tetrasomy 12p, and also of a trisomy 17, which appear to be fairly         common coming out of the human cell lines for whatever reason.  We         don't know.   But you have to constantly monitor these cell lines         to make sure that they are remaining normal as far as the karyotype is         concerned.  Not an unusual circumstance.                         Rudy, I'm sure, will deal with this.          But we got highly involved with the issue of somatic cell nuclear         transfer, mainly coming in from the desire to have matched tissue for a         patient.  But I want to point out two other issues here that I think,         in my way of thinking, are perhaps more important.  Rudy will probably         disagree.                         Number two on this list, to increase the         diversity of stem cell lines.  Number three, to facilitate the study of         inherited genetic diseases and somatic mutations.  Now, there's         been a lot of talk about, with the justice issues, of diversity of cell         lines.  We now know how many cell lines we need to cover the population         of the United States.  How are we going to get these lines?  We're         not going to get them, if we wanted them, by going out and matching up         people to get embryos, okay, or even assaying embryos in banks.  The         easiest way to do it is you identify a person that has the haplotypes         of class I and class II genes, and take a nucleus out of their cell.          And generate stem cells through somatic cell nuclear transfer.  No         question about it, easiest fast way of doing it.                         The issue of the studying of inherited         genetic mutations and somatic mutations.  It means that we can take         cells from a patient with a disease, some of them not expressing very         much from the standpoint of the pathogenesis of the disease, to others         that are full-blown, to try to figure out why some patients have one         form of the disease, another has the mild form of the disease.  We can         take this directly, and generate stem cells for those studies.  Somatic         mutations, breast cancer mutations.  We can generate cell lines —         it's the only way we can do it — through somatic cell nuclear         transfer.                         And then the issue of being able to         determine mechanisms of nuclear reprogramming.  We would hope that they         would approach normalcy from the standpoint that we may be able to use         that information to convert somatic cells into stem cells at some point         downstream.  This is why I think somatic cell nuclear transfer into a         human are reasons that are quite important.                         Well, I think with the issue of the human         embryonic stem cells, I think they have uniqueness in certain areas,         and I think that what we're going to learn out of these studies is         going to be extremely important in the future, not only for deriving         cell-based therapies, but in getting information that we're going         to be able to begin to instruct our own genes.                       And this is something which hasn't been paid a lot of attention,                but I think even within this Council, it may be a good idea, that                we're on the verge, I believe, of being able to instruct our                own cells.  And I think the ramifications of this are enormous.                 I mean, talk about enhancement.  One could go on the Internet and                get a kit for enhancing any part of your body to a certain degree.                 And this is all going to be done, I think, from information that                we get out of learning about cell differentiation, how these cells                function.  So I think we've got to keep our eye on this for                the future as well.                   Just in closing, the greatest impetus         that I can think of for making advancement in this field is funding         through the National Institutes of Health.  This is the only         information that I could get my hands on.  It's available.          It's for the fiscal year 2002.  You see how much money is being         spent on stem cell research in toto, how much on human adult stem cell         research, how much on animal adult.  And up to this point, $11         million.  On the human embryonic stem cell research, I think this year         it's going to be more, and we would hope in the future, as the         bottleneck for cell lines and more applications come in to the NIH,         that these numbers will become robust.                          And I think this will be the key to the         dreams that we have, anyway, of learning more about how humans are         built, and cell differentiation of human cells on their way to         therapy.  So I hope I've given you enough to think about.  Thanks.                        CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you very much.  Why don't we simply                proceed in order.  Dr. Jaenisch.                  DR. JAENISCH:   Well, thank you very much for inviting me                here.  And I will right away get to the cont roversy. I'm not                going to agree with much you said.                 So I want to try to develop two arguments.  One is reproductive                cloning faces principle biological problems that may not be solvable                for the foreseeable future.  And the other one is therapeutic cloning                poses no principle biological obstacles, only technical problems.                 And this, I think, in my opinion has implications for the status                of the fertilized and the cloned embryo.                   So you need one piece of data.  When we         do nuclear transfer, then it's clear that the donor cell, the donor         matters.  So if we use a somatic donor nucleus, cumulus cells,         fibroblasts, Sertoli cells, the result to get cloned adults is really         low, a few percent.  If you use B or T cells, or neurons, it is very         low.  Only with tricks we were able to get animals.  However, when one         uses embryonic stem cells as donors, it's an order of magnitude         more efficient.  So the conclusion is an embryonic cell is easier to         reprogram to support life than a somatic one.  I will come back to this         later when I make an argument.                         So, let me first come to cloned animals.          If you have an animal born, if you looked at this carefully, you find         that approximately four to five percent of all genes, as done in         percentile, are not correctly expressed.  Still, the animal develops to         birth.  If you look at imprinted genes, it's even worse.  Thirty to         fifty percent are not correctly expressed, regardless what the donor         cell nucleus is.  So from this we would argue that it's amazing         that these defective embryos can develop to birth and beyond.  But you         pay for that.  You pay with abnormalities.                          So my argument would be, and I will         develop this more, that there may be no normal clones.  Of course, we         have the problem to define what we mean with ""normal"".   But         let me then say that faulty reprogramming seems to me is a biological         barrier that may preclude the generation of normal cloned individuals,         at least for the foreseeable future.                         Let me come to therapeutic cloning.  So,         as we heard, cloning would involve taking from a patient a somatic         nucleus and derive an isogenic embryonic stem cell by nuclear         transfer.  This could be used, then, to correct the genetic defect if         it was present.  One has to differentiate these cells  in vitro ,         and then transplant it back into the individual and see whether it         could improve the condition.                         So we have made such an experiment.  I         just want to briefly outline the steps we went through.  As a patient         we used a mouse, which was totally immune-incompetent.  Due to the Rag2         defect, it did not have any B and T cells.  So that was our patient.                         From this, skin cells were removed from         this animal.  They were transferred.  A blastocyst was derived.  And         from this blastocyst, an embryonic stem cell, which of course is         mutant, as the donor.  And then we used just simple homologous         recombination to repair one or two alleles to make a functional Rag2         gene, and then differentiate these cells which had problems into         hematopoietic stem cells, put them back into the animal, and the result         was that these cells could colonize the embryo and repair, in part, the         defect.                          So some have argued that this experiment         really didn't work.  It really only showed that when you have — I         think Dr. Prentice argued that it only showed that one has to use a         cloned newborn as a source.  And this, of course, is not therapeutic         cloning.  I think that is a misrepresentation of those data.                         I would argue that from this experiment         we know that somatic nuclear transfer and therapeutic cloning will work         because it has worked in the mouse.  So only technical, not principle,         barriers exist to adapt it to human use, although these technical ones         may be daunting.  Technical, in contrast to principle ones, which we         see in reproductive cloning.                         So, if I look at the two ways we can         think about cell therapy, then we have the nuclear cloning approach as         I just outlined, which in the mouse we know works, at least for         hematopoietic cells, and I believe will work for other cells.  The         alternative is somatic adult stem cells.  We'll hear later from         this.                         And I believe here there are many, many         question marks.  It is a very young field, very interesting, but we         really don't understand how to really handle these stem cells, how         to propagate those.  And there's really, with the exception of bone         marrow stem cells, not really any proof of therapeutic potential at         this point.  So I think we need much more to learn here, but this we         know will work.                         So I want to come to really two key         questions.  One is can reproductive cloning be made as safe as  in         vitro  fertilization?  And the other one: Does faulty reprogramming         after nuclear transfer, does it pose a problem for the therapeutic         application of this technology?  I think these are the key questions in         my mind.                       So, can reproductive cloning be made safe?  I believe in addition                to the technical problems, which are solvable, there are serious                biological barriers.  And the main one is this one.  The two parental                genomes in all of our cells are differentially modified depending                on where the genome came through the egg or through the sperm.                 They're epigenetically distinct in the adult.  If you want to                recreate that situation, you would have to physically separate the                two genomes and treat them independently in an oocyte- or sperm-specific                way.                 So let me point that out in this very complicated-appearing diagram,                but it's very simple.  So let me just go through briefly what's                happening during normal fertilization.  In normal fertilization,                the egg genome and the oocyte genome are combined.  And they are                differentially modified during gametogenesis.  And this is what                these lollipops here show.  So they're different in the zygote.                 But now something very curious happens.  Within hours of fertilization,                the sperm genome is stripped of all methylation.  The oocyte is                resistant to this not-well-understood demethylation activity because                the oocyte genome has been, of course, together with this activity                throughout oogenesis.                   So then cleavage proceeds.  And the point         I'm making now is that the cells of the genomes in the adult are         different, different because of their history.  It's not only for         imprinted genes, but also for non-imprinted genes.  Now what happens in         cloning?  In cloning, one removes, of course, the egg nucleus and         replaces it now with one of the somatic nuclei.                          Now, both of these genomes are now         exposed to the egg cytoplasm.  So both become really — they're in         identical chromatin state.  So they'll be both modified, and the         difference will be equalized.  So the difference you see in a normal         adult cell will be equalized, tends to be equalized in cloning.  I         think that is a problem among those which we call epigenetic problems.                         So in order to solve that, I think one         would have to separate the two genomes physically and treat one in an         egg-specific appropriate manner, and the other one in a sperm-specific         manner.  I think if we could do that, then I think we would have a way         to solve that problem.                         So the phenotypes of clones, I would         argue, is a continuum without defined stages.  So we know the most         important stages are implantation and birth, and indeed, most clones         are lost at implantation, and then at birth again many are lost.  You         end up with very few which develop to late age.  And we know from most         experiments, even animals which are one year of age, 80 percent of         those die very early with major problems.  These experiments could only         be done so far in the mouse because the mouse is the only organism we         have old cloned animals.                         So I think the problem here is, yes, you         might get — because our criteria are not very good here — you might get         quasi-normal or maybe a normal individual with a certain frequency.          It's very difficult in animals to test, really, because our tests         are limited.  But we cannot predict ever at any of these stages who         will be among those outliers, and who will not be.  There's no way         to select good healthy from non-healthy clones.  I think that's         very important to emphasize.  There's no way we can think of to do         that.  So there's no predictability whatsoever.  So from my point         of view, this doesn't matter, really, whether one or two percent of         potentially normal animals which survive for a long time.  You         can't predict who this will be.                         So, therapeutic cloning.  So, as I said,         cloned animals are abnormal due to faulty reprogramming.  Why is         normalcy of differentiated cells derived from ES cells not affected by         this problem?  There are two reasons.  One is that we don't involve         a generation of a fetus.  And the other one is that the embryonic stem         cells lose what I'm going to call epigenetic memory of the nucleus         they came from.  So let me develop these two ideas.                       So first, it's simple.  In contrast to reproductive cloning,                there's no embryogenesis required to derive functional cells                 in vitro .  So it's totally irrelevant, for example, whether                imprinted genes are reprogrammed or not.  Imprinted genes have a                function only during fetal development, not in the adult.  So it                doesn't matter.  There is one or two exceptions, and those would                have to look at.                   Very importantly is the cells themselves         select themselves  in vitro  for the cell type you are selecting         for.  There's no selection possible  in vivo  after         implantation in a cloned animal.  And then we know that cloned ES cells         form normal chimeras, as do any other ES cells.  So biologically there         is no difference.                         Let me come to the memory question on         this slide here.  So we know we can make blastocysts from a zygote from         a fertilized egg, or by nuclear transfer from these various donor         cells.  Now I would argue the blastocyst remembers exactly where it         came from.  And we know that because we implant this blastocyst,         derived from a zygote, into the uterus, it will with a high efficiency         develop to birth, and will make a normal animal.                         If you derive - take a blastocyst derived         from an ES cell, and implant it, it will develop with a high efficiency         to the newborn stage, but it will make an abnormal animal.  If it came         from a cumulus cell, it would be very low efficiency - I showed you         this on the second slide - low efficiency to the newborn stage.  It         will be abnormal.  If the nucleus comes from B-, T-cells, or neurons,         it will be very low.  And it will be, of course, abnormal, if you get         it.                         So these blastocysts know exactly where         they came from.  And we know this, actually, when we look at gene         expression patterns in clones derived from ES cells, or from human         cells, they're different.  So they remember at birth where they         came from.  That's why cloning doesn't work.  That's why         these cloned ones develop abnormally, too, in the great majority.                         So what about ES cells?  In ES cells,         it's a very different thing.  I would argue you erase the         epigenetic memory of your donor nucleus.  And the argument is the         following.  We know that if you take such a blastocyst, the ES cells         are derived from the inner cell mast cells.  These inner cell mast         cells express certain set of genes, one of those called the Oct-4 gene,         one of the key genes, but another 70.  You put this blastocyst in         culture.  All these genes, all these cells array - silence, Oct-4.          This has been published.  And they don't divide.  They sit there.                       But over the next days or week or so, some of these cells, one                or the other, begins to re-express Oct-4 and another set of 70 genes.                 And these are the cells which would proliferate.  And we call them                ES cells.  It's a total tissue culture artifact of those cells                which can survive under the harsh tissue culture conditions.  So                I would argue ES cells have no counterpart in the normal animal                model.  They are a real tissue culture artifact, although a very                useful one.                   Now the same occurs, of course, with         these blastocysts.  The efficiency is lower.  But once you go to the         selection for the survivors, they're exactly - I think in order to         survive, they have to express the set of 70 genes which we call the         embryonic genes, which are important for the early developmental         stages.  So the point of this slide is really that this selection         process, which selects just for the fastest growing cell, erases the         memory to where the ES cell came from.  And indeed, when you transplant         these cells derived from a B- or T-cell or from a neuron or from a         zygote, they have identical properties.  They form normal chimeras, and         they  in vitro  differentiate indistinguishably.                         I want to summarize this.  An ES cell         derivation selects for survivors.  And I would argue survival depends         on an ES default epigenetic state which needs these Oct-4 like genes         being on.  Selection process erases the epigenetic memory of the donor         nucleus, and the cloned and the fertilized cells form normal chimeras.          So the potential of ES cells derived from an  in vitro  fertilized         embryo and from a cloned embryo is identical by all measures we can do.                         So I would conclude, then, it's         unlikely, if not impossible, to create a normal individual by nuclear         cloning.  The problem of reprogramming may not be solvable for the         foreseeable future because of these principle barriers, but ES cells         derived from clone embryos have the same potential for tissue repair as         those from the fertilized embryo.                          So I think one of the key concerns I can         see of this committee is that the derivation of embryonic stem cells by         nuclear cloning necessitates the destruction of potential human life.          I think that's a major concern.  And if I just compare now, to my         opinion, the difference between a fertilized and a cloned embryo.  The         fertilized embryo is created by conception.  It's genetically         unique.  There's a high potential it will develop to a normal         baby.  The cloned embryo of course has no conception, no new genetic         combination.  It is really the product of a laboratory-assisted         technique.  Sloppily, we could say it's a laboratory artifact.  But         most importantly, it has little or no potential to ever develop to a         normal baby.                         So I think the embryo, the cloned embryo,         lacks essential qualities of the normal embryo, which on this sort of         maybe summarizing my thoughts is on this slide where I think there are         really three possible fates for a cloned or for fertilized embryo.  We         fertilize one of these leftover embryos, hundreds of thousands in the         clinics.  They can be disposed of, they can be implanted to form a         normal baby with a high probability, or they can generate normal ES         cells.  The cloned embryo, three fates.  It can be disposed of.  It can         make normal ES cells, as I have argued, but it cannot make with any         acceptability efficiency a baby, not even a normal one.                         So if this is accepted, instead of         disposing these leftover embryos and use them for normal ES cells,         which could be used for research, as we heard.  This, of course, to my         opinion generates an ethical problem because you destroy potential         human life.  I think this - so if this is acceptable to some, I think         it should be ethically less problematic, because in this case I think         you don't have the potential to form, within acceptable         possibility, a normal baby.                         So from the biological point of view, I         think the derivation of embryonic stem cells by nuclear cloning         develops the structure of an embryo that lacks the potential to develop         into a normal being with any acceptable efficiency or predictability.                          I was asked - and I want to close with my         final slide, which really follows what John said - what are the         potential applications of cloned embryonic stem cells derived from a         cloned embryo.  I think we talked about therapy.  Clearly, I don't         have to dwell on this.  I'm not sure whether this will be really         generally available technology.  It maybe too expensive.  I don't         know.  And I don't know how fast we could solve the technical         problems of adapting this to human medicine.                          However, I think this is the more         important point, which I think John emphasized.  I think it allows us         to derive genetically identical cells from patients with multigenic         diseases, such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, ALS, diabetes.  And         we can now use this system  in vitro  to validate the cellular         defects of these complex diseases.  So compare ES cells derived from a         healthy individual with those from such a patient.  I think there's         enormous potential here if we find a difference, to find out why that         is so, and is it a screen for potential therapeutics, just in the         culture dish.  And as John emphasized, such diseases cannot be studied         in animal models, because there are no animal models for those         diseases.  But you can really make those in the culture if you just use         a cell of the patients.                         So I think this is a very important,         maybe the most important driving issue, to my opinion, to use this         technology.  Thank you.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you very much.  Dr.         Prentice. While we're waiting, Dr. Jaenisch, would you mind just         taking one question of just factual information so that we don't         lose a lot of time.  This last point about the models for multigenetic         diseases.  If someone were to say the same kind of models might be         available through, for example, the multipotent progenitor cells that         Dr. Verfaillie has, where you could go into the patient and get out         progenitor cells.  You might not get all the tissues, but if those         cells could reliably be differentiated into islet cells, couldn't         you do the studies on the pathogenesis of - in other words,         couldn't one, if one had stable and reliable adult stem cell         populations, wouldn't you have the same access to the cells from         the multigenetic diseases?                          DR. JAENISCH:   Yes.  I think if this         would work, if this would efficiently work, I think absolutely I agree         with you.  I think the problem as I see it now is that, indeed, working         with adult stem cells is very difficult.  And the major problem is that         we lack the ability in most cases to, for example, propagate them in         the undifferentiated state.  For example, with bone marrow stem cells,         although they're known for 30 years, this has not been         accomplished.  They are very useful for therapeutic applications         because they select themselves in the patient, but not easily for this         type of research, what you want to do.                         So I think there might, at some point, if         we learn that in this young field, I agree with you.  Then I think         these cells would, if you could differentiate them to dopaminergic         neurons in a way that we can do for now from ES cells, as Ron McKay has         shown, yes I think that would be useful.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you.  Dr. Prentice,         you're all right?                          DR. PRENTICE:   Yes.                          CHAIRMAN KASS:  Good.                          DR. PRENTICE:  I think we're ready to         roll.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I apologize for the delay up here.  I         was fighting off a fever from a respiratory virus, so I probably was in         a time warp.                         One of the main goals of stem cell         research, as you're all aware, is the idea of regenerative medicine         with stem cells, the idea that you might be able to take a stem cell         from some source, for example here from bone marrow, inject that into         an area of damaged tissue in the patient and regenerate or replace the         damaged tissue.                          Now, the interesting, confusing thing         about adult stem cells has been that it defies what for years we have         thought of as the normal developmental paradigm, that as we develop         from the blastocyst stage here, that cells follow one of these main         developmental trees.  And as a cell would become more and more         developed and more and more differentiated, they would end up out here         on the tip of a branch and not be able to back away from that         particular tip; not be able to back down and take a separate branch,         whether it were a nearby branch or one of these main branches.                         A lot of evidence now suggests, however,         that adult stem cells, at least some of them, can actually move from         branch to branch.  Now exactly how they're doing that, the         mechanism involved in these types of differentiation or different         branches of tissues, is still unknown.                          There's several questions related to         adult stem cells, and in fact many of these have to do with the same         questions related to embryonic cells.  What is their actual identity?          How could you identify a particular adult stem cell?  What is their         actual tissue source?  How do they form these other cell and tissue         types?  Do they form actual functional cell and tissue types, as we         look at these organs and tissues?  And what's the specific         mechanism of differentiation?                         They do seem to have some unique         characteristics, such as a homing phenomenon, where they tend to home         in on damaged tissue.  And most of the results that have been seen in         terms of an adult stem cell differentiating into another cell type or         tissue type seem to be tied primarily with injury to a tissue or         organ.  Usually you do not see these types of changes in the         experiments taking place unless there is some sort of damage.  The         other thing would be what type of cellular interactions and signalling         within the target tissue might trigger some of these differentiative         events.                          Now, one way to try and identify a stem         cell is with various markers, and I discuss this at some length in the         paper.  Typically what people have tried to do is eliminate what are         termed ""lineage markers"" for particular blood cells.  Some         people pick a particular marker called CD34, which has been associated         with bone marrow.  But others tend to eschew that type of marker.  And         I mentioned other markers in the paper that might indicate that an         adult cell is a stem cell.  The CD133 marker, or the c-kit marker.                         Several people have begun to undertake         studies of the gene expression within adult stem cells, and compare         them to embryonic cells to see if there is a commonality in terms of         all of the various genes that might be expressed that identify a cell         as a stem cell.  One of the problems that's been faced, though, is         that these markers tend to change over time.  This has been seen in         several studies where actually a marker such as CD34, that might have         been a chosen marker to identify a stem cell, actually might not be         expressed at a later time with that cell.  And then expression of that         gene would re-occur, even within the same cell.                         So it may be difficult to actually         identify one particular stem cell based on some of these markers,         simply because of changes in gene expressions as the cells undergo         changes in environment, as they may undergo changes in their isolation         conditions, and what Theise and Krause simply have called the         uncertainty principle, equivalent to the Heisenberg uncertainty         principle.  You might at one point be able to isolate a cell with a         particular set of markers or milieu of gene expression and say this is         a stem cell, but then as you would try to put it into different         conditions, or isolate it from different tissues, those particular         markers might change, or might be different.                          So it may actually be very difficult with         adult stem cells to particularly isolate a particular cell and say,         yes, this is an adult stem cell.  It may be more a matter of the         particular context of the cell: the tissue they're derived from,         the isolation conditions used, or the tissues that they're put back         into that may determine their functionality.                         In terms of differentiation mechanisms,         cell fusion appears to be one particular mechanism by which an adult         stem cell may change into another tissue type.  Now there were some          in vitro  experiments done approximately a year and a half ago         that indicated this possibility, but the  in vitro  experiments         were unable to verify whether this was actually a particular mechanism         that might be used by an adult stem cell.  More recently, two papers         have verified in mouse systems that bone marrow stem cells, at least in         these experiments, did fuse with hepatocytes and take on that         differentiated morphology and function, even in terms of repairing         liver damage.  So this is obviously one possible mechanism with some         experimental evidence.                         Another possibility might be that a cell         would de-differentiate, actually back down one of those branches and go         up another branch.  This would involve changes in gene expression to an         earlier state, or more primitive type of cell, and then re-expressing         specific genes particular to the tissue into which the cell was         placed.  Another possibility is what's termed         ""trans-differentiation"" in which the cell apparently is not         backing down a branch, but instead simply changing its gene expression         so that it now conforms to whatever tissue or cell population that         it's within.                          In terms of sources of adult stem cells,         not just tissues, but how did they get there?  How did an adult stem         cell get into bone marrow, or brain, or liver?  One theory is that some         of these cells may be leftover primitive stem cells, perhaps embryonic         stem cells, a few that are kept around, maintained in a state so that         then they can differentiate into various types of tissues.                          Another proposal is that there may be a         universal stem cell, an adult stem cell, not a primitive cell, but one         more geared towards maintenance and repair functions in the adult         body.  It may arise in one or more tissues, and then may disperse into         other tissues.                          Other possibilities are that there are         particular tissue stem cells, multipotent, not able to perhaps form all         tissues of the adult body, but a limited subset, and that they would be         resident within a few of these tissues.                          And then I mentioned here transient stem         cells, cells that are just sort of passing through.  And there is the         possibility that, especially if we're looking at this idea of a         universal stem cell, or even a tissue stem cell that can migrate in         some cases, that it may end up passing through a tissue, so you will         isolate what appears to be a stem cell from a particular tissue.  But         it didn't arise there.  It just happened to be passing through via         the circulatory system.                         I might mention, too, that some of the         other challenges for adult stem cells are very similar to some of the         challenges for embryonic cells.  For example, standardization.  There         essentially is no standardization in terms of adult stem cell         isolation, propagation, differentiation into other tissues at this         point.  Long term culture, with a few exceptions, has not been         attained.  Catherine Verfaillie's MAPC cells from bone marrow do         appear capable of long-term proliferation in culture.  And there are a         few other examples, very limited, that I point out in the paper.  But         being able to keep these cells growing in culture for a long period of         time has been difficult up to this point.                         The idea of safety, of course, is always         an issue when we're going to be dealing with patients.  Do these         cells form tumors?  Do they differentiate abnormally so that you         don't get the correct differentiation in the place, in the time, in         the tissue that you need?  So all of these need to be faced.                         Now this idea of a potential universal or         at least tissue stem cell that can migrate primarily has been put forth         by Helen Blau of Stanford, the idea being that perhaps the cell is in         the bone marrow, but then can go into the circulation and then exit the         circulation into another tissue.  Again, most of the studies have seen         this type of phenomenon in response to an injury, not in response to         the normal physiological systems.                         How would we then define a stem cell,         especially an adult stem cell, if we have all of this problem with         changeability of markers, and lack of standardization?  Moore and         Quesenberry have proposed a couple of simple guidelines.  Now         obviously, any stem cell has the ability to continue to replicate and         maintain a population of cells.  And then in response to some signal,         to differentiate into one or more potential tissue types.                          An initial first cut at how to identify a         stem cell in the adult would be, can it take on a different morphology         in a tissue in which you place it?  Can it take on some of the         differentiated cell markers that you would see in that tissue?  Now         this is a bare minimum, and it doesn't really mean necessarily that         the cell is functional, that it can participate in tissue repair, or         perhaps even that it has truly differentiated into that specific cell         type.                         Supplementing that, if you could         demonstrate functional activity, and actual integration into a tissue,         this would be a much better marker of a cell as a stem cell.  And         certainly, if in an injury situation, in animal model or even in human,         you could demonstrate a physiological improvement.  That would be a         good indication that you were seeing this sort of stem cell         differentiation and repair."
GX052-44-2943227	Friday, July 25, 2003               Session 7: Public Comments               CHAIRMAN KASS:  Look.  We have come to — only five                minutes late — we've come to the end of the time allotted for                this session and the time for the public comment, and we have four                people who have signed up for public comment, and if Council is                willing, why don't we simply stay at the table rather than take                a break, and then we can leave promptly by 12?                 For people who are with us for the first time, the house rules                are public comments, by all means welcome, but there is a five-minute                time limit on the comment to be made, and the first name on my list                is Allison Hoffman from the National Partnership for Women and Families.                              Ms. Hoffman, welcome and please come to the microphone.  It should                be on.                  MS. HOFFMAN:   The National Partnership for Women                and Families is pleased to submit public comments to the President's                Council on Bioethics for this meeting of July 24th and July 25th,                2003.                 The National Partnership is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization                that is working to promote better health care for women and their                families.  The National Partnership for Women and Families strongly                supports allowing research using somatic cell nuclear transfer,                commonly known as therapeutic cloning.                 The purpose of this technology is to develop treatments for diseases                and give millions of people access to life saving therapies using                their own DNA.  Medical research involving therapeutic cloning holds                tremendous promise for patients with countless diseases.  This research                could produce treatments for diseases particularly affecting women,                such as breast and ovarian cancer, arthritis, osteoporosis, and                a range of genetically based diseases.                 In addition to their own health concerns, women are the primary                health care decision makers and care givers for their families as                well.  Women continue to be the primary care givers for elderly                parents, children, and family members with chronic or degenerative                diseases.                 SCNT offers hope to women struggling to care for parents with                Alzheimer's disease or suffering after a stroke, children with                juvenile diabetes and husbands with heart disease.  Any restriction                on biomedical research, such as scent, jeopardizes this hope by                threatening to delay or prevent important medical advances and sets                a dangerous precedent for regulating medical research.                 Instead the National Partnership supports measures that will maximize                the benefits of this research and minimize the risk to women and                their families, as well as society as a whole.                 In establishing federal or state guidelines, we support policy                proposals that ensure that all research, including therapeutic cloning,                perceived with strong safeguards in place to protect individuals                from unscrupulous practices.  We believe that therapeutic cloning                research should be done only under the highest ethical standards                with strong informed consent requirements, measures to protect women                from exploitation, and a prohibition of undue financial inducements                to donate eggs.                 The National Partnership, along with countless other women's                health advocates have worked for years to make up for researchers'                past neglect of women's health.  In our pursuit of better information,                treatment and cures for women and their families, we must insure                that the newest and most promising techniques are available to those                same researchers.                 Thank you for your consideration of our concerns on this critical                issue for women.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you very much.                 Next, Sean Tipton from the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.                              Welcome.                  MR. TIPTON:   Thanks.                 I would point out to everyone that tomorrow morning and Sunday                morning you have an interesting opportunity to observe a convergence                of the two topics you dealt with this morning, and that is in the                person of Lance Armstrong as he pursue a fifth victory in the Tour                de France.                 You may recall Mr. Armstrong had testicular cancer, advanced testicular                cancer, and some of the controversies upon his return were some                question of enhancement versus therapy, and if he wins on Sunday,                I'm sure you will see him with his children on the platform.                 Those children were conceived with the assistance of ICSI.                 So at least that's the spin I'm going to give my wife                tomorrow and Sunday as I try to watch that on television rather                than take the kids to swim lessons or Sunday school.                 (Laughter.)                  MR. TIPTON:   So we'll see how that goes.                              Among the topics you all discussed at some length yesterday and                today was the question of outcome studies and what the federal government                can and cannot fund and those kind of questions.  I would point                out that the NIH and the NICHD do, in fact, fund some limited outcome                studies.  They have a trial underway now where the main site is                at Baylor down in Houston looking at outcomes for ICSI children.                              So I think there's certainly more that could be done there,                and I think in terms of other directions to go, I think there is                a huge, huge difference between an NIH funded multi-center outcomes                trial and a mandatory reporting or tracking of all embryos created                and, indeed, all children conceived and born.                 I think those are very, very different animals, and those differences                need to be considered with some care.  You have some significant                privacy concerns if nothing else that I think you need to deal with                in a little bit more explicit manner.  The outcomes work that we                do with the CDC in terms of tracking the number of cycles of ART                performed and how many of those lead to live births or multiple                births of children is very difficult to do, in part, because infertility                patients like to put their infertility experience behind them as                soon as possible.                 So I think doing other long-term studies has some significant                obstacles.  Having said that, we are very supportive of more outcome                studies, and I would comment to the committee looking at the recent                data from the European Society of Human Reproduction, which I think                only now was an abstract at a meeting and not yet fully published,                but should be out in a few months, and we think that outcome was                very important and very promising.                 Finally, I would like to wish a happy birthday to Louise Brown,                the first IVF baby who turns 25 today.  I think that's a very                significant milestone, and as we reflect upon that milestone, I                think it's worth noting and remembering the huge hue and cry                and, indeed what in some ways now looks to be a little bit of hysteria                that accompanied that birth around a technique which we are now                nearly a million children into.                 And I think maybe with a few notable exceptions most of those                families are very grateful that the technique was invented or perfected                by Professor Edwards and Steptoe, and I think we're a million                happy children into it, and that should not be forgotten in your                deliberations.                 Thank you.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you very much.                 Charles Queenan, Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation.                  MR. QUEENAN:   Good morning, Chairman Kass, and                members of the President's Council on Bioethics.  Thank you                for the opportunity to testify to you this morning.                 My name is Charles J. Queenan, III.  I'm here today on behalf                of my daughter Jenna, who is age 14 and suffers with juvenile diabetes,                also on behalf of the million other Americans who suffer with juvenile                or Type 1 diabetes, the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International,                and the Coalition for the Advancement of Medical Research.                 Jenna was diagnosed with diabetes 11 years ago when she was only                three years old.  Following her diagnosis, I very quickly became                actively involved with JDRF.  I currently serve on the international                board of JDRF and for the last two years I was the chair of the                Research Committee for JDRF, and in that capacity was responsible                for grants that during the last two years totaled over $200 million                for diabetes research.                 In addition, I have overseen the development of JDRF's embryonic                stem cell research program.  JDRF has entered into stem cell research                partnerships with three international governments.  We are also                in discussions with another six international governments for such                partnerships.                 This year JDRF expects to commit over $10 million to stem cell                research, ten million out of a total of 100 million research grant                commitments, and JDRF is the only non-governmental organization                represented on the United Kingdom sponsored international stem cell                forum, which also includes representatives of 12 governments.                 Much has changed over the last two years since the administration                announced its policy for federal funding of embryonic stem cell                research.  Stem cells continue to hold significant potential for                a wide range of diseases and disorders that impact some 100 million                Americans.  But it is clear that this area of science has not advanced                as rapidly as it was envisioned when the federal policy was determined.                              In our view it is time to consider expanding the availability                of embryonic stem cell lines so that  millions of Americans can                hopefully begin to see benefits from this research.                 Let me provide you with an update on how embryonic stem cell research                should impact juvenile diabetes.  JDRF is actively supporting embryonic                stem cell research because we feel it holds enormous promise to                play a critical role in understanding and curing juvenile diabetes.                              Actually I should say it has promise to extend the cure for juvenile                diabetes.  We are currently curing juvenile diabetes through transplantation                of insulin producing cells, but we are currently helping only a                very tiny percentage of those who have the disease.                 Of the more than 250 individuals who have received these transplants,                approximately 80 percent no longer require insulin injections to                control their blood sugar.  To these men and women who were previously                unable to control their blood sugar levels, even with multiple daily                injections, this is, indeed, a cure.                 Unfortunately, despite this unparalleled scientific progress that                has been hailed as the biggest advance in diabetes research since                the discovery of insulin, there's a severe shortage of insulin                producing cells suitable for transplantation.  Only 2,000 cadaver                pancreases are available annually from organ donors.  This means                that the vast majority of the one to two million Americans with                juvenile diabetes will never benefit from this therapy unless we                can develop additional lines of insulin producing cells.                 Embryonic stem cell research could play a key role in developing                an unlimited supply of cells so that we might extend the cure for                juvenile diabetes to all Americans who currently suffer from this                devastating disease.                 The current federal policy will never be sufficient to adequately                 advance this promising field.  Just a fraction of the stem cell                lines that were thought to have been available based on this policy                can actually be used by a scientist, and even though stem cell lines                might not safely be used for clinical trials because of the way                they were derived.                 We have worked closely with the White House, the Department of                Health and Human Services, and the National Institutes of Health                to try to implement the administration's stem cell policy.                 However, research progress in this area to date has been frustratingly                slow primarily because of the limited number of stem cell lines                scientists have to work with.                 The importance of having access to additional stem cell lines                from excess  in vitro  fertilized eggs that would otherwise                be discarded is crystal clear.  The time has come for a fresh look                at the policy so that it can be revised in light of what we now                know to more successfully move the research forward.                 Take the following four examples.  First, the number of embryonic                stem cell lines determined to be available under the President's                plan was 78.  However, at present information about only 11 are                on the NIH registry, and even fewer are fully available to researchers.                              Second, most, if not all, of the embryonic stem cell lines on                the NIH registry were developed using mouse feeder material as a                nutrient.  We are very concerned that this could make these lines                ineligible for use in human therapeutics because of the potential                for cross-species contamination.                 Third, while much concern has been expressed about the lack of                genetic diversity in the limited number of embryonic stem cell lines                that are currently on the registry, less attention has been paid                to a related issue.  Scientists are finding that the various embryonic                stem cell lines are proving to be much more heterogeneous than was                previously thought, and specific lines are tending to differentiate                to specific types of tissues.                 This means that researcher access to additional stem cell lines                will be even more important as we try to grow genetically diverse                tissue specific therapeutics for a number of different diseases.                              Finally, fewer than expected young scientists are entering this                area of research.  Anecdotal evidence indicates that the reason                for this, beyond the laundry list of practical considerations I                have just discussed, is concern among young investigators entering                a new field that there is a lack of long-term commitment by the                federal government as evidenced by the present limited policy to                provide a stable, creative, and nurturing environment for stem cell                research.                 Chairman Kass, I appreciate the Council's continued interest                in embryonic stem cell policy.  JDRF shares the President's                interest in advancing this field, and we look forward to working                with you to develop new ideas and approaches to the current federal                embryonic stem cell policy and to make the promise within this field                of research a reality.                 In conclusion, I just want to add that I understand that there                is concern that some patient organizations may look upon this research                with unrealistic and perhaps overly optimistic assessments of the                difficulty in finding a cure, and I want to say for the record that                in my experience both with other members of the JDRF board, thousands                of volunteers both in JDRF and in other foundations, that really                is not the case.                 I think you would find that they are very well informed both about                the scientific potential and the policy issues surrounding human                research.  What we do want, however, is to avoid artificial barriers                to moving forward the scientific research that must go forward.                              Thank you very much.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you.                 Kirsten Moore of the Reproductive Health Technologies Project.                              Welcome.                  MS. MOORE:   Thank you.  Thank you for this opportunity                to present our comments.                 My name is Kirsten Moore.  I'm president of the Reproductive                Health Technologies Project.  We're a national, nonprofit advocacy                organization, and our mission is to advance the ability of every                woman of any age to achieve full reproductive freedom without access                to the safest, most effective, appropriate and acceptable technologies                for insurance her health and controlling her fertility.                 We view technology not as an end in itself, but as an essential                component for all women and men, including those who are underserved                and historically been excluded to control their own health and fertility.                 We believe each technology requires careful analysis of its safety,                effectiveness, acceptability, appropriateness and ethical aspects,                recognizing that these vary from person to person and community                to community.                 Almost two years ago we began a process of dialogue and education                within the women's health community on the issue of stem cell                nuclear transfer.  Over the past 18 months, we've invited experts,                scientists, legal scholars, bioethicists, practitioners, and patient                advocates to share their perspectives on the science policy and                politics of SCNT to help inform the position of a number of organizations                within the women's health and reproductive rights communities.                              You will not be surprised to hear there is no uniform position                on the use of SCNT for research or reproductive purposes among the                many organizations and constituencies which make up this community.                 At the same time there is a strong consensus among many groups that                SCNT holds the potential to expand our knowledge of human physiology,                and with that, to develop safe, effective treatments for a broad                array of diseases and injuries.                 The promise of such benefit from this research is significant,                and to many organizations, including my own, the Society for Women's                Health Research, the National Partnership for Women and Families,                and the National Women's Law Center, justifies use of preimplantation                embryos in such research.                 At their request and with your permission I'd like to leave                statements from the society and from the National Women's Law                Center in this record.                 Even with that consensus, there are varying opinions as to how                such research should move forward.  Speaking from my own organization,                we believe SCNT research holds potential for unintended consequences,                as well as intended uses that may have adverse outcomes.                 To maximize the benefits of this research and minimize the risk                both to individuals and society at large, the Reproductive Health                Technologies Project calls for policy proposals that will enhance                and strengthen existing policy and regulatory guidelines which protect                human subjects in research and insure that consumers can rely on                the safety and efficacy of FDA approved products.                 In establishing such federal or state oversight, we would like                the following guiding principles to be observed, and I would like                to point out that we ducked the question that you were dealing with                earlier about exactly how to do this.  So these are just our thoughts,                no agencies assigned.                 The scientific rationale as well as the risks and benefits of                proposed SCNT research are evaluated with public oversight and accountability.                 The short and long-term safety and efficacy data on any therapies                or procedures that use SCNT are made available to the general public                on a timely basis and in an appropriate format.                 Informed consent and confidentiality of all participants, including                donors of genetic material who will not benefit directly from the                research is ensured.                 Adequate protections are established to minimize the potential                that embryos created for use in SCNT research are used for the purposes                of reproduction.  Payment for gametes and other genetic materials                used in SCNT research which exceed the cost of participation are                prohibited.                 The same regulatory guidelines and enforcement mechanisms should                apply to all SCNT research, whether or publicly or privately funded,                and inappropriate activities are discontinued and violators subject                to civil penalties.                 Thank you.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you very much.                 Before we break, let me make clear, as clear as I can, what the                next steps are with the two things that we've talked about this                morning.                 At the break Carter Snead had to leave, but he and I spoke about                the need to tap a number of you for some paragraphs on the topics                on which you either eloquently spoke or we suspect you have some                knowledge that would help.  You probably know who you are, but expect                to hear some requests from us to help fill out some of those things                on the monitoring and things talked about earlier.                 With respect to the Beyond Therapy project, we'd like your                written comments by the date indicated, and you should expect —                we didn't quite finish additional materials to give you today,                but you'll have them some time next week, the next two installments                for your reading pleasure and critical comments having to do with                the pursuit of less aging bodies and more happy souls.                 Cheerful thoughts, good health.  Thank you for your attention                and wonderful contributions.  Safe trip, and we'll see you in                September.                  (Whereupon, at 11:57 a.m., the meeting was concluded.)                                                                                                                                             Home   Site          Map   Disclaimers            Privacy Notice            Accessibility            Contact Us           NBAC            HHS            FOIA

At the same time, reports of previously unknown and unexpected                multipotent or stem cells in various tissues of children and adults                has produced enormous interest also in so-called adult stem cells,                with similar promise, and to be frank, also more than a little hype.                              By almost all accounts we stand today in the infancy, not to say                embryonic, stage of these researches, and it is surely too early                to answer the questions that the layman wants answered.  How soon,                for which of our diseases, from what sort of cells, at what cost,                and at what risk will the cure be available?                  Yet it is not too early to learn where we are in fact in this                rapidly growing field, to try to separate fact from fiction, true                promise from hype.  And to do this we have gone to the experts,                commissioning review essays, essays that would review for us the                published literature over the past two years since the August 2001                decision, covering work in five areas according to the origin of                the cells.  ""Human Embryonic Stem Cells,"" a paper by Tenneille                Ludwig and James Thomson, ""Human Embryonic Germinal Cells,""                a paper from John Gearhart, a paper on cloned embryonic stem cells,                a paper by Rudolph Jaenisch, a review of the adult stem cell research,                a paper from David Prentice, and an update on the work with her                own multipotent adult progenitor cells from Catherine Verfaillie.                 The papers have been sent out with the briefing books, and I assume                that they've been read.  We are thinking about another paper                on mesenchymal stem cells.                  We're very fortunate and grateful to have with us this afternoon                three of the authors, Dr. John Gearhart, Dr. Rudolph Jaenisch, and                Dr. David Prentice, who will, in brief presentations, highlight                their own papers, after which we will have questions and discussion.                               I would remind Council members that the purpose of this session                is wholly scientific.  We want to learn as much as we can about                the current and projected state of this research.  This isn't                the time for ongoing ethical arguments about the moral status of                the embryo, the research imperative, or equal access for the current                funding policy, important though these issues are.  And I will simply                say I'll use the authority of the Chair to see to it that we                try to stay on the topic.                 Dr. Gearhart has kindly agreed, by the way, to field questions                pertinent to the review essay submitted by Drs. Ludwig and Thomson.                 Gentlemen, welcome to you all.  Thank you for your papers, your                presence, and in advance for your presentation and participation.                 And we will proceed in alphabetical order with John Gearhart first.                               DR. GEARHART:   Well, I can't say I'm delighted                to be back, but I'm happy to be back.  And to not really dwell                on the research that's going on specifically in our laboratory,                but to give you a bit of a general overview of where the work is                in this field, and I think there will be ample opportunity from                some of the things that I say that you can ask questions about it.                              I think the first question, and judging from some of the morning                topics, that I would like to address is the one before you now,                which is, why study these cells?  And what we have heard most frequently                are the issues, well, this is going to be the most versatile source                of cells for promised cell-based interventions for various therapies.                               But I came at this at a different angle.  I am an embryologist                by training.  I've been a student of human embryology for 28                years.  And I'm extremely interested in knowing how we are put                together.  What are the events, what are the mechanisms that lead                to the formation of the human being?                And over time, as you can imagine, we've studied fruit flies,                we've studied mice, we've studied rhesus monkeys.  And I                think one of the major, and perhaps the most important bit of information                that we're going to get out of embryonic stem cells are going                to be the issue of how we are formed.  And this is going to involve                cell biology, genetics, on and on and on.  But this is what is going                to enable us.  And I think with this information, which at the moment                is under the heading of Fundamental Science, or Fundamental Discovery                in Basic Science, this, I think, is going to be the lasting contribution                of studies from embryonic stem cells.                 They're going to have applications, obviously, with that information,                and the sources of cells.  And we're going to apply those to                birth defects.  We're going to apply it to injuries and disease,                because many of the processes are similar.  And we're going                to be able to draw on that information in trying to correct diseases                and injuries.                 True, I think out of this we're going to get sources of cells                which, in the short term, are going to be used directly for the                cell-based interventions.  And I think through the use of these                cells, we're going to discover other important things about                these cells, and some in our research we've learned, which we                can apply in therapies.                 But I want to emphasize one point, and this is my belief, that                this period of time that we're going through in studying embryonic                stem cells is going to be transient.  And I want to emphasize that                I believe it's the information we're going to get out of                these cells that are going to be used in the longer term to restore                function, to regenerate tissues within the bodies of patients, without                the use of these cells.  And that to me, as I look downstream, is                going to be the most important outcome of this research.                 Now I realize that this quote is taken out of context for these                essays that were written, and what was being questioned here.  But                I want to make some comments which are important when we consider                the use of human embryonic stem cells directly.  And that is, we                are finding enormous differences between mouse embryonic stem cells                and human embryonic stem cells, not only in practical issues within                the laboratory from the standpoint of cell cycle times, et cetera,                but also, as we begin to differentiate these cells in a dish, we                find some very subtle and some very not so subtle differences between                the mouse cells and the human cells to get us to the differentiated                functional tissue that we need.                 So I do believe it's time that we work directly on the human                embryonic stem cells if we want to gain this information on embryogenesis,                and if we want to move forward with developing cell-based interventions.                              So, the sources that we're going to talk about in general                deal with this very early stage here derived from the IVF-donated                embryos, and from tissues collected within the early stage of fetal                development, the germ cells.  These cells have many things in common,                and we've published on this.  You've seen this, probably.                 And so we look at them as a group.                  There's a third member of this group, which is embryonal carcinoma                cell, depicted here on the right, which has very similar properties                to these two other cell types.  In fact, it's the only cell                type from which any cell has been derived that's being used                in a pre-clinical trial.  And this is on stroke patients at the                University of Pittsburgh.                 I want to spend time now, or my brief time, on three slides to                give you an indication of where the human work is on this class                of cells.  What are the questions that are being asked, where are                we on some of this stuff, et cetera?                So here now are issues around human embryonic stem cells, or embryonic                germ cells.  One of the first questions that's being asked about                the stem cell itself is what is meant by ""stemness""?                 And obviously this, at the molecular level, gets us into genomics,                proteomics.  And so there is a major effort around the world at                trying to determine the genetic basis of a stem cell.  And the human                cells are being used extensively for this purpose.  How many genes                are involved, what genes are involved, what signaling pathways,                on and on and on.  So stemness is an important issue within this                research.                 Now, it's a comparative thing.  We can do it also with mouse                cells.  We can do it with adult cells as well, trying to find commonality.                 What is it that makes a cell a stem cell?  That information will                be vital, I believe, in the future, in converting virtually any                cell to a stem cell, if we want to go that route.                 The second major issue currently are characterizations of existing                lines.  As you may know, there's no standardization within the                field as to what constitutes a human embryonic stem cell.  We talk                about developmental potential.  We talk about molecular markers,                biochemical/antigenic markers, this is now being taken up by an                international committee under the auspices of the MRC in London                to try to get an agreement on these issues from stem cells around                the world, human embryonic stem cells around the world.                 There's also the issue now of whether or not we should be                deriving new stem cell lines.  And in many countries, this is indeed                happening.  There are a number of new cell lines coming online.                 And what is the importance of this?  Now, many of you have heard                at least from what the Europeans refer to as the presidential cell                lines, those that are eligible for funding in this country.  Should                we have cells that are only grown on human feeder layers?  Most                of the cell lines that have been derived are on mouse feeder layers,                and there is a concern about infectious agents passing into the                human cells.                  I think there's a misconception out there that these lines                will be ineligible for any kind of therapeutic use.  I think the                FDA has made it very clear that they're certainly willing to                consider those grown on mouse feeder layers if they meet certain                criteria to also be eligible for use in the clinic.                  But there are a number of lines now that have been derived on                human feeder layers, and there are lines being derived that are                feeder layer independent, which means it makes it much easier to                work with in the laboratory.  You don't have to worry about                these other cells that are present in your cultures.                  And there's an attempt now being made to derive these lines                in defined media, which means there are no other animal products,                no serum, that you can control very carefully the differentiation                of these cells by adding specific growth factors in a sequential                fashion.                 The most important element to this, though, is this top line here.                 Many of you may not realize it, but when we say that routinely three                or four different mouse embryonic stem cell lines have been used                for the last 20-some years, what's the problem here, why can't                we use just a few of the human.  Those lines have been selected                from a hundred and some cell lines that were made as to being the                best cell lines to use for those purposes.  And so I think we're                still in this phase of trying to determine what are really the good                cell lines, human embryonic stem cell lines that are available.                 And thus the issue of generating more.                 For the use of these lines, emphasis in the lab now is in the                following area.  We're trying to work up high-efficiency differentiation                protocols that result in homogenous cell populations of functional                cell types.  That is, can we in the laboratory come up with protocols,                growth conditions, that are going to get us 10 million dopaminergic                neurons, and only dopaminergic neurons?  Most of the protocols we                have now result in a mixture of cell types within a dish, and we                go in and select out the ones we want.                 So there's concern about the heterogeneity of the cells, and                the fact that we can't at this point have a high efficiency                in getting the cell types we need.  We manipulate the growth environments,                and we manipulate the cells genetically to accomplish this goal.                              Once we differentiate these cells, and we've had some success                in certain pathways which we can talk about, we are very concerned                about what we refer to as the authenticity of the derived cells.                 That is, is the dopaminergic neuron you've formed, the insulin-producing                cell you've formed, the cholinergic neuron, the cardiac muscle,                are these actually functional cells that are the equivalent of those                that you normally find in the adult?                  So a great deal of effort, both in the dish,  in vitro ,                is being made in different parameters to measure whether or not                these are authentic cells.  There are many protocols, as you can                imagine, that lead to cells that look like something, but they're                not functional.  And this is a major concern.  The other side of                this is, the golden test is can you transplant these cells into                an animal model of some kind and see that they assume the function                that you're hoping that they would.                  But again, these are human cells going into rodents, primarily.                 Do we have every reason to believe that they're going to function                appropriately?  We don't know that yet.  We're also putting                cells into non-human primates to get that kind of a measure as well.                              We are in the laboratory contrasting and comparing among various                sources of stem cells.  In our laboratory, we work on human ES,                human EG, umbilical cord blood, et cetera.  And the importance of                this is that you are able to compare and contrast in the same paradigms                the sources of these cells to see which ones are going to be appropriate                for which tasks.  And I think this is extremely important.                 We're also very concerned, as you know, if these cells are                going to be continuously grown in the laboratory, there's a                finite possibility that you're going to get genetic mutations.                 We're interested in the frequencies of this, and the types of                the mutations that occur in these cells.  It's a safety issue.                 But with our genomic and proteomic studies, we can get a good handle                on this at this point in time.                 When we get into the grafting issues, which is obviously a desirable                endpoint, both in the basic science side, to say you have a functional                cell, and then transitioning into any use of these cells in cell-based                therapy, we have a number of issues here.                 The first, and I think you have to realize this.  There is virtually                no appropriate animal model for any human condition.  That's                the fact.  We approximate it.  We do the best we can.  But under                those limitations, we do the best we can.  And you have to be aware                of this.  There's a concern about what animal models you're                using for what test.                 The issue of what stage of cell differentiation in any of these                cells do you use for a specific graft?  We are finding that many                things within the central nervous system, you want to use something                that is fairly undifferentiated so that the cells can interestingly                migrate to where they're supposed to go, set up the appropriate                connectivity.  And so if you are working with a motor neuron, you'd                like to use a motor neuron precursor.  If you put in a fully differentiated                motor neuron, nothing works.  I mean, when you think about the nervous                system, it's not surprising.                 With insulin-producing cells, we find that you want the terminal                cell, at least in the experiments that we are doing.  But for each                of the cell types you're working with, we've got to determine                this, as well as how do you want to deliver it to those animal models.                              The last two are extremely important.  What are the fates of these                cells that you've grown in a dish, selected for in a dish, once                you graft it into an animal paradigm?  We know these cells like                to migrate.  Do they differentiate appropriately?  Do they form                tumors?  I remember a few years ago when I was all puffed up that                our cells were working so wonderfully, and I went to the FDA for                this meeting I thought was going to be one-on-one with members of                that group.  And it turned out that there were 40 of them and one                of me.  All their questions were about safety issues.  We now spend                as much time on these safety issues as we do at looking at differentiations                of these cells in a dish.                  Why?  Well, what have we found?  Indeed, in the early mouse work                with embryonic stem cells the rates of tumors were extremely high.                 Formation of teratocarcinomas, mixed germ cell tumors.  We have                at this point, though, grafted well over 3,000 animals with our                human cells, and we haven't seen a tumor yet.  And maybe we're                just lucky, maybe there's a difference between mouse and human                cells.  We don't know that.                  But these experiments are extremely expensive because you've                got to serial section through the whole central nervous system if                you're putting cells in there.  You're putting them in IP,                et cetera.  It's a lot of work.  The FDA, ideally, would like                to know if you're putting 300,000 cells into an animal, they                want to know where all 300,000 cells went.  This has gotten us into                extremely expensive experiments in labeling cells, developing labels                for cells that you could follow for a year or more later.  You could                go back and find those cells.  So we've employed radiologists,                and chemists, et cetera, to help us with these kinds of things.                 So it is a major issue.  And in all of our experiments, we look                at this.                 The last issue, on immune response graft rejection, is obviously                to some extent the Achilles' heel of this work.  If we can't                provide tissue that's going to be accepted in a graft, then                all this work has gone for naught.  So there are issues of active                experiments now going on in tolerance, in genetic alterations of                cells, the consideration of cell banks, how many different stem                cell lines would you need to cover certain populations of people,                and something you'll hear about probably from Rudy on nuclear                and cell reprogramming, so-called therapeutic cloning.  Is this                one of the avenues that we can approach?  So all of these are very                active research elements going on with respect to the human embryonic                germ cells and stem cells.  We can't divorce them.                 Now, in this cartoon, what I've depicted here is one of the                more difficult scientific aspects of the research.  And that is                that you have in a dish — now this is a bit of a repeat, but it's                important to mention — you have in a dish these cells that are capable                of forming any cell type that's present in the body.  The major                problem here is how do you get them only to form hepatocytes, dopaminergic                neurons, heart muscle, blood cells, pancreatic islet cells, solely.                 How do you do that?  This is where the real issues are within the                laboratory.                  And we try to recapitulate, as I showed you this before — oh,                and finally, the issue of — I put this little thing down here to                remind me.  Some of you have seen this report earlier this year                from Hans Schuler's lab at Penn, that he's been able to                find oocytes within embryonic stem cells derived from the mouse.                 Now, he did not — now keep this in mind, he did not purposefully                differentiate these cells into oocytes.  He came up with a neat                little trick of identifying them once they were present in the plate.                 Okay, so it's not that he's worked up a condition to differentiate                them only to oocytes, it's that they're there.  You can                use that technology to pull the cells out, and then further try                to mature them, see if they are actually functional oocytes, et                cetera.                 So we rely in the lab on trying to recapitulate what has occurred                to some extent in the embryo by providing growth factors that these                cells normally see to get them to enhance, or try to direct their                differentiation into the product that we want.                 We use selection techniques in the laboratory after getting these                mixtures of cell types by different avenues in the dish.  We then                come back using genetically selected markers, different growth media,                cell sorting, which is a fancy way of sending cells through a beam                of light, and if they have a certain antigen on the surface, you                tag it in a way that will put them into different pots.  And this                works fairly effectively for a number of cell types.  But it's                highly inefficient, and we've got to improve this technology.                              So what have we done?  What have we been able to do?  We've                been able to identify many, many different cell types in a dish.                 We've been able to expand many different cell types, whether                they're insulin-producing cells, dopaminergic neurons, heart                muscle cells, smooth muscle cells, hepatocytes, we're able to                do that.  Human.  And we've been able, in many cases, to show                that they are functional within the parameters that we like.  And                in a few cases we've studied extensively we've been able                to graft them into animal models to show that they will work, and                can ameliorate a condition in the animal, whether it's, to some                degree, whether it's a diabetic animal, or one with motor neuron                loss, mouse models of Parkinson's disease, we can do that at                this point.                 To reiterate, we are concerned about safety issues.  They go hand                in hand with all that we do in the laboratory.  It adds, again,                expense and time, but we want to make sure we get it right.                 Here's another issue of safety.  We find that in many of these                cell lines, if you're not careful — now human embryonic stem                cells are much more difficult to grow in the laboratory than mouse,                and if you're not careful, this can overwhelm your cultures                very quickly.  This is an example of a tetrasomy 12p, and also of                a trisomy 17, which appear to be fairly common coming out of the                human cell lines for whatever reason.  We don't know.   But                you have to constantly monitor these cell lines to make sure that                they are remaining normal as far as the karyotype is concerned.                 Not an unusual circumstance.                 Rudy, I'm sure, will deal with this.  But we got highly involved                with the issue of somatic cell nuclear transfer, mainly coming in                from the desire to have matched tissue for a patient.  But I want                to point out two other issues here that I think, in my way of thinking,                are perhaps more important.  Rudy will probably disagree.                 Number two on this list, to increase the diversity of stem cell                lines.  Number three, to facilitate the study of inherited genetic                diseases and somatic mutations.  Now, there's been a lot of                talk about, with the justice issues, of diversity of cell lines.                 We now know how many cell lines we need to cover the population                of the United States.  How are we going to get these lines?  We're                not going to get them, if we wanted them, by going out and matching                up people to get embryos, okay, or even assaying embryos in banks.                 The easiest way to do it is you identify a person that has the haplotypes                of class I and class II genes, and take a nucleus out of their cell.                 And generate stem cells through somatic cell nuclear transfer.                 No question about it, easiest fast way of doing it.                 The issue of the studying of inherited genetic mutations and somatic                mutations.  It means that we can take cells from a patient with                a disease, some of them not expressing very much from the standpoint                of the pathogenesis of the disease, to others that are full-blown,                to try to figure out why some patients have one form of the disease,                another has the mild form of the disease.  We can take this directly,                and generate stem cells for those studies.  Somatic mutations, breast                cancer mutations.  We can generate cell lines — it's the only                way we can do it — through somatic cell nuclear transfer.                 And then the issue of being able to determine mechanisms of nuclear                reprogramming.  We would hope that they would approach normalcy                from the standpoint that we may be able to use that information                to convert somatic cells into stem cells at some point downstream.                 This is why I think somatic cell nuclear transfer into a human are                reasons that are quite important.                 Well, I think with the issue of the human embryonic stem cells,                I think they have uniqueness in certain areas, and I think that                what we're going to learn out of these studies is going to be                extremely important in the future, not only for deriving cell-based                therapies, but in getting information that we're going to be                able to begin to instruct our own genes.                 And this is something which hasn't been paid a lot of attention,                but I think even within this Council, it may be a good idea, that                we're on the verge, I believe, of being able to instruct our                own cells.  And I think the ramifications of this are enormous.                 I mean, talk about enhancement.  One could go on the Internet and                get a kit for enhancing any part of your body to a certain degree.                 And this is all going to be done, I think, from information that                we get out of learning about cell differentiation, how these cells                function.  So I think we've got to keep our eye on this for                the future as well.                 Just in closing, the greatest impetus that I can think of for                making advancement in this field is funding through the National                Institutes of Health.  This is the only information that I could                get my hands on.  It's available.  It's for the fiscal year                2002.  You see how much money is being spent on stem cell research                in toto, how much on human adult stem cell research, how much on                animal adult.  And up to this point, $11 million.  On the human                embryonic stem cell research, I think this year it's going to                be more, and we would hope in the future, as the bottleneck for                cell lines and more applications come in to the NIH, that these                numbers will become robust.                  And I think this will be the key to the dreams that we have, anyway,                of learning more about how humans are built, and cell differentiation                of human cells on their way to therapy.  So I hope I've given                you enough to think about.  Thanks.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you very much.  Why don't we                simply proceed in order.  Dr. Jaenisch.                  DR. JAENISCH:   Well, thank you very much for inviting me                here.  And I will right away get to the cont roversy. I'm not                going to agree with much you said.                 So I want to try to develop two arguments.  One is reproductive                cloning faces principle biological problems that may not be solvable                for the foreseeable future.  And the other one is therapeutic cloning                poses no principle biological obstacles, only technical problems.                 And this, I think, in my opinion has implications for the status                of the fertilized and the cloned embryo.                 So you need one piece of data.  When we do nuclear transfer, then                it's clear that the donor cell, the donor matters.  So if we                use a somatic donor nucleus, cumulus cells, fibroblasts, Sertoli                cells, the result to get cloned adults is really low, a few percent.                 If you use B or T cells, or neurons, it is very low.  Only with                tricks we were able to get animals.  However, when one uses embryonic                stem cells as donors, it's an order of magnitude more efficient.                 So the conclusion is an embryonic cell is easier to reprogram to                support life than a somatic one.  I will come back to this later                when I make an argument.                 So, let me first come to cloned animals.  If you have an animal                born, if you looked at this carefully, you find that approximately                four to five percent of all genes, as done in percentile, are not                correctly expressed.  Still, the animal develops to birth.  If you                look at imprinted genes, it's even worse.  Thirty to fifty percent                are not correctly expressed, regardless what the donor cell nucleus                is.  So from this we would argue that it's amazing that these                defective embryos can develop to birth and beyond.  But you pay                for that.  You pay with abnormalities.                  So my argument would be, and I will develop this more, that there                may be no normal clones.  Of course, we have the problem to define                what we mean with ""normal"".   But let me then say that                faulty reprogramming seems to me is a biological barrier that may                preclude the generation of normal cloned individuals, at least for                the foreseeable future.                 Let me come to therapeutic cloning.  So, as we heard, cloning                would involve taking from a patient a somatic nucleus and derive                an isogenic embryonic stem cell by nuclear transfer.  This could                be used, then, to correct the genetic defect if it was present.                 One has to differentiate these cells  in vitro , and then transplant                it back into the individual and see whether it could improve the                condition.                 So we have made such an experiment.  I just want to briefly outline                the steps we went through.  As a patient we used a mouse, which                was totally immune-incompetent.  Due to the Rag2 defect, it did                not have any B and T cells.  So that was our patient.                 From this, skin cells were removed from this animal.  They were                transferred.  A blastocyst was derived.  And from this blastocyst,                an embryonic stem cell, which of course is mutant, as the donor.                 And then we used just simple homologous recombination to repair                one or two alleles to make a functional Rag2 gene, and then differentiate                these cells which had problems into hematopoietic stem cells, put                them back into the animal, and the result was that these cells could                colonize the embryo and repair, in part, the defect.                  So some have argued that this experiment really didn't work.                 It really only showed that when you have — I think Dr. Prentice                argued that it only showed that one has to use a cloned newborn                as a source.  And this, of course, is not therapeutic cloning.                 I think that is a misrepresentation of those data.                 I would argue that from this experiment we know that somatic nuclear                transfer and therapeutic cloning will work because it has worked                in the mouse.  So only technical, not principle, barriers exist                to adapt it to human use, although these technical ones may be daunting.                 Technical, in contrast to principle ones, which we see in reproductive                cloning.                 So, if I look at the two ways we can think about cell therapy,                then we have the nuclear cloning approach as I just outlined, which                in the mouse we know works, at least for hematopoietic cells, and                I believe will work for other cells.  The alternative is somatic                adult stem cells.  We'll hear later from this.                 And I believe here there are many, many question marks.  It is                a very young field, very interesting, but we really don't understand                how to really handle these stem cells, how to propagate those.                 And there's really, with the exception of bone marrow stem cells,                not really any proof of therapeutic potential at this point.  So                I think we need much more to learn here, but this we know will work.                              So I want to come to really two key questions.  One is can reproductive                cloning be made as safe as  in vitro  fertilization?  And the                other one: Does faulty reprogramming after nuclear transfer, does                it pose a problem for the therapeutic application of this technology?                 I think these are the key questions in my mind.                 So, can reproductive cloning be made safe?  I believe in addition                to the technical problems, which are solvable, there are serious                biological barriers.  And the main one is this one.  The two parental                genomes in all of our cells are differentially modified depending                on where the genome came through the egg or through the sperm.                 They're epigenetically distinct in the adult.  If you want to                recreate that situation, you would have to physically separate the                two genomes and treat them independently in an oocyte- or sperm-specific                way.                 So let me point that out in this very complicated-appearing diagram,                but it's very simple.  So let me just go through briefly what's                happening during normal fertilization.  In normal fertilization,                the egg genome and the oocyte genome are combined.  And they are                differentially modified during gametogenesis.  And this is what                these lollipops here show.  So they're different in the zygote.                 But now something very curious happens.  Within hours of fertilization,                the sperm genome is stripped of all methylation.  The oocyte is                resistant to this not-well-understood demethylation activity because                the oocyte genome has been, of course, together with this activity                throughout oogenesis.                 So then cleavage proceeds.  And the point I'm making now is                that the cells of the genomes in the adult are different, different                because of their history.  It's not only for imprinted genes,                but also for non-imprinted genes.  Now what happens in cloning?                 In cloning, one removes, of course, the egg nucleus and replaces                it now with one of the somatic nuclei.                  Now, both of these genomes are now exposed to the egg cytoplasm.                 So both become really — they're in identical chromatin state.                 So they'll be both modified, and the difference will be equalized.                 So the difference you see in a normal adult cell will be equalized,                tends to be equalized in cloning.  I think that is a problem among                those which we call epigenetic problems.                 So in order to solve that, I think one would have to separate                the two genomes physically and treat one in an egg-specific appropriate                manner, and the other one in a sperm-specific manner.  I think if                we could do that, then I think we would have a way to solve that                problem.                 So the phenotypes of clones, I would argue, is a continuum without                defined stages.  So we know the most important stages are implantation                and birth, and indeed, most clones are lost at implantation, and                then at birth again many are lost.  You end up with very few which                develop to late age.  And we know from most experiments, even animals                which are one year of age, 80 percent of those die very early with                major problems.  These experiments could only be done so far in                the mouse because the mouse is the only organism we have old cloned                animals.                 So I think the problem here is, yes, you might get — because our                criteria are not very good here — you might get quasi-normal or                maybe a normal individual with a certain frequency.  It's very                difficult in animals to test, really, because our tests are limited.                 But we cannot predict ever at any of these stages who will be among                those outliers, and who will not be.  There's no way to select                good healthy from non-healthy clones.  I think that's very important                to emphasize.  There's no way we can think of to do that.  So                there's no predictability whatsoever.  So from my point of view,                this doesn't matter, really, whether one or two percent of potentially                normal animals which survive for a long time.  You can't predict                who this will be.                 So, therapeutic cloning.  So, as I said, cloned animals are abnormal                due to faulty reprogramming.  Why is normalcy of differentiated                cells derived from ES cells not affected by this problem?  There                are two reasons.  One is that we don't involve a generation                of a fetus.  And the other one is that the embryonic stem cells                lose what I'm going to call epigenetic memory of the nucleus                they came from.  So let me develop these two ideas.                 So first, it's simple.  In contrast to reproductive cloning,                there's no embryogenesis required to derive functional cells                 in vitro .  So it's totally irrelevant, for example, whether                imprinted genes are reprogrammed or not.  Imprinted genes have a                function only during fetal development, not in the adult.  So it                doesn't matter.  There is one or two exceptions, and those would                have to look at.                 Very importantly is the cells themselves select themselves  in                vitro  for the cell type you are selecting for.  There's                no selection possible  in vivo  after implantation in a cloned                animal.  And then we know that cloned ES cells form normal chimeras,                as do any other ES cells.  So biologically there is no difference.                              Let me come to the memory question on this slide here.  So we                know we can make blastocysts from a zygote from a fertilized egg,                or by nuclear transfer from these various donor cells.  Now I would                argue the blastocyst remembers exactly where it came from.  And                we know that because we implant this blastocyst, derived from a                zygote, into the uterus, it will with a high efficiency develop                to birth, and will make a normal animal.                 If you derive - take a blastocyst derived from an ES cell, and                implant it, it will develop with a high efficiency to the newborn                stage, but it will make an abnormal animal.  If it came from a cumulus                cell, it would be very low efficiency - I showed you this on the                second slide - low efficiency to the newborn stage.  It will be                abnormal.  If the nucleus comes from B-, T-cells, or neurons, it                will be very low.  And it will be, of course, abnormal, if you get                it.                 So these blastocysts know exactly where they came from.  And we                know this, actually, when we look at gene expression patterns in                clones derived from ES cells, or from human cells, they're different.                 So they remember at birth where they came from.  That's why                cloning doesn't work.  That's why these cloned ones develop                abnormally, too, in the great majority.                 So what about ES cells?  In ES cells, it's a very different                thing.  I would argue you erase the epigenetic memory of your donor                nucleus.  And the argument is the following.  We know that if you                take such a blastocyst, the ES cells are derived from the inner                cell mast cells.  These inner cell mast cells express certain set                of genes, one of those called the Oct-4 gene, one of the key genes,                but another 70.  You put this blastocyst in culture.  All these                genes, all these cells array - silence, Oct-4.  This has been published.                 And they don't divide.  They sit there.                 But over the next days or week or so, some of these cells, one                or the other, begins to re-express Oct-4 and another set of 70 genes.                 And these are the cells which would proliferate.  And we call them                ES cells.  It's a total tissue culture artifact of those cells                which can survive under the harsh tissue culture conditions.  So                I would argue ES cells have no counterpart in the normal animal                model.  They are a real tissue culture artifact, although a very                useful one.                 Now the same occurs, of course, with these blastocysts.  The efficiency                is lower.  But once you go to the selection for the survivors, they're                exactly - I think in order to survive, they have to express the                set of 70 genes which we call the embryonic genes, which are important                for the early developmental stages.  So the point of this slide                is really that this selection process, which selects just for the                fastest growing cell, erases the memory to where the ES cell came                from.  And indeed, when you transplant these cells derived from                a B- or T-cell or from a neuron or from a zygote, they have identical                properties.  They form normal chimeras, and they  in vitro                 differentiate indistinguishably.                 I want to summarize this.  An ES cell derivation selects for survivors.                 And I would argue survival depends on an ES default epigenetic state                which needs these Oct-4 like genes being on.  Selection process                erases the epigenetic memory of the donor nucleus, and the cloned                and the fertilized cells form normal chimeras.  So the potential                of ES cells derived from an  in vitro  fertilized embryo and                from a cloned embryo is identical by all measures we can do.                 So I would conclude, then, it's unlikely, if not impossible,                to create a normal individual by nuclear cloning.  The problem of                reprogramming may not be solvable for the foreseeable future because                of these principle barriers, but ES cells derived from clone embryos                have the same potential for tissue repair as those from the fertilized                embryo.                  So I think one of the key concerns I can see of this committee                is that the derivation of embryonic stem cells by nuclear cloning                necessitates the destruction of potential human life.  I think that's                a major concern.  And if I just compare now, to my opinion, the                difference between a fertilized and a cloned embryo.  The fertilized                embryo is created by conception.  It's genetically unique.                 There's a high potential it will develop to a normal baby.                 The cloned embryo of course has no conception, no new genetic combination.                 It is really the product of a laboratory-assisted technique.  Sloppily,                we could say it's a laboratory artifact.  But most importantly,                it has little or no potential to ever develop to a normal baby.                              So I think the embryo, the cloned embryo, lacks essential qualities                of the normal embryo, which on this sort of maybe summarizing my                thoughts is on this slide where I think there are really three possible                fates for a cloned or for fertilized embryo.  We fertilize one of                these leftover embryos, hundreds of thousands in the clinics.  They                can be disposed of, they can be implanted to form a normal baby                with a high probability, or they can generate normal ES cells.                 The cloned embryo, three fates.  It can be disposed of.  It can                make normal ES cells, as I have argued, but it cannot make with                any acceptability efficiency a baby, not even a normal one.                 So if this is accepted, instead of disposing these leftover embryos                and use them for normal ES cells, which could be used for research,                as we heard.  This, of course, to my opinion generates an ethical                problem because you destroy potential human life.  I think this                - so if this is acceptable to some, I think it should be ethically                less problematic, because in this case I think you don't have                the potential to form, within acceptable possibility, a normal baby.                              So from the biological point of view, I think the derivation of                embryonic stem cells by nuclear cloning develops the structure of                an embryo that lacks the potential to develop into a normal being                with any acceptable efficiency or predictability.                  I was asked - and I want to close with my final slide, which really                follows what John said - what are the potential applications of                cloned embryonic stem cells derived from a cloned embryo.  I think                we talked about therapy.  Clearly, I don't have to dwell on                this.  I'm not sure whether this will be really generally available                technology.  It maybe too expensive.  I don't know.  And I don't                know how fast we could solve the technical problems of adapting                this to human medicine.                  However, I think this is the more important point, which I think                John emphasized.  I think it allows us to derive genetically identical                cells from patients with multigenic diseases, such as Parkinson's,                Alzheimer's, ALS, diabetes.  And we can now use this system                 in vitro  to validate the cellular defects of these complex                diseases.  So compare ES cells derived from a healthy individual                with those from such a patient.  I think there's enormous potential                here if we find a difference, to find out why that is so, and is                it a screen for potential therapeutics, just in the culture dish.                 And as John emphasized, such diseases cannot be studied in animal                models, because there are no animal models for those diseases.                 But you can really make those in the culture if you just use a cell                of the patients.                 So I think this is a very important, maybe the most important                driving issue, to my opinion, to use this technology.  Thank you.                               CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you very much.  Dr. Prentice. While                we're waiting, Dr. Jaenisch, would you mind just taking one                question of just factual information so that we don't lose a                lot of time.  This last point about the models for multigenetic                diseases.  If someone were to say the same kind of models might                be available through, for example, the multipotent progenitor cells                that Dr. Verfaillie has, where you could go into the patient and                get out progenitor cells.  You might not get all the tissues, but                if those cells could reliably be differentiated into islet cells,                couldn't you do the studies on the pathogenesis of - in other                words, couldn't one, if one had stable and reliable adult stem                cell populations, wouldn't you have the same access to the cells                from the multigenetic diseases?                  DR. JAENISCH:   Yes.  I think if this would work, if this                would efficiently work, I think absolutely I agree with you.  I                think the problem as I see it now is that, indeed, working with                adult stem cells is very difficult.  And the major problem is that                we lack the ability in most cases to, for example, propagate them                in the undifferentiated state.  For example, with bone marrow stem                cells, although they're known for 30 years, this has not been                accomplished.  They are very useful for therapeutic applications                because they select themselves in the patient, but not easily for                this type of research, what you want to do.                 So I think there might, at some point, if we learn that in this                young field, I agree with you.  Then I think these cells would,                if you could differentiate them to dopaminergic neurons in a way                that we can do for now from ES cells, as Ron McKay has shown, yes                I think that would be useful.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you.  Dr. Prentice, you're all                right?                  DR. PRENTICE:   Yes.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:  Good.                  DR. PRENTICE:  I think we're ready to roll.  Thank you,                Mr. Chairman.  I apologize for the delay up here.  I was fighting                off a fever from a respiratory virus, so I probably was in a time                warp.                 One of the main goals of stem cell research, as you're all                aware, is the idea of regenerative medicine with stem cells, the                idea that you might be able to take a stem cell from some source,                for example here from bone marrow, inject that into an area of damaged                tissue in the patient and regenerate or replace the damaged tissue.                               Now, the interesting, confusing thing about adult stem cells has                been that it defies what for years we have thought of as the normal                developmental paradigm, that as we develop from the blastocyst stage                here, that cells follow one of these main developmental trees.                 And as a cell would become more and more developed and more and                more differentiated, they would end up out here on the tip of a                branch and not be able to back away from that particular tip; not                be able to back down and take a separate branch, whether it were                a nearby branch or one of these main branches.                 A lot of evidence now suggests, however, that adult stem cells,                at least some of them, can actually move from branch to branch.                 Now exactly how they're doing that, the mechanism involved in                these types of differentiation or different branches of tissues,                is still unknown.                  There's several questions related to adult stem cells, and                in fact many of these have to do with the same questions related                to embryonic cells.  What is their actual identity?  How could you                identify a particular adult stem cell?  What is their actual tissue                source?  How do they form these other cell and tissue types?  Do                they form actual functional cell and tissue types, as we look at                these organs and tissues?  And what's the specific mechanism                of differentiation?                 They do seem to have some unique characteristics, such as a homing                phenomenon, where they tend to home in on damaged tissue.  And most                of the results that have been seen in terms of an adult stem cell                differentiating into another cell type or tissue type seem to be                tied primarily with injury to a tissue or organ.  Usually you do                not see these types of changes in the experiments taking place unless                there is some sort of damage.  The other thing would be what type                of cellular interactions and signalling within the target tissue                might trigger some of these differentiative events.                  Now, one way to try and identify a stem cell is with various markers,                and I discuss this at some length in the paper.  Typically what                people have tried to do is eliminate what are termed ""lineage                markers"" for particular blood cells.  Some people pick a particular                marker called CD34, which has been associated with bone marrow.                 But others tend to eschew that type of marker.  And I mentioned                other markers in the paper that might indicate that an adult cell                is a stem cell.  The CD133 marker, or the c-kit marker.                 Several people have begun to undertake studies of the gene expression                within adult stem cells, and compare them to embryonic cells to                see if there is a commonality in terms of all of the various genes                that might be expressed that identify a cell as a stem cell.  One                of the problems that's been faced, though, is that these markers                tend to change over time.  This has been seen in several studies                where actually a marker such as CD34, that might have been a chosen                marker to identify a stem cell, actually might not be expressed                at a later time with that cell.  And then expression of that gene                would re-occur, even within the same cell.                 So it may be difficult to actually identify one particular stem                cell based on some of these markers, simply because of changes in                gene expressions as the cells undergo changes in environment, as                they may undergo changes in their isolation conditions, and what                Theise and Krause simply have called the uncertainty principle,                equivalent to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.  You might at                one point be able to isolate a cell with a particular set of markers                or milieu of gene expression and say this is a stem cell, but then                as you would try to put it into different conditions, or isolate                it from different tissues, those particular markers might change,                or might be different.                  So it may actually be very difficult with adult stem cells to                particularly isolate a particular cell and say, yes, this is an                adult stem cell.  It may be more a matter of the particular context                of the cell: the tissue they're derived from, the isolation                conditions used, or the tissues that they're put back into that                may determine their functionality.                 In terms of differentiation mechanisms, cell fusion appears to                be one particular mechanism by which an adult stem cell may change                into another tissue type.  Now there were some  in vitro  experiments                done approximately a year and a half ago that indicated this possibility,                but the  in vitro  experiments were unable to verify whether                this was actually a particular mechanism that might be used by an                adult stem cell.  More recently, two papers have verified in mouse                systems that bone marrow stem cells, at least in these experiments,                did fuse with hepatocytes and take on that differentiated morphology                and function, even in terms of repairing liver damage.  So this                is obviously one possible mechanism with some experimental evidence.                              Another possibility might be that a cell would de-differentiate,                actually back down one of those branches and go up another branch.                 This would involve changes in gene expression to an earlier state,                or more primitive type of cell, and then re-expressing specific                genes particular to the tissue into which the cell was placed.                 Another possibility is what's termed ""trans-differentiation""                in which the cell apparently is not backing down a branch, but instead                simply changing its gene expression so that it now conforms to whatever                tissue or cell population that it's within.                  In terms of sources of adult stem cells, not just tissues, but                how did they get there?  How did an adult stem cell get into bone                marrow, or brain, or liver?  One theory is that some of these cells                may be leftover primitive stem cells, perhaps embryonic stem cells,                a few that are kept around, maintained in a state so that then they                can differentiate into various types of tissues.                  Another proposal is that there may be a universal stem cell, an                adult stem cell, not a primitive cell, but one more geared towards                maintenance and repair functions in the adult body.  It may arise                in one or more tissues, and then may disperse into other tissues.                               Other possibilities are that there are particular tissue stem                cells, multipotent, not able to perhaps form all tissues of the                adult body, but a limited subset, and that they would be resident                within a few of these tissues.                  And then I mentioned here transient stem cells, cells that are                just sort of passing through.  And there is the possibility that,                especially if we're looking at this idea of a universal stem                cell, or even a tissue stem cell that can migrate in some cases,                that it may end up passing through a tissue, so you will isolate                what appears to be a stem cell from a particular tissue.  But it                didn't arise there.  It just happened to be passing through                via the circulatory system.                 I might mention, too, that some of the other challenges for adult                stem cells are very similar to some of the challenges for embryonic                cells.  For example, standardization.  There essentially is no standardization                in terms of adult stem cell isolation, propagation, differentiation                into other tissues at this point.  Long term culture, with a few                exceptions, has not been attained.  Catherine Verfaillie's MAPC                cells from bone marrow do appear capable of long-term proliferation                in culture.  And there are a few other examples, very limited, that                I point out in the paper.  But being able to keep these cells growing                in culture for a long period of time has been difficult up to this                point.                 The idea of safety, of course, is always an issue when we're                going to be dealing with patients.  Do these cells form tumors?                 Do they differentiate abnormally so that you don't get the correct                differentiation in the place, in the time, in the tissue that you                need?  So all of these need to be faced.                 Now this idea of a potential universal or at least tissue stem                cell that can migrate primarily has been put forth by Helen Blau                of Stanford, the idea being that perhaps the cell is in the bone                marrow, but then can go into the circulation and then exit the circulation                into another tissue.  Again, most of the studies have seen this                type of phenomenon in response to an injury, not in response to                the normal physiological systems.                 How would we then define a stem cell, especially an adult stem                cell, if we have all of this problem with changeability of markers,                and lack of standardization?  Moore and Quesenberry have proposed                a couple of simple guidelines.  Now obviously, any stem cell has                the ability to continue to replicate and maintain a population of                cells.  And then in response to some signal, to differentiate into                one or more potential tissue types.                  An initial first cut at how to identify a stem cell in the adult                would be, can it take on a different morphology in a tissue in which                you place it?  Can it take on some of the differentiated cell markers                that you would see in that tissue?  Now this is a bare minimum,                and it doesn't really mean necessarily that the cell is functional,                that it can participate in tissue repair, or perhaps even that it                has truly differentiated into that specific cell type.                 Supplementing that, if you could demonstrate functional activity,                and actual integration into a tissue, this would be a much better                marker of a cell as a stem cell.  And certainly, if in an injury                situation, in animal model or even in human, you could demonstrate                a physiological improvement.  That would be a good indication that                you were seeing this sort of stem cell differentiation and repair.                              Now, the next set of slides, what I've tried to do is just                condense from that rather difficult mass to read of all of these                various tissue sources, and cell types that they can turn into,                and so on.  I won't spend a great deal of time on these.  I'll                just try and point out some particular points on each slide.                 With mesenchymal or stromal stem cells from the bone marrow, we                need to keep in mind that bone marrow is a mixed population.  We've                known about hematopoietic stem cells from bone marrow since the                1960s.  These are well-studied and used clinically.  The hematopoietic                stem cell is differentiating primarily, at least, into blood cells.                               Another stem cell that's in the bone marrow is this mesenchymal,                or stromal, cell.  As I mentioned in the paper, one way that this                type of cell is actually isolated is perhaps first by markers, but                then also simply by its ability to form attached adherent layers                in the culture dish, once you're putting them into the dish                in the lab.                  Now, there have been various studies, and I've just tried                to collect a number of them here, showing potential differentiation                into different tissue types, either in the lab dish, or in the animal.                 Again, the way they're following this in the animal is primarily                to use a genetic or a fluorescent marker, follow the cell, see what                tissue it ends up in, and look at its morphology, and then also                potentially try to analyze functionality and integration into the                tissue.                 In various disease models, some of these cells have been used.                 For example, in models of stroke.  And I want to point out again                what Dr. Gearhart said.  Animal models are only an approximation.                 This does not tell us the actual situation that we might encounter                in human beings.  But at this point, it's the best we can do.                 We can see if these cells might participate in cell and tissue repair.                 Using rat or human cells, there has been some therapeutic benefit                in some of these disease models in stroke with animals.  With demyelinated                spinal cord.                 Intravenous injection, interestingly enough, of mesenchymal stem                cells in the mouse has shown some remyelinization in spinal cord                injury.  Adult stem cells are not alone in terms of this ability.                 Other cell types have shown this.  And this does not necessarily                mean that you've totally corrected the condition.  It simply                means that you're able to provide some sort of functional recovering                of a bare nerve.                 Another interesting point about this particular study was that                they did not see a large incorporation of these cells into the spinal                cord tissue.  So what benefit they did see did not appear to be                due primarily to the adult stem cells actually differentiating into                the myelinating cells here.  Instead, what appeared to be happening                was the presence of those cells caused a signal for the endogenous                cells to start to re-grow and repair the damage.                  In fact, Dr. Gearhart's lab just recently published a paper                showing that embryonic germ cells showed in a particular mouse model                the same type of repair phenomena.  The mice did show therapeutic                benefit.  But what they found was that the cells did not, to a large                extent, integrate in and participate in the repair.  Instead, it                seemed to be a signalling phenomenon.  And I'll point this out                in a couple of other examples along the way.                 There has been one clinical trial that I could find in the literature                where 11 patients were treated for Hurler syndrome, or metachromatic                leukodystrophy using allogeneic, and not from the original patient,                but from donor mesenchymal cells.  Now, the study noted that four                out of those eleven patients showed a small increase in nerve conductance.                 One of the problems with these diseases is a decrease in nerve conductance.                 There are other neurological effects, and so on.  So small increase.                              And in terms of loss of bone mass, all 11 patients seemed to maintain,                at least for a certain time.  But in terms of any of the other symptoms                in these patients, there was no effect of the adult stem cells.                 Very early study.                 Using mixed population of bone marrow stem cells.  So in this                case, and again, this lack of identifiability for a particular adult                stem cell.  What many people have done is simply take raw bone marrow                and either in culture try to get various differentiations, or putting                back into the animal in various disease models.  And they've                been tried in quite a number of disease models showing some therapeutic                benefit.  In this particular case, again in stroke, intravenous                injection of this mixed population of cells.  Again, no attempt                to purify the cells, or identify the particular cell that's                being used for the treatment of the animal model.  But the cells                in this case did home in on the damage.  Again, this interesting                phenomenon that we've seen.                 Various other conditions.  There was an interesting study relating                to cardiac damage, where cells from mice were actually put into                rats.  And what they noticed was over a fairly extended period of                time there did not appear to be immune rejection of these transplanted                cells, even though they were even from a different species.                  Now, it's only one study.  Does that mean that these particular                cells might be immune privileged and not subject to rejection?                 Only more experiments will tell.  Recent study indicated that with                diabetes, in a mouse model again, where the pancreas was damaged                to induce loss of insulin secretion, bone marrow stem cells injected                into the animal could regenerate insulin-secreting cells.  As in                the other example I mentioned before, there was very low incorporation                of the actual bone marrow stem cells identified as forming insulin-secreting                cells.  Instead, what they seemed to be doing in this instance was                again secreting particular growth or stimulatory factors to stimulate                the endogenous cells to re-form insulin-secreting cells.                 And there have been several clinical trials and publications,                peer reviewed publications, from those trials, primarily with cardiac                damage.  There have been several groups in Germany and a group in                Japan that have published their results.  Again, very, very limited                numbers of patients, we must keep in mind.  And what they're                seeing, though, is some physiological improvement in the ejection                fraction from the heart, and when they actually examine some of                the damage that seems to be being repaired.  One Japanese group                has reported growth of blood vessels in limbs that were threatened                to be lost by gangrene.                  Peripheral blood.  Probably we should just skip this category,                in a sense, because they seem to be very similar to the bone marrow                stem cells.  And it makes a lot of sense that bone marrow stem cells                could actually enter the circulation.  The interesting thing is                that two groups recently have isolated peripheral blood stem cells                from human blood.  One group in particular noticed that the cells                that they isolated showed high levels of Oct-4 expression, this                gene that's associated with pluripotent status of a stem cell.                              In a couple of animal disease models for stroke and cardiac damage,                and I put this under peripheral blood because what the workers did                was not remove adult stem cells and then re-implant them in the                animal.  They injected growth factors to stimulate mobilization                of the stem cells, most likely from bone marrow.  And these cells                appeared to provide a therapeutic benefit in these conditions.                 And we'll come back and talk a little bit more about mobilization                later.                  Neural stem cells.  I certainly was taught in graduate school                that you start with as many brain cells as you're ever going                to have and it's downhill from there.  And on my campus, it's                downhill even faster on a good Friday or Saturday night.  But within                the last decade or so, the discovery that there are these stem cells                within neural tissue that can at least regenerate all three main                neuronal types, and perhaps some other tissue types as well.                  Interestingly enough, they have been used in some animal disease                models to show some therapeutic benefit.  And there have been some                clinical trials, very early.  There is one Parkinson's patient                who was treated with his own neuronal stem cells.  The cells were                removed, grown in culture for awhile, and placed back just into                one side of the brain.  He did see a benefit.  He did see improvement.                              In terms of spinal cord injury, there are no peer reviewed publications                in terms of actual human treatment.  But there have been reports                that at least one group in Portugal are beginning these types of                treatments on patients for spinal cord injury.                  Dr. Gearhart mentioned the embryonic carcinoma cells.  And there's                one group of this cell termed usually ""hNT"" that you might                say has been tamed in culture.  This particular line that they've                come across primarily forms neuronal-type cells in culture, and,                as he mentioned, it's being used in a beginning clinical trial                on stroke.                  Muscle stem cell can regenerate itself.  It has its own stem cell,                primarily dedicated to forming more muscle.  But there's indication                that it does have, perhaps, another stem cell present in that population.                 Debate as to whether those cells can actually form blood, or if                that was one of these so-called transient cells moving through.                 The potential though, perhaps, to form bone from this type of cell,                and these muscle stem cells have been used in some disease models,                primarily directed back towards muscle.  Very interesting one that                I came across was to re-form bladder muscle, or at least reinforce                bladder muscle, in a rat model of incontinence.  And there's                been one published paper regarding a clinical trial using muscle                stem cells, one patient, in France, where the patient did seem to                receive some therapeutic benefit from the muscle stem cells.                 Liver stem cells and pancreatic stem cells.  Pancreas and the                liver derive from the same embryonic primordia.  And so it might                not be surprising that you tend to see liver able to form pancreas,                or pancreas able to form liver.  The interesting thing here is that                genetically engineered liver stem cells, simply by adding and activating                a gene, have helped an animal model induce diabetes in these animals.                 The pancreatic stem cells, likewise, have shown the similar ability.                              Corneal limbal stem cells are a very limited subset.  And what                we might in one sense call a unipotent stem cell, at least for the                most part, other than one or two little reports, so that they would                re-form only the tissue in which they're located.  They have                been used, however, in corneal transplants in a number of countries.                 And there are several published reports on this.   In vitro ,                one group was able to get them to form neuronal cells in culture,                or what looked like neuronal cells.                 Cartilage, again, a very limited sort of application, but clinical                trials for articular cartilage transplants.  And one group has used                them in an attempt to treat children with osteogenesis imperfecta.                               Umbilical cord blood, not a great deal of research has been done,                but there are a growing number of publications.  The interesting                thing here is, in terms of the disease models, stroke, spinal cord                injury, and one particular model of ALS, the cells are delivered                intravenously.  So again, this potential to home in on areas of                damage.                 And then just a list of a number of other tissues here where some                type of adult stem cell has been identified, or potentially identified.                 And I want to point out the adipose, or fat-derived stem cells.                 And I use ""derived"" because it's very likely this                is one of those transient stem cells moving through via the circulatory                system.  Interestingly enough, though, it provides a reliable, readily                available source, you might say, from liposuction fat.  And one                group has been able to see neuronal differentiation in the lab;                not in any animal models yet.                 Now, in terms of activation and mobilizing these adult stem cells,                this may be actually one of the best directions to go in terms of                potential clinical treatments.  Simply because it may not be the                stem cells themselves that participate in the repair of the damage.                 And in that case, maybe what we need to do is simply activate the                cells so that they can deliver the signal to the damaged tissue.                 And again, there may be various states within the bone marrow as                an example of a tissue where you might activate, where the cell                could be activated and then mobilized into the circulatory system,                and then reach the particular tissue to differentiate.                 Again, there were two animal models that had been used, one for                cardiac damage, and one for stroke, where there was an indication                that this might be a potential avenue of research.  Rather than                removing the cells, having to culture them, isolate them, identify                them, put them back, simply being able to mobilize the cells within                the body.                  Another possibility is genetic engineering.  And in terms of actual                animal models of disease, genetically engineered adult stem cells                have been used in a few examples in the publications.  In lung,                that one particular reference indicated that there was a large contribution                of the adult cells to lung tissue.  Again, a damaged tissue system.                              Clinical trials, not directly, you might say, repairing a damaged                tissue.  But in Severe Combined Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome, bubble                boy syndrome, several infants have been treated using genetically                modified bone marrow stem cells from the patient.  They seem to                have been, quote, ""cured,"" and I use that word advisedly,                of the disease.  There have been reports that at least two, and                potentially a third infant, has come down with leukemia as a result                of that treatment, most likely due to the viral vector that was                used to insert the gene into those cells.  Because the gene is not                targeted in those instances.  Instead, it may go into an area where                it can activate oncogenic genes within the cells.                  In terms of delivering the signal, this might be an even better                use of genetic engineering in adult stem cells.  And there have                been a few published examples, potentially for use in animal models                with tumor therapy, to alleviate some of the symptoms in the model                of Niemann-Pick disease for increasing bone healing, and in a Parkinson's                model, where the cells were not participating to any great extent                in repair of the tissue.  Instead, they're delivering a signal                to the endogenous cells there, and stimulating them.                 And in terms of that then, perhaps the best avenue eventually                to pursue might be trying to isolate what these factors are, so                that no stem cells would be needed at all.  Instead, if you can                identify those factors to stimulate regeneration within the tissue,                they could be delivered directly.                  And there are a few published examples of this, one in which there                was some axon regrowth, some, in a rat spinal cord injury model                by injecting a couple of different factors.  One mouse Parkinson's                model study infused directly a factor into the brain of the mouse                model and saw a therapeutic benefit.  Another publication lists                a different factor in terms of a model of chronic kidney damage.                 And one clinical trial where five patients, five Parkinson's                patients were treated with infusion of this glial-derived neurotrophic                factor, they did see some improvement.  Not a cure, and it may be                that that's not the sole signal that's needed, or the correct                signal.  But it did seem to stimulate some physiological improvement                in the patients.                 Thank you.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   For a young field, there's a lot going                on.  And we have also talked our way late into the hour.  Let me                make a suggestion, if I might.  Technically, this session was to                run till 3:30, with the next to start at a quarter of 4:00.  I'm                going to take the liberty of suggesting we spend a half an hour                here at least with our visitors to get some of our questions asked.                 And if Lori Andrews will forgive us, we'll be pushing back the                start of the next session, just so we can get the questions asked.                              Michael Sandel, then Jim Wilson.                 DR. SANDEL:  I learned a great deal from all of these presentations,                as I suspect we all did.  I was especially struck by one feature                of Dr. Jaenisch's presentation, and I'd like to put this                as an observation which actually will end with a question.                 The subtitle of the paper and of the talk, Dr. Jaenisch, and my                Council colleagues will appreciate this perhaps more than our visitors.                 The subtitle could well have been, ""The Vindication of Paul                McHugh.""  Because when we were discussing the biology of cloning,                almost everyone here shared an assumption, regardless of the positions                that we took on the ethical issues.  Almost everyone took it for                granted that biologically the fertilized embryos and cloned embryos                were essentially the same, and the moral argument proceeded from                that assumption.  With the exception of one person, Paul McHugh.                               And he introduced a distinction, a distinction, as he put it,                between a zygote and a ""clonote"", by which he meant the                cloned embryo, the product of cloning.  And for insisting on this                distinction, poor Paul suffered heaps of ridicule and abuse, and,                at best, a kind of bemused chuckling, by those of us around the                table.  And he argued that there's a difference, a biological                difference, with a possible ethical significance between a zygote                and a clonote, between a fertilized embryo and an artifact created                in the lab.  And he was told that this is an eccentric position.                 He was told that this is an off the wall distinction, that it had                no basis in biology or science.                  And in a memorable exchange with our colleague Charles, who unfortunately                isn't here for the benefit of this discussion, he was asked,                ""Well, but what if a cloned embryo actually came to term?                 Isn't Dolly a sheep?""  And Paul's answer was, ""Well,                a sick sheep.""                 And then we read, Dr. Jaenisch, in your paper that a cloned human                embryo would have little, if any, potential to develop into a normal                human being, that it lacks essential attributes that characterize                the beginning of normal human life.  And you explained that it has                to do with faulty reprogramming after nuclear transfer.                 Now, I don't know whether that's true, whether it's                generally accepted, or controversial in the scientific community.                 But whatever the case, it seems that what we regarded here as an                eccentric, off the wall suggestion, that there is a biologically                significant difference between a fertilized embryo and a cloned                embryo, now, if I understand you correctly and here's my question,                now, you're telling us that far from being eccentric or off                the wall, Paul's position may be true.                  DR. JAENISCH:   Well, I think that was the whole purpose                of going through these arguments for me.  To argue from a biological                point of view, it is a continuum.  We have to struggle with that.                 And we have, for the early, most abnormal stage, we have good markers.                 Death is a terrific marker.  Then we have molecular markers after                birth, or we have aging as another marker.                 So these are concrete markers, and we know these animals are not                normal.  So when it is claimed that cows on the field are normal,                which has been published by ACT.  They looked at their one- to four-year-old                cows sit on the fields and eat and give milk.  They argued, well,                they must be normal.  So they checked that.  And they checked it                by checking if it had a heart.  Yes, it had a heart.  A liver, yes                they had a liver, and that serum, even.  So they concluded they                must be normal and publish this in ""Science"".                 Now, this of course is a very superficial way of looking at it.                 And very interesting.  Once this paper came out, six months later,                two of these healthy cows, one got multiple tumors, the other one                generalized seizures.  Now this is not normal.  You wait, and these                things come out.                 The point I was trying to make is that these are stochastic problems.                 There is not a key master gene which, if this is right then the                embryo's right.  No.  The whole genome is stochastically, correctly                reprogrammed or not.  And what's amazing to me is that mammalian                development is so regulative that it can tolerate so much gene disregulation                and still get an animal to birth and beyond.  But you pay for that.                 You pay with subtle or less subtle, more or less subtle problems.                               And of course, because it's stochastic, you will arrive at                the end at some animals which live a normal life span.  And by all                our available tests they might be normal, or you might not see it.                 If you look at the primate, or in the human, we might see this because                we could look at some much more subtle phenotypes.                  So I think the point I was trying to make is if you want to use                this as a technique to generate human beings, there's no predictability.                 You cannot do this.  And for me, it doesn't matter with one                percent or two maybe something normal, because you can't predict                it before.                 So I totally agree with what your thought was.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Jim Wilson.                  PROF. WILSON:   Michael asked the same question I was going                to ask using virtually the same words.  I guess it's the Harvard                affliction.                 But I want to just press a bit more.  An oocyte is not potential                human life because it's an unfertilized egg.  You can enucleate                it and put in a new nucleus, and now it is a clone.  But according                to your account, a cloned embryo has little, if any, potential to                ever develop into a normal human being.                 If you would step back, then, from your biological role and adopt                a somewhat more philosophical role, would you say that a clone,                therefore, is not potential human life?                  DR. JAENISCH:   I would argue it's not potential normal                human life.                  PROF. WILSON:   Thank you.                  DR. JAENISCH:   I think that's the only thing I can                say.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   And Dolly still is a sheep?                  DR. JAENISCH:   Still was a sick sheep, was a very sick                sheep, and which died, of course, predictably very early.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Janet Rowley.                  DR. ROWLEY:   Well, I, too, learned a great deal this afternoon.                 I want to make two comments, and then I have a question for Rudy.                              The first comment is that I think it is most unfortunate that                we're prevented from asking our experts, and particularly John                Gearhart, about the status of funding that supports this very critical                area of science.                  The second comment is also directed to John.  And I was struck                by the specific chromosome abnormalities that you identified in                your human embryonic cells, because you probably know that an isochromosome                for 12p is the most common abnormality in human testicular carcinoma.                               So it's astonishing that this is the abnormality that you                see in these cells, and I'm sure it is extraordinarily important.                              The question that I have for Rudy — I was surprised when you said                that imprinted genes are only important in embryogenesis, because                clearly there are a number of human conditions.                 Now, you could say, well, human condition and the malformations                occur because of embryogenesis, but there is also this whole question                of imprinting and its relationship to carcinogenesis.  So I'd                like you to expand on that.                  DR. JAENISCH:   This is a very important point you're                bringing up, so I was probably a little bit generalized.  So I think                most imprinting, as we know, have — so that could be among these                things that could be the most interesting, because it's IGF-2,                which is a loose cannon.                  IGF-2 is a tumor, an oncogene essentially, so this would be available                for cloning, because IGF-2 is very easily dysregulated.  And I would                worry if you have both copies active, because that's pretumor                status.  So you want to screen for this.                 But the other genes — for all of the other genes, for example,                an Angelman Syndrome probably really is — there are really problems                of fetal development.  So these genes and fetal development — I                could go further into this, because it's really growth of the                fetus, where these genes appear to play the most important role.                              And there's really no evidence, with the exception of IGF-2,                maybe KIP-257, which is a tumor suppressor gene, those are the ones                you would worry about.  So I think we know only two of those, and                those you would test for I think.                  So I agree, which makes this a little bit more restrictive when                I say it.                  DR. ROWLEY:   Right.  And there probably are others that                we don't know about, but —                  DR. JAENISCH:   There might be others which we don't                know —                  DR. ROWLEY:   — you're saying that they would —                  DR. JAENISCH:   Yes.                  DR. ROWLEY:   — just all be tested for.                  DR. JAENISCH:   Those two we know for sure, but others we                know they don't play a role.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   I have myself next, if I might.  A question                for Dr. Prentice, and then for the group as a whole.  In Dr. Gearhart's                presentation, he gave a great deal of emphasis to the importance                of the characterization of these cells, the reproducibility, all                of these various things.                 You had to cover an enormous amount of material in the number                of papers, and you also in your presentation alluded to the problem                of characterization, though I gather many of these studies seem                to be one-shot efforts of throwing some things in and trying to                see what their clinical effect might be.                 And as I've read the debates, a lot of people wonder, are                these really stem cells?  How well characterized are they?  So could                you say something about what criteria should be used for these stem                cell preparations?                  What criteria would they have to meet before you could satisfy                the critics that these are, in fact, fit to be called human stem                cells, and fit, therefore, for controlled studies on the kinds of                things that you're talking about here?                 And kind of a subordinate question, what's the best characterized                of, and the most versatile of, these adult stem cell preparations?                 Are there any that at the moment meet the criteria that you yourself                would advance?                  DR. PRENTICE:   In answer to your first question, it's                difficult, obviously, because as you point out many of these studies                have been sort of one-shot, especially if you look at the mixed                bone marrow population studies where they are simply taking a preparation,                putting it back into a diseased animal or a diseased model, and                trying to come up with some therapeutic benefit.                 You know, obviously, what you'd like to be able to do is to                isolate the cell or the population, keeping in mind that caveat                that the population dynamics may be an important facet of this.                               But let's say there's one particular stem cell that you're                after.  Supposedly, if you saw that sort of therapeutic benefit                from the mixed population, you should be able to go in and simply                take cuts and eventually isolate that one cell, and then be able                to grow it in culture.                 In terms of the overall markers, that's been very difficult,                and there have been a few studies looking at the gene expression                common to neural stem cells, bone marrow stem cells, embryonic stem                cells.  And there are a subset of those genes that are common to                all of those cells.                 Now, what you would hope to be able to do, then, is to go look                at each of those genes and start using those as guides to come up                with a marker for any stem cell that would be targeted for the types                of differentiation models that we'd like to see, and eventually                clinical applications.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   And with respect to the second question,                what is the best characterized and most versatile adult stem cell                preparation at the moment?  I mean, can you — is there —                  DR. PRENTICE:   Probably Dr. Verfaillie's MAPC cells,                and I can't speak for her, but those do show many of these characteristics                that ideally you would like — long-term growth in culture, clonogenic                growth, and then differentiation.  They've been used in a couple                of different animal models of disease to see some sort of benefit.                              One of the mesenchymal cell — stem cell lines, if I remember correctly                — and there are a lot of things to sort back through there — had                been kept in culture, I believe, for about two years.  There was                another cell line that — I think it was also a bone marrow derived                cell line, but it had been genetically engineered to contain telomerase                or additional telomerase gene.  And that had been kept in long-term                culture.                 I believe also one of the neural stem cell lines has been kept                in long-term culture, and actually Dr. Gearhart might be able to                comment more on that.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Okay.  Thank you.                 And I have a general question to all of you, if I might.  Since                we sent you some general questions that we were hoping to get some                help on, to go from where we are now to actually having reliable                tissue grafting therapeutic applications in humans, since there's                a fair amount of speculation out there — and, Dr. Gearhart, you                did emphasize how early we are in the process and the emphasis,                really, on learning of the basic biology.                 But the public out there is more — much more interested in, you                know, where are the cures?  Could you address that particular question                of the various sort of stages, and where we are, and what kind of                — how one should talk about these things responsibly in relation                to the widespread hopes for remedies for which the patient groups                are, quite understandably, clamoring?                  DR. GEARHART:   The answer to that question is a very complex                one for me.  I could run through a number of cell lineages with                respect to the human embryonic and stem cell and germ cell lines,                where we are in the process, but it's the other end that I want                to address.                 The most difficult talks that I give anymore are those before                patient-based groups where the hopes are high.  They come with expectations                that far exceed, I think, where we are.  And this is the result                that I think that early on in the field, as you mentioned, the hype                was there when circumspection should have been there.  And I don't                think circumspection is a retreat from promise.                 The reality is when you get into the laboratory, and you are working                on cell lines, it seems the more progress you make, the further                away the goal is as we learn.  And we can show I think remarkable                things in our animal models of putting in cells, and these are almost                — they bear some resemblance to the adult stem cell story where                you try a lot of things empirically, you get a response of some                kind, and you're trying to figure out what it is, why.                 But when you superimpose on top of the biology issues of trying                to control these cells in a dish, and trying to expand them in a                dish to characterize them, to show that they're authentic, that                they do work, the issues of safety, which I think we all are in                agreement have to be foremost in this, that the time frame is years                away before I think any of this will be realized in a clinic.                 I think there's misunderstanding, that if all of a sudden                you have an insulin-producing cell in a laboratory, which we do,                and we're — as other labs have as well — that most people think                this is the answer.  You just put insulin-producing cells into a                diabetic.  And as you know, this doesn't solve the underlying                problem.                 We can — so I don't know how to answer the question that you                ask.  I mean, I'm certainly optimistic.  I think it's going                to be a direct function, and I'll come back to Janet's question                that she can't ask or isn't supposed to ask, and that is                that obviously more funding into this area — and I know that this                isn't a congressional committee of any kind, where we're                seeking funding, but obviously the progress is directly proportional                to the number of good investigators you have working on projects.                              And in this field, we've had a bottleneck, first from the                number of lines that could be used, now the NIH funding I'm                sure is going to be more robust over time, but this remains not                only I think a financial issue but also almost a psychological one                — for students getting involved, for post-docs getting involved,                for young faculty getting involved in the field, where we don't                know what the future will be, to be honest with you, in this country.                              We see our colleagues around the world in different laboratories                I think making really substantial progress here.  And so I'll                get off this part of it, but I think this is an important issue,                at least with the embryonic and fetal sources of cells.  And I hope                we'd get over that.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you.                 I have Gil Meilaender, Bill Hurlbut, Janet.  Gil.                  PROF. MEILAENDER:   Yes.  Dr. Jaenisch, I want to come back to                where Michael Sandel started us, because I'm just not certain                that I'm clear on something.  And what I want to know is, you                know, it's always hard to know when one's speaking as a                scientist and when one's speaking as something else.                 But as a scientist, there are various kinds of chromosomal or                genetic defects that a fetus might have, the result of which would                be that it might die immediately after birth or very soon after                that.  How would you scientifically describe those fetuses?  Would                you say that they have — that they also do not have the potential                to be a normal human being?                  I'm trying to get away from the stem cell issue for a moment.                 Would the same characterization be the appropriate one there?                  DR. JAENISCH:   This a really a question which is not a                scientific question, then, right?  An embryo which has a trisomy                number, whatever, large chromosomes will die very early, maybe before                implantation.  So that has this embryo which is afflicted with this                genetic alteration.                  Has that a normal potential development to a human being?  No.                               PROF. MEILAENDER:   So it falls into the same — so, in other words,                this is a rather large category of embryos and fetuses that — about                which we would say this.  We're not only talking about cloned                embryos.                  DR. JAENISCH:   Well, I think that —                  PROF. MEILAENDER:   The same characterization —                  DR. JAENISCH:   Yes, I —                  PROF. MEILAENDER:   — would fit.                  DR. JAENISCH:   I think the difference, from my point of                view, if a chromosomal abnormality occurs after normal fertilization,                something which is totally unpredictable and is assessed, that is                what fate is to genetic game.  With cloning, I think it's predictable,                and that's the difference.  It is predictable to a large extent,                so I think that would make the difference.                 One is spontaneous, unpredictable, it's a risk of normal reproduction.                 The other one is predictable.  Otherwise, I really can't — I                think this for me is a major difference.  You predictably generate                a human being which has no chance to become normal with any acceptable                efficiency.                  PROF. MEILAENDER:   I think I'll stop there.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Bill Hurlbut, and then Janet.                  DR. HURLBUT:   Did I hear you correctly say you find destruction                of IVF embryos morally troubling, but cloned embryos for embryonic                stem cell use less troubling?                  DR. JAENISCH:   No.  Well, I said that if you accept that                instead of throwing away an  in vitro  fertilized embryo which                cannot be implanted because nobody wants it, instead of throwing                this embryo away generating to an embryonic stem cell, I mean, people                accept this.  I find this acceptable.  But it does pose an ethical                problem, because you do destroy potential normal human life.  There's                no talking around it.                 So if you accept that, then I would argue that a cloned embryo                is less of an ethical problem.  That's all that I want to say.                 So the potential is not there.                  DR. HURLBUT:   And from hearing you and talking with you                at lunch, I had the sense that you feel like nuclear transfer actually                offers us more versatility and more promise than using IVF embryos,                because we can use the genotypes we want and control various things.                 Is this fair?                  DR. JAENISCH:   Yes, I would think so.                  DR. HURLBUT:   So I have to admit I'm troubled by your                comment, and not convinced by Michael Sandel's comment.  As                much as I like my colleague Paul McHugh, I'm not — I'm troubled                by the notion that what you called not potentially normal human                life does not have a moral standing.                 And the reason I'm troubled by that is — was just alluded                to by Gil, that I would not say that a potentially abnormal trajectory                of embryogenesis is not a human life necessarily.                  Now, I have a handicapped child myself, and she does not have                a problem of development, but she had brain damage at birth.  But                she's not what you would call a normal human life in that specifically                all-healthy sense.  But she's very human, as human as I am.                              I'll let somebody make the joke on that one, if you want.                              But the question is this.  I feel for what you're saying.                 I feel for what Michael said, and I feel — have been with Paul to                some extent on this all along.                  But if we say that natural — the natural meaning of the definition                of a human life is not normal, but some meaningful process of integrated                — of integration of identity, of continuity, then it seems to me                that the clones that have been produced at least with animal studies                have to qualify as entities of their species.                 So even though, as you said to me even a year ago, a cow standing                on a green hill chewing its cud isn't — doesn't make it                a normal cow.  I agree.  But I think it's still a cow.                 And likewise, the human trajectory of whatever the clone could                be is troublingly human-like.  I personally wouldn't feel comfortable                saying, for example, as was implied by John Gearhart in his talk,                that we could use it to harvest out later tissues for more difficult                differentiations.                 Well, let me back that up.  All of my colleagues, and my own reading                on this, confirms to me that going from embryonic stem cells to                useful cells, tissues, and organs, is a long journey, maybe short                for Parkinson's Disease, but longer for more complex tissues,                and very long for — what we really want is organs and — for transplant,                like kidneys, and so forth.                 I think there will be a temptation in our civilization to move                the trajectory of something that's designated non-human on to                further stages of gestation.  Now maybe not gestation in a human                womb.  Maybe it'll be in an artificial endometrium or something                that can coax it just 30, 60 days longer for good use.  It starts                to be troubling, even if you accept your premises.                 Let me back it up, then.  I think in principle what you're                saying has something to it, and Paul and I have been trying to talk                about this, and I've had dialogues with my colleagues on this.                               I put forward in my personal statement on the President's                Council Report on Cloning what I called a speculative proposal,                where I suggested that — drawing on what Paul had said, that this                is an artifact, not a human being, a clonal artifact.                  Why don't we go to the bottom of the problem?  Why don't                we say that something that does not have a human potential in any                meaningful way, not an abnormal human potential, but no meaningful                human potential, might supply us with the essential way to get around                the moral problem, at least to get us to stem cells?  And we can                deal with the next issues later.                 And I want to stay two things before I conclude.  One is in making                this proposal, I was very aware that the first issue of what you                might call the inviolability of the human life is only the beginning                of the questions about the moral use of human process or human tissues                or anything.                 But what I had in mind was this — that just as we've come                to see that a cell does not define the locus of human dignity, nor                does a gene, of course — let's start at the smallest.  A gene                — a human gene can be put into a bacterium, grown, used to make                insulin.  A cell — we do blood cell transplants.  Tissues — we do                skin transplants.  Organs — we do transplants and even organ systems.                 None of those are the locus of human dignity, human moral standing.                              Likewise, in this age of developmental biology, we will learn                that partial generative potentials are not the locus of human moral                standing.  We will harness these partial generative potentials in                such a way that we can do wonderful things with them without violating                the integrity, identity, and continuity of human life.                 So this is my question to you.  Could we find a scientific way                to meet the challenge of our President and our nation and the imperative                of our civilization to go forward with the science?  Could we define                the danger as we never want to interrupt a normal human life in                process, or even one that is remotely normal?                 Could we meet that moral objection while at the same time opening                the positive future of our science?  And here the suggestion I would                have is using something so fundamental, like short, interfering                RNA, to preclude the very possibility of anything but the most minimal                and genetic mammalian process to the blastocysts from which we could                then take embryonic stem cells.                 What do you think?                  DR. JAENISCH:   Yes.  I think we talked about this before.                 I think it's a really interesting possibility.  So what we need                to — for a human being to develop two major lineages, which is a                trophoblast lineage and the epiblast lineage.  The trophoblast lineage                will support the embryo from the placenta.                 So certainly there are genes which are only needed, as far as                we know from experiments, that are only needed for placental development.                 They are not needed for the epiblast lineage or for the embryo.                 So one would modify a donor cell — let's say a skin cell that                you want to transplant — with inactivating such a gene — I can give                you examples of those — and expressing, for example, using the SI                RNA technology, which now really becomes — seems to become a routine                procedure to inactive genes.                 And, indeed, an embryo — a cloned embryo derived from such a nucleus                would not be able to form a trophoblast lineage which would be functional.                 So, therefore, if this embryo would be implanted, it would definitely                fail.  You could predict it would fail much earlier than this continuum,                which I outlined for the cloned embryos which are not modified.                              So I think, in principle, this is a doable — potentially doable                manipulation which would prevent what you are interested in and                what you are raising, prevent the development very far in utero.                               DR. HURLBUT:   In your opinion, could we reasonably call                that not in any sense a human life in process, abnormal or normal,                but call it a clonal artifact, a laboratory production for the procurement                of cells with a potential for something, but not what we would have                to call embryonic cells?                  DR. JAENISCH:   Yes, because you would argue this embryo                — I mean, the definition of an early embryonic cell, like a two-cell                or a four-cell embryo, the blastomere, is totipotent.  These cells                can make the placental lineage and the epiblast lineage.                 This embryo would not be able to make the trophoblast lineage,                so, therefore, it would not be totipotent.  So I think you could                argue this would be a real biological difference.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   We do want to go to the next session shortly,                but I've got Janet and Elizabeth, and then I'm going to                call a halt for this session.                  DR. ROWLEY:   I come back to John Gearhart.  And, first,                I want to take you to task for comments at the very end of your                talk, and then I have a question.  And what I want to take you to                task for are your comments, all related to enhancement and how easy                it's going to be to just get genetic enhancement of all sorts                of features.                 And I think — well, you could expand on that or explain what you                meant by that.  But this has been such a critical issue for this                particular Council — the likelihood of enhancement — that I think                that it shouldn't just be left unchallenged.                 And the question that I have is, with regard to characterization                of current lines, you indicated that that's under the auspices                of the MRC in London.  And I'm just curious, are they looking                at both so-called presidential lines as well as lines available                elsewhere?  Or are they only lines available elsewhere?  And what                kinds of characterization are they proceeding with?                  DR. GEARHART:   Let me answer the non-controversial question                first.  This is a relatively — this panel — there has been, over                the last nine months or so, an international consortium that has                been meeting on human embryonic stem cells.                 The outcome of this was the appointment of a panel headed by Peter                Andrews at Sheffield University, who will be — that panel will be                setting up the standardizations, if you will, or the criteria for                the embryonic stem cell lines.                 They will — I think some of this work will be done in the equivalent                of what's the FDA in the United Kingdom.  But they will take                any cell line that's submitted to them, whether it's a presidential                one or one from anywhere else.  They are not a — they are not distributing                cells.  They are just testing them for these different parameters.                              And, obviously, there will be a number of transcription factors,                a number of surface antigens.  This kind of thing will be in that                mix.                  DR. ROWLEY:   Will they do karyotypes?                  DR. GEARHART:   Oh, yes, karyotype is — yes, it's absolutely                essential to have a normal karyotype, and one that's stable                over a number of cell passages is critical.                 The comment I made about enhancements, I just — it may have been                out of order here, but I am concerned, I mean, as a biologist I'm                concerned.  I'm concerned about a number of issues.  It makes                it sound as if most of the time that scientists aren't concerned,                that we're just going along in a fashion that, you know, science                for science sake.                 And I only have to remind you over the last few months to see                the use of human embryonic stem cells in mouse chimeras, the use                of chimeric human embryos that has been done, that you say there's                no reason that these things should have been done.  I mean, there's                no scientific basis for this.                 And we have to have some degree — and I'm not going to call                it regulation, I don't like that term, obviously, but there                has to be some consensus as to what should be permitted and shouldn't                be permitted in almost a global way.  And I realize that this is                very, very difficult.                 I've been to two G-6/G-7 meetings in which we have tried to                get some kind of consensus even on human cloning among countries.                 I mean, let alone the use of embryos for research, and things like                this.  And as you can imagine, nothing much happens.  Everyone has                their own opinions, and we go away.                 When we have the capability — if this work is successful — I'll                be frank with you.  If this work is successful, and by success that                we are learning mechanisms around differentiation and the development                of cell types, we are going to have an awful power that we can instruct                ourselves.                 Now, we're not necessarily going to be talking about germ                line cells or germ line modifications.  Maybe.  Because, obviously,                if we can grow oocytes from these cells — there are reports that                we can grow spermatogonia and sperm cells out of these — maybe the                possibility exists for that at this point.                 But I'm just hoping that people are thinking ahead a bit,                that, you know, this is something that's going to be on the                table in a number of years, and that we should give it some thought                — where we're going to go with this.  That's all.                 And so I made a comment about, you know, getting it off the internet                or something to do it.  Maybe that's an overstatement.  Maybe                that's just crying wolf, and I apologize for that.                 But I think it's something that we have to be aware is out                there.  It's going to be out there.  Not out there now, but                will be out there, and we should be thinking ahead.  So I apologize                to the Council for making that kind of a comment.                  DR. ROWLEY:   Well, I don't think an apology is necessary.                 I think what I'm trying to say is — my own personal view is                that the Council should be especially concerned about things that                are relatively near term.  And by ""near term,"" in such                a rapidly-moving field I think a few years is near term.  And if                you're saying, well, in 10 years' time we'll be able                to do this, we can't see that far ahead.                  DR. GEARHART:   Right.  Right.                  DR. ROWLEY:   And so that — so what kind of terms are you                talking about in terms of time?                  DR. GEARHART:   Oh, I'm talking not about 10 years.                 I'm talking about a shorter time interval.                  DR. ROWLEY:   Okay.                  DR. GEARHART:   You know, Janet, I think to be honest with                you, the number of federal Blue Ribbon Panels that have been set                up, at the NIH level, the National Academy, to discuss issues that                seem to be 10 years away, recommendations were made by our leading                scientists, our leading scholars, only to be ignored.  And then,                we find ourselves in a pot once these things happen.                 And it's just, I mean, frustrating as a scientist.  It's                frustrating almost as a citizen to do this, where it seems that                the scientific community, to a certain degree, is marginalized when                it comes to making recommendations as to how we should proceed.                              And we are left, then, every time something comes up in this area                everything is thrown up in the area as to where we're going,                etcetera.  So that's the nature of the comment.  Or, I'm                sorry, that's the basis of the comment that I made.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Last comment.  Elizabeth, if you — did                you still want to say something?  You were on the queue.                 PROF. BLACKBURN:  I'll return to the science, and I don't                know who would like to answer this question.  But it was picking                up on the point that I think Leon did raise about asking about the                sources of adult stem cells.  And you mentioned that there's                really only one good one, or the best one, is that right.  Dr. Verfaillie's.                 And —                  DR. PRENTICE:   I think Dr. Verfaillie's is the best                characterized —                 PROF. BLACKBURN:  Yes, best characterized.                  DR. PRENTICE:   — in terms of all of these various traits.                              PROF. BLACKBURN:  Yes.  So, you know, we're struck — and I                think Leon pointed this out, too — by the fact that there's                a great deal of research that's been ongoing in the last, you                know, couple of years —                  DR. PRENTICE:   Yes.                 PROF. BLACKBURN:  — on adults.  And yet it seems to me there's                a real problem.  And, you know, what's the problem?  Why is                there so little known?  To put it bluntly.                  You know, here's 192 publications that you cite, and why is                it so difficult?  Are these just inherently really difficult things                to work with?  Is this what it comes down to, that people who work                with adult stem cells don't really like to say that, or — sorry                to cut to the point, but I know time is of the essence.                  DR. PRENTICE:   I think one of the reasons comes back to                this difficulty in identifying which one is actually the stem cell,                how to actually purify it, isolate it.  Some of the cells seem rather                easy to isolate.  Certainly, peripheral blood is quite easier, or                the adipose-derived cells would be easy to isolate.                 But then, how do you really know that one is the stem cell?  And,                again, most of the results — the best results seem to come primarily                from these mixed populations of the bone marrow stem cells, where                they have not intentionally in many cases isolated the particular                stem cell.  Instead, they've been geared towards some sort of                physiological endpoint.                 My assumption would be, then, working back from that, once they                could achieve that end point, then they might be able to derive                the particular cell.                 But I think it also brings up a point I tried to raise before                in that it may not be possible, or it may not be preferable, to                try to get a particular cell.  It may be the context of these cells                with the population and their interactions, exchanging growth factors,                altering their own gene expression, and then — in the tissue milieu                — that really gives them this ability to somehow cause the repair.                               And I use that term because, again, I think in many of the instances                the research is showing that it's not direct integration and                taking on the function.  It's somehow stimulating endogenous                cells.                 PROF. BLACKBURN:  So it may — are you hinting that it might be                qualitatively different from what is going on with embryonic stem                cells, when those were tried to be used?                   DR. PRENTICE:   Well, I —                 PROF. BLACKBURN:  I don't want to get too much into this,                but I'm just trying to understand the science here.                  DR. PRENTICE:   Yes, I think that might be a good way to                put it.  It may be qualitatively different.  You know, it's                interesting Dr. Jaenisch mentioned that embryonic stem cells, in                a sense, are a tissue culture artifact.  He might just as well,                by the same definition, call Dr. Verfaillie's MAPC cells a tissue                culture artifact.                 And it may be that putting these cells into culture, now changing                their context, gives them some of these characteristics that are                so sought after.  Our target might be better put in terms of, what                is the physiological endpoint that we want?  Not a particular starting                cell, but how do we achieve the repair of the tissue damage?                 And, again, as I mentioned in the talk and in the paper, it may                be that it's not a particular cell that we really need.  Short                term, cellular regeneration may be our best goal.  But long term,                figuring out the particular molecular and cellular signals — and,                again, it may be a context-type signal — cell-cell context or cell-matrix                context — that actually can give us that physiological endpoint,                and so eventually going to a non-cell-based system, but a signal-based                system if you will.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Paul McHugh insists on a very brief comment,                and then we're —                  DR. McHUGH:   I have just two —                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   — going to break.                  DR. McHUGH:   — little tiny scientific questions, but because                they are important science that we're discussed here.  The first                one really relates to Dr. Jaenisch, and that is, I wanted to know,                sir, now whether you could say that the genetic alterations and                the problematic genetic status of the fully cloned animal, whether                those genetic abnormalities would then pass on to their offspring,                and so, therefore, be a contaminant to the whole human genome legacy                from then on?  That's the one question.                  DR. JAENISCH:   Let me first clarify there are no genetic                alterations which are important.  They are all epigenetic.                  DR. McHUGH:   Right, yes.                  DR. JAENISCH:   So the experiment has been done.  You can                take two animals afflicted with large offspring syndrome and mate                them.  The offspring will be all (risk?) normal, because you send                the genome through the process of gametogenesis, which reprograms                everything in a normal way, everything is reset.                 Of course, there might be some genetic alterations which are acquired                during somatic life.                  DR. McHUGH:   Right.                  DR. JAENISCH:   Those would not be — they cannot explain                the phenotype.  They would be recessive, and so they haven't                shown up yet.                  DR. McHUGH:   Right.                  DR. JAENISCH:   So we don't know if they would show                up.                  DR. McHUGH:   They might show up later.                  DR. JAENISCH:   Right.                  DR. McHUGH:   And secondly, to John Gearhart — John, you                whine a lot about how troublesome it is to be a scientist nowadays.                 I just want to know this.  The President made a very good Solomonic                decision and produced the cell lines for you scientists to work,                putting the ball in your court.                 Are you saying to us now you've used up all of the potential                in those cell lines, and now, because of the President's decision,                are restricted in your progress?                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   You don't have to answer, and he's                over time.  But if you'd like to —                  DR. GEARHART:   I have to answer Paul.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   — 15 seconds.                  DR. GEARHART:   Being a scientist is the greatest thing                in the world, and I wouldn't trade it for anything, Paul.  And                so I don't —                  DR. McHUGH:   I know that, John.  Me, too.                  DR. GEARHART:   Okay.  And I'm not here to whine.  The                funding issues are improving, and they are improving nicely here.                 Okay?  And, clearly, we can learn a lot through the lines that are                approved.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Gentlemen, thank you very much.                 Look, we have a guest we've kept waiting for quite a long                time.  Would the Council, please, 10 minutes.                 Thank you all very much.                 (Applause.)

Medical Encyclopedia: Stem cell research     URL of this page:  http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007120.htm         Definition                       A stem cell is a ""generic"" cell that can make exact copies of itself indefinitely. In addition, a stem cell has the ability to produce specialized cells for various tissues in the body -- such as heart muscle, brain tissue, and liver tissue. Scientists are able to maintain stem cells forever, developing them into specialized cells as needed.       There are two basic types:                         Embryonic stem cells  - these are obtained from either aborted fetuses or fertilized eggs that are left over from in vitro fertilization (IVF). They are useful for medical and research purposes because they can produce cells for almost every tissue in the body.                               Adult stem cells  - these are not as versatile for research purposes because they are specific to certain cell types, such as blood, intestines, skin, and muscle. The term ""adult stem cell"" may be misleading because both children and adults have them.             In August, 2001, President George W. Bush approved limited federal funding for stem cell research. While stem cell research has the potential to provide major medical advances, including cures for many diseases, stem cell research is controversial.         Information                                         Potential uses for stem cells             There are many areas in medicine where stem cell research could have a significant impact. For example, there are a variety of diseases and injuries in which a patient's cells or tissues are destroyed and must be replaced by tissue or organ transplants. Stem cells may be able to generate brand new tissue in these cases, and even cure diseases for which currently there is no adequate therapy. Diseases that could see revolutionary advances include Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, diabetes, spinal cord injury, heart disease, stroke, arthritis, cancer, and burns.       Stem cells could also be used to gain a better understanding of how genetics work in the early stages of cell development. This can help scientists understand why some cells develop abnormally and lead to medical problems such as birth defects and cancer. By understanding the genetic basis for cell development, scientists may learn how to prevent some of these diseases.       Finally, stem cells may be useful in the testing and development of drugs. Because stem cells can be used to create unlimited amounts of specialized tissue, such as heart tissue, it may be possible to test how drugs react on these specialized tissues before trying the drugs on animals and human subjects. Drugs could be tested for effectiveness and side effects more rapidly.               Controversy about stem cell research             The use of embryonic stem cells is controversial. The controversy is based on the belief by opponents that a fertilized egg is fundamentally a human being with rights and interests that need to be protected. Those who oppose stem cell research do not want fetuses and fertilized eggs used for research purposes.       Supporters of stem cell research argue that the fertilized eggs are donated with consent from each couple and would be discarded anyway. Therefore, there is no potential for those fertilized eggs to become human beings. Fertilized eggs are not (at this time) being created specifically for stem cell research.       As with any moral and ethical issue, the controversy surrounding stem cell research will likely continue for quite some time. Supporters believe that an aggressive federal program is needed before the potential of stem cell research can be realized. At this time, federal funding is limited to stem cell lines that already exist. The funding does not support further destruction of fertilized eggs. This is based on the idea that the ""life and death"" decision on the existing stem cell lines has already been made. Thus, a compromise has been made that supports medical research and respects the fundamental moral issues associated with the potential for life.

THIRD MEETING  Thursday, April 25, 2002     Session 1: Stem Cells 1:   Medical Promise of Embryonic Stem Cell Research (Present and Projected)   Dr. John Gearhart         CHAIRMAN KASS:  Well, I would like to ask Dean         Clancy to officially open the meeting, please.          MR. CLANCY:  This meeting is lawful.          CHAIRMAN KASS:  Thank you very much. Apologies to         our guests and to members of the audience for the late start. Council         Members had to take an oath of office, which should have been administered         to us before our very first meeting.         That has been done and we are now legal in every respect. Welcome to         this, the third meeting of the President's Council on Bioethics. We are         expecting colleagues Krauthammer and George today, and Stephen Carter         will not be with us, and Bill May will join us tomorrow.         I would like to introduce a new member of our staff, Judy Crawford,         who comes to us as the office manager. Judy, would you please rise so         that the council members can know you. We are very delighted to have Judy         with us.         We reconvene as the debate about the cloning legislation heats up around         us, a debate that we did not begin and do not control. We are in the midst         of our own careful and thorough investigation of the ethical, social,         and policy implications of human cloning seen in its larger scientific,         medical, and human contexts.         We have chosen to proceed in a deliberate, collegial, wisdom-seeking,         mode in keeping with our charge to inquire fundamentally into the human         and moral significance of developments in biomedical science and technology.         The most challenging aspect of our inquiry to date has been the moral         significance of cloning for biomedical research, a topic discussed for         the first time at our last meeting, and to which we return later today         in the hope of making progress and clarifying the contested moral issues         at stake, and in articulating the best possible moral arguments for and         again the conduct of such research.         On behalf of the council, I would like to thank the staff for its superb         work in advancing our inquiry, and on behalf of the staff, I would like         to thank council members for their thoughtful comments and responses.         We are in your debt.         The agenda for this meeting brings us into some new, but not altogether         unrelated, areas of inquiry. Stem cell research, a topic of our first         three sessions today.         Second, the question of therapy versus enhancement as a goal for the         uses of biomedical technology, and third, possible regulation of biomedical         technology. These topics have been selected with a view to initiating         one of our obligatory future projects, stem cell research, and exploring         two possible future projects for the council for the rest of our two year         charter.         As everyone knows, in his speech announcing the creation of this council,         President Bush charged us with monitoring stem cell research, embryonic         and non-embryonic, human and animal, in order to assess their progress         in gaining knowledge and beneficial therapies, and in due course to offer         guidelines and regulations for the conduct of such research.         As I indicated at our first meeting, we have begun to collect data that         will enable us to describe, assess, and compare the successes achieved         with both embryonic and non-embryonic stem cells.         As we are doing this, however, it seemed desirable for council members         to learn firsthand, and from some leading researchers in the field, about         the scientific and therapeutic promise of stem cell research present and         projected; embryonic and non-embryonic.         And it also seemed desirable to explicitly begin a disciplined conversation         about the ethical issues of embryonic stem cell research. Our first three         sessions today constitute the official thematic beginning of our project         on stem cell research.         We have of course already been deliberating about some of these matters         in our discussion of human cloning for biomedical research, a topic that         first arose for us as a crucial side question of the larger subject of         human cloning to produce children, what to think about it, and what to         do about it.         This is therefore a useful juncture at which to indicate the distinction,         as well as the connection between these two topics. Many members of the         public, including many of our elected officials who are in the process         of making policy in this area, as well as some members of the media, have         conflated the issue of stem cell research and the issue of cloning.         The issue of cloning comes first to attention as an issue of the ethics         of producing children by novel technological means, and the issue of cloning,         insofar as it has captured the public attention, is primarily about what         to think about the asexual production of new human beings who are going         to be genetically virtually identical to already existing individuals.         And the issues there are in the first instance the questions of the         ethics of, crudely speaking, baby-making. That is quite different from         the question of the ethics of embryo research.         Virtually all embryonic stem cell research now under way, both in humans         and in animals, involve cell lines developed from embryos, whether inner-cell         mass, or from the gonadal ridge of donated fetuses, that originate from         the sexual union of egg and sperm, and very often in the human case using         excess embryos produced in in vitro clinics and in all cases from material         not produced for the sake of the research. The question of Federal funding         of this research that President Bush resolved last summer, this was the         question that was resolved last summer, and the research in this area         proceeds not only with Federal funding under the guidelines that the President         established, but also in the private sector.         The two topics, however, intersect and overlap because cloning to produce         children necessarily proceeds through the production of cloned blastocysts,         which offer special opportunities for embryonic stem cell and other research.         Some proposals to curtail cloning for providing children would do so         by curtailing the initial steps, thus interfering with the possibility         of using cloned embryos for research.         And this has given rise to arguments for and against cloning for biomedical         research proper. This is where the intersection can be made explicit,         and that is where we now are.         In order for us in the other project to continue to make progress, and         therefore in order to see what value added might derive from working with         embryonic stem cells extracted from cloned blastocysts, one needs to know         something about what it would be added to. That is to say, to work on         ordinary embryonic stem cells. And in order to see more clearly what the         ethical issues are that might come from the question of producing cloned         embryos for biomedical research, it would be helpful for us to know something         of the ethical issues of experimenting on human embryos of sexual and         not clonal origin, and of using extra embryonic -- using the extra embryos         or fetuses not created for experimental purposes so we can see what different         questions arise here.         To help us with our scientific and medical education, we are very fortunate         to have as our guests and presenters this morning two distinguished researchers,         one who is a pioneer in isolating and characterizing human pluripotent         stem cells, Dr. John Gearhart, the C. Michael Armstrong Professor of Medicine         at Johns Hopkins University, and the Director of the Institute of Cell         Engineering.         And second a person who is a pioneer in work with human multipotent         adult progenitor cells, Dr. Catherine Verfaillie, a Professor of Medicine         and Director of the Stem Cell Institute at the University of Minnesota.         Each of our guests in separate sessions will make formal presentations,         roughly 30 to 35 minutes, after which time we will have a chance to ask         questions about the scientific, technological, and clinical aspects of         these areas of research.         This is our chance to learn about the wonderful prospects of these investigations.         However, let me say that because our guests are here not only as scientists,         but also as our neighbors, in a morally aspiring human community, we will         perhaps try toward the end to elicit from them their own thoughts about         the ethical issues in their own work.         But the purpose of these sessions is primarily our own education about         the scientific and medical aspects. With that I would like to turn the         meeting over to Dr. Gearhart, and to thank him very much for joining us         this morning.          DR. GEARHART:  I am certainly grateful to have         this opportunity to share with the President's Council my knowledge in         a very tiny area of biomedical research, and it is currently quite tiny,         but if you read and believe the press, it is obviously going to expand         enormously.         Much has been written and much has been said about stem cells, and it         seems every morning in the paper there is some article relating to it         and continuing the debate.         In the scientific literature, we see virtually in every issue of leading         journals a paper dealing with stem cells. An age old dream I think of         mankind or humankind has been to replace damaged or diseased tissues with         functional ones, new ones, and wouldn't it be nice to be able if you had         a damaged liver or kidney to take one off the shelf if you know what I         mean.         And this dream I think is going to become a reality, and with some of         the advances in biomedical research, and one of the ones that we are going         to talk about today, I think this will provide the starting material that         will lead to this reality.         The concept behind cell-based therapies -- and this is what we are talking         about here initially -- is a very simple one, and I think that that makes         it attractive, and it makes it understandable to the public. And that         is that if there is a tissue deficit, why not just replace the tissue.         Now, it is easy to say, and it will be difficult to do, but the concept         is an easy one.         Cell-based therapy has also been called regenerative medicine, and there         are many rubrics for this today. The power of this technology is derived         from information inherent in our genes and in our cells, and the recent         isolation of these embryonic type stem cells I believe is going to provide         the enabling material as I mentioned for this to go forward.         Stem cells are going to serve several purposes, the first of which could         be as a direct source in transplantation therapies. That means specific         cell types will be grown in culture, such as heart muscles, nerves, et         cetera, and transplanted to patients for function.         Or they will be genetically engineered to do exactly what we want them         to do and transplant it to patients; or they will be used by our tissue         engineer colleagues to construct tissues and parts of organs, which would         then be transplanted to patients.         Stem cells will also be used as a source of information, basic science,         and this is really where we are at currently. That could be applied to         a patient's own cells, such that we could remove cells from a patient         and alter them in some fashion to produce the cell types that we want,         and then transplant them.         Or ultimately I feel that what we are going to be able to do from the         information that we are going to learn on stem cells is that we will be         able to work in vitro with patient cells to get them to perform in a manner         that we want without taking them out and putting them in culture.This,         I believe, is the future. The scientific challenges to attain our goal         of producing safe and effective therapies are formidable. It will take         the efforts of many scientists and clinicians, in a variety of disciplines,         to bring this endeavor to fruition.         Now, the stem cells that I am going to talk about today interestingly         really do not exist naturally. That is, they don't exist in embryos or         fetuses. They are artifacts of culture.         But we take tissues from embryos and fetuses and they undergo a type         of transformation in culture to provide these stem cells. And this source         obviously brings with it a number of ethical concerns.         I, as an investigator, who has had to cross this bridge 9 or 10 years         ago when I began this work, believe that the ethical issues are manageable.         I also believe that it is the responsibility of scientists to candidly         and in a timely fashion present the social implications of their research         and its technological applications; to provide assessments on reliability,         and to participate in the establishment of ethical guidelines and to work         within those guidelines.         For the past 9 years at Hopkins, we have been in compliance with all         institutional, State, and Federal policies in dealing with the cells that         we work with.         It has not been easy because the landscape has changed in 9 years, and         every year there have been new concerns raised, and new issues that had         to be addressed, and I think we are keeping up with it.I should tell you         also up to this point in time that no Federal monies, no public monies,         have gone into our research effort. Now that Federal policy has changed,         we do have applications pending before the National Institutes of Health.         I also want to point out something that may be surprising to most of         you; that in our laboratory at Hopkins that we just are not concentrating         on an embryonic or fetal source of stem cells.         We are studying stem cells from adult sources, umbilical sources, et         cetera. This is the only way that we feel that you can have a scientific         advance, and that is to be able to compare and contrast the different         sources of stem cells.         So side by side, in the laboratory, in experimental paradigms, we are         using stem cells from a variety of sources, and this is what I think has         to happen to assess which of these sources are going to prove the most         effective for any specific type of therapy.         Another thing that I want to point out to you is that the work on the         human cells, I do have the questions that came from your committee in-         hand, and many of them are asking what is the status of certain types         of work.         I just want to point out that this work has been ongoing for a period         of 2-to-2-1/2 years, and although we feel that we are making progress,         we certainly are going to come up with, well, I don't know as answer to         some of your questions.         I just want to let you know that we don't have all the answers to this,         and we are very, very early in all studies of stem cells, be they from         the embryonic or adult sources.         I would tell you though that to date the work in our lab and others         on embryonic stem cells and the results of that work is certainly consistent         with the idea that this is going to prove to be a productive line of research.         Well, it is interesting that very few people know you and what you are         about, and I think it is important to point out something. My interests,         or my research interests for decades, have been in the area of developmental         genetics and development biology.         I have been labeled as a human embryologist, and my interests certainly         are in the area of how an embryo goes from a single cell to a multi-cellular         integrated organism.         And this is where our research has been in the past 25 years, and I         have carried this a step further. We are very interested in congenital         malformations and birth defects.         I have had a program project through the NIH for many, many years dealing         with Down's Syndrome, and we are very interested in trying to determine         what the mechanism is that underlies many of the unusual anatomical neurobiological         consequences of this extra chromosome in human beings.         And this is essentially how I got into this work. We wanted to have         in the laboratory a source of cells in addition that we could study at         the site or level of the impact of these extra genes.         And this obviously is a goal, along with a number of other genetic-based         diseases and malformations in the human being. So this is what led to         our getting into this area of research.         Now, I have to say up front that we are now required by our university         to reveal where our monies come from, and these are the sponsors of our         research, and there is one sitting in the middle there that I also have         to show to you that I am conflicted.         And which means that to the sponsorship of this private company, we         have received money for research, for which licenses have been negotiated         between Hopkins and Geron, and that I am a stockholder, albeit a few hundred         shares of something that is trading now at -- and I hate to think about         it.         It is not in our possession as you know. It is held in escrow. But nonetheless         we do have this arrangement with this company. So I would tell you that         this is not the motivation, this connection.         Without the sponsorship of this research, this work would not have gone         forward over the past seven years. We are not in this business as individuals         to make money.         Well, having said all of that, let's talk about stem cells. The first         thing I want to give you is a little bit of a primer on stem cells so         that we are talking the same language, and you have an understanding of         where I am coming from.         Well, what is a stem cell, and basically a stem cell is a cell that         has two properties. It has a property in that it has a capacity for self-renewal,         which means that the cell can divide and produce more cells like itself.         And it has some type or some degree of differentiative capability, which         means that it can go on to specialize into a single cell type, or it can         specialize into a number of cell types.         And in a developmental sense, if we over time at what our research has         told us about stem cells, they fall into a number of categories. Early         on in developmental practices, we have a cell that is totipotent.         It can renew, and it can form virtually every cell type that is present         in an embryo. As development proceeds, its developmental capabilities         become more restricted until we get into different lineages, specific         lineages, and its ability to divide also becomes more diminished over         time.         This has been the classical picture of development. Now, what has happened         over the past couple of years interestingly is we find that these restrictions         in developmental capability are much more plastic than we had thought.         So out here where we thought that these cells are highly restricted,         perhaps they aren't so, and when you remove them from the organism and         culture them, they have capabilities of forming other cell types, and         Catherine will be talking to you about some of these issues.         Well, we are going to be talking about embryonic stem cells, and what         is it about them. Well, interestingly, we know that these cells are capable         of producing virtually every cell type that is present in an embryo, a         fetus, or an adult, except one.         And that one happens to be the trophoblast cell, which I will tell you         about in a moment. So we consider these cells to be totipotent.         They don't have the ability in and of themselves to form an embryo or         an individual, okay? They have this other property of self-renewal, which         basically with respect to embryonic stem cells means that they will expand         indefinitely, and grow indefinitely, and this is a very important property.         It means that within the laboratory from a very few cells that you could         grow a roomful of these cells very easily. But there is an issue here         that we don't know much about, and that is obviously there is a finite         probability that at every cell division that a genetic mutation will appear.         And there was a paper published recently that indicated that indeed         this is the case, and the types of mutation, although the mutation frequency         and the mutation rate is greatly -- by several folds lower than in normal         somatic cells, mutations do occur in these cells, and they are of the         nature of making these cells susceptible to formation of tumors.         The uniparental disomy appears and it is a condition about which we         should be concerned. And up until this point, in the mouse where these         cells were first isolated, and for that work the person who did this,         Martin Evans, was awarded the Lasker Award last year.         We know that these lines forming whole animals, which is what they have         been used for up to this point, in genetic mutations is getting genetically         defined strains of mice.         That there comes a time when these cells are no longer productive in         doing this and that they lose some quality. So we know that there is going         to be a half-life to the use of these cell lines for whatever reason.         I just want to point that out, although they do have this replicative         ability. Well, where do these totipotent cells come from, and two major         sources. The first is this pre-implantation stage which we are going to         talk about, and the second are from specific cells within the fetus.         I also have on this slide, and by the way, I have given you two handouts.         One is the slides in the presentation, and another in a fairly recent         Nature review of this material, that you can refer to.         I want to point out another source of a cell that is very similar to         these two that we have isolated, and that comes as a stem cell for a specific         type of tumor called in the old days teratocarcinoma, and now called mixed         cell carcinomas.         These stem cells, referred to as embryonal carcinoma cells, were first         isolated back in the 1970s when I worked on this, and we thought that         these would be the answer to finding cells that would produce a variety         of cell types that we could work with within the human.         And I should tell you that at this point in time that there is a clinical         trial going on at the University of Pittsburgh using embryonal carcinoma         cells that have been selected for a neural lineage, and so that in culture         you can derive neural cells and that these have been placed in the brains         of 12 stroke patients.         It is a cell that is very, very similar to the two that I am going to         talk about. Well, the first source that you are aware of comes from these         structures here, which are pre-implantation stage human embryos, and I         am sure you are familiar with this.         And where that structure consists of two groups of cells; this outer         layer called trophectoderm, and an ectopically placed inner group of cells         called the inner-cell mass. It is from this group of cells here that the         embryo proper is derived, and it is connected ultimately to this outer         layer, which develops in the placental tissue by connecting stock in an         umbilical cord.         These cells may number only 15 or 20 in an embryo that may consist of         perhaps several hundred cells. And in work in the mouse, and subsequently         done in humans, first by Jamie Thomson, was that these cells were isolated,         placed in a culture condition, which then permits their growth and their         conversion into an embryonic stem cell.         This process of conversion can be highly inefficient, meaning that you         would need a large number of blastocyst and inner cell mass cells to derive         a few cell lines.         In some people's hands, it can be more efficient, but there is an issue         with that. A second source of cells with the same features was identified         in the early 1990s, first by Peter Donovan at NCI.         And what they were attempting to do were to culture long term cells         that are called primordial germ cells. These are diploid cells that are         present in an early embryo that eventually give rise to egg and sperm.         And they isolated, and this is superimposed upon a human fetus, they         isolated from the gonads, the gonadal ridges, these large cells, which         at the time of isolation in humans are about 20,000 of them present in         a gonad, and placed them in culture and essentially ended up with the         same type of cell.         This is what a human EG culture looks like, this clustering of cells         and I want to point out that there are cells in the background here which         are the so-called feeder layers.         All of these cell lines are derived on feeder layers, and all the lines         that were approved by Mr. Bush, and all the lines that we have, are derived         on a mouse feeder layer, and this is a point of contention, meaning that         we are concerned now about the fact of any endogenous viruses being transferred         from other animal tissues into the human cells.         And the FDA must deal with this at this point in time, but we do not         have permission on the use of Federal funds to derive new lines, avoiding         this issue of other animal products.         But they are grown on feeder layers. They are established and grown         on feeder layers of other species. If we compare different properties         of these cell types, and I bring this up -- some of these are of no value         to you immediately, but these are the criteria that one must use to say         whether or not you have a cell line.         It is very important, and of the 80 some lines that are now purported         to be available, I can guarantee you in talking to many investigators         from around the world that only a handful of these are bona fide cell         lines, and/or available to investigators.         Now, this may beg the point and that that may be enough to serve the         purposes in the immediate future. But really the majority, the vast majority         of so-called lines available do not meet the criteria that are now used         to say whether a line is a line.         Now, how do we -- we are very interested then in two things here. One         is the basic science aspect of this, and of course what is driving all         of this is the hope for some type of transplantation therapy.         Let's talk a minute about the basic science. What we have in the laboratory         now are cultures of cells in the plate that can form any cell type in         a human body.         Now, the argument is have we demonstrated that you can get out of these         all 200 and some cell types? No. You only find what you are looking for.         What we have found though are a large number of cell types that are         present in the human body within these dishes. The problem at the moment         is getting homogenous population of pancreatic islet cells or blood cells,         or muscle cells.         This is the real part of the scientific struggle here, and coming up         with the paradigms to say can we take a cell that can form any cell type,         and get it to form but one cell type.         And to do this we have to rely upon our knowledge coming out of molecular         embryology as to the genetics and what not involved in any type of cell         specialization.         And this is really the limiting issue at this point in time, getting         these purified populations of cells on demand. There are strategies that         are used that we do pretty good at, and we will take the initial populations         of cells, and we can change feeder layers, and we can change growth factors,         and we can put them in different types of cultures and force them then         to begin to specialize.         But they are mixed cultures, and within the same dish you are going         to find neurons and muscle, et cetera. And we must then go another step         and begin to sort out either through procedures called flow sorting based         on what is on cell surfaces to get then pure populations of hematopoietic         stem cells, muscle cells, or neuro cells.         And this works fairly well. We can get cultures of dopanergic neurons         that are 80 percent pure, and we can get cardiac muscle that is 97 percent         pure, et cetera.         But we are a long way from isolating in a homogeneous fashion the various         types of cells that we would like to get. Some of them ere doing well         at and others were not.         And it is going to require an extensive amount of research to achieve         this. Now in going to transplantation therapy -- we are going to jump         a little bit ahead here, and if we start, this could be ES.         If we start with this population, we do not transplant into anybody,         or into an animal at this point, one of the stem cells. You don't do it.         The reason that you don't do it is this.         These stem cells are capable of forming a variety of tissues, and they         will form tumors, and these tumors are these mixed germ cell tumors that         contain a variety of cell types.         They are called teratomas in the old literature. Monster. I mean, they         are contained in a mixed array, and you can see teeth, sebaceous glands,         hair, bone, parts of the gut, et cetera.         So what you have to do to make this work is you want to at least get         cells that you have treated somehow in a dish into some of these more         defined lineages that are away from this capacity to form tumors.         So that we then begin to select tissues downstream, all right? Part         of the problem, and you will read this in the literature, is how good         your selection is, is also indicated by whether or not when you take myocardiocytes         that you say, oh, these are all 100 percent myocardiocytes, you transplant         them into the wall of the heart, and you end up with a teratoma.         This happens, and we are into the central nervous system, and you end         up with a teratoma within the brain. So getting rid of those initial stem         cells are essential, and we have ways of doing this genetically, but I         just want to point out that this is an issue.         To say nothing about the fact that we do not know whether any cell downstream         here has the capacity to revert. We know very little about that at this         point in time.         So let me give you an example. There are many of these coming out in         a number of laboratories, most of them in the mouse in which lines have         been derived in different lineages, and they have been transplanted into         animals to show proof of concept, and that you can isolate a specific         cell type, and you can transplant it, and it will function within the         transplant.         I would like to give you now an example from our work at Hopkins. It         is an unpublished work, and it is now under review, but I think it is         important because it really illustrates several points that are critical         here.         We have taken our human cells and grown them under culture conditions         that would select for specific types of lineages, and whether it is neural,         or whether it is muscle, et cetera. And now we have, I believe, in our         laboratory over a hundred a hundred lines like this, of the human lines.         And in the one example that I want to present to you, which was done         with members of our department of neurology, and in collaboration with         our lab, is a model, using these cells in an animal model of the motor         neuron disease.         And in this study, these animals are treated with a virus that destroys         lower motor neutrons, so that animals become paralyzed, and they are paralyzed         because they lose the big nerve muscles that in your spinal cord hook         your muscles up to the central nervous system.         So that in a period of 10 days following the injection of the virus         into the brain, the animals become paralyzed, and we have gone to great         lengths to show that it is really the ventral roots that are involved.         You wipe out these neurons and these animals never recover. They never         recover. So what we have done is to take our human neural cells out of         this and infuse it into the spinal cords of these rats, and to look then         for the recovery of motor activity.         This is a rat out for a mid-morning stroll, and this animal is infected         with the virus, and it is a virus that really leads to an encephalomyelitis,         and within a period of 10 days the animal is paralyzed.         We can document exactly what this paralysis is about. The virus is cleared,         and shortly thereafter we will put a cannula into the lumbar region of         the animal, and infuse 300,000 cells into the cerebrospinal fluid, and         these cells will float all the way up to the hind-brain.         And then we monitor the motor activity of these animals, and within         a period of a few months, we begin to see animals that can now place their         limbs underneath them, and that can draw them up, support some weight,         and begin to push off.         And at the high end, within a several month period, we can have animals         that are now walking. And the issue is why are they walking. And what         we have learned, although it is not as you can see a normal gait, et cetera,         and we have really documented this as well, they are walking.         And why are they walking? Well, initially what we felt was this. This         is a panel showing cells within the ventral horn of those animals and         I want you to look at this cell here.         This cell, based on its marker, and based on its physical characteristics,         and molecular characteristics, is a human motor neutron cell that has         been specialized out of these neural precursor cells, that has sent an         axon out into the periphery at least two centimeters.         And we have been able to cut the sciatic nerve out on the limb of this         animal, place a dye at that site, and that dye is picked up by that axon,         and brought back to the cell body that extended the axon.         And it comes back, and this is the green stuff here, and it comes back         then into the cell body of the human motor neuron. We have gone on to         document how many human cells are present, and what they are as far as         the phenotype is concerned, to see -- you know, yes, they are forming         glia, and they are forming a variety of cell types within the ventral         horn of that animal.         Interestingly, and one of the safety issues that we find is that 50         percent of the cells don't do anything. And we are a little bit concerned         about that.         I mean, is it good to have all these cells in there that aren't doing         anything, but this is an issue that we have got to resolve. Well, it turns         out that this is only part of the answer. It turns out that the human         cells at the same time are producing growth factors that rescue and enhance         the regeneration of the animal's own cells within the ventral horn.         And so this has led us then to set up experiments to try to figure or         try to determine what growth factors it is that is causing the growth         of axons in those mice and in rats in the ventral horn, and it may be         that eventually we can use just the combination of those growth factors         to elicit this response. We don't know.         So these cells are serving in a dual capacity, which is somewhat exciting.         We have taken the human cells and we now have grafted them into monkeys.         They were in monkeys for over a year.         This was a safety study to in fact show that we are not getting tumors         formed. I think you can appreciate one of the major issues here that we         are going to be faced with, with this type of approach, is animal experiments         are of a very short duration. Mice and rats are for periods of several         months.         Monkeys we can go much longer. How much data is going to be needed to         convince the FDA that this is a safe approach, and this is something that         is being debated now within the FDA and it is a difficult issue.         But here we show human cells, and that is these blue ones that have         been in this monkey, and in this case for 180 days, but we are now out         a year, and we can show that these cells are forming specialized structures         and they are non-tumorigenic.         The next phase is to look at a graph model here that is functional.          CHAIRMAN KASS:  Can I just ask a question?          DR. GEARHART:  Sure.          CHAIRMAN KASS:  What has been injected here?          DR. GEARHART:  Oh, I'm sorry. These are the         same -- what has been injected into this monkey are the same cells that         were injected into the rat. The same cells. They were human cells --          CHAIRMAN KASS:  Neural precursors?          DR. GEARHART:  Neural precursor cells. The         same cells, the same culture cells. A major issue that we must discuss         and that we are concerned about is graft rejection. Obviously, anything         that you grow up, unless it matches the patient, is going to be subjected         to that, and now we get into an area which Dr. Kass has mentioned earlier.         But what are our options here? What are the options of being able to         grow these cells into any of these lineages and then to transplant them         and not have rejection?         Well, there is a long list, and it starts with, well, maybe what we         ought to do is derive hundreds of ES and EG cell lines, and then you would         have a best match for a patient. Not very practical.         Can we use the patients own cells, and you will hear about some of this         shortly. Should we use immunosuppressive therapies. We would like to get         away from that.         Can we use what the tissue engineers are referring to as sequestering         grafts, and what this is, is you can take grafted cells and put around         them matrices that will not permit other cells to touch them, but yet         they can produce products, or they can function in a graft.         So you are trying to hide them from the host immune cells. How effective         that is going to be, we don't know.         Can we perhaps come in and genetically modify, which is easy to do in         these cells with the histo-compatibility genes, so we can make them more         like a patient that is going to receive these cells.         Or is it possible that we may end up being able to produce cells that         may be universal donors. Again, we are trying this, and at the moment         it is speculation.         Clearly the one thing that has worked is the issue of nuclear transfer         therapy, the so-called therapeutic cloning, in which as you know the argument         is to take a cell from a patient, and fuse it to an enucleated egg, derive         a blastocyst, recover the inner cell mass, culture it out, and then these         embryonic stem cells would match the genome of the patient.         Is this a pipe dream? The answer is no, and I will give you an example         of that in a moment. To get around some of the issues with the human cloning,         embryonic cloning in humans, you have seen reports in the Wall Street         Journal and other places which I can confirm are real, in which there         are attempts now to take human cells, human nuclei, place them for example         into rabbit eggs, enucleated rabbit eggs, and grow up a blastocyst, and         generate stem cells that have human nuclei and rabbit mitochondria.         And the argument has been made here that, well, these cells would be         perfectly fine for an autograft, and this isn't accurate. We know that         mitochondria produced polypeptides that are integrated into the cell membrane,         and are actually considered to be minor histocompatibility antigens, and         will be recognized and rejected by the host from which the nucleus came         from.         So this really is not getting around the issue of the graft stuff at         all using other animals, and we are a little bit concerned about how this         is being handled.         So, let me give you an example, and one which you should read these         papers if you haven't from Rudy Jaenisch and George Daley at MIT, using         the nuclear transfer therapy, or the therapeutic cloning, to do two things.         What they did was to take a mouse that had a genetic mutation in genes         that are important as far as the immune response is concerned. And they         took cells from this mouse, took the nucleus out of the cell, and placed         that nucleus into an enucleated egg to produce a blastocyst from a cloned         embryo.         They took the inner-cell mass cells out of that, and generated embryonic         stem cells, that then are the same genome type as this animal, and then         went in and repaired genetically the mutation within those cells.         And then differentiated these cells into the hematopoietic stem cell         component, transferred them back into this animal that had the mutation,         and the transplant took, completing the whole hematopoietic system, and         in rescuing that animal.         So this is a proof of concept kind of experiment, and I urge you to         read it. It is an extremely powerful illustration, not only of the therapeutic         cloning end of things, but also the ability then to come along and correct         the genetic mutation and the reference was given to you.         Another argument has been made that we should be using perhaps just         eggs that have been stimulated to form embryos, and these are parthenotes.         And the argument here has been that we can then use these directly into         the female from which the eggs were taken. I just want to point out that         in my opinion that this is going to have very low usage.         You are going to have to recover embryos or eggs from patients, post-pubertal,         and pre-menopause. The window is going to be fairly short, I think, for         many of the therapies that you would want to effect.         And the other issue is that we don't know much about cells that are         derived this way, and how viable, and how functional they are going to         be. But this has been used or promoted also as a source, and this is an         illustration of where you take those cells.         All of this type of technology, I just want to let you know, and I know         that you are grappling with this, but even within the field of the scientists         are beginning to argue about what is an embryo and what isn't an embryo.         So any arguments that you have within your council on this, I will tell         you is also being held among biologists. I think that my own personal         feeling is that anything that you construct at this point in time that         has the properties of those structures to me is an embryo, and we should         not be changing vocabulary at this point in time. It doesn't change some         of the ethical issues involved.         What are some of the problems here, and I will summarize this a little         bit. Current research. Well, we have to come up with better ways of having         high efficiency differentiation protocols resulting in homogeneous cell         populations.         We are dealing with growth environments, and genetic manipulations,         and we are trying to define stages of cell differentiation within our         cultures.         And assessing whether or not the differentiated cells that we are getting         out are normal and completely functional. And this is in a dish.         And let me tell you that there are examples of where you can spend all         of an effort studying something in a dish, only to find that if you pop         it in an animal that it doesn't behave how you think it is going to behave.         We have a lot to learn here.         I think you can imagine that what is going on in a dish is not exactly         what is going on in a site where you transplant. The whole issue of grafting,         and how you put it in, and the safety issues, and that cells migrate away,         and they differentiate, and will they form tumors, and then the issue         of the immune response.         These are all, you know, formidable obstacles that lie ahead. I mentioned         to you that we can use cells individually, and have been used in a variety         of paradigms in our collaborators of single cells, and the tissue engineers         are now taking these different cell types and seeing if they can reconstruct         or construct organal aids or tissues to do in-grafting, and thee has been         some success with this at this point.         Finally, to me, the future is going to be that the basic science coming         out of this is the most important element, and that from that information         we are going to be able, I think, to take patient cells, where appropriate,         and I say where appropriate because if you have autoimmune disease, or         in cases where you have an injury, spinal cord injury, or stroke, or heart         attack, and you don't have time to take that patient's cells, you are         going to have to come up with different paradigms.         But I think we are going to be able to eventually coax a patient's own         cells to behave in a manner that we want to, but we are going to learn         this I think through the study of stem cells.         The last thing I will say is I know that you want to ask, well, what         is the future going to bring, and I am concerned about predicting the         future. I can't even do this on a three year NIH grant and this is what         is expected of us.         You know, what is going to happen here. I certainly think that everything         that has happened up to this point is consistent with success in this         area, and I could get into more predictions in a moment.         But we are always asked when is this going to happen, and it is going         to be I think based on specific cell types, and on, and on, and on. But         the predictive thing is very, very difficult.         Well, I thank you for your attention, and I hope that this was enough         of a primer to add more meat to your discussions. Thank you.          CHAIRMAN KASS:  Thank you very much.         (Applause.)          CHAIRMAN KASS:  We were only physically in the dark,         but we are grateful for your enlightenment, Dr. Gearhart, and the floor         is open for questions, and comment, and discussion. Don't forget that         you have to turn your microphones on to be heard. Jim, go ahead.          DR. WILSON:  Dr. Gearhart, do you foresee         that it will ever make a difference whether cells that are transferred         for human cell regeneration come from cloned eggs, or from the retrieval         from IVF eggs? Does it make a difference what the source is?          DR. GEARHART:  Well, I think in the short term         that it will. I think the only way we have around the immune rejection         story at this point is from cloned embryos.         For a patient in which you can predict ahead of time is going to need         stem cell therapy and you have the time and money available to do the         cloned approach.         I would like to think that this is going to be a transitionary period,         and that we will not have to rely upon this in the long term, and that         we will be able to take for any specific disease a stem cell, or a derivative         of a stem cell that may come from the adult source, the umbilical source,         the fetal source, or embryonic source.         I mean, whichever presents, and that we will have ways of dealing with         this graft rejection story other than through the cloning of human embryos.          DR. WILSON:  If I could just supplement         my question with a related one to which you referred. What is your current         assessment of the value of adult stem cells, as opposed to embryonic ones,         as a source of organ regeneration currently?          DR. GEARHART:  Oh, I think it is a very viable         option and I think NIH should fund it. I think that from what we see in         the work, and Catherine will present a nice overview of this, that this         is going to be a good source of stem cells.         They have some issues that they have to overcome, issues of expandability,         and plasticity, that we feel are -- that have not been demonstrated as         well as embryonic stem cells, but I think that eventually we will be able         to overcome this.         But I think part of the knowledge of overcoming it is going to be coming         from our studies of cells that have those capabilities, and being able         to transfer that information to those other cells.         So I think we are going to come up with -- I believe that in the stem         cells, cell-based therapies, that we are going to identify certain adult         sources that are going to be good for some diseases, some injuries, and         embryonic sources for others.         So I think we are going to mutually proceed on this and benefit from         it.          CHAIRMAN KASS:  Please, Elizabeth.          DR. BLACKBURN:  Dr. Gearhart, you can         give us I think a unique perspective on the comparison between adult,         and embryonic, and fetal stem cells.         And in particular many of us read the recent papers, the scientific         peer-reviewed papers that came out with respect to the adult stem cells,         and the interpretation of their plasticity being cast in some considerable         doubt by the observation that there was cellular fusion of those cells         which had led to in these particular cases examined a mistake in interpretation         of their plasticity.         And I wondered if you could give us your perspective on that aspect,         which extends Jim's question somewhat.          DR. GEARHART:  I will do so in the face of         Catherine sitting back here, who is --          DR. BLACKBURN:  Yes, I am going to ask         her, of course, about this, too.          DR. GEARHART:  -- actually done those experiments.         Clearly the most difficult experiments that we have had to address and         interpret are those utilizing adult stem cells that have been placed into         the blastocyst of mice to create chimeras.         And in those chimeras, we see that the descendants of those adult cells         gave rise to many, many lineages within the embryo, and this was really         the issue. How did we explain this.         And from the studies of Austin Smith and others that you are referring         to, the implication was that when those cells were transplanted into that         blastocyst to generate the chimeras, that a subset of these cells fused         with the hosts own cells and it was those fusion products then that gave         rise to the variety of lineages.         At the moment that is an implication, and that has not been demonstrated         in the embryo. It has been demonstrated in the dish that they had that         capacity.         So we are now waiting and putting pressure on Catherine, and Freizen,         and others to look into those animals to see if they can recover those         specialized cells that were derived from or that had the adult phenotype         if you know what I mean, the marker, to say are you truly of the adult         stem cell lineage, or do you have other markers present, other chromosomes         present, that come from host cells.         So until we see that data -- you know, I will wait. That is something         that can be looked at scientifically, and that is as far as I would go         with you, Elizabeth, at this point.         It is an interesting observation, and we will see if it actually is         the answer.          DR. BLACKBURN:  And just to extend on         what you said, I think what it does now do is to demand that the onus         be put on the researcher to show that there has been a plasticity or transdifferentiation,         and there are other set of criteria, which would be karyotype and multiple         micro-satellite, polymorphisms -- sorry to get overly technical -- and         other genetic markers.         There are clearly tools in hand, and so it seems as if every experiment         can in fact be subjected to those sets of analyses now.          DR. GEARHART:  Right.          DR. BLACKBURN:  And will need to be before         we can get a good view of this.          DR. GEARHART:  Right.          CHAIRMAN KASS:  Rebecca.          PROF. DRESSER:  I have four questions,         and maybe if I say them all it will be possible to answer some of them         together. One, I was wondering if the rats are being given immunosuppressants         in this study.         And then you said a problem with the rabbit eggs is that the mitochondrial         DNA might cause rejection, and so I wondered if that would happen with         a cloned human embryo as well if the egg came from another person, and         if you are trying to do a therapy that is compatible with a patient.         And let's see. The feeder layers, I was wondering if they have available         feeder layers that do not come from animals or what the state of that         development is.         And then finally what about the fact that if you are creating a blastocyst         from a patient's cell, and if the patient, let's say, has cancer or some         condition that could be related to genetics, would the stem cells somehow         perhaps be risky?          DR. GEARHART:  There is no question in my mind         that the possibility exists that if you are doing an egg donor, and nuclear         transfer into an egg, that there possibly exists that that cell -- that         the embryonic stem cells derived from that could be rejected. Absolutely.         Now, how do you test this? I mean, where do you test it. This almost         comes under the same criteria that I have for anyone coming to -- if I         was on an IRB and they wanted to clone a human reproductivity, what data         do you present before you permit it to go.         To me, it is one of these things where you need perfection before experimentation,         or without experimentation, which is something in science is anathema.          PROF. DRESSER:  Well, you could test that         in an animal, right? I mean, you could at least see --          DR. GEARHART:  Well, you can, and we could         set it up in an animal, but the issue is -- I mean, where you are very         defined and to demonstrate it by doing it into a different strain of mouse.         There is no question about it.         But whether or not that would carry over in polymorphisms that exist         in human, again you are still faced with human versus rodent.         The feeder layer issue. It is one that is being taken on, and there         is no banning of this type of work with private money, and clearly there         are a number of investigators, laboratories, working on establishing feeder         layers from human tissue that could be used, and I think that this is         very important.         So those studies are certainly under way. We have used a variety of         different human tissues as well to look at in our studies. Oh, the very         first question that you asked. I'm sorry, it was again?          PROF. DRESSER:  For the rats --          DR. GEARHART:  Oh, sorry. We did animals that         were immunosuppressed and animals that were not immunosuppressed. And         we did not find a great deal of difference in the short term, although         -- I mean, as far as any type of destruction of cells and things like         that, although clearly in the animals that were not immunosuppressed that         you could see reactive cells present.         So clearly in the monkeys immunosuppressed, absolutely, and so we have         done them both. And then the blastocyst question?          PROF. DRESSER:  If it comes from a patient         with a particular disease.          DR. GEARHART:  Yes. Clearly where there is         a genetic basis of any type of a disease, you would be concerned about         reintroducing the same cells that were subjected to whatever the disease         process was.         And I think that this carries over also into, for example, the diabetes         work, where if you have an attack on insulin itself, you know, is this         going to be a viable alternative, and there are some evidence now that         you can alter the insulin molecule to make it not recognized by some of         the autoimmune antibodies.         I should say that there are a number of laboratories -- and this is         one area that is being emphasized in the use of human cells, including         our own, with Mike Shamblott, where we have lines that are -- human lines         that are insulin producing that you can pop them into animals, and demonstrate         that they can produce human insulin.         And we are very encouraged by some of these early results. But I would         still contend that we have a long way to go to carry that into some type         of clinical application. We have a lot of questions to answer.          CHAIRMAN KASS:  Janet.          DR. ROWLEY:  Well, I, too, have multiple questions         and I want to thank you for a very lucid presentation. That helps a great         deal. I would like to first -- and I think I will do these one at a time.         It is a substantial question as to what value the embryos that are left         over from IVF can play in this whole process as compared with embryos         that you develop for either a particular purpose, or just straight off.         And my understanding was that maybe some of the embryos were sufficiently         mature so that maybe the cells derived from IVF would not be useful in         developing, say, cells lines or things. And I would like your comments.          DR. GEARHART:  One of my hats at Hopkins when         I moved there in the late '70s was to develop the IVF program. So we are         very well tuned into the issues of IVF, and clearly in an IVF procedure         the best embryos obtained are those that are used first in first transfers.         So that generally those that are left over are of the ones -- we don't         want to call it a lesser quality, but at least as far as our eye is concerned,         and how we judge grades of embryos, based mainly on morphology to be honest,         and more currently we are looking at biochemical parameters that we can         measure in the media in which these cells are growing that something has         been secreted to have some kind of a measure.         And that clearly those that are the spare embryos generally are those         of -- let's say, what we deem, and knowing what that means, of lesser         quality.         So what does that mean? In most cases, they have not developed far enough         along, which means that if they are left over that you take them back         out of the freezer, and you try in your culture conditions to get them         up to this blastocyst point.         If you can't get them to a blastocyst stage, you can't derive the cells.         If there is no inner cell mass, you can't do it. And you find that you         are compromised there, and that generally these are not very good embryos.         So one could argue that overall that you would expect to have a low         efficiency yield with respect to taking in embryo and deriving a line         from spare embryos in an IVF program. That is in general.          DR. ROWLEY:  Okay. You mentioned modifying         the histocompatibility locus, and I would have thought that there is still         so much that we don't know about the MAC that that would -- I mean, obviously         anything can be done in the future with time, but do you look on this         as practical?          DR. GEARHART:  Well, back in the ancient days,         in the early '80s it seems in this field, Oliver Smithies and others did         do knockouts of Class I and Class II genes, in an effort to determine         whether or not this could prolong grafts into animals without those.         And that depending on the tissue or the organ, there was evidence that         this indeed could be the case, and not that it was an indeterminate thing,         but just by days, or weeks, or months, that this was the case.         What they didn't know about at that time were NK killer cells, and those         kinds of things, and the importance of other determinants which must be         on cells. They wiped everything out.         So some labs are now taking a look at this to see if it is possible         then to rebuild back some of these markets. But it is a matter of speculation         at this point whether or not this could occur.         Now, what we can talk about I think is it possible to take using the         act of transgenesis and things like this, where we could move big pieces         of DNA; of taking part of a patient's chromosome-6, you know, and cloning         that into a stem cell after knocking out some of it, and we may get some         degree closer.         But that says nothing about the myriad of other loci that could be involved         as minor histocompatibility problems. So, some of it is speculation, but         I think it is also testable at this point in time.          DR. ROWLEY:  And my last question is coming         back to the 80 plus cell lines, and you raised concerns, which many of         us have, as to how useful some of those are going to be.          DR. GEARHART:  Right.          DR. ROWLEY:  Could you expand a little bit,         in terms of whether you think they are really not going to be long term         cell lines, and that is your concern, or whether there are other aspects.          DR. GEARHART:  Well, I have many concerns,         and I hope that I can get them all in. I mean, look, we were all thrilled         when Mr. Bush made the decision to move forward with this and establish         cell lines to permit the work to go forward. There is no question about         it.         But as we looked into -- and by looking into, it was a practical matter.         Many investigators around the world, and I have close contacts with colleagues         in Germany, and in France, and in England, and Japan, and Australia, and         on and on, as we compare notes all the time on our results of research,         as well as on practical things like this, and on political issues.         I mean, there is no question that we have to keep abreast, and what         happened, particularly from the German investigators, which is significant,         as you know, in Germany, they are not permitted to derive cell lines.         And for a while they were not permitted to use those that were even         derived, and recently their parliament voted to permit the use of existing         cell lines as of January 2002.         But what happened was that when these investigators set about to import         cell lines, and contacted the registry list at the NIH, which continues         to grow each day, and more lines are added to it as you know, it turned         out that many of the lines were not defined.         Someone just reported that they had a clump of cells growing in a dish,         and they didn't have any of these parameters or very few of them done.         And this reduced the list substantially, quite substantially, down to         -- we are talking about, say, a dozen. And then the issue came up as to,         well, are these -- can they be imported without a stringent material transfer         agreement, and with a reach through clause that would say that anything         that you would do with those lines belongs to the person giving you the         line.         And this reduced the line substantially. And then other lines are not         available because if you needed to get them, you needed NIH funding, and         only NIH funding. You could not use private funding with them, and on         and on.         And so it drastically reduced down the number of lines that are practically         available. Now, whether or not this will have a major impact, clearly         the NIH is receiving grants, and we have been reviewing grants, and using         the existing approved lines, the few that one can get.         And the work will go forward, and whether or not that will be sufficient,         and we recognize that there is going to be a half-life to these lines         for various reasons, and that there will come a time if it proves effective         in the basic science part of this to move forward, that we should be looking         at being able to generate new lines.         And the issue of the feeder cells is a major issue as well, and to begin         to establish lines on human cells so that we are not faced with that anything         that we derive from this now, and it is important to consider, has to         be considered as a xenograft.         Although it is a human line, the FDA requires that if it has seen these         other products, it has to be considered a xenograft, which sets up a whole         new set of criteria for moving this into the clinical applications.         So I think there are reasons why we should eventually be permitted to         derive new lines. Well, I'm sorry. We can do it now on private money,         but anything that is derived cannot receive Federal money for support.          CHAIRMAN KASS:  There are people waiting in line,         but can I get a clarification on this question that came up in your answer         to Janet about the durability and longevity of the lines, and on the one         hand, one says that the embryonic stem cell lines, their great virtue         is that they can be self-renewed indefinitely.         On the other hand, they have a half-life, perhaps because of accumulated         mutations. Could you say a little more? I mean, some people claim these         are eternal lines.          DR. GEARHART:  Right.          CHAIRMAN KASS:  And could you say something about         the possible differences between human and mouse with respect to renewability,         because I think it is an important factor.          DR. GEARHART:  Well, the issue is maybe they         are eternal, but can you still use them. They can still divide indefinitely,         but they may not --          CHAIRMAN KASS:  But they are no longer the same.          DR. GEARHART:  Yes, they are no longer the         same, and they may not give you the biologic properties that you need.         Strangely enough, Leon, there have been very few publications up to this         point, and up to this point there is one that I can cite for you, and         I have it in answer to some of your questions by Joe Stanbrook at -- Peter         Stanbrook, at the University of Cincinnati, in which he looked -- these         were mouse lines.         And he looked at the frequency and rate of mutation within several mouse         lines, and contrasted those with several schematic cell lines that were         in the lab as well.         And he found that indeed the mutation rates -- and what you do is you         pick certain genes to look at changes, and to look at chromosome lost         or gain.         This paper was published in PNAS in the March 19th issue for those who         are interested, and what he found was that the frequency and rates of         mutation were orders of magnitude less in the embryonic stem cell line         than in the schematic cell line.         And you are looking at a rate of generally 10 to the minus 6 frequency         within any mammalian cell as it is divided. But what he did find, and         that was a bit troublesome, was that the type of mutation that appeared         in the embryonic stem cell one led to what is called uniparental disomy,         which is a situation where you end up with homozygosity across a region,         or across chromosomes or regions of chromosomes, that gets rid of really         the dominant tumor suppressor genes, which then raises the issue that         these cells may be more susceptible to tumorigenesis than others.         Now, that is the only report, and I will tell you that in several laboratories         what is being done now with the human lines, and that is using express         sequence tags, for example, and you can use 10,000 of them, they are looking         at mutation rates at 10,000 loci, if you know what I mean, over time in         culture passage, after passage, after passage.         So we will get information on this parameter, and how significant it         is going to be, I don't know, but one would predict that clearly there         is going to be an accumulation of mutations within these cells.          CHAIRMAN KASS:  Okay. Thank you. I have Michael         -- well, also, was that on this point?          DR. BLACKBURN:  Just a very brief clarification.         Did the absolute frequency of uniparental disomy go up? Was it an absolute         frequency increase, or simply did it relatively increase as you looked         at the whole spectrum of mutations in the mouse embryonic stem cells?         Do you see the difference that I am trying to get at?          DR. GEARHART:  Yes.          DR. BLACKBURN:  That if it were an absolute         increase, that is a reason for concern, much more than if it were simply         a relative increase in a number that has already gone down by --          DR. GEARHART:  These numbers are rates, and         so I believe it is an actual number. In other words, it was a real --          DR. BLACKBURN:  An absolute increase?          DR. GEARHART:   Yes, an absolute increase.          DR. BLACKBURN:  So I just wanted to make         sure that I understood the numbers here.          CHAIRMAN KASS:  Michael Sandel, and then Frank.          PROF. SANDEL:  I would like to go back         to the adult stem cell versus embryonic stem cell question, and ask it         in a slightly different, and maybe more pointed, form.         As you know, there are some people who regard embryonic stem cell research         as morally objectionable. I am not asking you or trying to drag you into         that debate. But I would like to know your view on the following scientific         question.         If adult stem cell research in the best case scenario redeems its promise,         what would we lose medically and scientifically if we ban embryonic stem         cell research, or imposed a moratorium on it for a period of time, until         we could assess what adult stem cell research could achieve?          DR. GEARHART:  I personally think it would         be a tragedy, and for the following reason, if this was to happen. I think         the length of time that it is going to take to assess whether the adult         stem cell avenue is going to provide the potential therapies that we are         thinking about, is going to be years.         And I think for us to deny at this point any avenue that has the potential         of the embryonic stem cell story is a tragedy to those people who need         or who will need these cures.         And I think that it is a time element. If this could be done in a year,         I would maybe listen to that argument. But it is going to take years to         really assess any of these approaches.         And I really think they should move forward together. I think we are         going to learn in both directions how to utilize information coming out         of these studies that would benefit, for example, or enable us to understand         more about the adult sources if this is going to be the emphasis, and         to really make them effective in their use.         So I think that it wouldn't be wise to put a ban on the embryonic source         at this point, and wait until another avenue is assessed. The length of         time is going to be too long.          PROF. SANDEL:   Can you be more specific?         Are there certain types of research avenues that you would associate more         with embryonic stem cell research, as against adult stem cell research?         Is it likely that success is in particular areas, or is it just that         you feel that as a general matter it is better to have more avenues rather         than fewer?          DR. GEARHART:  Well, I think that one of the         messages that I hope that I can get across, and maybe Catherine will,         too, is that we are in very early stages in all of stem cell research,         no matter what the origin of the cells are.         And to make a judgment as to which of these is already more advanced         than the other, it would be a tenuous one at this point, because you have         got to remember that there are very few investigators actually working         on embryonic stem cells at this point.         The list on the adult side obviously is larger. I mean, as far as investigators         are concerned. And I don't think that any of us are really showing dramatic         -- you know, utilization in the sense that we can say we are going to         go to any clinical use of this.         It is going to take years for this to occur. We are in the very early         stages and so I would be really hesitant to say that anything is demonstrating         anything better.         All I would say about embryonic stem cells at this point in a very positive         way is that we know that at this point that out of these cells we can         virtually generate any cell type we want in dish and in large numbers.         That is the advantage of this approach. Now, whether this will be surmounted         by other discoveries in adult stem cells to do the same kinds of things,         I don't want to predict. I hope that it happens.         You know, our -- and I also want to emphasize that we -- and although         we are associated with the embryonic form, we are studying other forms         as well. We are not foolish.         As a scientist, you know, you are not going to put all your eggs in         one basket here. And so we are trying to move forward on a broad front,         and I think that this would be the more rational way to proceed in this         arena          CHAIRMAN KASS:  Frank.          PROF. FUKUYAMA:  Dr. Gearhart, did I understand         you correctly that in the experiment that you headed up with the mouse         that it lost the motor function in its rear legs, that you were injecting         human stem cells?          DR. GEARHART:   Yes. Well, if I could correct         you a moment. It was a rat, first of all.          PROF. FUKUYAMA:  Okay. A rat.          DR. GEARHART:  Rat, too, but the issue is please         don't say that you are injecting stem cells. These are derivatives of         stem cells. I mean, just so that we know, but they are out of the stem         cell line, okay?          PROF. FUKUYAMA:  Okay. Fine. But what was         the resulting tissue? It was a mixture then of rat and human neurons,         or do you think it was simply the stimulation of these other factors that         was causing the rat neurons?          DR. GEARHART:   Right. That is a good question.         We still don't know -- I mean, to be honest with you -- what the mechanism         of recovery here is. We know that sitting in the ventral horns of these         animals, and where these big neutrons reside, you now have a mosaic population         of host cells, of neurons, inner-neutrons.         I mean, we all -- I mean, human and rat, or human and mouse, depending         on which one we did. We don't know the relative contributions. We can         count cells, but really what is the functional basis of what occurred         there.         We know that the human cells are also rescuing the other, but to what         degree. This is where the hard work comes in. What was the mechanism,         and what really went on or is going on in that ventral horn.         I can tell you in work that John McDonald has done at Wash U, in which         they generate a contusion injury in the spinal cord of a mouse or a rat,         and then infuse in mouse embryonic stem cell derivatives, and that he         is faced with the same issue. He can see that these animals recover to         a certain degree, but the mechanism of what is it, of what has really         occurred there, is not known.         And I think what we are going to find is a demand that we come up with         mechanism in some of these animal models so that we can completely understand         what that therapy is going to be if you take it to a human.         And this is going to require a lot of work. Now, some of it you could         argue is that you could do it all within animal studies. You know, mouse         embryonic stem cells, and you don't have to put the human in.         But I think we are finding enough differences between species that it         would warrant at least the study also of the human derived cells in the         same paradigms to ask those questions.          PROF. FUKUYAMA:   But I am just curious.         Are you getting actual tissues in which you have cells from different         species that are growing simultaneously?          DR. GEARHART:  Oh, yes, absolutely. Yes, sitting         in the same -- well, you can see in the section here that might be 15         or 20 microns across, you see a mixture of the rat cells or mouse cells,         and human cells, functioning.         You know -- I mean, this isn't uncommon. We do interspecific grafts         a lot in experimental things, and the question is when you do it, and         we see, you know, human cells growing in animals very nicely. I mean,         as long as there is immunosuppression and things like this occurring.          PROF. FUKUYAMA:  But could you go the other         way, also injecting stem cells from other species into human beings?          DR. GEARHART:  Oh, yes. I mean, this is one         of the issues with xenografts. You know, is this something -- well, there         is a report recently about chicken embryonic stem cells, and the fact         that people who had derived these were promoting the use in humans.         Pig stem cells, you know, et cetera, and so it can be done, but a couple         of issues, and one of them is the issue of the xenograft itself, of bringing         in endogenous viruses, and is this a wise thing to do.         And the other thing that I would ask you, and I won't be flippant about         it, is to say that if you -- and one of the concerns that we have that         maybe this council and others would take up, is long term in a neurologic         sense.         If you are putting stem cells in, and you are putting them in between         different human beings, what are you doing to that individual. And I would         say to you that if you have a stroke, and someone comes along and says,         well, we have pig, cow, mouse, human, take your pick, what would you select.         I am not being flippant about it, but I am just saying that I think         that we know that human would be preferable at this point in time.          CHAIRMAN KASS:  Could I ask a question, and just         for clarification again also on your own experiment that you showed us.         You said that some of the rats were immunosuppressed and some were not.         Is that correct?          DR. GEARHART:  Yes.          CHAIRMAN KASS:  And were there functional differences         in the results between those two groups, and would that bear upon the         question of whether or not the major effect was owing to the action of         the human cells, or a stipulation of the endogenous cells?         And lastly, if these animals had come to post-mortem was there a difference?         Was there rejection in the non-immunosuppressed animals of the human cells?          DR. GEARHART:  It is important to keep in mind         the time frame that these experiments are done in. They are of very short         duration relatively speaking, in a period of several months maximum.         In experiments that have been done in our laboratory, principally by         Mike Shamblott, in taking human cells and grafting, and these are insulin-producing         cells, and we have done it in a variety of tissues into rodents, you always         see reactive cells, which means that you are eliciting an immune response.         Again, they are short term, and whether you are getting destruction,         we see cellular debris, and we see this kind of stuff at these sites.         I should tell you a little bit that may be enlightening.         When you do grafts like this, if we say we are putting in 300,000 cells         or we are microinjecting in a lot of these cells, many of these cells         will die at the time of injection, simply because you have taken them         out of one environment and you put them into another, and you see a tremendous         amount of cell death.         Very few of these populations of cells continue to divide. In other         words, it may undergo one more round of division, and they sit there.         You do see when you come in finally to look at where is the human versus         where is the rodent, and you use your human markers. You invariably find         a group of cells that you can't phenotype, if you know what I mean, and         to say what has happened here, and clearly there are cells being destroyed.          CHAIRMAN KASS:  Fused?          DR. GEARHART:  Well, we don't know that. And         one of the arguments for many years has been that the central nervous         system is an immune privileged site. I don't think anymore that this is         something that is believed or subscribed to, and if you have the option         of immunosuppression, or of getting around that, that that would be preferred.         And particularly when you are talking about a graft going into a human         being that may be there for 20 years, as opposed to a matter of a few         months. So I think that this is going to remain a major issue, and there         is no question about it.          CHAIRMAN KASS:  Thank you very much. Bill Hurlbut         and then Paul McHugh          DR. HURLBUT:  John, I hear you saying that         we should pursue all lines of research, but I want to weigh the different         options here and pursue the question of if the lines were restricted what         would be gained or lost.         Specifically, I have several questions that hinge each on the other.         First of all, the cells that were implanted or tested for their tumorigenicity         effect that you spoke of in your paper were the so-called EBDs.         Were those derived only from embryonic germ cells; is that what is implied         there?          DR. GEARHART:  Yes. In our paper, we took the         stem cell itself and plated it out in a variety of culture conditions,         some of which are designed to enhance or select for certain types of differentiation.         And we referred to these as embryoid body-derived cells. They came out         of this little cluster, and in our field it is essential that we take         the stem cell off the dish, and let it form into a little ball, and which         is just a multi-cellular structure, called an embryoid body.         Now, this was an unfortunate name that was given to it by a French pathologist         back in the '30s, but as you can imagine, when someone in a political         sense talks about an embryoid body, they conjure up embryos here.         But these are little clusters of cells, and within those or within that         cluster, the beginning of differentiation begins. These cell-cell interactions         are essential for this. We have not been able to mimic this in a sheep         yet.         So what happens is you get within that ball a variety of cell types         being formed, and all that you want to do is to disassociate that ball         after a period of time, and select out only those that are going in the         direction that you want them to go in.         So this is what we did in that experiment, and so we have now these         EBD lines, and in these lines, in these human lines, and these lines have         been placed in a large number of animals, in the grafts that we have used,         we have never seen a tumor up to this point.         And it may be unique to humans, because human primary cultures are easy         to establish and mouse aren't. I mean, there is an issue here that we         don't know that you can't do the same experiment in the mouse.         So with our experience with the EBDs, we have never seen a tumor. Our         experience in the mouse and using what we thought were equivalent lines,         we have seen too many tumors with respect to grafts into the central nervous         system.          DR. HURLBUT:  Just parenthetically haven't         I been reading all along that embryoid bodies are also formed from ES         cells?          DR. GEARHART:  Oh, yes, absolutely.          DR. HURLBUT:  But the point is that your particular         lines don't produce tumors, and the ones derived from the primordial germ         cells don't seem to produce tumors; whereas, the embryonic stem cell lines         do?          DR. GEARHART:  Well, the only comparison that         we have at this point are mouse ES lines, in which we have derived different         types of precursors under different conditions, have been compared to         human EG lines that have been derived, or which precursors have been derived         in a slightly different manner.         You can't derive them both in the same way. We have seen nothing up         to this point on human ES derived lines transplanted. We just have not         seen any data on that.         So I don't want to make it clear that there is a difference between         the derivation either from a germ cell derived, or an inner-cell mass         derived line. Does that make sense? That comparison is not there yet.          DR. HURLBUT:  Well, obviously what I have been         getting at here is if in fact your cell lines are less likely to cause         tumors, then does that imply that there might be some advantage to using         your cell lines, and if so, would it in fact be the greatest advantage         if a patient's own cell line could be derived from primordial germ cells?          DR. GEARHART:  Oh, boy, this committee would         -- well, wow. Now, think what this means. It means that you would be generating         an embryo, and having it implanted. Now, what you don't know is that our         fetal tissue comes from 5-to-9 weeks post-fertilization. These are therapeutic         abortions.         And which means now that you are way beyond -- I mean, the point of         where a blastocyst is, and obviously way beyond I think anyone subscribing         to that approach.          DR. HURLBUT:  You told us that in your paper.          DR. GEARHART:  Okay.          DR. HURLBUT:  But is it true that maybe there         would be some great advantage if we could find a legitimate way to harvest         tissues generated from a specific patient at a later date?          DR. GEARHART:  Right. Well, I think it would         be terribly risky. We have been asked this question a lot though; is it         possible to do a biopsy on a developing embryo, and to remove just a few         germ cells.         I think at the stage that we are using these embryos are a matter of         -- or fetuses are a matter of maybe 6 or 7 millimeters in length, and         to do the surgery on this I think would just be impossible without causing         harm.         The other issue that I would contend is do you think it would be okay         to go in and remove the germ cells from an embryo and let that individual         go on and say, well, we have taken your germ cells. Now, we have another         therapy for you.         And so I don't think it is a very good thing to do.          DR. HURLBUT:  And that is my final point, and         I wanted to ask you personally in working with these cells, do you see         14 days as some kind of magic marker moment?         Do you see something crucial about implantation? And you spoke of keeping         all options open.          DR. GEARHART:  Right.          DR. HURLBUT:  Why in fact do we allow abortion         fairly late in term, and yet now we are speaking as 14 days as the sacred         moment? I know that I am opening a very difficult issue here.         But in fact wouldn't we gain a lot scientifically from extending that         14 day limit potentially if we could find a culture median that could         sustain the embryo, or wouldn't we gain a lot from implanting, even gestating         and harvesting?         And why do we feel that we shouldn't do those things? And I would also         be interested in your personal response to these ethical issues.          DR. GEARHART:  Wow, you have asked a lot. As         you know, stem cells have been obtained from many stages of human fetal         development, and have been found to be useful in generating various cell         types in culture.         And if we look at a variety of studies, you can find it in the published         literature. We have had a number of requests for fetal tissue at different         stages, and I think legitimate requests of investigators willing to investigate         cell lineages, et cetera, within the embryo.         So people have been thinking about it. I mean, there is no question         about that. We have found it difficult enough to be fortunate enough to         obtain the fetal tissue that we work with.         I mean, there is a consenting process and we have nothing really to         do with other than to make sure that it complies with institutional, Federal,         and State law.         To obtain viable tissue from abortuses of any kind is a major concern.         When we started our studies, we looked into using spontaneously aborted         material, which occurs across the board, but mainly in the early stages.         And we thought that this would be a good source. As it turned out, by         the time that we were notified -- and this occurs in outlying hospitals,         and not at major medical centers, where investigators are -- you know,         a patient presents with a miscarriage, and it is taken care of in the         ER.         And it turned out that it was very ineffective, number one. And, number         two, and then I will get back to your question, we found that most of         the material that did come to us had chromosomal abnormalities that made         it less desirable for use.         Now, the issue of the 14 days, and what does it mean. Well, this was         something that really came into play in the United Kingdom when they were         trying to deal with this issue.         And it was decided at that point that at that stage the embryo still         does not have a central nervous system. It can feel no pain, et cetera.         And this was why basically that period of time was set to be able to grow         them in culture, or to remove tissue.         We, as embryologists, argue the point all the time as to what is going         on in these early stages, and we were always asked these questions. When         do you believe personhood occurs and when is it established, and things         like this.         To me that is not a biologic question. We don't have a means of probing         that. So I think that is why the 14 days was selected, and that's why         it is sort of adhered to in a sense.         Do I adhere to that? Well, to a certain degree, no. We take material         that is later on, and it is cadaveric fetal tissue. I think that we should         be able to utilize any tissue that comes out of abortion if the alternative         is that it is just going to be disposed of, which is what happens.         The pathologist takes a look at it to make sure that all of the parts         are accounted for, and there is an issue about being concerned about what         is left in the uterus.         That is my personal opinion on that. But I don't think that we should         be going and establishing pregnancies, and to downstream then utilize         that tissue.         I mean, to then stop the pregnancy and then to recover it. I mean, that         is my personal opinion. I don't think we should be doing that. As you         know, years ago, President Reagan was faced with this, I believe, when         he heard that families were establishing pregnancies so that regions of         the brain could be harvested to treat Parkinson's disease in the family.         And clearly we don't subscribe to that in any fashion.          CHAIRMAN KASS:  Thank you. We are coming up to the         break and I have Paul McHugh, Mike Gazzaniga, and we are running a little         late because we started a little late. We will take a break shortly. Paul         and then Mike.          DR. MCHUGH:  My point is very brief, John,         because you have touched upon it in several places. But first of all,         I want to thank you very much for that coherent presentation, and I especially         thank you for showing us experimental data.         And that is what of course generates better questions to ask you. And         it is really out of that experimental work that I did have a question.         And that is what you showed us was fundamentally a xenograftic experiment         using human tissue, human cells, in rats.         And the results were very interesting, and not only was there growth         of cells, but you told us that there were trophic factors that were probably         acting in this way.         And I then wondered, and you can answer this, why was it necessary to         use human cells to demonstrate this phenomenon in a rat, and why weren't         you using rat cells to do rat experiments.         And if that is true, that you could do rat cells to do rat things and         the like, the development of the question is would it not be wise of us         to ask you all to go back and work with your rats and your mice, and your         cats and your sheep, and keep going at it, and come back and tell us why         you need human stuff to do this stuff, okay?          DR. GEARHART:  Okay. We did it first with mouse         cells. We don't have rat embryonic stem cells. We did it first with the         mouse and it worked.         And in our exuberance, saying, well, would the human cells work, and         they did. There is no question that I think that the mouse cells worked         better, and the mouse cells were from these neural precursors that we         had obtained that I had mentioned that we had this concern about tumors.         But they did work, and so the only two cell types that we have found         at this point that work have very similar origins if you know what I mean.         Clearly the paradigm has to be extended to other sources of stem cells,         adult and umbilical, and this is planned to say in this particular paradigm         will it work.         So, Paul, the answer is that we did it first with the rodent cells,         and we could pursue that. I mean, as far as looking for the growth factors         and what not.         But we have changed almost completely to the human cells for trying         to determine what those growth factors were that were secreted, but we         could do that again with the mouse, absolutely.          CHAIRMAN KASS:  Mike.          DR. GAZZANIGA:  Just briefly, thank you again         for a wonderful presentation. This moves to another level, and that is         how big is the American biomedical engine.         And I ask that from the sense of having just taken a trip to China and         Japan, and England, and you read that Sweden and Singapore, and India,         and so forth, are going ahead.         If America dropped out of this for legal reasons that are on the horizon,         how big an impact would that have on the overall resolution and development         of these therapies?         In other words, if you just look across molecular genetics and microbiology         now, and prior to this issue arising, what is the size and importance         of the American effort?          DR. GEARHART:  Well, I don't think that there         is any question that the investigators funded through the National Institutes         of Health, and our academic establishments here, are the engine that drives         biologic research, biomedical research, in the world.         There is no question about it. I mean, the volume, the sheer volume         of this, is enormous. And if you look at this compared to even in our         country to what the biomedical industry, or I mean the private industry         is putting into this, it is dwarfed by the Federal funding.         And this is really what is enabling and this is why I think the U.S.         has been so far ahead. So it is essential I think to have Federal funding         into this area really to reach our goals as quickly as possible.         There is one last thing or one thing that I would like to say to the         committee, and it is understandable, but when you are in and start in         a business like this, you don't know the impact of it.         The thousands of communications that we have received from patients,         and patient-based groups, about our work and about moving the work along,         not only is it emotional, it is unbelievable. I mean, from the standpoint         of just pure numbers, sheer numbers.         It doesn't just extend within the United States, but throughout the         world. In 1998 when we published our paper, within a few days we had 10,000         e-mails alone about it.         And every day I still get hundreds of e-mails relating to this. It extends         not only to bona fide -- you know, many people don't understand what this         work is about.         They are contacting you for a brain, or a uterus, or from some countries         we have had requests, hundreds of requests for penises, for example. And         you are trying to figure out why -- you know, what is the issue here.         We need education and we need informing to say that we are dealing really         with cells and tissues at this point. That is what we are really about.         It is going to be years away before it goes beyond that.         And so what I am trying to say is that there are requests throughout         the world. So that is one issue. I mean, the pressure is enormous, and         also people offering you large sums of money to provide them with cells         outside of the arena that it should be done in. Do you know what I mean?         There is desperation, and you see this, and it is tragic, and as a researcher         this is new to you. This is something that you are not accustomed to and         never will be accustomed to handling.         So I just wanted to let you know what that pressure is like. It is enormous.         I have boxes full of these things. I don't know what I am going to do         with them, but you try to respond.         There has been an issue with brain drain. We know that there has been         one investigator from the University of California system that went to         the U.K. and received one-and-a-half million pounds to pursue this work         in the U.K.         Well, this happened here. I will tell you that -- and I am talking to         students in our own group, you know, go to Europe for your post-doc, and         go to England for your post-doc if you want to continue in this thing.         And I think you will see more of this, and whether major investigators         will leave, I don't think so. I think we will get through this, and I         hope that we will get through this period in this country.         There are many, many investigators, many investigators, and I can't         tell you what it is like not to be able to give a cell to the person next         door to you because of a policy.         I mean, this is just an incredible situation. I think we will get through         it, and I think we will be okay. But I am still concerned about it. Sorry         for the editorial, but I think it is important.          CHAIRMAN KASS:  Charles, did you want a quick word?          DR. KRAUTHAMMER : If I could just ask a very         quick question. You said that you would oppose and you supported the opposition         of creating a fetus for, say, harvesting the brain cells, and you talked         about the example in the Reagan years.         On the other hand, there is no difficulty, at least in your estimation,         of using tissue from a discarded fetus already aborted, and tissue which         would otherwise be thrown away.         Would you apply that same distinction to the embryonic stage? In other         words, you now use -- you develop embryonic stem cells from discarded         embryos from IVF clinics, and would you be equally opposed to the creation         of embryos specifically for their use as sources of embryos using that         same analogy?          DR. GEARHART:  No, I would not be opposed to         that. I don't give the same moral status to that entity.          CHAIRMAN KASS:  Well, we have -- let me just make         mention of one matter. Janet Rowley has submitted in writing, and I would         endorse, these questions if we had enough time.         We would like your comments on what kind of regulation you think might         be or should be developed for this area, and what is the status of government         support for what kind of research, and what are the limitations that are         counterproductive.         If we could invite -- if you would be willing, and these are hard questions         and they are big questions, but if you would be willing to respond if         we put these set of questions to you, and perhaps some others to you in         a letter?          DR. GEARHART:  Absolutely.          CHAIRMAN KASS:  I think the committee would be very         grateful for your help in thinking through the regulatory questions, which         are at the moment not what we have here.          DR. GEARHART:  Absolutely.          CHAIRMAN KASS:  I just want to thank you very, very         much, for an instructive morning, and also for the wonderful spirit in         which you presented your remarks and engaged the questions. I am very         grateful to you for coming.         We are running about 15 minutes behind, and we will reconvene at a quarter-of.         We have an hour-and-a-half for the second session this morning as originally         planned.          (Whereupon, at 10:33 a.m., the council was recessed and resumed at 10:49         a.m.)"
GX050-82-1910316	"Home NIH Stem Cell Backgrounder                               NIH Stem Cell Backgrounder                                                             1.

Does NIH fund embryonic stem cell research?              9.   Which research is best to pursue?                     What are stem cells?         Stem cells have the remarkable potential to develop into many different          cell types in the body. Serving as a sort of repair system for the body,          they can theoretically divide without limit to replenish other cells as          long as the person or animal is still alive. When a stem cell divides,          each new cell has the potential to either remain a stem cell or become          another type of cell with a more specialized function, such as a muscle          cell, a red blood cell, or a brain cell.   Return to top         What classes of stem cells are there?         Common terms you may come across describing stem cells group them according          to how many different types of cells they have the potential to produce.          A fertilized egg is considered  totipotent , meaning that its potential          is total; it gives rise to all the different types of cells in the body.           Pluripotent  stem cells can give rise to any type of cell in the          body except those needed to develop a fetus. Stem cells that can give          rise to multiple different cell types are generally called  multipotent .   Return to top         Why are doctors and scientists so excited about stem          cells?         Stem cells have potential in many different areas of health and medical          research. To start with, studying stem cells will help us to understand          how they transform into the dazzling array of specialized cells that make          us what we are. Some of the most serious medical conditions, such as cancer          and birth defects, are due to problems that occur somewhere in this process.          A better understanding of normal cell development will allow us to understand          and perhaps correct the errors that cause these medical conditions.         Another potential application of stem cells is making cells and tissues          for medical therapies. Today, donated organs and tissues are often used          to replace those that are diseased or destroyed. Unfortunately, the number          of people suffering from these disorders far outstrips the number of organs          available for transplantation. Stem cells offer the possibility of a renewable          source of replacement cells and tissues to treat myriad diseases, conditions,          and disabilities including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, spinal          cord injury, stroke, burns, heart disease, diabetes, osteoarthritis and          rheumatoid arthritis. There is almost no realm of medicine that might          not be touched by this innovation.    Return to top         Have stem cells been used successfully to treat any          human diseases yet?         Blood-forming stem cells in bone marrow called hematopoietic stem cells          (HSCs) are currently the only type of stem cell commonly used for therapy.          Doctors have been transferring HSCs in bone marrow transplants for over          40 years. More advanced techniques of collecting, or ""harvesting"", HSCs          are now used in order to treat leukemia, lymphoma and several inherited          blood disorders.         The clinical potential of stem cells has also been demonstrated in the          treatment of other human diseases that include diabetes and advanced kidney          cancer. However, these newer applications have involved studies with a          very limited number of patients, using stem cells that were harvested          from people.    Return to top         How do scientists get stem cells for medical and scientific          use?         Pluripotent stem cells have been isolated from human embryos that are          a few days old. Cells from these embryos can be used to create pluripotent          stem cell ""lines"", cultures that can be grown indefinitely in the laboratory.          Multipotent stem cell lines have also been developed from fetal tissue          obtained from terminated pregnancies.         Stem cells can also be isolated from adult tissue. Thus far, these cells          have been multipotent. Adult stem cells have not been found for all types          of tissue, but discoveries in this area of research are increasing. For          example, until recently it was thought that stem cells were not present          in the adult nervous system, but in recent years such stem cells have          been found in the brain.    Return to top         Why do scientists want to use stem cell lines?         Once a stem cell line is established from a cell in the body, it is essentially          immortal, no matter how it was derived. That is, it does not have to be          created again from the original embryo or adult. Once established, it          can be grown in the laboratory indefinitely and widely distributed to          other researchers.         In addition, before scientists can use any type of stem cell for transplantation,          they must overcome attempts by a patient's immune system to reject the          transplant. Human stem cell lines might in the future be modified with          gene therapy or other techniques to overcome this immune rejection. Scientists          might also be able to replace damaged genes or add new genes to stem cells          in order to give them new characteristics that can ultimately help to          treat diseases.     Return to top          What will be the best type of stem cell to use for          therapy?         Pluripotent stem cells, while having great therapeutic potential, face          formidable technical challenges. First, scientists must learn how to control          their development into all the different types of cells in the body. Second,          the cells now available for research are likely to be rejected by a patient's          immune system. Another serious consideration is that the idea of using          stem cells from human embryos or human fetal tissue troubles many people          on ethical grounds.         Until recently, there was little evidence that stem cells from adults          could change course and provide the flexibility that researchers need          in order to address all the medical diseases and disorders they would          like to. New findings in animals, however, suggest that even after a stem          cell has begun to specialize, it may be more flexible than previously          thought.         There are currently several limitations to using adult stem cells. Although          many different kinds of multipotent stem cells have been identified, the          evidence that adult stem cells could give rise to all cell and tissue          types is not yet conclusive. Adult stem cells are often present in only          minute quantities and can therefore be difficult to isolate and purify.          There is also evidence that they may not have the same capacity to multiply          as embryonic stem cells do. Finally, adult stem cells may contain more          DNA abnormalities — caused by sunlight, toxins and errors in making more          DNA copies during the course of a lifetime. These potential weaknesses          might limit the usefulness of adult stem cells.     Return to top         Does NIH fund embryonic stem cell research?         Research on human embryonic stem cell lines may receive NIH funding if          the cell line meets the following criteria: removal of cells from the          embryo must have been initiated before August 9, 2001, when President          Bush outlined this policy; and the embryo from which the stem cell line          was derived must no longer have had the possibility of developing further          as a human being. The embryo must have been created for reproductive purposes          but no longer be needed for them. Informed consent must have been obtained          from the parent(s) for the donation of the embryo, and no financial inducements          for donation are allowed.          In order to ensure that federal funds are used to support only stem          cell research that is scientifically sound, legal, and ethical, NIH examines          stem cell lines and maintains a  registry  of those lines that satisfy the          criteria.     Return to top         Which research is best to pursue?         The development of stem cell lines that can produce many tissues of the          human body is an important scientific breakthrough. This research has          the potential to revolutionize the practice of medicine and improve the          quality and length of life. Given the enormous promise of stem cells therapies          for so many devastating diseases, NIH believes that it is important to          simultaneously pursue all lines of research and search for the very best          sources of these cells.

Pets are  more common in households with children, yet there are more pets than  children in American households.  There are more than 51 million dogs,  56 million cats, 45 million birds, 75 million small mammals and  reptiles, and uncounted millions of aquarium fish.       It is important at this time to assess whether these populations have  any beneficial impact on physical, social, and psychological health.     To this end, the National Institutes of Health convened a Technology  Assessment Workshop on the Health Benefits of Pets on September 10-11,  1987.  After a day-and-a-half of presentations by experts in relevant  fields, a working group drafted the following report to provide the  scientific community with a synthesis of the current knowledge and a  framework for future research, and to provide the public with the  information it needs to make informed decisions regarding the health  benefits of pets.     Throughout history animals have played a significant role in human  customs, legends, and religions. Primitive people found that human-  animal relationships were important to their very survival, and  petkeeping was common in hunter-gatherer societies.  In our own time,  the great increase in pet ownership may reflect a largely urban  population's often unsatisfied need for intimacy, nurturance, and  contact with nature.  However, it is impossible to determine when  animals first were used specifically to promote physical and  psychological health.  The use of horseback riding for people with  serious disabilities has been reported for centuries.  In 1792, animals  were incorporated into the treatment for mental patients at the York  Retreat, England, as part of an enlightened approach attempting to  reduce the use of harsh drugs and restraints.  The first suggested use  of animals in a therapeutic setting in the United States was in 1919 at  St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, D. C., when Superintendent Dr.  W.A. White received a letter from Secretary of the Interior F.K. Lane  suggesting the use of dogs as companions for the psychiatric hospital's  resident patients.  Following this, the earliest extensive use of  companion animals in the United States occurred from 1944 to 1945 at an  Army Air Corps Convalescent Hospital at Pawling, New York.  Patients  recovering from war experiences were encouraged to work at the  hospital's farm with hogs, cattle, horses, and poultry. After the war,  modest efforts began in using animals in outpatient psychotherapy.  During the 1970s, numerous case studies of animals facilitating therapy  with children and senior citizens were reported.                  The Role of Pets in Cardiovascular Health      The role of social support in cardiovascular health--a question not yet  resolved despite considerable research--provides a rational framework  for studying the possible benefits of pets beyond mere enjoyment and  affection.       Since psychological factors can elicit strong and immediate responses  from the cardiovascular system, many studies are attempting to determine  whether such influences ultimately affect the risk of developing  cardiovascular diseases.  The description of a ""coronary-prone behavior  pattern,"" or Type A behavior, and its link to the probability of  developing overt disease provided hope that, with careful training,  individuals could exercise additional control over somatic illness by  altering their lifestyle.  Relaxation, meditation, and stress management  have become recognized therapies for attempting to reduce blood pressure  before pharmacological methods are prescribed.  It therefore seems  reasonable that pets, who provide faithful companionship to many people,  also might promote greater psychosocial stability for their owners, and  thus a measure of protection from heart disease.  Systematic research  addressing this issue is scarce, and it has been difficult to draw  definitive conclusions from the few studies with small sample sizes that  have been completed.  A selection of these, providing direct as well as  indirect evidence relevant to this hypothesis, was reported at this  conference.     A plausible physiological basis for a beneficial influence of pets is  provided by studies of heart rate in Old World monkeys and research of  blood pressure in college students.  There is now objective evidence,  based on direct examination of coronary arteries, that monkeys housed in  benign social environments and more frequently engaged in affiliative  behaviors develop less severe coronary disease than monkeys repeatedly  exposed to dominance-competitive interactions.  It is possible that this  decrease in atherosclerosis is directly related to the much lower heart  rates that have been observed in these animals by means of telemetry,  especially at times when they are engaged in social interactions with  each other.  Decreased coronary disease in animals with genetically  lower heart rates also has been reported by others.       Since elevated blood pressure also is associated with higher risk of  developing significant coronary heart disease, demonstration that the  presence of an unfamiliar dog lowers systolic blood pressure (but not  diastolic blood pressure or heart rate) in college students is only a  partially encouraging finding for proponents of a link between health  and pet ownership.  The experiment should be repeated, using the  subjects' own pets rather than an unfamiliar animal, which may evoke a  degree of anxiety in some people.  A number of studies have reported  that domesticated animals can influence physiological measures such as  heart rate and blood pressure acutely, but conclusive data are needed to  demonstrate that the magnitude of these effects is sufficient to be  clinically significant and endure over a sufficiently long period of  time to be beneficial.  One approach would be a cross-sectional study  showing lower heart rates or blood pressures in pet owners than in  nonowners, although the problem of self-selection still remains.  Experimental designs that randomly assign pets to some individuals andnot to others for a period of time would be ideal, although more  difficult and costly.       However suggestive the findings from studies of human physiology may be,  the final link will have to come from clinical studies that demonstrate  a direct relationship between pet ownership and either the incidence of,  recurrence of, or mortality from heart disease in people.  Results from  one such study, presented at this conference, found that postmyocardial  infarction survival rates were much higher among pet owners than among  nonowners.  However, as in the case of other social variables, only a  small proportion (3.5 percent) of the difference in mortality was  attributable to pet ownership itself.  Because determining severity of  disease is not yet an exact science, it is conceivable that all  myocardial infarction (MI) patients who owned a pet were in relatively  better health, as reflected by their ability to care for a household  pet. It is therefore important to conduct rigorous prospective studies  in which the effects of placing a pet with a randomly chosen sample of  post-MI patients would be examined.       In spite of the current insufficiency of data conclusively linking pet  ownership to cardiovascular health, the evidence provided at this  conference is sufficiently encouraging and intriguing to be worthy of  serious followup.  Those who own pets would surely be delighted to learn  that they reap unexpected health and financial benefits (from lower  health care costs) in addition to enjoying the companionship of the  family cat or dog.       Conference participants agreed that definitive conclusions on possible  benefits of companion animals would require much larger sample sizes and  more rigorous experimental designs than studies conducted thus far.  Reexamination of data from one or more of the existing large  epidemiological studies or collection of relevant followup data seeking  to link incidence of disease with presence or absence of household pets  could be a useful forerunner to costly de novo population studies.  Alternatively, future national health surveys might include questions  related to pet ownership among the demographic data collected so that  the relationship of household pets to a variety of illnesses and  conditions also could be determined.       Pet ownership is a very personal decision reflecting an individual  preference; this can bias the outcome of nonrandomized studies. Not only  does ability to care for a pet imply better health, it also may reflect  availability of more discretionary income, which may result in more  investment in health care.  A companion animal may not necessarily be  appropriate for everyone; however, withholding a pet from someone who  wants one could be as much a source of distress as forcing one upon  someone who does not. Conference participants accepted that many  questions would have to be examined when attempting to resolve these  issues. Given the present state of knowledge, the best judge of the  risks or benefits of pet ownership for optimal cardiovascular health is  the individual.  Hopefully, research developments will provide better  guidance in the future.                  The Role of Pets in Child Development      A number of empirical studies have investigated how children interact  with pets and how they view their relationships with animals, including  pets. These studies have taken two basic forms: (l) observational  studies of actual interactions between child and pet and (2) interviews  with children in which their attitudes and beliefs regarding animals in  general, and their own pet in particular, were examined.       These studies have demonstrated major developmental changes in how  children interact with pets.  For example, toddlers (2 to 3 years old)  are more likely to hit, poke, or grab their pets (behaviors that might  be considered aggressive) than are older children. Three- to 4-year-old  children tend to pet their animals more than engage in other behaviors,  while 5- and 6-year-olds generally hug, stroke, and massage their pets,  suggesting both more sophisticated and ""gentle"" physical contact  patterns and more empathetic social relationships.  These age-based  changes in patterns of behavioral interactions with pets are generally  parallel to the developmental changes in interaction patterns that  children have with familiar humans, including parents, siblings, and  peers.       Examination of children's attitudes toward pets reveals that many of  them ascribe a rich range of social attributes to these animals. Some of  these attributes--especially love and affection, companionship,  intimacy, and nurturance--also are used in the children's description of  their relationships with other specific people, but other attributes--  for example, ownership and entertainment--are uniquely ascribed to pets.  Consider the attributes of companionship and love and affection.  Most  children rate their own pets very high on both characteristics while  they rate neighborhood animals high on companionship but not on love and  affection.  (By way of comparison, siblings tend to be rated high on  companionship but not on love and affection, while the reverse is the  case for ratings of grandparents.) Taken as a whole, these results  suggest that children's relationships with familiar animals, especially  pets, are unique and different from their relationships with others in  their social world.  The relationship with pets typically is  complementary to these other relationships rather than a substitute for  any one type of human relationship.       Of course, children differ in their attitudes and relationships toward  pets, and some of these differences can be related to factors such as  family size, presence or absence of younger siblings, and family income  (most of the studies to date have been limited to samples of children  from stable, suburban middle-class families, and generalization to other  groups of children may not be valid).  The long-term consequences for  children of establishing such relationships with pets and other animals  have not been studied to date in any detail, although a number of  studies of children in diverse family circumstances suggest that, at  least for some, the presence of a pet is greatly beneficial.  On the one  hand, it has been suggested that exposure to pets should facilitate the  establishment and maintenance of relationships with peers, especially in  grade and high school.  On the other hand, there has been some concern  that children who establish too intense a relationship with a pet may  suffer in the development of sophisticated and meaningful relationships  with other people.  More research is needed to determine what such  long-term consequences might be and to identify any conditions,  situations, or characteristics of particular children whose specific  relationships with their pets put them at risk for developing problems  in subsequent social, emotional, and cognitive development. Prospective  longitudinal studies in home or neighborhood settings would be very  useful in this regard.                  Health Correlates of Pets in Older Persons      In addition to examination of the effects of the human-companion animal  bond among children and special populations of chronically ill or  disabled adults, there has been widespread consideration of the benefits  of companion animals for older persons. Interdisciplinary researchers in  veterinary medicine, public health, and the behavioral sciences have  begun to explore the health correlates of the human-animal bond and to  examine the benefits of a wide range of pet-facilitated therapies on the  health and functioning of the elderly.  The assumption of a salutary  effect of pet ownership on the health of older persons is based on a  growing body of literature suggesting the importance of social ties and  relationships for persons experiencing life changes affecting health or  social situations.       Two types of research predominate in this area.  A few large-scale  epidemiological studies are examining the association of pet ownership  and attachment with the health and well-being of older persons living  independently in the community.  However, most researchers are involved  in applied intervention studies examining the effect of pet-facilitated  therapy or animal visitation programs on older persons in long-term care  settings.       Data from a national probability sample of 1,232 older persons living in  the community reveal a lack of influence of pet variables on health  outcomes in the general population of older persons: (1) no direct  association was found between pet variables (pet ownership and  attachment) and reported illness status or levels of depression and (2)  no support was found for the hypothesized protective buffering role of  pet ownership/attachment, and (3) there was stability in basic  conclusions across subgroup analyses based on sex, age, and pet  characteristics.       However, a benefit of pet ownership and attachment in combatting  depression, but not general illness status, was found among older  persons in situations of personal stress who were without adequate human  social support (e.g., bereaved persons without a close source of human  support).  Significant health benefits of human-animal interactions in  the general population of older persons may be limited to persons in  special ""at-risk"" circumstances.  There is also new research examining  the relationship between pet ownership, psychosocial variables, and  health care utilization.  These data collectively suggest that pet  ownership may reduce the demand for care for medically nonserious  problems.       Studies of health benefits of pet programs for nursing home and health  center residents often are flawed methodologically or reported  incompletely.  Yet the cumulative weight of these studies strongly  suggests that psychosocial benefits can be gained from animal visitation  programs for at least some older persons in such settings.  For example,  the presence of animals in institutional settings is associated with the  tendency of older persons to smile and talk more, reach out toward  people and objects, exhibit more alertness and attention, and experience  more symptoms of well-being and less depression.  Pet programs have  proven superior in producing psychosocial benefits in comparison to some  other alternative therapies (e.g., arts and crafts programs, friendly  visitor programs, and conventional psychotherapy).       The effect of exposure to pets on measures of physical and cognitive  functioning is less clear.  It is difficult to isolate intervention  effects in the face of multiple symptoms and changing physiological  conditions found in the severely impaired older population.  Further,  benefits for cognitively impaired persons may not carry over to times  when animals are not present.  The benefit of animal visitation and  live-in programs should be addressed in relationship to other factors  that influence long-term care services for older persons.       Future research is needed to test explanatory models for understanding  the health benefits of human/animal interactions in older persons.  Two  strategies for theory development were identified in this conference:  (l) the generation of hypotheses from observations about the nature and  consequences of the human-animal bond, and (2) the borrowing of theories  and methodology from related scientific studies (e.g., the study of  health and human social supports). Future studies need to recognize the   heterogeneity of the older population and the complexity of the human-animal  bond.  Large-scale epidemiological studies of associations between people and   pets often fail to reveal the expected relationships. We need to have realistic  expectations of the benefits of pets given the number of other interacting   social and behavioral risk factors that impinge on the health and functioning   of older persons--whether in community or institutional settings. There is a   need to specify the meaning of pets in everyday life and to explore the ways   in which the presence of companion animals can affect the health and   well-being of different segments of the older population.       The examination of associated health benefits of companion animals for  the elderly requires the researcher to go beyond a simplistic  description of the presence or absence of a companion animal to consider  the quality of that pet interaction.  The relationship between the  desire for and the reality of pet interaction should be examined  further.  The congruency between desire and reality may be a key factor  in observed health impacts.                  The Role of Pets in Social and Therapeutic Effects      The use of selected animals as agents in a wide variety of therapeutic  approaches has become increasingly widespread in recent years.  Two  examples were highlighted in this section of the workshop: companion  dogs for handicapped people confined to wheelchairs and ""hippotherapy,""  horseback riding as part of a therapeutic program.       Companion dogs provide wheelchair patients with a source of social  stimulation that is typically more constant and reliable than most human  companions, including spouses, siblings, or therapists.  In addition, a  number of empirical studies have demonstrated that the presence of a  companion dog serves to increase the quantity and quality of attention  directed toward the handicapped persons by both familiar individuals and  strangers.  This ""magnet"" effect of companion dogs can be of significant  benefit to the handicapped individuals because research has clearly  demonstrated that individuals with noticeable physical handicaps  otherwise tend to be avoided or ignored by both familiar and unfamiliar  individuals, relative to nonhandicapped people.  At this point, study of  long-term consequences of companion dog presence for this group of  handicapped individuals has yet to be carried out.       ""Therapeutic riding"" is an umbrella term to describe a variety of ways  in which the horse may be used to influence the physical and  psychological well-being of individuals.  It incorporates riding skills  and gymnastic exercises for emotional, cognitive, and sensorimotor  benefits.  For patients with movement disorders, specially trained  physical and occupational therapists use therapeutic riding in which the  horse influences the patient rather than the patient controlling the  horse.  The goal is to improve the patient's posture, balance, mobility,  and function.       At this time, solid data on the success of therapeutic riding is  limited. The European literature on the topic is increasing. Future  research is indicated to compare the efficacy of therapeutic riding with  other clinical treatment procedures that do not involve the horse and to  validate dramatic clinical observations.                  Safety and Risks in People-pet Relationships      In evaluating the health benefits of pet-people relationships, one also  must consider the safety of this intervention for both people and pets  -- for example, dangers to pets associated with chemicals such as  insecticides and pesticides and people's risks of infections, allergies,  and injuries associated with lack of veterinary medical advice.       Although the risks associated with interaction are real for both people  and pets, we need additional research to better define those situations,  hazards, and populations with high risk as well as those situations and  populations with very low risk.  For example, reports from agencies in  50 states and studies of 284 nursing homes in Minnesota have shown that  visiting and live-in pets can be relatively safe for residents in the  supervised conditions of nursing homes.  In the Minnesota study, no  infections or allergic reactions and only two significant injuries were  associated with pets during 12 months of research.  Other studies  emphasize that knowledge and motivation for people and appropriate  selection and behavioral training of pets are essential to increase the  safety of people-pet interactions.       More research is needed to better define high- and low-risk conditions  in defined populations and situations to develop more specific knowledge  for promotion of safety and appropriate interactions between people and  pets.                  Future Research Directions      Studies on human-animal relationships originated with a focus on the  beneficial aspects of pets.  In time, four general research areas  developed, including:        historical descriptions of human-animal interactions,       demographics and explanations of pet ownership,       physiological and psychological responses of people interacting with  animals, and       animals as facilitators of psychological or physical therapy.     Methodologies for future research can begin without explicit hypotheses  and proceed from descriptive studies of representative and, hopefully,  random samples.  There is nothing intrinsically wrong with extrapolating  from attitudinal information as long as the sample is representative of  the target population.  It should be remembered that samples of  convenience are prone to bias, and interpretation must be limited and  made with great care.  If the hypothesis is supported, research could  proceed to cross-sectional and retrospective studies and then to long-  range prospective investigations.  A causal association between animal  contact and human health can be demonstrated only by prospective  studies.       There are many promising areas of research related to potential health  benefits of companion animals that would not only advance our  comprehension of how to best utilize animals therapeutically but also  would provide insight into the very nature of the link between people  and animals in the general population.  The major research questions  include:      For whom is animal interaction most beneficial?        For whom and where is animal interaction problematic?        How is contact with animals beneficial? and       Are different species of animals, and even plants, important to  human health?          Future knowledge and research efforts should be directed toward specific  health benefits of pets in the following areas:      Pets have a special place in the lives of people but, in larger   perspective, share many attributes of other members of the living  environment.  The value of this environment to the physical and mental  health of people should be better understood. Specific research, from this   perspective, is needed.      Data are needed to address issues of how to assess optimal candidate   populations that most benefit from pets and what relationships serve to   produce effects of sufficient magnitude and duration to be of lasting benefit.  Such studies are needed for all candidate populations and include   cardiovascular, developmental, and psychosocial issues.      The relationship between animals and cardiovascular disease is intriguing   and needs to be aggressively studied. Specific studies are needed in at least   two areas in followup to work reported here. An understanding is needed of the  differences in the effect of ""bonding"" between a person and his pet versus   simply the effect of a strange animal on blood pressure and cardiovascular   disease. Also, large clinical prospective studies are needed in which  animals are randomly placed with postmyocardial infarction patients to examine  the magnitude and longevity of protective effects. These studies on people   should be repeated on nonhuman animals to generate and test hypotheses about   mechanisms of action.      It is evident that interpretation of results in this area of research is   particularly difficult due to the lack of long-term clinical and   epidemiological data.  Much clarity would be achieved by the reexamination of   large, national, epidemiological studies and by the addition of animal-related  and pet ownership and demographic questions on future national health surveys.  Consideration of pet exposure as a possible ""protective"" factor in scientific   studies of human health would be cost-effective and is an idea whose time has   come. This research area would be facilitated greatly if animal ownership   patterns could be added to many ongoing studies.      The relatively low order of significance of many of the test results   points to the importance of rigorous statistical methodology. Sample sizes,   likewise, have not been sufficient in many cases to support definitive  conclusions. Due to the great number of pets in American households, however,   a positive impact of even a few tenths of a percentage point may benefit tens   of thousands of people. The U.S. census also should begin to include questions  on the number and types of animals in people's homes. If this were done, we   could begin to address a variety of public health issues, including potential   zoonoses with long incubation periods and subtle positive effects of animals   on chronic and stress-related diseases.      Studies suggest that pets should be beneficial to some children through   the facilitation of stable relationships with peers and adults, yet these   studies are limited due to the small numbers and disproportionate samples from  upper and middle classes. Prospective longitudinal studies should be conducted  across racial and socioeconomic boundaries to determine long-term consequences  and to identify specific populations, conditions, and experiences, with or   without pets, that put children at risk for developing problems in social,   emotional, and cognitive development.      There has been extensive consideration of the benefit of pets to older   persons. In most cases, these applications simply have been in acknowledgment  of the psychosocial benefit of animal visitation and live-in programs to the   institutionalized person, and have not been rigorous studies. Because of the   rapidly increasing size of the elderly population and the overwhelming  evidence, anecdotal and large-scale surveys, additional studies are needed to focus on this population.  Future studies should recognize the heterogeneity of  this population and the difficulty in isolating the many variables impinging   on the older person. Such variables stem from illness, prior experiences with   or without pets, and expectations of the benefit of pets (as contrasted to the  reality of caring for the pet). This research should consider the use of   existing explanatory models to serve as a unifying theoretical base.      European literature on the use of therapeutic horseback riding should be   made readily available in English and the knowledge assimilated. Future   research should identify the specific emotional, cognitive, and sensorimotor   effects of therapeutic riding on movement disorders and compare these effects   with that of other clinical treatment procedures that do not involve the horse.      The value of companion animals for visually handicapped persons has long   been known.  More recently, similar animals have proven equally effective for   the hearing impaired. New research is needed to extend these relationships to   further identify the benefit of companion animals to other handicapped persons  such as paraplegics and quadriplegics.      The Working Group believes it is important to generate an increased  awareness of the potential importance of human-animal interaction and  involve scientists from a wide variety of fields for interdisciplinary  collaborative research.  Future studies of human health should consider  the presence or absence of a pet in the home and the nature of this  relationship with the pet as a significant variable.       This workshop examined many of the relationships between companion  animals, people, and health, and concentrated on the status of the  scientific descriptions of these relationships.  The Working Group,  which drafted this report, believes that persuasive evidence was  presented to conclude that pets are likely to be medically beneficial to  some people's health.  However, much is to be learned about many of  these relationships before broad generalizations of medical benefit can  be made.  The committee hopes that investigators will heed the  recommendations of this report in the design of future studies and that  funding institutions will encourage their submission for peer review.

The resultant NIH Technology Assessment  Statements are intended to advance understanding of the technology or  issue in question and to be useful to health professionals and the  public.       Some Technology Assessment Conferences and Workshops adhere to the  Consensus Development Conference format because the process is  altogether appropriate for evaluating highly controversial, publicized,  or politicized issues.  Other Conferences and Workshops are organized  around unique formats.  In this format, NIH Technology Assessment  Statements are prepared by a nonadvocate, nonfederal panel of experts,  based on: (1) presentations by investigators working in areas relevant  to the consensus questions typically during a 1-1/2-day public session;  (2) questions and statements from conference attendees during open  discussion periods that are part of the public session; and (3) closed  deliberations by the panel during the remainder of the second day and  morning of the third.  This statement is an independent report of the  panel and is not a policy statement of the NIH or the Federal Government.

Carl Levin, D-Mich., the chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations,  today urged President Bush to support federal funding for research using human embryonic stem cells. Last week, the subcommittee held a hearing on diabetes at which witnesses testified about both the serious consequences of juvenile diabetes and the distinct possibility that embryonic stem cell research could lead to its cure.     ""Congress has been repeatedly told that embryonic stem cell research holds the greatest promise of a cure for some of the most debilitating and deadly diseases,"" Levin wrote to the president.  ""Not only do scientists, patient advocacy groups, and many in the business community agree that federal funding of embryonic stem cell research has enormous potential, but so do many of us in Congress.  Senators like Orrin Hatch and my former colleague Connie Mack, who take a very different position than I do on the issue of whether abortion should be legal, strongly support embryonic stem cell research.""    At the subcommittee hearing last week, Dr. Hugh Auchincloss, professor of surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, testified to the ""considerable scientific evidence suggesting that these embryonic stem cells have major advantages over any other source.""  President Bush has heard from almost 80 Nobel Laureates who have strongly endorsed federal funding of embryonic stem cell research.    Letter follows:    * * *                      July 5, 2001      The President  The White House  Washington, DC 20500    Dear Mr. President:     I am writing to strongly urge you to support federal funding for research using human embryonic stem cells.  Congress has been repeatedly told that embryonic stem cell research holds the greatest promise of a cure for some of our most debilitating and deadly diseases.     Last week the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I chair, held a hearing on diabetes at the request of our Ranking Member, Senator Susan Collins, and a major focus of that hearing was embryonic stem cell research.  We heard compelling testimony about both the serious consequences of juvenile diabetes and the distinct possibility that embryonic stem cell research could lead to its cure.      Dr. Hugh Auchincloss, Professor of Surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, testified to the ""considerable scientific evidence suggesting that these embryonic stem cells have major advantages over any other source.""  Almost 80 Nobel Laureates have written to you strongly endorsing the federal funding of embryonic stem cell research.  And numerous patient advocacy groups, such as the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, are counting on federal funding of embryonic stem cell research for a possible cure for the diseases they are battling.       Not only do scientists, patient advocacy groups, and many in the business community agree that federal funding of embryonic stem cell research has enormous potential, but so do many of us in Congress.  Senators like Orrin Hatch and my former colleague, Connie Mack, who take a very different position than I do on the issue of whether abortion should be legal, strongly support embryonic stem cell research.        I hope you will heed these calls for support and of life and allow for federal funding of embryonic stem cell research.

Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s                  Research                 William Pursley, President and CEO, Osiris Therapeutics, Inc.                 Robert Goldstein, Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International                                               CHAIRMAN KASS:   Could we get started, please?                 Our fourth session of the day is on stem cells, moving research                from the bench to the bedside, the role of non-governmental activity.                              Progress in stem cell research proceeds not only with government                support, important though such support surely is.  Biotech companies                are vigorously active in the field both with embryonic and non-embryonic                cells, and disease related and other philanthropic foundations are                actively supporting such research.                 Our monitoring of stem cell research would not be complete without                some review of what is going on under these auspices.  This afternoon                we are fortunate to have with us representatives from two leading                biotech companies very active in stem cell research and from two                leading private philanthropic research foundations who will tell                us something about the strategies they are pursuing to develop stem                cell based experimental therapies, how close they are to developing                such therapies, and what obstacles currently stand in the way.                 As they have all been asked to avoid commercial pitches, criticisms                of competitors, or advocacy for or against legislation currently                pending before Congress, I would ask Council members to refrain                from prodding them to do otherwise or to ask them for investment                tips or other privileged information.                 (Laughter.)                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Our guests in order of presentation are                Dr. Thomas Okarma, who is the President and CEO of Geron Corporation,                a company that emphasizes embryonic stem cell research and formerly                supported the work, among others, of John Gearhart and James Thomson,                and that has solid patent positions in this field.                 Second, Dr. Theo Palmer, who is an assistant professor in the                Department of Neurosurgery at Stanford, a stem cell researcher working                on nervous system applications, and today representing the Michael                J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson Research on whose scientific advisory                board he serves.                 Third, William Pursley, President and CEO of Osiris Therapeutics,                Inc., a company in the forefront especially of mesenchymal stem                cell research, with many strong patents in this area and exploring                clinical applications for cardiac therapy, immunomodulation, among                others.                 Finally Dr. Robert Goldstein, who is the Chief Scientific Officer                of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International, an organization                with extensive activities, including a recently announced program                of training grants to draw top young researchers into the stem cell                field.                 Gentlemen, thank you very much for taking time from your busy                lives to travel here and to give us the benefit of your knowledge.                              We'll start with Dr. Okarma.                  DR. OKARMA:   Thank you, Dr. Kass, for the opportunity to                spend some time with you today.  It's a visit that's probably                overdue.                 You asked me to address three topics:  our progress in the development                of products based on embryonic stem cells; our thoughts about immune                tolerance and immune rejection of the transplanted cells; and, lastly,                impacts of various policies on our progress in the private sector                in 15 minutes.  So I will be terse and not do justice to either                question, but try to give you an overall picture.                 By way of background and the take-home point, clearly human embryonic                stem cells are a special case, and this Council has certainly debated                the issue of the moral status element of that specialness.  But                I would argue that there are two other elements to its specialness.                              First, the biology which is unique amongst all the cells in the                universe and its promise for medical therapeutics.                 And thirdly and not well understood, this paradigm is in the industrial                sector, not in the academic sector, and that has some very important                implications to the development of this technology, and I'll                try to make those points as I go through.                 Geron, as you may know, has been at the forefront of human embryonic                stem cell research since 1995 when we first entered the field.                 We funded the work done in Jamie Thomson's lab, John Gearhart's                lab, and Dr. Pedersen's lab at UC-San Francisco, and as such,                we're the movers technically, technologically and proprietarily                in this entire field.                 We have spent over $70 million on this technology, most of it                since 1999 after the cells were derived.  That's a number against                which the NIH disbursements pale by both absolute and relative terms,                and there are some reasons for that that I will touch on.                 So let me move first then into our development plans and our developmental                progress.  First, let me talk a bit about some of the infrastructure                basic science components that we've established.                 You've heard a lot of discussion about how these cells are                grown on mouse feeder cells.  We've established a scalable way                to grow these cells not only off of feeder cells, but now with a                fully qualified set of reagents.  These can be scaled virtually                limitlessly.                 We've established ways to scalably produce seven different                differentiated cell types from each of the lines that we have.                 So one line now makes seven different kinds of cells that we'll                describe in a moment.                 We have verified the stability of the embryonic stem cell line                in culture.  Some of the lines have been grown continuously for                over three years, more than 600 population doublings, and there's                a manuscript in press now describing four lines studied over that                period of time that demonstrates that the karyotype, surface marker,                differentiation potential, and gene expression level, the stability                of these undifferentiated cell lines grown under our culture conditions.                              We have had a preliminary meeting with FDA, and we have now qualified                two of our cell lines for human use.  They have passed every assay                the FDA has asked us to submit them to, even though they are appropriately                classified as xenogeneic.  I will return to that later.                 In collaboration with Celera, we've established an annotated                genomic database of undifferentiated embryonic stem cells.  One                hundred fifty thousand EST sequences have been sequenced, and the                physical clones are deposited in Menlo Park.                 This is fully annotated.  We can query this database.  We understand                what the gene expression pattern of stemness really is and what                genes are up and down-regulated as these cells differentiate.  That                has been a crucial foundation for our ability to learn how to produce                differentiated cell types.                 And lastly, we, too, have developed methods to genetically modify                these cells.                 Now, the cells that we have learned how to make are characterized                by their normalcy.  Virtually every cell that we have made, without                exception, expresses completely normal cell biology.  So the islet                cells we have derived express insulin, and they express insulin                in a dose-dependent fashion as a function of glucose concentration                in the media.                 The oligodendrocytes we have made myelinate spinal cord cells                in animals.                 The dopaminergic neurons we have made secrete dopamine.                 The cardiomyocytes that we have made express all of the molecular                markers consistent with their being human cardiomyocytes.  They                respond in appropriate dose response fashion to cardioactive drugs.                              The bone cells that we have made in  Roslin have absolutely normal                biology.  The techniques to look at the bone formation these cells                make  in vitro  by X-ray diffraction are absolutely spot-on                normal.                 We are close, but have not yet derived chondrocytes.  That is                also a project funded at the Roslin Institute.                 And lastly, bone marrow cells, hematopoietic progenitors, which                again are absolutely normal in their cell biology, producing all                three cell lines normally.                 Now, some of these cells have progressed into animal studies,                and I'll detail those in a moment.  The first take-home point                to make is that we have never ever seen in any single animal the                formation of a tumor.  That is because we only put in differentiated                cells.                 The issue about growing the cells in the undifferentiated state                is to keep them from differentiating.  So when we remove them from                the undifferentiated culture conditions, these cells want to differentiate,                and we have molecular markers to prove that they are differentiated.                              We also have cytotoxic technology capable of detecting one out                of ten million cells that are undifferentiated should we need to                apply that later on in scale-up.                 So which cells are in animal models?  Well, first the hematopoietic                cells are in Canada, and we've demonstrated now engraftment                of these human embryonic stem cell derived hematopoietic cells in                the appropriate nude mouse model, which repopulates the animal's                peripheral blood.  That has important implications not only for                an alternative source of cells for bone marrow transplantation,                but for the second question regarding immune rejection.                 We've made dopaminergic cells which are engrafting robustly                in animal models of Parkinson's disease.  This is a huge tissue                engineering challenge where these cells must penetrate to the cortex                of the animal to completely correct the Parkinsonian defect.                 We have not yet demonstrated significant behavioral improvement                in the animals.  We are still working on that, but the cells engraft                robustly and, again, without tumors.                 The cell type that is most advanced is the oligodendrocyte, and                there will be a very exciting manuscript later this year from our                collaborator at UC-Irvine, Hans Keirsted, in which we have transplanted                the human oligodendrocytes into a model of spinal cord injury and                not only show statistically significant functional improvement of                the animal, but we have shown at the histologic level that the animal                cells are remyelinated by the cells that we have injected.                 Lastly, we are now in animal studies in three different labs with                cardiomyocytes injected into animal models of heart failure and                myocardial infarction.  Again, no tumors; again, the cells engraft,                and we have histologic evidence that these cells begin now to communicate                 with the animal cell  in situ  in the heart.                 So the work is early.  There is much more to do, but we are quite                pleased with the progress that we've made thus far and would                predict that the oligodendrocyte will be the first cell to enter                the clinical environment, and that an IND, if all goes well, could                be submitted in late '04 or early '05, which is quite a                bit ahead of most people's expectations.                 At this point our second cell type into the clinic would probably                be cardiomyocytes, based on the data set we have today.                 As part of that first question, you asked about obstacles.  There                are clearly many, many technical and scale-up obstacles that we                yet have to traverse, but those we think are fungible.  Our major                problem is funding.  We have done two reductions in force in the                company since a year ago.  We are one third of our former size.                              The political uncertainty of this field not only turns off investors,                but also turns off the other source of funding for biotech, which                are pharmaceutical partners, who at this point in time are completely                uninterested in this field.                 Turning to the issue of immune rejection, first, there are a number                of very exciting, new immunosuppressive drugs in clinical development.                 So I think the field of immune suppression through pharmacology                 will dramatically advance, and we hope to take advantage of that.                              Secondly, it's now known that pure effector cell transplants,                in other words, not organs that are contaminated by the donor's                immune system, are much less immunogenic in animal models and in                a few cases in human than is an entire organ transplant, again,                auguring well for the size of the problem of immune tolerance.                 Thirdly, there is some very exciting work that we are doing not                yet published, so I can only hint at it, that establishes the human                embryonic stem cell as being unusually unique in its immunologic                properties.  It has inherited some of the immunosuppressive properties                that are existent in the blastocyst.                 Why is it that the mothers never immunologically reject what is                an allograft, the blastocyst?  Well, there are specific reasons                for that, and those reasons are, in fact, inherent in the undifferentiated                embryonic stem cell.                 But in terms of our strategy, notwithstanding the prior points                of how to control immune rejection, we have one that makes a lot                of sense, and that is hematopoietic chimerism.  We know from the                bone marrow transplantation work that if a patient who gets a bone                marrow donation from me will be completely tolerant to receiving                a kidney allograft or a heart allograft from me.  The prior bone                marrow transplant has tolerized the patient to the antigens in my                tissues.                 We also know now from work done at Stanford that patients who                are status post whole organ transplant patients can be completely                weaned off of immunosuppressive drugs by giving them a mini bone                marrow transplant taken from a donor with the same tissue type as                the prior kidney donor.                 This is the strategy we plan to use out of the box in our clinical                program, having now established that we can derive hematopoietic                progenitors from one of the lines.   A dose of those cells should                tolerize the patient to any effector cell transplanted into that                individual derived from the same stem cell line.  So that is my                answer to Question  2.                 Lastly, you asked me to address issues of policy that affect our                ability to develop the programs.  Certainly the fact that this is                primarily an industrial paradigm helps with regard to FDA.  I've                worked with Kathryn Zoon and Phil Noguchi since the mid-'80s                in my prior company in cell therapies.  Many of the points to consider                that are now published came from our mutual collaboration in the                early work in the '80s and '90s in cell transplantation.                              The pathway to regulatory testing and commercialization with this                technology is clear.  There are some idiosyncracies, it is true,                but we understand the pathway, and we have thus far been very pleased                with our early interactions with the agency.                 The NIH has a different issue:  to recognize the primary role                in this field that has been played by industry.  That is not their                fault.  They were prohibited by law from funding this arena.  That                is how we got into it.  That is how we got ahead of everyone.                 But that has some special implications.  For us, as I manage Geron,                we have two platforms:  the stem cells that we're talking about                today and a cancer program based on telomerase.  And the management                and depth of technology in both of those platforms is hugely different                with, I think, important consequences both for patients and for                policy makers.                 On the cancer side, we have sent the telomerase gene to hundreds                of laboratories all around the world.  We have many, many collaborators.                 Many people have worked independently of us on telomerase.  So as                we move into the clinic with our anti-cancer platform, our scientific                understanding of how to use telomerase as a vaccine, how to develop                drugs that inhibit telomerase, how to use the promoter of telomerase                to drive oncolytic viruses is very, very deep.                 That reduces risks to patients and increases the likelihood that                our first entré into the clinics will be successful, as we                are, in fact, seeing with our telomerase vaccine program in the                clinic at Duke.                 That is to be contrasted with our program in embryonic stem cells,                where we have a small number of collaborators, the bulk of which                are frankly either in California funded by us and the State of California,                or in other countries, the U.K. and in Canada.                 So there's no question that when we think we are ready to                move into the clinic expeditiously and cautiously, having checked                all of the appropriate boxes the FDA wants us to check, we will                still be skating on relative thin ice in terms of the science behind                the product that we are testing in people.                 So the narrower science base in embryonic stem cell research increases                risk of technical failure and exposes patients to greater risk from                the experiment.                 The second point under policy I would make sort of illustrates                a problem that's about to happen.  We've heard a lot about                the issue of are the old existing lines okay.  What about new lines?                 Will they be different?  Will they be better?                 Well, the existing lines, as you've heard today, can be used                in human clinical trials, but they will not last forever, we don't                think.  There's no reason to assume that.  And these current                lines, all of them, were derived on mouse embryonic layers and,                as such, are appropriately classified as xenogeneic transplants                with increased risk to patients and a much increased burden on the                sponsor to follow these patients for life after they receive these                cells.  That's appropriate.                 So the FDA is urging us appropriately to derive new lines that                not only have not seen mouse feeders, but whose entire pedigree                is from reagents that are qualified for human use and that the entire                process of derivation be under GMP, good manufacturing practices.                              We will be successful in doing this.  We will generate such a                line very quickly, very soon, and then the implication of the current                policy, however, is that arguably this would be the best line to                use and to qualify and to share, but because it was derived after                2001 in August, the NIH will be prohibited from studying it.                 And what are the implications for when we take that cell line                into the clinic?  Will we be unable to share that cell line either                from a funding or a technology perspective with the NIH?                 So those are my brief comments on the three questions.  We are                unquestionably the leader in the field because of circumstances                that enabled us the freedom to operate, and in some ways, particularly                with regard to FDA and scale-up and GMP, that's good for the                field.                 But in terms of getting this technology embedded rapidly in the                most sophisticated biomedical community in the world, we are amiss.                              Thank you.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you very much.                 I think we should hear from all four people together and then                have questions.                 Dr. Palmer, please.                  DR. PALMER:   Thank you, Chairman Kass, members of the Council.                              I'm here on behalf of the Michael J. Fox Foundation, and I                was asked by the foundation and by the Council to give a little                bit of an overview of the foundation's efforts in targeting                Parkinson's disease.  So I'll talk to you a little bit about                Parkinson's disease, or PD, and then also the role of stem cells                in our portfolio; finally, a little bit about what we've learned                in three years of trying to use stem cells in this very targeted                application.                 The foundation is relatively new.  As you know, it started in                late winter of 2000.  The goal of the foundation is to match funding                to scientists who are pursuing every avenue of research to find                a cure for Parkinson's disease.                 Our secondary goal and my primary goal as an advisory board member                is to make sure that this funding reaches the investigator with                speed, and one of the things that we've found that has really                speeded the research is to short circuit some of the delay in an                investigator coming up with a good idea and then getting the funding                to that research.                 So we're targeting Parkinson's disease, and our efforts                in stem cells are quite narrow compared to many of the applications                that you'll hear today.  But Parkinson's disease is the                accelerated loss of a dopamine neuron in the adult brain.  These                neurons control movement, and the loss of the neuron does not allow                the brain to initiate movement.                 So one of the strategies, of course, is to replace those neurons                with a stem cell derived dopamine neuron population.  This is part                of our research effort.                 The other part, and in fact, a larger part, is to understand the                disease itself and then prevent or augment the remaining system,                prevent degeneration.                 So the brain doesn't replace these neurons, and the stem cell                biology really comes into play when you've got a patient who's                missing a substantial portion and is now dysfunctional in terms                of their ability to move.                 It's a slow disease.  It progresses over years, often decades.                 There's a declining quality of life, and the disease is lethal.                 It affects more than a million people in the U.S. alone, and there's                no cure.                 In the context of PD, stem cell technology has promised two significant                advances that are not available in any other context or form.  A                single culture can create enough dopamine neurons to cure the entire                population of PD patients if we can get the technology to work.                              This may not necessarily be true in practice, and we heard one                reason why this might not be true, if there are limits to the ability                to expand the culture.  But a second reason and perhaps one that's                not very well explored by the Council is the ability to use ES cell                lines as a tool for research and particularly as a way of making                authentic human dopamine neuron for drug screening or high throughput                assays of some sort or another.                 Now, this is a very important point I'll come back to later.                              I'd like to go over the portfolio of the Fox Foundation and                just give you a picture of the research that's being funded                in PD by a private sponsor of research.  To date the foundation                has funded 28 million in Parkinson's related research overall.                 This is since our inception in late 2000.                 Twenty percent of that fund has gone to stem cell research of                one sort or another, and it's a carefully chosen array of stem                cell strategies in mouse, non-human primate, and human embryonic                stem cell systems.                 At the time the grants were funded, so beginning in 2000, very                few investigators had either the ability or access to human lines,                and by default rather than by design, at this point except for one                study, all of the studies that we fund use approved lines.                 Now, this will change in the near future, and we anticipate in                the next rounds that we may see a significant increase in the request                for funding on non-approved lines.  And in part, we feel this is                driven by the FDA and the requirement for lack of adventitious agents                and just the ease at getting a cell line product through the approval                process if it has been isolated without the use of the animal cell                lines or animal products that were not characterized.                 So we have seen in the past several years a significant increase                in requests for stem cell funding in the review of our funding portfolio                and our upcoming funding efforts so that we're attracting new                scientists, people who have not really used stem cell technology                in their research into the area of Parkinson's disease.                 So as a tool, it's an attractive tool for a scientist who                knows Parkinson's as a model, but now wants to expand their                repertoire to use a tool that seems to have much higher promise                than the current strategies they're using.  So we're seeing                an increase in new researchers in the field.                  In our annual fast track funding, this is an independent, investigator-initiated                pilot study where investigators send in unsolicited proposals.                 In 2001, we had roughly 200 applications in Parkinson's in general.                 Ten of these were stem cell applications.  The total request at                that point was just a little over a million dollars.                 In 2002, we had a similar number of total applications, and our                requests went up.  We had 12 requests.  Two and a half million dollars                would have funded all of those stem cell requests.                 And in our pending round in 2003, we have over 200 total applications                that we're anticipating, and more than 20 of these are stem                cell related.  And over time, we're seeing a significant increase                in both the application of stem cells to cell replacement in Parkinson's,                but more interestingly, a recognition of their utility as an  in                vitro  source of authentic human neurons, where people can study                drug effects or the genetics of Parkinson's disease itself.                 And these are studies that are not necessarily targeted at replacement,                but more at understanding the disease and then coming up with a                non-stem cell basis for treatment.                 So the foundation's experience has given us some insights                into what a moratorium would mean in terms of research on stem cells                and also what the current policy on federal funding is.  We have                a diverse portfolio.  We have studies on embryonic stem cells as                well as fetal stem cells and adult stem cells.  Many of these projects                were funded early in our round because the advisory board felt that                stem cell strategies had very high merit, and one of our first efforts                was in creating cell lines that could be used for transplantation.                              So we have now and unusual point of view where we can actually                compare the preliminary results from a variety of efforts.  After                two years of focused research, we can see that if this was a foot                race and we were comparing adult stem cells to fetal stem cells,                there's no competition.  There really is no race involved at                all.                 We have data generated from our funded research that shows that                the adult tissues are not presently a robust source of cells, particularly                when it comes to creating dopamine neurons in our focused effort                to treat Parkinson's disease.                 Optimists would say that there's still potential, and there                is still potential in leveraging the adult stem cell to our goals                as a Parkinson's research foundation.                 But to contrast the progress made in the same time frame with                embryonic stem cells, it's a fragile hope at best to say that                in the immediate future the adult cells hold the promise that we                had hoped two or three years ago that we would see in the research.                              So it is now clearly demonstrated  in vitro , and when we                started this was still an unknown, but now quite well established                in several of our funded laboratories that the human embryonic stem                cells can make authentic dopamine neurons.  What's left now                is the practical application of making this work in a transplant,                and these are ongoing studies.                 So I mentioned a moment ago the proliferative potential provides                a means to treat many individuals from a single isolate.  Unfortunately                our research experience is now encompassing a number of cell transplant                strategies.  The farthest along of these is fetal tissue transplantation                where you harvest from the fetal tissue an authentic dopamine neuron                and transplant that into a Parkinson's patient.                 One of the key observations now that we have had blinded clinical                trials tell us that there may be additional problems that were unforeseen,                a key point is the presence of a fairly robust immune response in                many of these patients, and this is something that cannot really                be ignored.                 I have to take my hat off right now and put on my own personal                hat so that I'm no longer a foundation representative here.                 I work in adult stem cell biology, and it's my hope that we                can make endogenous neural progenitors do the job of an embryonic                stem cell, but in studying the behavior of newborn neurons from                endogenous precursors, we have just run into a very serious impediment                that involves the immune system.                 The immune system, if activated in the context of a developing                neuron, essentially shuts off this early progenitor's ability                to make a functioning neuron, and if we're looking at cell transplantation                as a way to cure Parkinson's disease and the cell transplants                are not well matched to the host or if there isn't a strategy                for making the host tolerant, then having just a few lines is going                to be a very serious impediment to applying the existing lines to                clinical research.                 So getting back to the foundation portfolio, there is another                benefit to looking at additional lines of ES cells.  Putting cell                replacement aside and now looking at the technology that stem cells                in the culture dish provides, there's a body of research that                has been going on for nearly 20 years or more, and that's the                technology of transgenic animals and, more recently, the use of                embryonic stem cells in creating mice that carry very discrete genetic                mutations.                 Now, one of the strategies that we as a foundation trying to cure                Parkinson's disease contemplate is the value of having embryonic                stem cells that actually carry the genetic profile of a Parkinson's                patient, and although we're not talking today necessarily about                nuclear transfer technologies, this clearly pops into mind as a                strategy for making an  in vitro  authentic dopamine neuron                population that is identical to a class of patients that are presenting                a certain disease phenotype.                 So the disease is diverse.  It presents early and progresses rapidly                or it can present very late in life when a tottering gait is really                 commonplace in that age bracket and, therefore, it's not as                big of an effect.                 But this variability is really as variable as human life itself,                and so having 11 or 12 lines from normal individuals does not allow                us to access to that technology, and the creation of drugs that                would more readily target a type of dopamine neuron depletion or                a disease context.                 So the targeted manipulation of genes in an embryonic stem cell                is another aspect of this that is now just entering science, and                the ability to introduce genes into human ES cells or to target                mutations to an individual cell population obviously gives you a                potential way around this, but this is a technology that's novel.                              Nuclear transfer technology would circumvent that.  It gives us                the baseline from which to understand how to create ES cells through                a non-embryonic process, but there has to be a way to get from Point                A to Point B, and this is where the additional lines and the exploration                of new technologies comes into play.                 I'd like to finalize or just summarize here with an overview                of current research concerns.  In the near term, human ES cells                are already undergoing efficacy trials in preclinical models.  So                human ES cells, as we heard earlier, are in animals, and there's                great hope that we'll see that they're at least as effective,                if not more so, if the immune complications can be overcome than                the fetal tissue transplants that are so commonplace now.                 To move forward with these lines, there are several limitations                with current policy that seem to inhibit our progress as a foundation                that's trying to promote cure or intervention in stem cells.                 The first is what I've targeted mostly in my presentation, and                that's the heterogeneity of these current cell lines and limited                numbers.                 So if you start with a few lines and the cell lines are heterogeneous,                some will make, in our experience, a lot of dopamine neurons, and                others really seem to be impeded in their ability to respond to                the same cues provided in the same dish.                 So in this preliminary data that we see presented in summarizing                our funded work, we're observing that one line will work beautifully                well in a paradigm.  Another line is basically eliminated from the                study because it has an inability to make enough dopamine neurons                to be useful.                 So heterogeneity in the performance of an individual line may                limit what can be done with the existing lines, and of course, the                absence of genetic diversity within the existing lines, the absence                of a representation of disease genotype is limiting in what can                be done at the research bench in understanding the disease process,                and of course, heterogeneity in HLA matching may be a very serious                concern, and it will require additional complexity and treatment                if we don't have a matched donor and host or fairly stringent                strategies for tolerizing the host to the incoming cells.                 Finally, I think there is this question that's been touched                upon quite broadly today, and that's the presence of adventitious                agents in the existing lines and whether or not the foundation's                research can transition quickly to clinic really depends on how                well an existing line can meet FDA requirements.                 And I've heard that this is possible, but it also places an                extreme burden of follow-up on a funded project that makes it difficult                for a private foundation to fund.                 So in the absence of federal funding, is private support really                up to the task?  And I think really to summarize this, the private                foundation's focus is to pilot research, to find very good strategies                or promising strategies, and that's where our funding really                runs out.  The NIH has typically stepped in at that point, after                the pilot study stage, and proceeded with the larger experiments,                the validation, the expansion.                 If the foundation funds unapproved lines, that has nowhere to                go at this point.  So there is a serious concern that though we                may be able to use private funding to our benefit, that there will                be a stall or serious delay in getting this to clinic.                 So these burdens loom particularly large to us as a foundation                as the Baby Boomers age, and the number of Parkinson's patients                increases.  The social and economic costs go well beyond just the                Parkinson's community, and I think the economic costs in terms                of the cost of clinical care is just one part of it.  The economic                cost in delayed development of drugs because we cannot use in the                public sector privately funded ES lines for drug screening or nuclear                transfer lines for screening, lines that carry a disease phenotype.                              I think this is an economic burden that our society has to face                and one that should be very carefully weighed in the Council's                discussion.                 I think the foundation very much appreciates the ability and the                invitation here to give our experiences, and we understand that                you have a very difficult task ahead of you as counsel to the President,                and we thank you for this opportunity.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you very much, Dr. Palmer.                 Mr. Pursley, please.                   MR. PURSLEY:   Yes.  Thank you.                 Thank you for having Osiris here.  We've been involved in                mesenchymal stem cell, adult stem cell research for about 11 years                now.  Our technology came out of Arnie Kaplan's lab and was                acquired from Case Western at that time, and we've been solely                focused in that area since on several applications.                 Our development strategy is very straightforward.  It's tissue                engraftment and regeneration without immune suppression.                  Let me back up a moment, too, to set the record straight.  In                some of the earlier media documents, it has me as a Ph.D.  I'm                not a scientist or a physician.  I'm a businessman, and if my                technical explanations aren't satisfactory, most of what I'm                going to report on is published or we believe will be published                in acceptable peer review journals, and in fact, correct me if I'm                wrong.  This panel should have been provided privately an embargoed                manuscript that will be submitted.                 Okay.  Our technology is the universal application, and I'll                explain that term in a moment, of adult MSCs, or mesenchymal stem                cells, with no  in vitro  manipulation.  In other words, if                you will, these very smart cells do what they do  in vivo .                 We simply put them in there and let them go, so to speak.  And I'll                define that in some of our programs.                 What I mean by universal application, we started out as an autologous                cell company and later found out that we can provide from any donor,                unrelated, HLA unmatched, any donor these cells to any recipient                without immune rejection.                 And in fact, what you'll see in our first program, we found                them to be immune selective, T cell-suppressive in some instances.                 So we are now working on what would be literally an off-the-shelf                product for whatever the indication may be.                 The process we use under anappropriate IRB protocol, again, we                take an unrelated, unmatched, volunteer adult donor.  We take a                bone marrow aspirate, a whole marrow aspirate from the iliac crest,                bring that back to our manufacturing, and then we will culture and                expand that currently to about 1,000 doses from one donor.                 We are going through an expansion now that's not a change                in process.  It's an expansion of process.  We will ultimately                get that to about 10,000 doses per single donor.                 A very nice advantage of this is that we don't have to expand                cells indefinitely.  We can go back to new donors.  Currently one                donor can provide bone marrow six times in their lifetime.  These                are usually younger people because the younger you are, the more                MSCs you have.                 We will then cryopreserve the finished product in liquid nitrogen,                and at that point it is ready to go to clinic for use.  We also                now have done stability and potency testing to have that stored                at a lesser temperature over X period of time in certain containers                so that it's easier for the hospitals to use.                 The safety of these cells in the universal application has been                proven now.  Allogenic MSCs have been given to 56 human beings.                 Thousands of various animals models have been used, rats, mice,                goats, dogs, pigs, and baboons.                 This has been done in conjunction with the NIH, Hopkins, Cedar-Sinai,                Texas Heart, et cetera.  And at this point, over several years now,                there has been no possibly or probably related serious adverse events                associated with MSCs.  This includes no infusion or direct administrative                toxicity.  There's no ectopic tissue formation.  In other words,                they aren't differentiating in cartilage  in the heart, on the                knee, et cetera, and there is no tumor formation at this time.                 And, in fact, we have two lead programs in Phase 2, which by definition                from the agency standards, the FDA, means we have met their safety                standards for biologic in order to move into Phase 2.  So we are                very happy to report we see and now the agency sees these cells                as safe, allowing us to move into Phase 2.                 Now, the precise mechanism of action regarding this universal                application is not known.  All we do know is apparently there are                certain cell surface characteristics of the MSC that do not elicit                an immune response, and in fact, as I said, as you'll see in                our first indication, are actually immune suppressive.                 As far as how close are we to developing therapies, our first                two programs are in Phase 2.  The first is peripheral blood stem                cell transplant support for patients with hematologic malignancies,                and again, forgive me if you're very familiar with this pathology,                but basically if you have a leukemia, a myeloma, a lymphoma, et                cetera, a blood cancer, you receive total body irradiation and/or                chemotherapy, with the goal of obliterating the bone marrow because                that's the source of the cancered blood.                 These patients then need to receive a transplant.  They receive                a peripheral blood transplant of hematopoietic stem cells so they                can produce enough platelets to clot and white cells to fight infection                and red blood cells for volume, and gain a natural state of hematopoiesis.                              And those cells usually come from a sibling or a parent.  The                problem is for these patients who have no choice but to go through                this, ten percent and up to 20 percent can actually die from this                procedure, with the vast majority of graft versus host disease,                and that means the hematopoietic stem cells are rejecting the recipient.                              And so what we did in a Phase 1, in a multi-center Phase 1, is                provide MSCs, mesenchymal stem cells approximately four hours prior                to the transplantation with, first of all, in a Phase 1, the primary                goal for a biologic is always safety, and you look for secondary                efficacy trends, which are great if you reach them, and we did in                a very big way.                 What we did is reduce significantly graft versus host disease.                 So we believe there was a T cell suppressive effect in working with                the patient or with the hematopoietic stem cells not to reject the                patient, if you will.                 Now, the reason we say selective T cells suppressive, these Phase                1 patients are now out three years.  They have also had a significant                reduction in return of the cancer, which means we did not suppress                the T cells fighting GVL, graft versus leukemia.                 This was a very big concern.  If these are immune suppressive,                are we going to hurt the patient's own ability to fight the                cancer coming back?  And what we've seen at three years out                is this is not only not the case.  They have a less incidence of                return of the cancer.                 So with those data we are in Phase 2. This is an IV preparation.                 The status is we should have Phase 2 data reportable in time Q3                of '04.                 If that goes well, we will go into a Phase 3, and this should                be available to the hematologic malignancy population if things                go as planned, and Murphy has a way of raising his head in this                business and always will, but even with some of those considerations,                we would hope to be commercially available to humans by 2007 with                this.                 Just after that program, a very similar situation but a different                mechanism of action, which is the amazing thing about these cells.                 That was a T cell suppression effect to reduced GVHD.  In a similar                sense there are infants to adolescents primarily who don't have                matched donors who will receive cord blood transplants, and their                problem is not GVHD because there are so few hematopoietic stem                cells in the  cord blood transplants.  Their problem is establishing                a natural hematopoiesis.                 So some of these kids will lay in the hospital an average of about                90 days.  It's fairly replete in the literature, and they aren't                released from the hospital until they produce enough platelets to                get out, and so they can sit for 90 days in a subacute state with                bleeds and infections, et cetera.                 This is a tiny population.  It's an orphan indication, but                there's nothing that can be done for these, and in  a Phase                1 study with an admittedly retrospective comparison to that database.                 All of these kids are in a single database in the U.S.                 Our primary goal was to decrease the time to platelet engraftment,                to get these kids out of the hospital and establish a natural hematopoiesis,                and the kids that received MSCs got out in an average of about 38                days compared to retrospective control, historical control of 90.                              And so that program is in Phase 2, and we hope it would be available                also to humans in the '07 time frame.                 The very large and much more talked about program, our cardiac                program for acute MI, will be in humans this December in conjunction                with Boston Scientific.  Most of this preclinical work was done                in swine models at Cedar-Sinai and Hopkins, and the primary goal                here is for these cells to reshape the baseline morphology, the                heart, and regain the baseline function of the heart pre-MI.                 It is fantastic preclinical data, and I say that with humility                after looking at preclinical data for 24 years in this business.                 After you see so many pig hearts grow back and get back to normal                function, you start to believe it.                 And the IND has been filed, and the FDA will allow us to go into                clinic at the NIH and Duke this December.                 The idea here, too, in this indication, something we just found                out in '99 in rats, this will be an IV administration.  It is                not a direct injection or catheter application to the heart.  Apparently                these very smart cells — and I can call them that because I'm                not a scientist — find their way to an inflammatory site.                  And an acute MI is a very strong inflammatory event, and an inflammatory                cascade that probably lasts in a strong manner for seven or eight                days.  And basically these are given IV.  They swim to the heart.                 They regenerate the infarcted area of the heart, which the heart                doesn't then respond with a compensatory thickening like normal,                and that happens in about four to six weeks, and in about six months                the heart gets very close back to pre-MI function.                 And if that gets in the clinic in December as planned, and it                should, these are going to be much larger trials because of acute                MI.  We would like to think that this product could be available                to the public commercially in 2009 or 2010.                 The next product which we have an IND filed for and will be in                humans before the end of '04 is meniscal repair in the knee.                 This is the most common knee injury at least in this country.  There's                about 850,000 meniscal tears, from the Weekend Warriors.  This will                be a high regulatory bar.  It should be.  These are healthy young                people normally, and so the safety is going to be critical.                 Preclinical work has been done in 72 goats, and basically what                we do is do a partial to full meniscectomy as is done with the patients.                 There's nothing you can do for this today but take out part                or all of the meniscectomy to ease the pain.  After whole or partial                meniscectomy, it is replete in the literature that one goes on to                develop osteoarthritis.                And what we do is give about 150 million cells directly into the                knee, and it grows back the meniscus in about six weeks time, and                hopefully then it will obviate any progression to osteoarthritis,                and we hope to be in the clinic with that as well in, again, '04                and, again, should be commercially available to humans in a similar                time as the acute MI product in '09 or '10.                 The last advanced program, also in concert with Boston Scientific,                is maybe the largest unmet definitive therapy  in terms of societal                cost, and that's congestive heart failure or, maybe more appropriately,                chronic ischemia leading to congestive heart failure.  At Texas                Heart, in the canine model, we put an amaroid occluder in place                in these dogs to mimic chronic ischemia.  Basically you do that                for about 30 days until you create an ischemic model.                 About 30 days later you give the MSCs.  The ejection fraction                in the amaroid occluded non-treated dogs, once it drops below 17                percent, they die.  The ejection fraction in the treated dogs with                the occluded, LAD still in place, the occlusion remaining in place,                goes back to normal function in about six months.                 So basically we've restored the heart morphology and the baseline                heart function pre-ischemic model with the amaroid occluder in place,                and there is possibly some form of angiogenesis going on here.                 So those are the advanced programs, and in all of these programs                and all of the animal models to this date, there have been no serious                adverse events associated with MSCs, again, neither infusional toxicity,                ectopic foci, or tumor formation.                 Finally, we have many, many orthopedic models in a preclinical                area where we will or will not use a scaffolding or a matrix for                these cells in some of those applications.                 And finally, we are involved in grants from DARPA and NIST looking                at wound healing and CNS repair, respectively.                 As far as what obstacles stand in the way, the usual.  One is                enough money, especially in today's very tight private equity                market, and it's probably going to stay that way until the IPO                lid comes off.                 Cell biology talent.  We will be forever understanding what goes                on with these, which leads to another point I'll get to in a                moment.                 And then one, to put into an equal bag where we can all take an                equal share of guilt, and that's politics, corporate greed,                and academic ego, which is a bane always in the development of any                of these, and I don't say this lightly.  Again, as a personal                comment after being involved in this 24 years and being fortunate                enough to be at Genentech when they grew up and then at Genzyme                when they grew up and at TKT with maybe the most elegant protein                technology I've ever seen.  Have never seen anything like this.                              The hardest thing about managing this company is keeping it focused.                 There is no application that can't be brought up that we can                deny the possibility of the use of these cells or cells like this.                               Bill Krivits up at Minnesota has given these to kids with lysosomal                storage diseases and they are not transduced.  They just start secreting                the enzyme they're missing.                 The immune modulation possibility now that we found out almost                serendipitously with our first program, that's a whole new area                of arthritis, et cetera.  It literally is limited by our imagination,                and it's bigger than any of those entities I mentioned by far.                 It is the closest thing — and I'm sorry for the drama — of a                human health care miracle that I've seen in a quarter century.                              And I just hope somehow those entities can synergize to bring                this as quickly as possible and as safely as possible to the millions                and millions of people.                 As far as approaches to overcome immune reaction, we don't                have any.  We have found that there is no immune reaction against                these cells, and not only that.  We have found them to be immune                suppressive selectively in appropriate situations.                 As far as the federal policy impact, depending on what your patent                portfolio is, that drives your answer on this.  Right now we think                from the Patent Office's perspective it's a very good thing.                 We have had senior scientists that have stuck with this from the                beginning because they believe with this their inventions have been                protected, and it is allowed to go on in a protected manner to develop                those.                 As far as the NIH, again, anything that can be done by that institution                to further synergize itself with commercial endeavors without feeling                it is bastardizing its academic purity, and exactly what that means                and how that is getting done we don't have an answer, and I                don't know who does, but it certainly could help all efforts.                              And the FDA, first of all, I want to say, again, in a long experience                over several technologies, they have been a very good partner with                us in this, and we appreciate that.  We're a tiny company.                 We need a lot of guidance, and it hasn't been an adversarial                situation.   It has been a partnership situation, and anything to                continue to increase that.                 We are in the good fortune of being by far the most advanced company                in the world in adult stem cell research, and so it has got to be                in partnership with the FDA that we understand how these are to                be regulated because I think that will set the bar for how it is                done from this point on.                 I think one of the things that will be looked at, and we have                to understand where we draw the line to accept, is especially in                the technology where everything is happening  in vivo , basically                from a cell that's the same  ex vivo .  Without all of                the black box answers for mechanism of action, why, how, where,                how long known is how that will be weighed against the actual clinical                outcomes of safety and efficacy and how that regulatory guide pole                is looked at is critical.                 Thank you very much.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you very much.                 Dr. Goldstein, please.                  DR. GOLDSTEIN:   Chairman Kass and members of the President's                Council on Bioethics, thank you very much for inviting me to testify                today.                 I'm the Chief Scientific Officer for the Juvenile Diabetes                Research Foundation.                 JDRF was founded in 1970 by parents of children with juvenile                diabetes to find a cure for diabetes and its complications through                the support of research, and this year we expect to fund approximately                $90 million worth of research.                 Since its inception JDRF has funded diabetes research all over                the world, and it turns out it's the world's leading nonprofit,                non-governmental funder of diabetes research.                 At your July 25th meeting, you heard from Charles Queenan, a JDRF                volunteer, who spoke about the advances in islet cell transplantation                that are showing dramatic results in people with Type I diabetes.                 I'd like to briefly summarize.                 As of April 2003, more than 250 patients worldwide had received                islets infusions using the so-called Edmondton protocol.  About                half of these patients received islets alone.  The other half received                islets in conjunction with or after a kidney transplant.                 Most patients have enjoyed insulin independence, reduced hypoglycemic                episodes, and improved quality of life.                 Despite this success, there are too few insulin producing cells                available from organ donors that at its max could help perhaps five,                six, 700 people a year.  JDRF, therefore, believes that embryonic                stem cell research could lead to the discovery of new ways to develop                additional and unlimited supplies of insulin producing beta cells                with the hope that everyone with the disease can be treated and                cured.                 With this background, I want to cover some of the activities that                JDRF is engaged in over the past several years in the United States                and abroad to help advance the embryonic stem cell research agenda.                              In the spring of 2000, we announced our intention to support embryonic                stem cell research.  We began to build a research portfolio that                promoted human and animal stem cell research.                 To insure the ethical conduct of this research we formed a stem                cell oversight committee consisting of leading researchers, policy                makers, ethicists, and lay volunteers who were charged with providing                a second level of review in addition to the usual scientific peer                review for all human stem cell research applications that we received                and considered.                 We recognize that stem cell research may require innovative and                novel public/private partnerships, and we included in our request                or solicitation the notation that we would support the derivation                of human embryonic stem cell lines.                 The scientific principles that form the basis for stem cell research                funding program is as follows.  We recognize the need to support                research using human stem cells from all sources and that  very                basic research is the necessary precursor for the development of                cell based therapies; that adult stem cell research is a complementary                approach.  We have long supported efforts in both adult stem cell                research, as well as more recently human embryonic stem cell research.                              JDRF believes in providing a collaborative environment that will                encourage or maximize the opportunity and promise of this research,                and we work to insure easy and public dissemination  of embryonic                stem cell lines without major restrictions as to the usage, and                we're committed to sharing information and data as they become                available.                 We also participate in forums for public dialogue and dissemination                information.                 JDRF embryonic stem cell research activities today include everything                that I mentioned, cells from all sources.  This year we have applied                approximately $6 million in support of stem cell research with out-year                commitments of about $16 million over the next four years.  Of the                $6 million this year, about three million is for research to direct                the differentiation into glucose-responsive, insulin- producing                cells using human embryonic stem cells as starting material.  About                two million is for research using human stem cells from other sources,                and one million for animal work.                 About one third of JDRF's funding for human embryonic stem                cell research supports work done in the United States.  The rest                supports research outside the United States where in many cases                investigators work in more favorable environments, often with special                government programs that provide extra resources for human embryonic                stem cell research efforts, for example, Sweden, the United Kingdom,                Australia, and Singapore.                 We initially received very few applications from U.S. based investigators,                perhaps related to concerns over policies and restrictions.  We                have received consistent feedback from U.S. investigators that they                are wary of entering this field even with private funding due to                the limitations imposed by the federal policy.                 They, in addition, mentioned a limited number of federally approved                lines, the lack of genetic diversity among the lines, insufficient                characterization, variability in the developmental capacities of                the lines, difficulties in distribution, as well as the ubiquitous                presence of the mass feeder layers which we've been discussing                which make the development of clinically useful cell therapies not                impossible, but more difficult as has been mentioned.                 These barriers we feel need to be removed to increase the value                of using the approved stem cell lines for research and then for                the development of therapies.  We acknowledge and recognize the                efforts of the NIH, particularly the NIH stem cell task force, and                we are working closely with NIH on this.                 But I think that it's our international partnerships that                are pertinent to the conversation this afternoon.                 JDRF's international efforts have continued and been expanded                in the area of stem cell research both through independent funding                of investigators, as well as through partnerships directly with                other governments.  We have established a series of co-funding partnerships                with government research agencies in the United Kingdom, Sweden,                Canada, Australia, France and Singapore, and we have ongoing discussions                with others.                 In some of these partnerships, local foundations within those                countries also provide support.                 In addition, in many of those countries, we have provided funding                for very basic embryonic stem cell research that was not necessarily                connected to diabetes in any particular way since the research was                at the earliest stage.                 Because of our extensive international work and leadership, JDRF                was invited in January 2003 to be a founding member of the International                Stem Cell Forum established by the Medical Research Council of the                United Kingdom under the leadership of Professor Sir George Radda.                              This group currently includes representatives from government                agencies in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Finland, France,                Germany, Israel, Japan, Singapore, Sweden, and the Netherlands,                as well as the NIH.                 The objectives of the forum are to encourage collaborative research                across nations, boundaries, and disciplines; to encourage sharing                of resources and data; to fully capitalize on the existing available                human stem cell lines; to identify key research gaps and address                these by capitalizing on national strength; and to identify funding                schemes that actually facilitate transnational collaborations.                 In specific terms, this group has agreed to develop a set of criteria                that could be adopted globally for optimizing the derivation characterization                and maintenance of human stem cell lines from all sources; identify                a small number of international laboratories that would commit to                using the agreed criteria to characterize existing human embryonic                stem cell lines; and to identify opportunities for sharing resources,                cell lines, data protocols, and guidance documents on an international                basis; to coordinate or make an attempt to coordinate national stem                cell banking activities.                 This group has already convened a working group to characterize                stem cell lines with a series of recommendations.                 The United Kingdom has one of the more progressive environments                for stem cell research as a consequence of the British government                providing strong political, regulatory, and funding support in this                area.  The recent establishment of the U.K. Stem Cell Bank is one                example.  This will provide access to existing and new quality controlled                adult, fetal, and embryonic stem cell lines.  It will have a good                manufacturing practice arm for research leading to clinical applications.                              Academic researchers and companies from the U.K. and elsewhere                will be eligible to deposit and to access lines according to a code                of practice developed by interested parties.                 This bank will serve as an outstanding example of how to foster                and enhance the research needed to develop therapies from stem cells                of all kinds.                 Other countries are working toward the development of similar                resources, and it is envisioned that the International Stem Cell                Forum may serve to coordinate such activities in order to enhance                the exchange of information and to provide complementary efforts                in this burgeoning field of research.                 Examples of activities under consideration include the establishment                of a registry posted on an international Web site that would provide                appropriate scientific information about lines not listed in the                current NIH registry; characterization of non-NIH registry lines,                and comparison with NIH lines; in addition, joint training programs                to assist new investigators.                 Organizing and coordinating these international research activities                in order to better serve research efforts everywhere provides a                model that is highly likely to bring results to the clinic much                sooner.                 Well, this summarizes research activities to date.  I do not want                to provide the impression that these international activities, for                example, can replace the resources which the federal government                and United States could provide for this research.                 The limitations imposed by the current policy raise questions                and provoke uncertainties about the future  of human embryonic stem                cell research in the United States.  We think that one result is                fewer scientists working, fewer graduate students, postdocs, et                cetera, and universities who have less than an active willingness                to invest in facilities, a comment that was made earlier in the                afternoon.                 These resources could make a significant difference to research                progress in the development of insulin producing beta cells for                the cure of diabetes, and in this area, they need to establish and                nurture collaborations between the world's experts in beta cell                biology and the world's experts in stem cell biology so they                can collectively conduct the necessary research.  It remains a critical                event.                 Expanded federal embryonic stem cell policy would make an important                difference in helping promote this research.                 Much of the current knowledge of beta cell development comes from                studies using mass embryonic stem cells that is not always easily                translatable into human work.  Several protocols, however, have                been reported that direct mass embryonic stem cells to becoming                functioning islet cells.  Early studies in human embryonic stem                cells suggest that they could be coached, though at the moment inefficiently                to insulin secreting cells, and this work has gone a little more                slowly than we would like.                 We do continue to support research on the differentiation of adult                precursor cells into beta cells, but that's a severely limited                field in terms of how successful it has been.                 Progress to date does underscore the need for continued investment                in research in this area, including the creation of an environment                in the United States that encourages and supports scientific discovery.                              The potential for this research to have a positive impact on the                maybe 100 million Americans who suffer from a wide variety of diseases                and injuries who might benefit is just too great to be ignored.                              Thank you for your invitation, your time, and your consideration.                               CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you, Dr. Goldstein.                 Thank all of your for your fine presentations.                  Let me just throw the floor open.  Let me, so that everybody knows                where we are, we started late.  We were originally scheduled to                go to 5:15.  Let's go to at least 5:25 and get people's                questions out so that we take advantage of our guests who traveled                so far to be with us.                 So, please, Jim Wilson.                  PROF. WILSON:   Several of you referred to the political                uncertainty of stem cell research in the United States, and in the                course of making these remarks, you listed many possibilities.                 I would like to know from you as briefly as possible what you think                is the chief political uncertainty.                 Is it money?  Is it stem cell lines?  Is it the number of researchers                or what?  What is the political uncertainty that you're concerned                about?                  DR. OKARMA:   Well, the quick answer is all of the above                that you just mentioned.  If I were to prioritize them, it is the                pure political process of taking scientific inquiry out of the hands                and hearts of the scientists and into the halls of Congress.                 Can the environment worsen with a different administration or                with the same administration?  These are exactly the things that                our investors tell us that they are concerned about.                 But the fact that there is a very thin infrastructure to complement                what we are doing at Geron, what other folks that you've heard                are doing here makes the risk higher to achieve a commercialable                and safe and effective product.  They are intimately intertwined.                               PROF. WILSON:   That is true, but Congress has always, since                1938, placed under legislation by its action important therapeutic                regimes that might affect the safety or health of other people.                 Is this supposed to be exempt from that?                  DR. OKARMA:   I'd like to hear an example of that that                compares to the —                  PROF. WILSON:   Well, the FDA constantly regulates.                  DR. OKARMA:   That's not political; that's not congressional.                 This is different.                  PROF. WILSON:   Oh, there's a difference between the                FDA and Congress?  You'll have to explain that to me.                  DR. OKARMA:   I think there certainly is.                  PROF. WILSON:   Anyone else have a response?                  DR. GOLDSTEIN:   The universities during the past two years-plus,                since the administration's policy, have had a variety of information                coming.  As Dr. Zerhouni told you, it has only been since his arrival                that the stem cell task force was created.  So some time was lost.                              The most simplest example that I can give you is the confusion                over the application of federal policy to indirect cost of university                researchers, and it has only been in the past four to six months                where people have accepted the notion that they can do federally                funded research next door to privately funded research without getting                in trouble.                 The clarification of that was painfully slow, and people just                didn't hop on the bandwagon immediately.                 The second part, I think, has to do with what investigators tell                us, is it takes me six to eight months to work through my research                office to get a material transfer agreement to get one cell line                at $5,000.  I'm hardly likely to be interested in studying two,                three, or more at that pace and would prefer some more economical                and more free distribution of more well characterized material.                              So that inherent slowness is not exactly a terrific ingredient                for promoting and expediting research in a new area.  It's one                reason why the international community, for example, has taken a                very strong position to complement the NIH activity and make materials,                information available on a more free exchange environment.                 And you know, it's in a time when budgets for funding research                worldwide seem to be down.  I would point out that the U.K., Japan                have put special extra money at this topic because they view it                as an opportunity.  That coincident with decreases in their regular                research budgets.                 So people see this as a major opportunity.                  PROF. WILSON:   Thank you.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Alfonso.                   DR. FOSTER:   Jim, were you through?                  PROF. WILSON:   Yes.                   DR. FOSTER:   Dr. Okarma, I wanted to ask one question                that I wasn't sure about.  You emphasized the oligodendrocyte                as one of your chief cells that was moving on.  You said you were                working on this in spinal cord injury, but I presume this would                be some myelinating agent in something like MS or multiple sclerosis                or something as well.  I don't know that, but the question would                be if you put in a differentiated cell and let's say you have                a balance between, you know, some autoimmune disease that's                demyelinating and an oligodendrocyte that's myelinating, the                question I was going to ask is that apparently a lot of times there's                a block in the oligodendrocyte capacity to myelinate because there's                a block in the movement from the pre-oligodendrocyte to the oligodendrocyte                by, you know, a jagged notch interaction or something like that.                              So I guess the question I'm asking:  is this differentiated                cell going to be — we've talked about the problem of immune                rejection and things like that — but is there another problem in                certain diseases of differentiated cells that they might not work                because of the primary disease that's present?                  DR. OKARMA:   That's precisely correct, and we have                yet done no work on systemic autoimmune based demyelinating diseases,                although to your point, they could potentially be subject to — we                have only worked on oligodendrocyte precursors in acute spinal cord                injury.                   DR. FOSTER:   Thank you very much.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Alfonso Gomez-Lobo.                  DR. GÓMEZ-LOBO:   I don't know who this question                is going to go to.  Probably Dr. Okarma.                 I understand my charge here in this Council primarily as a duty                to worry about bioethics.  I mean this is a Council on Bioethics,                and that's the way I see my social role in this context.                 And one of the things that worries me is that in these presentations,                in these wonderful presentations you have made, I don't see                that dimension.  For instance, it's one thing for there to be                political problems and perhaps concentrated on Congress, but I think                that there's the larger context of the whole nation and there's                the larger context of our lives and of the respect we owe to each                other, et cetera.                 And then the question arises:   shouldn't we see a problem                in the fact that a blastocyst that we know could be implanted and                continue its journey towards being like one of us, if that's                destroyed to extract the embryonic stem cells, whether we should                not worry at all about that?  Is that a reason why some people may                have serious doubts not about the benefits, but about the means                to obtain these benefits?                  DR. OKARMA:   Well, first, sir, I was specifically asked                not to address those concerns, but let me assure you that they are                very prominent in the culture of our company.  Approximately six                months after I arrived at Geron in December of '97, I formed                an ethics advisory board to discuss precisely those issues both                for my own uncertainties, to more vigorously and rigorously dissect                the issues as viewed by different Western religious traditions,                as well as secular perspectives, and to expose the workers in the                company to this body and have them ask their own questions of it,                which has helped us enormously and has informed us about the issues                of moral status and has comforted us in our position that this is                not an ends justifies the means argument, but that the special circumstances,                the scalability, the biological diversity, the normalness of the                cells that we're able to manufacture from a single stem cell                line made from a single embryo destined for destruction tilts the                moral seesaw in our direction.                 And we are intellectually and emotionally convinced of that point.                               DR. GÓMEZ-LOBO:   May I?                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Do you want to respond?                  DR. GÓMEZ-LOBO:   Fair enough.  Now, that's a                straightforward utilitarian argument, and someone may say that,                you know, even one adult could be sacrificed for many.  So there                are serious problems with that argument.                 Let me leave it at that.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Does someone else want to respond to the                question as put before I call on someone else?                 Dr. Goldstein.                  DR. GOLDSTEIN:   I would like to make a general comment                that we took the issue so seriously that we added an additional                layer of oversight, and the charge to the committee was to provide                and consider and revisit issues as they come up.                 We assumed this was going to be a dynamic field, and this committee                developed guidelines.  It watches over and it considers many aspects                that we don't consider with typical research grants, with typical                research grants that the IRB approves and you have all of the signatures                on.                 So I think it has been taken in extremely serious ways.  I don't                have a specific response about, yes, this is the correct or incorrect                or that kind of thing, but we made this effort because we saw this                as an issue, and we decided we needed a serious way to deal with                it.                 And this committee reports directly to our board.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Janet, Janet Rowley.                  DR. ROWLEY:   I'd like further discussion in two areas,                and I suspect  that maybe it's both Dr. Okarma and Dr. Palmer                who might respond to this.                 First, I was surprised at your discussion of your funding problems                at Geron and the fact that you're only a third of the size of                a year ago because implicit in much of what has been written and                discussed earlier this morning, the assumption was that the federal                funding wasn't going to be important because private funding                was so robust and we could sit back and let the private sector take                care of it.                 And you've raised some question about that more rosy view.                              I have another question though about the role of nonapproved cell                lines.  So in a sense, both of you are counting on these nonapproved                cell lines because they will obviate the need for feeder cell layers                and things of that sort.  But how do you view these being used in                the future or being of benefit or are they only going to be of use                outside of the United States and not be available for use for American                citizens?                  DR. OKARMA:   Well, first, let me clarify the premise of                your question.  There's no uncertainty that the current lines                in Menlo Park that we have qualified for human use can go forward                into early stage human trials.  They are robust.  They are clean.                 They differentiate repeatedly in the directions that we want them                to go.                 But they are xenogeneic, and they will eventually die off, we                think.  We have no evidence for that yet, but we think it's                the conservative and appropriate assumption to make, that these                cells, despite their telomerase expression will not be immortal,                as is a tumor cell.                 So for those two reasons, their natural life span and the desire                to improve by taking advantage of what we've learned from the                existing derivation protocols and improving them, putting those                derivation procedures under GMP with completely qualified and pedigreed                reagents so that even the antibody used to purify the growth factor                has never seen a murine antibody; that's what we're talking                about about GMP cell lines.                 And that is a normal progression within the entire field of cell                therapy, and we think we are ahead of everyone in the restricted                arena of embryonic stem cells.  So stay tuned for that announcement.                              The issue, as you correctly point out, is that those cells by                definition of the current government policy will not be available                for study by U.S. government funded entities, and there's no                question, as you correctly imply, that the international community                will be very anxious to get their hands on those cell lines.                  DR. PALMER:   I'd like to add then to that the idea                of heterogeneity.  If you're a publicly funded entity and would                like to explore the utility of these cells and you find that only                a few will perform the way that you are interested in and then only                a few of those will work in a portion of the patients that you are                interested in treating, then the new lines become absolutely critical;                that you could not cure Parkinson's.  You could treat a few                people.  If the cell lines run out, then you're done.                 So it is a critical aspect of expanding the research to a level                where it's self-sustaining.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Bill Hurlbut.  I'm sorry.  Excuse me.                 Michael and then Bill.                  PROF. SANDEL:   This is a question for Dr. Palmer, and it                goes back to something that Paul McHugh said in this morning's                discussion.  He was giving an interpretation, a sympathetic interpretation,                of the President's current policy allowing the use of private                funds but not public funds for new embryonic stem cell lines and                limiting public funding to the preexisting.                 And the way that Paul interpreted that was as a challenge to scientists                to say, ""All right.  Within this limited area, show us what                you can do.  Show us that there's not just speculative promise,                but that there's genuine progress.  Show us.  Let the burden                be on you scientists to show us not only that, but also that redeeming                that progress depends on going beyond the 12 approved stem lines                that are currently available for distribution, and show us also                that redeeming that genuine progress requires federal funding for                more than the existing approved cell lines.""                 Now, much as I heard your comment, you were speaking in that spirit,                addressing that kind of challenge with respect very concretely to                Parkinson's, but I wonder if you could just, taking that challenge                directly of Paul, address to him in a summary way the answer.                 As I understood your testimony just now, you in effect think you                already now have the answer for Paul, and then I'd be interested                to hear Paul's response.                  DR. PALMER:   Let me speak about data that I have seen,                but it's still proprietary and confidential in a general sense.                 In funding stem cell research, about half of our stem cell effort                is in embryonic stem cells, and the remainder divided between adult                stem cells and fetal stem cells.                 Within the embryonic stem cell projects, several of these proposals,                their specific aim was to contrast and compare cell lines that were                available to them, and what we have seen in the data that they present                is that there is beyond a shadow of a doubt huge potential to create                authentic dopamine neurons from human ES cells.                 That's good.  The problem is that within the limited number                of cell lines that they have tested that potential is hugely variable.                 These are cell lines that are theoretically pluripotent, and they                should be equivalent embryonic lines.  If you look at a picture                of them in the dish, they look strikingly different from line to                line, which has the stamp of their history, which cell lines they                have been exposed to, which sera they had applied to them, which                growth factors were used in their preparation in isolation.                 And this history of experience from these ES cells then imprints                them to behave a certain way when their context is suddenly if they're                asked to produce a dopamine neuron.                 So the heterogeneity tells me as a scientist that we have a problem,                that some of these lines may work some of the time for some of the                applications, but they will not all work for all applications.                 And this is a very strong argument for expanding the variety and                the heterogeneity of the lines that we currently have access to.                 Eleven or 12 is not enough.                  DR. McHUGH:   Yes, thank you very much, Michael, for asking                that question because it was rather what I wanted to ask.  But I                have two responses to that.                 First of all, the heterogeneity that you mentioned may or may                not be so compelling as to not allow you to find, after all, these                are immortal cells, and if you get one or two or three lines from                the 12 and the expansion of things that are going, you may well                be able to tell us that you're already achieving with what we                have in front of us adequate things for the future.  That's                the first thing.                 But more importantly to me, anyway, was what you said about the                issues of the autoimmune problem and how you thought that the autoimmune                problem was going to be the telling one as you have seen the cells                die in the process when they're exposed in this way in a foreign                turf and you looked forward to the opportunity perhaps of using                somatic cell nuclear transplantation to develop dopamine cells that                were, in fact, from the person themselves.                 And I wanted to say that I, of course, have spoken in this conference                that I think that that is going to be the way in which embryonic                cells ultimately will — as one of the ways that will get to this                source of cells in ways that we will have to look more closely at                its ethical basis and I see as distinct from the ethical source                that comes from the zygote and the embryonic stem cells that the                President was talking about in his August 9 speech.                 So, Michael, now to return to you, I just think that we've                seen today from these wonderful four presenters just the kinds of                things that I would like to see to enhance our conversation to get                us to a place where we will talk about the direction science will                go and the promise that it will take.                 And let's just finish off by a very small question that I                wanted to ask you, Dr. Palmer, since I've got the floor, and                that was aspects of the biology of Parkinsonism itself and the concern                that I have that perhaps the disorder — are you sure that the disorder                will not in itself being directed against dopamine cells, might                not kill off the stem cells that are being produced and kill them                more quickly than even the endogenous cells?                 So where is the understanding of the pathogenesis of Parkinsonism                in relationship to this transplantation treatment?                  DR. PALMER:   Let me turn this around maybe and expand your                horizon in thinking about ES cells, embryonic stem cells, and again                stepping one more step into the nuclear transfer arena or into the                area where you can engineer, genetically modify a traditional embryonic                stem cell.                 So there is no guarantee that making a pure population of dopamine                neurons will cure Parkinson's disease.  There is very good evidence                that under some circumstances dopamine neurons from fetal tissue                do help in Parkinson's disease, and what we would be striving                for is a population that is renewable that would not require the                use of fetuses for curing individuals.                 So in that sense, there is a gold standard that is working relatively                well, but has problems to overcome to which ES cell strategies can                aspire to, and that does work.  And so I am optimistic that the                stem cell strategy will also work, if not better, if we can eliminate                the aspects of the fetal tissue transplant that may be giving us                trouble in that particular clinical paradigm.                 Now, flip-flopping this a little bit, you brought up the idea                that Parkinson's disease is a disease, and putting healthy cells                into the diseased brain may be a bad idea and may not make it work.                 How would you understand the complexities of that disease?                 The way one might approach this is to use ES cells that harbor                all of that genetic complexity of that disease and model it in a                tissue culture dish.  Try your drug screening strategies.  See if                you can't find mechanisms that are not possible to even understand                in a whole organism by recreating the system in the dish.                 This is the real power of ES cell technology.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Bill — sorry.  Paul, did you want to just                every quickly?                  DR. McHUGH:   No.  Thank you very much for that.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Bill Hurlbut, the last question and then                we'll stop.                  DR. HURLBUT:   Well, thank you for your presentations and                the very exciting prospects of going forward with the existing cell                lines and the others that you suggest.  The future looks like it                has real possibilities.                 What I want to explore for a second is beyond the therapeutic                potential.  You've mentioned amazing possibilities for scientific                research and drug testing and so forth.  So even if this technology                doesn't end up making its way into the clinics, it obviously                is going to be very, very important for the whole future of biomedical                science.                 So what I want to ask you is this.  Given this amazing foundational,                early stage of this new medicine, kind of a whole new wing on the                mansion of medicine, and yet given the conflict that is going on                within our culture where, depending on who you believe, which survey                you believe, maybe half the population has problems about the moral                grounding of this future of medicine, here's my question.                 I was speaking with a pediatrician recently, and she told me that                it's not uncommon to have parents whose children are going to                be vaccinated ask her was this vaccine grown on fetal tissues.                 So the problem is that even if the individual patient doesn't                choose to employ the therapy that they have an ethical problem with,                the whole foundation of medicine is going to be built on this technology,                and so it's not just a vaccine that somebody can say, ""Well,                I don't want it.""  It's just sort of like everything                will be built on this, right?                 And beyond the question of whether or not the President could                change his policies, there is the Dickey amendment, and I think                we heard this morning that to a very large extent his decision was                an interpretation of the Dickey amendment itself.                 So given half the population roughly has ethical problems, given                that this is going to be the future foundation of medicine, are                there ways in the kind of research you're doing; do you see                any hopeful ways that we can do this in a way that bypasses the                moral problems?                 And as a part of that question, I'd like to ask you:  how                important do you think cloning for biomedical research is, so-called                therapeutic cloning?                 And recently the work of Gurdon at Cambridge suggested that maybe                you can find the cytoplasmic factors that can down-regulate or reprogram                the nucleus of a somatic cell.  Do you see any hopeful ways out                of this?                 And are there ways we could fund this current research such that                the  moral impasse would be temporary if we could just get it launched                with a good deal of support?                  DR. PALMER:   I do agree with the sentiment entirely.  So                the real issue is how.  Let's take two hypotheticals.                 One is that the U.S. is restricted in its ability to pursue these                technologies on ethical grounds, on moral grounds, yet other countries                are not.  The moral question becomes can you then use the information                and technology that was developed offshore morally.  And that's                something that would have to be discussed.                 We would be far behind in our technologies, in our drug development,                in our ability to provide health care to our constituents.  If we                had the ability to temporarily recognize the value of the lines                of research with the full intent that we need to understand what                these cytoplasmic factors are, nuclear transfer technology is the                prototype.  It is the first working example of taking a genome,                which is totipotent.  So a cell's genome has all of the information                that you need to make an individual.                 My cheek cell, if it has all of its genes, is totipotent, given                the right cytoplasmic factors to program it.  How will you circumvent                this moral problem unless there is a decision or an understanding                that the morality is a combination of concepts and beliefs?                 This is a very difficult question, and I don't envy your task                as Council.  If you were to take a fertilized egg and reprogram                a nucleus, create an embryo out of that to make stem cells, that's                not so technically different than just simply programming the nucleus                to go through all of those steps to create stem cells, and it's                one of an intellectual process coming to grips with a moral stance,                a belief.  It's going to be difficult to separate those two,                I think.                 So technically I think there's great hope to program the genome                in a way that would lead to an embryonic stem cell that's pluripotent.                 The prototype of that is nuclear transfer technology, and that is                the technology that's going to give you those steps to get from                Point A to Point B without creating the embryo.                  DR. HURLBUT:   Within the constraints of existing policy,                do you think we could if we funded it properly find a way to do                that?                  DR. PALMER:   It could happen tomorrow or it could be years.                 It will happen offshore regardless.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thanks to our four panelists for your presentations,                your forthcomingness.  Thanks to the Council members for enduring                a long, but very interesting day.                 We meet again tomorrow morning at 8:30, and we meet again at 6:30                for convivial repast.                 The meeting is adjourned.                  (Whereupon, at 5:40 p.m., the meeting in the                above-entitled matter was adjourned, to reconvene at 8:30 a.m.,                Friday, September 5, 2003.)"

JOHN GEARHART                  CHAIRMAN KASS:  Well,                I would like to ask Dean Clancy to officially open the meeting,                please.                 MR. CLANCY:  This meeting                is lawful.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Thank                you very much. Apologies to our guests and to members of the audience                for the late start. Council Members had to take an oath of office,                which should have been administered to us before our very first                meeting.                That has been done and we are now legal in every respect. Welcome                to this, the third meeting of the President's Council on Bioethics.                We are expecting colleagues Krauthammer and George today, and Stephen                Carter will not be with us, and Bill May will join us tomorrow.                I would like to introduce a new member of our staff, Judy Crawford,                who comes to us as the office manager. Judy, would you please rise                so that the council members can know you. We are very delighted                to have Judy with us.                We reconvene as the debate about the cloning legislation heats                up around us, a debate that we did not begin and do not control.                We are in the midst of our own careful and thorough investigation                of the ethical, social, and policy implications of human cloning                seen in its larger scientific, medical, and human contexts.                We have chosen to proceed in a deliberate, collegial, wisdom-seeking,                mode in keeping with our charge to inquire fundamentally into the                human and moral significance of developments in biomedical science                and technology.                The most challenging aspect of our inquiry to date has been the                moral significance of cloning for biomedical research, a topic discussed                for the first time at our last meeting, and to which we return later                today in the hope of making progress and clarifying the contested                moral issues at stake, and in articulating the best possible moral                arguments for and again the conduct of such research.                On behalf of the council, I would like to thank the staff for                its superb work in advancing our inquiry, and on behalf of the staff,                I would like to thank council members for their thoughtful comments                and responses. We are in your debt.                The agenda for this meeting brings us into some new, but not altogether                unrelated, areas of inquiry. Stem cell research, a topic of our                first three sessions today.                Second, the question of therapy versus enhancement as a goal for                the uses of biomedical technology, and third, possible regulation                of biomedical technology. These topics have been selected with a                view to initiating one of our obligatory future projects, stem cell                research, and exploring two possible future projects for the council                for the rest of our two year charter.                As everyone knows, in his speech announcing the creation of this                council, President Bush charged us with monitoring stem cell research,                embryonic and non-embryonic, human and animal, in order to assess                their progress in gaining knowledge and beneficial therapies, and                in due course to offer guidelines and regulations for the conduct                of such research.                As I indicated at our first meeting, we have begun to collect                data that will enable us to describe, assess, and compare the successes                achieved with both embryonic and non-embryonic stem cells.                As we are doing this, however, it seemed desirable for council                members to learn firsthand, and from some leading researchers in                the field, about the scientific and therapeutic promise of stem                cell research present and projected; embryonic and non-embryonic.                And it also seemed desirable to explicitly begin a disciplined                conversation about the ethical issues of embryonic stem cell research.                Our first three sessions today constitute the official thematic                beginning of our project on stem cell research.                We have of course already been deliberating about some of these                matters in our discussion of human cloning for biomedical research,                a topic that first arose for us as a crucial side question of the                larger subject of human cloning to produce children, what to think                about it, and what to do about it.                This is therefore a useful juncture at which to indicate the distinction,                as well as the connection between these two topics. Many members                of the public, including many of our elected officials who are in                the process of making policy in this area, as well as some members                of the media, have conflated the issue of stem cell research and                the issue of cloning.                The issue of cloning comes first to attention as an issue of the                ethics of producing children by novel technological means, and the                issue of cloning, insofar as it has captured the public attention,                is primarily about what to think about the asexual production of                new human beings who are going to be genetically virtually identical                to already existing individuals.                And the issues there are in the first instance the questions of                the ethics of, crudely speaking, baby-making. That is quite different                from the question of the ethics of embryo research.                Virtually all embryonic stem cell research now under way, both                in humans and in animals, involve cell lines developed from embryos,                whether inner-cell mass, or from the gonadal ridge of donated fetuses,                that originate from the sexual union of egg and sperm, and very                often in the human case using excess embryos produced in in vitro                clinics and in all cases from material not produced for the sake                of the research. The question of Federal funding of this research                that President Bush resolved last summer, this was the question                that was resolved last summer, and the research in this area proceeds                not only with Federal funding under the guidelines that the President                established, but also in the private sector.                The two topics, however, intersect and overlap because cloning                to produce children necessarily proceeds through the production                of cloned blastocysts, which offer special opportunities for embryonic                stem cell and other research.                Some proposals to curtail cloning for providing children would                do so by curtailing the initial steps, thus interfering with the                possibility of using cloned embryos for research.                And this has given rise to arguments for and against cloning for                biomedical research proper. This is where the intersection can be                made explicit, and that is where we now are.                In order for us in the other project to continue to make progress,                and therefore in order to see what value added might derive from                working with embryonic stem cells extracted from cloned blastocysts,                one needs to know something about what it would be added to. That                is to say, to work on ordinary embryonic stem cells. And in order                to see more clearly what the ethical issues are that might come                from the question of producing cloned embryos for biomedical research,                it would be helpful for us to know something of the ethical issues                of experimenting on human embryos of sexual and not clonal origin,                and of using extra embryonic -- using the extra embryos or fetuses                not created for experimental purposes so we can see what different                questions arise here.                To help us with our scientific and medical education, we are very                fortunate to have as our guests and presenters this morning two                distinguished researchers, one who is a pioneer in isolating and                characterizing human pluripotent stem cells, Dr. John Gearhart,                the C. Michael Armstrong Professor of Medicine at Johns Hopkins                University, and the Director of the Institute of Cell Engineering.                And second a person who is a pioneer in work with human multipotent                adult progenitor cells, Dr. Catherine Verfaillie, a Professor of                Medicine and Director of the Stem Cell Institute at the University                of Minnesota.                Each of our guests in separate sessions will make formal presentations,                roughly 30 to 35 minutes, after which time we will have a chance                to ask questions about the scientific, technological, and clinical                aspects of these areas of research.                This is our chance to learn about the wonderful prospects of these                investigations. However, let me say that because our guests are                here not only as scientists, but also as our neighbors, in a morally                aspiring human community, we will perhaps try toward the end to                elicit from them their own thoughts about the ethical issues in                their own work.                But the purpose of these sessions is primarily our own education                about the scientific and medical aspects. With that I would like                to turn the meeting over to Dr. Gearhart, and to thank him very                much for joining us this morning.                 DR. GEARHART:  I am                certainly grateful to have this opportunity to share with the President's                Council my knowledge in a very tiny area of biomedical research,                and it is currently quite tiny, but if you read and believe the                press, it is obviously going to expand enormously.                Much has been written and much has been said about stem cells,                and it seems every morning in the paper there is some article relating                to it and continuing the debate.                In the scientific literature, we see virtually in every issue                of leading journals a paper dealing with stem cells. An age old                dream I think of mankind or humankind has been to replace damaged                or diseased tissues with functional ones, new ones, and wouldn't                it be nice to be able if you had a damaged liver or kidney to take                one off the shelf if you know what I mean.                And this dream I think is going to become a reality, and with                some of the advances in biomedical research, and one of the ones                that we are going to talk about today, I think this will provide                the starting material that will lead to this reality.                The concept behind cell-based therapies -- and this is what we                are talking about here initially -- is a very simple one, and I                think that that makes it attractive, and it makes it understandable                to the public. And that is that if there is a tissue deficit, why                not just replace the tissue. Now, it is easy to say, and it will                be difficult to do, but the concept is an easy one.                Cell-based therapy has also been called regenerative medicine,                and there are many rubrics for this today. The power of this technology                is derived from information inherent in our genes and in our cells,                and the recent isolation of these embryonic type stem cells I believe                is going to provide the enabling material as I mentioned for this                to go forward.                Stem cells are going to serve several purposes, the first of which                could be as a direct source in transplantation therapies. That means                specific cell types will be grown in culture, such as heart muscles,                nerves, et cetera, and transplanted to patients for function.                Or they will be genetically engineered to do exactly what we want                them to do and transplant it to patients; or they will be used by                our tissue engineer colleagues to construct tissues and parts of                organs, which would then be transplanted to patients.                Stem cells will also be used as a source of information, basic                science, and this is really where we are at currently. That could                be applied to a patient's own cells, such that we could remove cells                from a patient and alter them in some fashion to produce the cell                types that we want, and then transplant them.                Or ultimately I feel that what we are going to be able to do from                the information that we are going to learn on stem cells is that                we will be able to work in vitro with patient cells to get them                to perform in a manner that we want without taking them out and                putting them in culture.This, I believe, is the future. The scientific                challenges to attain our goal of producing safe and effective therapies                are formidable. It will take the efforts of many scientists and                clinicians, in a variety of disciplines, to bring this endeavor                to fruition.                Now, the stem cells that I am going to talk about today interestingly                really do not exist naturally. That is, they don't exist in embryos                or fetuses. They are artifacts of culture.                But we take tissues from embryos and fetuses and they undergo                a type of transformation in culture to provide these stem cells.                And this source obviously brings with it a number of ethical concerns.                I, as an investigator, who has had to cross this bridge 9 or 10                years ago when I began this work, believe that the ethical issues                are manageable.                I also believe that it is the responsibility of scientists to                candidly and in a timely fashion present the social implications                of their research and its technological applications; to provide                assessments on reliability, and to participate in the establishment                of ethical guidelines and to work within those guidelines.                For the past 9 years at Hopkins, we have been in compliance with                all institutional, State, and Federal policies in dealing with the                cells that we work with.                It has not been easy because the landscape has changed in 9 years,                and every year there have been new concerns raised, and new issues                that had to be addressed, and I think we are keeping up with it.I                should tell you also up to this point in time that no Federal monies,                no public monies, have gone into our research effort. Now that Federal                policy has changed, we do have applications pending before the National                Institutes of Health.                I also want to point out something that may be surprising to most                of you; that in our laboratory at Hopkins that we just are not concentrating                on an embryonic or fetal source of stem cells.                We are studying stem cells from adult sources, umbilical sources,                et cetera. This is the only way that we feel that you can have a                scientific advance, and that is to be able to compare and contrast                the different sources of stem cells.                So side by side, in the laboratory, in experimental paradigms,                we are using stem cells from a variety of sources, and this is what                I think has to happen to assess which of these sources are going                to prove the most effective for any specific type of therapy.                Another thing that I want to point out to you is that the work                on the human cells, I do have the questions that came from your                committee in- hand, and many of them are asking what is the status                of certain types of work.                I just want to point out that this work has been ongoing for a                period of 2-to-2-1/2 years, and although we feel that we are making                progress, we certainly are going to come up with, well, I don't                know as answer to some of your questions.                I just want to let you know that we don't have all the answers                to this, and we are very, very early in all studies of stem cells,                be they from the embryonic or adult sources.                I would tell you though that to date the work in our lab and others                on embryonic stem cells and the results of that work is certainly                consistent with the idea that this is going to prove to be a productive                line of research.                Well, it is interesting that very few people know you and what                you are about, and I think it is important to point out something.                My interests, or my research interests for decades, have been in                the area of developmental genetics and development biology.                I have been labeled as a human embryologist, and my interests                certainly are in the area of how an embryo goes from a single cell                to a multi-cellular integrated organism.                And this is where our research has been in the past 25 years,                and I have carried this a step further. We are very interested in                congenital malformations and birth defects.                I have had a program project through the NIH for many, many years                dealing with Down's Syndrome, and we are very interested in trying                to determine what the mechanism is that underlies many of the unusual                anatomical neurobiological consequences of this extra chromosome                in human beings.                And this is essentially how I got into this work. We wanted to                have in the laboratory a source of cells in addition that we could                study at the site or level of the impact of these extra genes.                And this obviously is a goal, along with a number of other genetic-based                diseases and malformations in the human being. So this is what led                to our getting into this area of research.                Now, I have to say up front that we are now required by our university                to reveal where our monies come from, and these are the sponsors                of our research, and there is one sitting in the middle there that                I also have to show to you that I am conflicted.                And which means that to the sponsorship of this private company,                we have received money for research, for which licenses have been                negotiated between Hopkins and Geron, and that I am a stockholder,                albeit a few hundred shares of something that is trading now at                -- and I hate to think about it.                It is not in our possession as you know. It is held in escrow.                But nonetheless we do have this arrangement with this company. So                I would tell you that this is not the motivation, this connection.                Without the sponsorship of this research, this work would not                have gone forward over the past seven years. We are not in this                business as individuals to make money.                Well, having said all of that, let's talk about stem cells. The                first thing I want to give you is a little bit of a primer on stem                cells so that we are talking the same language, and you have an                understanding of where I am coming from.                Well, what is a stem cell, and basically a stem cell is a cell                that has two properties. It has a property in that it has a capacity                for self-renewal, which means that the cell can divide and produce                more cells like itself.                And it has some type or some degree of differentiative capability,                which means that it can go on to specialize into a single cell type,                or it can specialize into a number of cell types.                And in a developmental sense, if we over time at what our research                has told us about stem cells, they fall into a number of categories.                Early on in developmental practices, we have a cell that is totipotent.                It can renew, and it can form virtually every cell type that is                present in an embryo. As development proceeds, its developmental                capabilities become more restricted until we get into different                lineages, specific lineages, and its ability to divide also becomes                more diminished over time.                This has been the classical picture of development. Now, what                has happened over the past couple of years interestingly is we find                that these restrictions in developmental capability are much more                plastic than we had thought.                So out here where we thought that these cells are highly restricted,                perhaps they aren't so, and when you remove them from the organism                and culture them, they have capabilities of forming other cell types,                and Catherine will be talking to you about some of these issues.                Well, we are going to be talking about embryonic stem cells, and                what is it about them. Well, interestingly, we know that these cells                are capable of producing virtually every cell type that is present                in an embryo, a fetus, or an adult, except one.                And that one happens to be the trophoblast cell, which I will                tell you about in a moment. So we consider these cells to be totipotent.                They don't have the ability in and of themselves to form an embryo                or an individual, okay? They have this other property of self-renewal,                which basically with respect to embryonic stem cells means that                they will expand indefinitely, and grow indefinitely, and this is                a very important property.                It means that within the laboratory from a very few cells that                you could grow a roomful of these cells very easily. But there is                an issue here that we don't know much about, and that is obviously                there is a finite probability that at every cell division that a                genetic mutation will appear.                And there was a paper published recently that indicated that indeed                this is the case, and the types of mutation, although the mutation                frequency and the mutation rate is greatly -- by several folds lower                than in normal somatic cells, mutations do occur in these cells,                and they are of the nature of making these cells susceptible to                formation of tumors.                The uniparental disomy appears and it is a condition about which                we should be concerned. And up until this point, in the mouse where                these cells were first isolated, and for that work the person who                did this, Martin Evans, was awarded the Lasker Award last year.                We know that these lines forming whole animals, which is what                they have been used for up to this point, in genetic mutations is                getting genetically defined strains of mice.                That there comes a time when these cells are no longer productive                in doing this and that they lose some quality. So we know that there                is going to be a half-life to the use of these cell lines for whatever                reason.                I just want to point that out, although they do have this replicative                ability. Well, where do these totipotent cells come from, and two                major sources. The first is this pre-implantation stage which we                are going to talk about, and the second are from specific cells                within the fetus.                I also have on this slide, and by the way, I have given you two                handouts. One is the slides in the presentation, and another in                a fairly recent Nature review of this material, that you can refer                to.                I want to point out another source of a cell that is very similar                to these two that we have isolated, and that comes as a stem cell                for a specific type of tumor called in the old days teratocarcinoma,                and now called mixed cell carcinomas.                These stem cells, referred to as embryonal carcinoma cells, were                first isolated back in the 1970s when I worked on this, and we thought                that these would be the answer to finding cells that would produce                a variety of cell types that we could work with within the human.                And I should tell you that at this point in time that there is                a clinical trial going on at the University of Pittsburgh using                embryonal carcinoma cells that have been selected for a neural lineage,                and so that in culture you can derive neural cells and that these                have been placed in the brains of 12 stroke patients.                It is a cell that is very, very similar to the two that I am going                to talk about. Well, the first source that you are aware of comes                from these structures here, which are pre-implantation stage human                embryos, and I am sure you are familiar with this.                And where that structure consists of two groups of cells; this                outer layer called trophectoderm, and an ectopically placed inner                group of cells called the inner-cell mass. It is from this group                of cells here that the embryo proper is derived, and it is connected                ultimately to this outer layer, which develops in the placental                tissue by connecting stock in an umbilical cord.                These cells may number only 15 or 20 in an embryo that may consist                of perhaps several hundred cells. And in work in the mouse, and                subsequently done in humans, first by Jamie Thomson, was that these                cells were isolated, placed in a culture condition, which then permits                their growth and their conversion into an embryonic stem cell.                This process of conversion can be highly inefficient, meaning                that you would need a large number of blastocyst and inner cell                mass cells to derive a few cell lines.                In some people's hands, it can be more efficient, but there is                an issue with that. A second source of cells with the same features                was identified in the early 1990s, first by Peter Donovan at NCI.                And what they were attempting to do were to culture long term                cells that are called primordial germ cells. These are diploid cells                that are present in an early embryo that eventually give rise to                egg and sperm.                And they isolated, and this is superimposed upon a human fetus,                they isolated from the gonads, the gonadal ridges, these large cells,                which at the time of isolation in humans are about 20,000 of them                present in a gonad, and placed them in culture and essentially ended                up with the same type of cell.                This is what a human EG culture looks like, this clustering of                cells and I want to point out that there are cells in the background                here which are the so-called feeder layers.                All of these cell lines are derived on feeder layers, and all                the lines that were approved by Mr. Bush, and all the lines that                we have, are derived on a mouse feeder layer, and this is a point                of contention, meaning that we are concerned now about the fact                of any endogenous viruses being transferred from other animal tissues                into the human cells.                And the FDA must deal with this at this point in time, but we                do not have permission on the use of Federal funds to derive new                lines, avoiding this issue of other animal products.                But they are grown on feeder layers. They are established and                grown on feeder layers of other species. If we compare different                properties of these cell types, and I bring this up -- some of these                are of no value to you immediately, but these are the criteria that                one must use to say whether or not you have a cell line.                It is very important, and of the 80 some lines that are now purported                to be available, I can guarantee you in talking to many investigators                from around the world that only a handful of these are bona fide                cell lines, and/or available to investigators.                Now, this may beg the point and that that may be enough to serve                the purposes in the immediate future. But really the majority, the                vast majority of so-called lines available do not meet the criteria                that are now used to say whether a line is a line.                Now, how do we -- we are very interested then in two things here.                One is the basic science aspect of this, and of course what is driving                all of this is the hope for some type of transplantation therapy.                Let's talk a minute about the basic science. What we have in the                laboratory now are cultures of cells in the plate that can form                any cell type in a human body.                Now, the argument is have we demonstrated that you can get out                of these all 200 and some cell types? No. You only find what you                are looking for.                What we have found though are a large number of cell types that                are present in the human body within these dishes. The problem at                the moment is getting homogenous population of pancreatic islet                cells or blood cells, or muscle cells.                This is the real part of the scientific struggle here, and coming                up with the paradigms to say can we take a cell that can form any                cell type, and get it to form but one cell type.                And to do this we have to rely upon our knowledge coming out of                molecular embryology as to the genetics and what not involved in                any type of cell specialization.                And this is really the limiting issue at this point in time, getting                these purified populations of cells on demand. There are strategies                that are used that we do pretty good at, and we will take the initial                populations of cells, and we can change feeder layers, and we can                change growth factors, and we can put them in different types of                cultures and force them then to begin to specialize.                But they are mixed cultures, and within the same dish you are                going to find neurons and muscle, et cetera. And we must then go                another step and begin to sort out either through procedures called                flow sorting based on what is on cell surfaces to get then pure                populations of hematopoietic stem cells, muscle cells, or neuro                cells.                And this works fairly well. We can get cultures of dopanergic                neurons that are 80 percent pure, and we can get cardiac muscle                that is 97 percent pure, et cetera.                But we are a long way from isolating in a homogeneous fashion                the various types of cells that we would like to get. Some of them                ere doing well at and others were not.                And it is going to require an extensive amount of research to                achieve this. Now in going to transplantation therapy -- we are                going to jump a little bit ahead here, and if we start, this could                be ES.                If we start with this population, we do not transplant into anybody,                or into an animal at this point, one of the stem cells. You don't                do it. The reason that you don't do it is this.                These stem cells are capable of forming a variety of tissues,                and they will form tumors, and these tumors are these mixed germ                cell tumors that contain a variety of cell types.                They are called teratomas in the old literature. Monster. I mean,                they are contained in a mixed array, and you can see teeth, sebaceous                glands, hair, bone, parts of the gut, et cetera.                So what you have to do to make this work is you want to at least                get cells that you have treated somehow in a dish into some of these                more defined lineages that are away from this capacity to form tumors.                So that we then begin to select tissues downstream, all right?                Part of the problem, and you will read this in the literature, is                how good your selection is, is also indicated by whether or not                when you take myocardiocytes that you say, oh, these are all 100                percent myocardiocytes, you transplant them into the wall of the                heart, and you end up with a teratoma.                This happens, and we are into the central nervous system, and                you end up with a teratoma within the brain. So getting rid of those                initial stem cells are essential, and we have ways of doing this                genetically, but I just want to point out that this is an issue.                To say nothing about the fact that we do not know whether any                cell downstream here has the capacity to revert. We know very little                about that at this point in time.                So let me give you an example. There are many of these coming                out in a number of laboratories, most of them in the mouse in which                lines have been derived in different lineages, and they have been                transplanted into animals to show proof of concept, and that you                can isolate a specific cell type, and you can transplant it, and                it will function within the transplant.                I would like to give you now an example from our work at Hopkins.                It is an unpublished work, and it is now under review, but I think                it is important because it really illustrates several points that                are critical here.                We have taken our human cells and grown them under culture conditions                that would select for specific types of lineages, and whether it                is neural, or whether it is muscle, et cetera. And now we have,                I believe, in our laboratory over a hundred a hundred lines like                this, of the human lines.                And in the one example that I want to present to you, which was                done with members of our department of neurology, and in collaboration                with our lab, is a model, using these cells in an animal model of                the motor neuron disease.                And in this study, these animals are treated with a virus that                destroys lower motor neutrons, so that animals become paralyzed,                and they are paralyzed because they lose the big nerve muscles that                in your spinal cord hook your muscles up to the central nervous                system.                So that in a period of 10 days following the injection of the                virus into the brain, the animals become paralyzed, and we have                gone to great lengths to show that it is really the ventral roots                that are involved.                You wipe out these neurons and these animals never recover. They                never recover. So what we have done is to take our human neural                cells out of this and infuse it into the spinal cords of these rats,                and to look then for the recovery of motor activity.                This is a rat out for a mid-morning stroll, and this animal is                infected with the virus, and it is a virus that really leads to                an encephalomyelitis, and within a period of 10 days the animal                is paralyzed.                We can document exactly what this paralysis is about. The virus                is cleared, and shortly thereafter we will put a cannula into the                lumbar region of the animal, and infuse 300,000 cells into the cerebrospinal                fluid, and these cells will float all the way up to the hind-brain.                And then we monitor the motor activity of these animals, and within                a period of a few months, we begin to see animals that can now place                their limbs underneath them, and that can draw them up, support                some weight, and begin to push off.                And at the high end, within a several month period, we can have                animals that are now walking. And the issue is why are they walking.                And what we have learned, although it is not as you can see a normal                gait, et cetera, and we have really documented this as well, they                are walking.                And why are they walking? Well, initially what we felt was this.                This is a panel showing cells within the ventral horn of those animals                and I want you to look at this cell here.                This cell, based on its marker, and based on its physical characteristics,                and molecular characteristics, is a human motor neutron cell that                has been specialized out of these neural precursor cells, that has                sent an axon out into the periphery at least two centimeters.                And we have been able to cut the sciatic nerve out on the limb                of this animal, place a dye at that site, and that dye is picked                up by that axon, and brought back to the cell body that extended                the axon.                And it comes back, and this is the green stuff here, and it comes                back then into the cell body of the human motor neuron. We have                gone on to document how many human cells are present, and what they                are as far as the phenotype is concerned, to see -- you know, yes,                they are forming glia, and they are forming a variety of cell types                within the ventral horn of that animal.                Interestingly, and one of the safety issues that we find is that                50 percent of the cells don't do anything. And we are a little bit                concerned about that.                I mean, is it good to have all these cells in there that aren't                doing anything, but this is an issue that we have got to resolve.                Well, it turns out that this is only part of the answer. It turns                out that the human cells at the same time are producing growth factors                that rescue and enhance the regeneration of the animal's own cells                within the ventral horn.                And so this has led us then to set up experiments to try to figure                or try to determine what growth factors it is that is causing the                growth of axons in those mice and in rats in the ventral horn, and                it may be that eventually we can use just the combination of those                growth factors to elicit this response. We don't know.                So these cells are serving in a dual capacity, which is somewhat                exciting. We have taken the human cells and we now have grafted                them into monkeys. They were in monkeys for over a year.                This was a safety study to in fact show that we are not getting                tumors formed. I think you can appreciate one of the major issues                here that we are going to be faced with, with this type of approach,                is animal experiments are of a very short duration. Mice and rats                are for periods of several months.                Monkeys we can go much longer. How much data is going to be needed                to convince the FDA that this is a safe approach, and this is something                that is being debated now within the FDA and it is a difficult issue.                But here we show human cells, and that is these blue ones that                have been in this monkey, and in this case for 180 days, but we                are now out a year, and we can show that these cells are forming                specialized structures and they are non-tumorigenic.                The next phase is to look at a graph model here that is functional.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Can                I just ask a question?                 DR. GEARHART:  Sure.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  What                has been injected here?                 DR. GEARHART:  Oh, I'm                sorry. These are the same -- what has been injected into this monkey                are the same cells that were injected into the rat. The same cells.                They were human cells --                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Neural                precursors?                 DR. GEARHART:  Neural                precursor cells. The same cells, the same culture cells. A major                issue that we must discuss and that we are concerned about is graft                rejection. Obviously, anything that you grow up, unless it matches                the patient, is going to be subjected to that, and now we get into                an area which Dr. Kass has mentioned earlier.                But what are our options here? What are the options of being able                to grow these cells into any of these lineages and then to transplant                them and not have rejection?                Well, there is a long list, and it starts with, well, maybe what                we ought to do is derive hundreds of ES and EG cell lines, and then                you would have a best match for a patient. Not very practical.                Can we use the patients own cells, and you will hear about some                of this shortly. Should we use immunosuppressive therapies. We would                like to get away from that.                Can we use what the tissue engineers are referring to as sequestering                grafts, and what this is, is you can take grafted cells and put                around them matrices that will not permit other cells to touch them,                but yet they can produce products, or they can function in a graft.                So you are trying to hide them from the host immune cells. How                effective that is going to be, we don't know.                Can we perhaps come in and genetically modify, which is easy to                do in these cells with the histo-compatibility genes, so we can                make them more like a patient that is going to receive these cells.                Or is it possible that we may end up being able to produce cells                that may be universal donors. Again, we are trying this, and at                the moment it is speculation.                Clearly the one thing that has worked is the issue of nuclear                transfer therapy, the so-called therapeutic cloning, in which as                you know the argument is to take a cell from a patient, and fuse                it to an enucleated egg, derive a blastocyst, recover the inner                cell mass, culture it out, and then these embryonic stem cells would                match the genome of the patient.                Is this a pipe dream? The answer is no, and I will give you an                example of that in a moment. To get around some of the issues with                the human cloning, embryonic cloning in humans, you have seen reports                in the Wall Street Journal and other places which I can confirm                are real, in which there are attempts now to take human cells, human                nuclei, place them for example into rabbit eggs, enucleated rabbit                eggs, and grow up a blastocyst, and generate stem cells that have                human nuclei and rabbit mitochondria.                And the argument has been made here that, well, these cells would                be perfectly fine for an autograft, and this isn't accurate. We                know that mitochondria produced polypeptides that are integrated                into the cell membrane, and are actually considered to be minor                histocompatibility antigens, and will be recognized and rejected                by the host from which the nucleus came from.                So this really is not getting around the issue of the graft stuff                at all using other animals, and we are a little bit concerned about                how this is being handled.                So, let me give you an example, and one which you should read                these papers if you haven't from Rudy Jaenisch and George Daley                at MIT, using the nuclear transfer therapy, or the therapeutic cloning,                to do two things.                What they did was to take a mouse that had a genetic mutation                in genes that are important as far as the immune response is concerned.                And they took cells from this mouse, took the nucleus out of the                cell, and placed that nucleus into an enucleated egg to produce                a blastocyst from a cloned embryo.                They took the inner-cell mass cells out of that, and generated                embryonic stem cells, that then are the same genome type as this                animal, and then went in and repaired genetically the mutation within                those cells.                And then differentiated these cells into the hematopoietic stem                cell component, transferred them back into this animal that had                the mutation, and the transplant took, completing the whole hematopoietic                system, and in rescuing that animal.                So this is a proof of concept kind of experiment, and I urge you                to read it. It is an extremely powerful illustration, not only of                the therapeutic cloning end of things, but also the ability then                to come along and correct the genetic mutation and the reference                was given to you.                Another argument has been made that we should be using perhaps                just eggs that have been stimulated to form embryos, and these are                parthenotes.                And the argument here has been that we can then use these directly                into the female from which the eggs were taken. I just want to point                out that in my opinion that this is going to have very low usage.                You are going to have to recover embryos or eggs from patients,                post-pubertal, and pre-menopause. The window is going to be fairly                short, I think, for many of the therapies that you would want to                effect.                And the other issue is that we don't know much about cells that                are derived this way, and how viable, and how functional they are                going to be. But this has been used or promoted also as a source,                and this is an illustration of where you take those cells.                All of this type of technology, I just want to let you know, and                I know that you are grappling with this, but even within the field                of the scientists are beginning to argue about what is an embryo                and what isn't an embryo.                So any arguments that you have within your council on this, I                will tell you is also being held among biologists. I think that                my own personal feeling is that anything that you construct at this                point in time that has the properties of those structures to me                is an embryo, and we should not be changing vocabulary at this point                in time. It doesn't change some of the ethical issues involved.                What are some of the problems here, and I will summarize this                a little bit. Current research. Well, we have to come up with better                ways of having high efficiency differentiation protocols resulting                in homogeneous cell populations.                We are dealing with growth environments, and genetic manipulations,                and we are trying to define stages of cell differentiation within                our cultures.                And assessing whether or not the differentiated cells that we                are getting out are normal and completely functional. And this is                in a dish.                And let me tell you that there are examples of where you can spend                all of an effort studying something in a dish, only to find that                if you pop it in an animal that it doesn't behave how you think                it is going to behave. We have a lot to learn here.                I think you can imagine that what is going on in a dish is not                exactly what is going on in a site where you transplant. The whole                issue of grafting, and how you put it in, and the safety issues,                and that cells migrate away, and they differentiate, and will they                form tumors, and then the issue of the immune response.                These are all, you know, formidable obstacles that lie ahead.                I mentioned to you that we can use cells individually, and have                been used in a variety of paradigms in our collaborators of single                cells, and the tissue engineers are now taking these different cell                types and seeing if they can reconstruct or construct organal aids                or tissues to do in-grafting, and thee has been some success with                this at this point.                Finally, to me, the future is going to be that the basic science                coming out of this is the most important element, and that from                that information we are going to be able, I think, to take patient                cells, where appropriate, and I say where appropriate because if                you have autoimmune disease, or in cases where you have an injury,                spinal cord injury, or stroke, or heart attack, and you don't have                time to take that patient's cells, you are going to have to come                up with different paradigms.                But I think we are going to be able to eventually coax a patient's                own cells to behave in a manner that we want to, but we are going                to learn this I think through the study of stem cells.                The last thing I will say is I know that you want to ask, well,                what is the future going to bring, and I am concerned about predicting                the future. I can't even do this on a three year NIH grant and this                is what is expected of us.                You know, what is going to happen here. I certainly think that                everything that has happened up to this point is consistent with                success in this area, and I could get into more predictions in a                moment.                But we are always asked when is this going to happen, and it is                going to be I think based on specific cell types, and on, and on,                and on. But the predictive thing is very, very difficult.                Well, I thank you for your attention, and I hope that this was                enough of a primer to add more meat to your discussions. Thank you.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Thank                you very much.                (Applause.)                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  We were                only physically in the dark, but we are grateful for your enlightenment,                Dr. Gearhart, and the floor is open for questions, and comment,                and discussion. Don't forget that you have to turn your microphones                on to be heard. Jim, go ahead.                 DR. WILSON:  Dr. Gearhart,                do you foresee that it will ever make a difference whether cells                that are transferred for human cell regeneration come from cloned                eggs, or from the retrieval from IVF eggs? Does it make a difference                what the source is?                 DR. GEARHART:  Well,                I think in the short term that it will. I think the only way we                have around the immune rejection story at this point is from cloned                embryos.                For a patient in which you can predict ahead of time is going                to need stem cell therapy and you have the time and money available                to do the cloned approach.                I would like to think that this is going to be a transitionary                period, and that we will not have to rely upon this in the long                term, and that we will be able to take for any specific disease                a stem cell, or a derivative of a stem cell that may come from the                adult source, the umbilical source, the fetal source, or embryonic                source.                I mean, whichever presents, and that we will have ways of dealing                with this graft rejection story other than through the cloning of                human embryos.                 DR. WILSON:  If I could                just supplement my question with a related one to which you referred.                What is your current assessment of the value of adult stem cells,                as opposed to embryonic ones, as a source of organ regeneration                currently?                 DR. GEARHART:  Oh, I                think it is a very viable option and I think NIH should fund it.                I think that from what we see in the work, and Catherine will present                a nice overview of this, that this is going to be a good source                of stem cells.                They have some issues that they have to overcome, issues of expandability,                and plasticity, that we feel are -- that have not been demonstrated                as well as embryonic stem cells, but I think that eventually we                will be able to overcome this.                But I think part of the knowledge of overcoming it is going to                be coming from our studies of cells that have those capabilities,                and being able to transfer that information to those other cells.                So I think we are going to come up with -- I believe that in the                stem cells, cell-based therapies, that we are going to identify                certain adult sources that are going to be good for some diseases,                some injuries, and embryonic sources for others.                So I think we are going to mutually proceed on this and benefit                from it.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Please,                Elizabeth.                 DR. BLACKBURN:  Dr.                Gearhart, you can give us I think a unique perspective on the comparison                between adult, and embryonic, and fetal stem cells.                And in particular many of us read the recent papers, the scientific                peer-reviewed papers that came out with respect to the adult stem                cells, and the interpretation of their plasticity being cast in                some considerable doubt by the observation that there was cellular                fusion of those cells which had led to in these particular cases                examined a mistake in interpretation of their plasticity.                And I wondered if you could give us your perspective on that aspect,                which extends Jim's question somewhat.                 DR. GEARHART:  I will                do so in the face of Catherine sitting back here, who is --                 DR. BLACKBURN:  Yes,                I am going to ask her, of course, about this, too.                 DR. GEARHART:  -- actually                done those experiments. Clearly the most difficult experiments that                we have had to address and interpret are those utilizing adult stem                cells that have been placed into the blastocyst of mice to create                chimeras.                And in those chimeras, we see that the descendants of those adult                cells gave rise to many, many lineages within the embryo, and this                was really the issue. How did we explain this.                And from the studies of Austin Smith and others that you are referring                to, the implication was that when those cells were transplanted                into that blastocyst to generate the chimeras, that a subset of                these cells fused with the hosts own cells and it was those fusion                products then that gave rise to the variety of lineages.                At the moment that is an implication, and that has not been demonstrated                in the embryo. It has been demonstrated in the dish that they had                that capacity.                So we are now waiting and putting pressure on Catherine, and Freizen,                and others to look into those animals to see if they can recover                those specialized cells that were derived from or that had the adult                phenotype if you know what I mean, the marker, to say are you truly                of the adult stem cell lineage, or do you have other markers present,                other chromosomes present, that come from host cells.                So until we see that data -- you know, I will wait. That is something                that can be looked at scientifically, and that is as far as I would                go with you, Elizabeth, at this point.                It is an interesting observation, and we will see if it actually                is the answer.                 DR. BLACKBURN:  And                just to extend on what you said, I think what it does now do is                to demand that the onus be put on the researcher to show that there                has been a plasticity or transdifferentiation, and there are other                set of criteria, which would be karyotype and multiple micro-satellite,                polymorphisms -- sorry to get overly technical -- and other genetic                markers.                There are clearly tools in hand, and so it seems as if every experiment                can in fact be subjected to those sets of analyses now.                 DR. GEARHART:  Right.                 DR. BLACKBURN:  And                will need to be before we can get a good view of this.                 DR. GEARHART:  Right.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Rebecca.                 PROF. DRESSER:  I have                four questions, and maybe if I say them all it will be possible                to answer some of them together. One, I was wondering if the rats                are being given immunosuppressants in this study.                And then you said a problem with the rabbit eggs is that the mitochondrial                DNA might cause rejection, and so I wondered if that would happen                with a cloned human embryo as well if the egg came from another                person, and if you are trying to do a therapy that is compatible                with a patient.                And let's see. The feeder layers, I was wondering if they have                available feeder layers that do not come from animals or what the                state of that development is.                And then finally what about the fact that if you are creating                a blastocyst from a patient's cell, and if the patient, let's say,                has cancer or some condition that could be related to genetics,                would the stem cells somehow perhaps be risky?                 DR. GEARHART:  There                is no question in my mind that the possibility exists that if you                are doing an egg donor, and nuclear transfer into an egg, that there                possibly exists that that cell -- that the embryonic stem cells                derived from that could be rejected. Absolutely.                Now, how do you test this? I mean, where do you test it. This                almost comes under the same criteria that I have for anyone coming                to -- if I was on an IRB and they wanted to clone a human reproductivity,                what data do you present before you permit it to go.                To me, it is one of these things where you need perfection before                experimentation, or without experimentation, which is something                in science is anathema.                 PROF. DRESSER:  Well,                you could test that in an animal, right? I mean, you could at least                see --                 DR. GEARHART:  Well,                you can, and we could set it up in an animal, but the issue is --                I mean, where you are very defined and to demonstrate it by doing                it into a different strain of mouse. There is no question about                it.                But whether or not that would carry over in polymorphisms that                exist in human, again you are still faced with human versus rodent.                The feeder layer issue. It is one that is being taken on, and                there is no banning of this type of work with private money, and                clearly there are a number of investigators, laboratories, working                on establishing feeder layers from human tissue that could be used,                and I think that this is very important.                So those studies are certainly under way. We have used a variety                of different human tissues as well to look at in our studies. Oh,                the very first question that you asked. I'm sorry, it was again?                 PROF. DRESSER:  For                the rats --                 DR. GEARHART:  Oh, sorry.                We did animals that were immunosuppressed and animals that were                not immunosuppressed. And we did not find a great deal of difference                in the short term, although -- I mean, as far as any type of destruction                of cells and things like that, although clearly in the animals that                were not immunosuppressed that you could see reactive cells present.                So clearly in the monkeys immunosuppressed, absolutely, and so                we have done them both. And then the blastocyst question?                 PROF. DRESSER:  If it                comes from a patient with a particular disease.                 DR. GEARHART:  Yes.                Clearly where there is a genetic basis of any type of a disease,                you would be concerned about reintroducing the same cells that were                subjected to whatever the disease process was.                And I think that this carries over also into, for example, the                diabetes work, where if you have an attack on insulin itself, you                know, is this going to be a viable alternative, and there are some                evidence now that you can alter the insulin molecule to make it                not recognized by some of the autoimmune antibodies.                I should say that there are a number of laboratories -- and this                is one area that is being emphasized in the use of human cells,                including our own, with Mike Shamblott, where we have lines that                are -- human lines that are insulin producing that you can pop them                into animals, and demonstrate that they can produce human insulin.                And we are very encouraged by some of these early results. But                I would still contend that we have a long way to go to carry that                into some type of clinical application. We have a lot of questions                to answer.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Janet.                 DR. ROWLEY:  Well, I,                too, have multiple questions and I want to thank you for a very                lucid presentation. That helps a great deal. I would like to first                -- and I think I will do these one at a time.                It is a substantial question as to what value the embryos that                are left over from IVF can play in this whole process as compared                with embryos that you develop for either a particular purpose, or                just straight off.                And my understanding was that maybe some of the embryos were sufficiently                mature so that maybe the cells derived from IVF would not be useful                in developing, say, cells lines or things. And I would like your                comments.                 DR. GEARHART:  One of                my hats at Hopkins when I moved there in the late '70s was to develop                the IVF program. So we are very well tuned into the issues of IVF,                and clearly in an IVF procedure the best embryos obtained are those                that are used first in first transfers.                So that generally those that are left over are of the ones --                we don't want to call it a lesser quality, but at least as far as                our eye is concerned, and how we judge grades of embryos, based                mainly on morphology to be honest, and more currently we are looking                at biochemical parameters that we can measure in the media in which                these cells are growing that something has been secreted to have                some kind of a measure.                And that clearly those that are the spare embryos generally are                those of -- let's say, what we deem, and knowing what that means,                of lesser quality.                So what does that mean? In most cases, they have not developed                far enough along, which means that if they are left over that you                take them back out of the freezer, and you try in your culture conditions                to get them up to this blastocyst point.                If you can't get them to a blastocyst stage, you can't derive                the cells. If there is no inner cell mass, you can't do it. And                you find that you are compromised there, and that generally these                are not very good embryos.                So one could argue that overall that you would expect to have                a low efficiency yield with respect to taking in embryo and deriving                a line from spare embryos in an IVF program. That is in general.                 DR. ROWLEY:  Okay. You                mentioned modifying the histocompatibility locus, and I would have                thought that there is still so much that we don't know about the                MAC that that would -- I mean, obviously anything can be done in                the future with time, but do you look on this as practical?                 DR. GEARHART:  Well,                back in the ancient days, in the early '80s it seems in this field,                Oliver Smithies and others did do knockouts of Class I and Class                II genes, in an effort to determine whether or not this could prolong                grafts into animals without those.                And that depending on the tissue or the organ, there was evidence                that this indeed could be the case, and not that it was an indeterminate                thing, but just by days, or weeks, or months, that this was the                case.                What they didn't know about at that time were NK killer cells,                and those kinds of things, and the importance of other determinants                which must be on cells. They wiped everything out.                So some labs are now taking a look at this to see if it is possible                then to rebuild back some of these markets. But it is a matter of                speculation at this point whether or not this could occur.                Now, what we can talk about I think is it possible to take using                the act of transgenesis and things like this, where we could move                big pieces of DNA; of taking part of a patient's chromosome-6, you                know, and cloning that into a stem cell after knocking out some                of it, and we may get some degree closer.                But that says nothing about the myriad of other loci that could                be involved as minor histocompatibility problems. So, some of it                is speculation, but I think it is also testable at this point in                time.                 DR. ROWLEY:  And my                last question is coming back to the 80 plus cell lines, and you                raised concerns, which many of us have, as to how useful some of                those are going to be.                 DR. GEARHART:  Right.                 DR. ROWLEY:  Could you                expand a little bit, in terms of whether you think they are really                not going to be long term cell lines, and that is your concern,                or whether there are other aspects.                 DR. GEARHART:  Well,                I have many concerns, and I hope that I can get them all in. I mean,                look, we were all thrilled when Mr. Bush made the decision to move                forward with this and establish cell lines to permit the work to                go forward. There is no question about it.                But as we looked into -- and by looking into, it was a practical                matter. Many investigators around the world, and I have close contacts                with colleagues in Germany, and in France, and in England, and Japan,                and Australia, and on and on, as we compare notes all the time on                our results of research, as well as on practical things like this,                and on political issues.                I mean, there is no question that we have to keep abreast, and                what happened, particularly from the German investigators, which                is significant, as you know, in Germany, they are not permitted                to derive cell lines.                And for a while they were not permitted to use those that were                even derived, and recently their parliament voted to permit the                use of existing cell lines as of January 2002.                But what happened was that when these investigators set about                to import cell lines, and contacted the registry list at the NIH,                which continues to grow each day, and more lines are added to it                as you know, it turned out that many of the lines were not defined.                Someone just reported that they had a clump of cells growing in                a dish, and they didn't have any of these parameters or very few                of them done.                And this reduced the list substantially, quite substantially,                down to -- we are talking about, say, a dozen. And then the issue                came up as to, well, are these -- can they be imported without a                stringent material transfer agreement, and with a reach through                clause that would say that anything that you would do with those                lines belongs to the person giving you the line.                And this reduced the line substantially. And then other lines                are not available because if you needed to get them, you needed                NIH funding, and only NIH funding. You could not use private funding                with them, and on and on.                And so it drastically reduced down the number of lines that are                practically available. Now, whether or not this will have a major                impact, clearly the NIH is receiving grants, and we have been reviewing                grants, and using the existing approved lines, the few that one                can get.                And the work will go forward, and whether or not that will be                sufficient, and we recognize that there is going to be a half-life                to these lines for various reasons, and that there will come a time                if it proves effective in the basic science part of this to move                forward, that we should be looking at being able to generate new                lines.                And the issue of the feeder cells is a major issue as well, and                to begin to establish lines on human cells so that we are not faced                with that anything that we derive from this now, and it is important                to consider, has to be considered as a xenograft.                Although it is a human line, the FDA requires that if it has seen                these other products, it has to be considered a xenograft, which                sets up a whole new set of criteria for moving this into the clinical                applications.                So I think there are reasons why we should eventually be permitted                to derive new lines. Well, I'm sorry. We can do it now on private                money, but anything that is derived cannot receive Federal money                for support.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  There                are people waiting in line, but can I get a clarification on this                question that came up in your answer to Janet about the durability                and longevity of the lines, and on the one hand, one says that the                embryonic stem cell lines, their great virtue is that they can be                self-renewed indefinitely.                On the other hand, they have a half-life, perhaps because of accumulated                mutations. Could you say a little more? I mean, some people claim                these are eternal lines.                 DR. GEARHART:  Right.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  And                could you say something about the possible differences between human                and mouse with respect to renewability, because I think it is an                important factor.                 DR. GEARHART:  Well,                the issue is maybe they are eternal, but can you still use them.                They can still divide indefinitely, but they may not --                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  But                they are no longer the same.                 DR. GEARHART:  Yes,                they are no longer the same, and they may not give you the biologic                properties that you need. Strangely enough, Leon, there have been                very few publications up to this point, and up to this point there                is one that I can cite for you, and I have it in answer to some                of your questions by Joe Stanbrook at -- Peter Stanbrook, at the                University of Cincinnati, in which he looked -- these were mouse                lines.                And he looked at the frequency and rate of mutation within several                mouse lines, and contrasted those with several schematic cell lines                that were in the lab as well.                And he found that indeed the mutation rates -- and what you do                is you pick certain genes to look at changes, and to look at chromosome                lost or gain.                This paper was published in PNAS in the March 19th issue for those                who are interested, and what he found was that the frequency and                rates of mutation were orders of magnitude less in the embryonic                stem cell line than in the schematic cell line.                And you are looking at a rate of generally 10 to the minus 6 frequency                within any mammalian cell as it is divided. But what he did find,                and that was a bit troublesome, was that the type of mutation that                appeared in the embryonic stem cell one led to what is called uniparental                disomy, which is a situation where you end up with homozygosity                across a region, or across chromosomes or regions of chromosomes,                that gets rid of really the dominant tumor suppressor genes, which                then raises the issue that these cells may be more susceptible to                tumorigenesis than others.                Now, that is the only report, and I will tell you that in several                laboratories what is being done now with the human lines, and that                is using express sequence tags, for example, and you can use 10,000                of them, they are looking at mutation rates at 10,000 loci, if you                know what I mean, over time in culture passage, after passage, after                passage.                So we will get information on this parameter, and how significant                it is going to be, I don't know, but one would predict that clearly                there is going to be an accumulation of mutations within these cells.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Okay.                Thank you. I have Michael -- well, also, was that on this point?                 DR. BLACKBURN:  Just                a very brief clarification. Did the absolute frequency of uniparental                disomy go up? Was it an absolute frequency increase, or simply did                it relatively increase as you looked at the whole spectrum of mutations                in the mouse embryonic stem cells?                Do you see the difference that I am trying to get at?                 DR. GEARHART:  Yes.                 DR. BLACKBURN:  That                if it were an absolute increase, that is a reason for concern, much                more than if it were simply a relative increase in a number that                has already gone down by --                 DR. GEARHART:  These                numbers are rates, and so I believe it is an actual number. In other                words, it was a real --                 DR. BLACKBURN:  An absolute                increase?                 DR. GEARHART:   Yes,                an absolute increase.                 DR. BLACKBURN:  So I                just wanted to make sure that I understood the numbers here.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Michael                Sandel, and then Frank.                 PROF. SANDEL:  I would                like to go back to the adult stem cell versus embryonic stem cell                question, and ask it in a slightly different, and maybe more pointed,                form.                As you know, there are some people who regard embryonic stem cell                research as morally objectionable. I am not asking you or trying                to drag you into that debate. But I would like to know your view                on the following scientific question.                If adult stem cell research in the best case scenario redeems                its promise, what would we lose medically and scientifically if                we ban embryonic stem cell research, or imposed a moratorium on                it for a period of time, until we could assess what adult stem cell                research could achieve?                 DR. GEARHART:  I personally                think it would be a tragedy, and for the following reason, if this                was to happen. I think the length of time that it is going to take                to assess whether the adult stem cell avenue is going to provide                the potential therapies that we are thinking about, is going to                be years.                And I think for us to deny at this point any avenue that has the                potential of the embryonic stem cell story is a tragedy to those                people who need or who will need these cures.                And I think that it is a time element. If this could be done in                a year, I would maybe listen to that argument. But it is going to                take years to really assess any of these approaches.                And I really think they should move forward together. I think                we are going to learn in both directions how to utilize information                coming out of these studies that would benefit, for example, or                enable us to understand more about the adult sources if this is                going to be the emphasis, and to really make them effective in their                use.                So I think that it wouldn't be wise to put a ban on the embryonic                source at this point, and wait until another avenue is assessed.                The length of time is going to be too long.                 PROF. SANDEL:   Can you                be more specific? Are there certain types of research avenues that                you would associate more with embryonic stem cell research, as against                adult stem cell research?                Is it likely that success is in particular areas, or is it just                that you feel that as a general matter it is better to have more                avenues rather than fewer?                 DR. GEARHART:  Well,                I think that one of the messages that I hope that I can get across,                and maybe Catherine will, too, is that we are in very early stages                in all of stem cell research, no matter what the origin of the cells                are.                And to make a judgment as to which of these is already more advanced                than the other, it would be a tenuous one at this point, because                you have got to remember that there are very few investigators actually                working on embryonic stem cells at this point.                The list on the adult side obviously is larger. I mean, as far                as investigators are concerned. And I don't think that any of us                are really showing dramatic -- you know, utilization in the sense                that we can say we are going to go to any clinical use of this.                It is going to take years for this to occur. We are in the very                early stages and so I would be really hesitant to say that anything                is demonstrating anything better.                All I would say about embryonic stem cells at this point in a                very positive way is that we know that at this point that out of                these cells we can virtually generate any cell type we want in dish                and in large numbers.                That is the advantage of this approach. Now, whether this will                be surmounted by other discoveries in adult stem cells to do the                same kinds of things, I don't want to predict. I hope that it happens.                You know, our -- and I also want to emphasize that we -- and although                we are associated with the embryonic form, we are studying other                forms as well. We are not foolish.                As a scientist, you know, you are not going to put all your eggs                in one basket here. And so we are trying to move forward on a broad                front, and I think that this would be the more rational way to proceed                in this arena                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Frank.                 PROF. FUKUYAMA:  Dr.                Gearhart, did I understand you correctly that in the experiment                that you headed up with the mouse that it lost the motor function                in its rear legs, that you were injecting human stem cells?                 DR. GEARHART:   Yes.                Well, if I could correct you a moment. It was a rat, first of all.                 PROF. FUKUYAMA:  Okay.                A rat.                 DR. GEARHART:  Rat,                too, but the issue is please don't say that you are injecting stem                cells. These are derivatives of stem cells. I mean, just so that                we know, but they are out of the stem cell line, okay?                 PROF. FUKUYAMA:  Okay.                Fine. But what was the resulting tissue? It was a mixture then of                rat and human neurons, or do you think it was simply the stimulation                of these other factors that was causing the rat neurons?                 DR. GEARHART:   Right.                That is a good question. We still don't know -- I mean, to be honest                with you -- what the mechanism of recovery here is. We know that                sitting in the ventral horns of these animals, and where these big                neutrons reside, you now have a mosaic population of host cells,                of neurons, inner-neutrons.                I mean, we all -- I mean, human and rat, or human and mouse, depending                on which one we did. We don't know the relative contributions. We                can count cells, but really what is the functional basis of what                occurred there.                We know that the human cells are also rescuing the other, but                to what degree. This is where the hard work comes in. What was the                mechanism, and what really went on or is going on in that ventral                horn.                I can tell you in work that John McDonald has done at Wash U,                in which they generate a contusion injury in the spinal cord of                a mouse or a rat, and then infuse in mouse embryonic stem cell derivatives,                and that he is faced with the same issue. He can see that these                animals recover to a certain degree, but the mechanism of what is                it, of what has really occurred there, is not known.                And I think what we are going to find is a demand that we come                up with mechanism in some of these animal models so that we can                completely understand what that therapy is going to be if you take                it to a human.                And this is going to require a lot of work. Now, some of it you                could argue is that you could do it all within animal studies. You                know, mouse embryonic stem cells, and you don't have to put the                human in.                But I think we are finding enough differences between species                that it would warrant at least the study also of the human derived                cells in the same paradigms to ask those questions.                 PROF. FUKUYAMA:   But                I am just curious. Are you getting actual tissues in which you have                cells from different species that are growing simultaneously?                 DR. GEARHART:  Oh, yes,                absolutely. Yes, sitting in the same -- well, you can see in the                section here that might be 15 or 20 microns across, you see a mixture                of the rat cells or mouse cells, and human cells, functioning.                You know -- I mean, this isn't uncommon. We do interspecific grafts                a lot in experimental things, and the question is when you do it,                and we see, you know, human cells growing in animals very nicely.                I mean, as long as there is immunosuppression and things like this                occurring.                 PROF. FUKUYAMA:  But                could you go the other way, also injecting stem cells from other                species into human beings?                 DR. GEARHART:  Oh, yes.                I mean, this is one of the issues with xenografts. You know, is                this something -- well, there is a report recently about chicken                embryonic stem cells, and the fact that people who had derived these                were promoting the use in humans.                Pig stem cells, you know, et cetera, and so it can be done, but                a couple of issues, and one of them is the issue of the xenograft                itself, of bringing in endogenous viruses, and is this a wise thing                to do.                And the other thing that I would ask you, and I won't be flippant                about it, is to say that if you -- and one of the concerns that                we have that maybe this council and others would take up, is long                term in a neurologic sense.                If you are putting stem cells in, and you are putting them in                between different human beings, what are you doing to that individual.                And I would say to you that if you have a stroke, and someone comes                along and says, well, we have pig, cow, mouse, human, take your                pick, what would you select.                I am not being flippant about it, but I am just saying that I                think that we know that human would be preferable at this point                in time.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Could                I ask a question, and just for clarification again also on your                own experiment that you showed us. You said that some of the rats                were immunosuppressed and some were not. Is that correct?                 DR. GEARHART:  Yes.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  And                were there functional differences in the results between those two                groups, and would that bear upon the question of whether or not                the major effect was owing to the action of the human cells, or                a stipulation of the endogenous cells?                And lastly, if these animals had come to post-mortem was there                a difference? Was there rejection in the non-immunosuppressed animals                of the human cells?                 DR. GEARHART:  It is                important to keep in mind the time frame that these experiments                are done in. They are of very short duration relatively speaking,                in a period of several months maximum.                In experiments that have been done in our laboratory, principally                by Mike Shamblott, in taking human cells and grafting, and these                are insulin-producing cells, and we have done it in a variety of                tissues into rodents, you always see reactive cells, which means                that you are eliciting an immune response.                Again, they are short term, and whether you are getting destruction,                we see cellular debris, and we see this kind of stuff at these sites.                I should tell you a little bit that may be enlightening.                When you do grafts like this, if we say we are putting in 300,000                cells or we are microinjecting in a lot of these cells, many of                these cells will die at the time of injection, simply because you                have taken them out of one environment and you put them into another,                and you see a tremendous amount of cell death.                Very few of these populations of cells continue to divide. In                other words, it may undergo one more round of division, and they                sit there.                You do see when you come in finally to look at where is the human                versus where is the rodent, and you use your human markers. You                invariably find a group of cells that you can't phenotype, if you                know what I mean, and to say what has happened here, and clearly                there are cells being destroyed.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Fused?                 DR. GEARHART:  Well,                we don't know that. And one of the arguments for many years has                been that the central nervous system is an immune privileged site.                I don't think anymore that this is something that is believed or                subscribed to, and if you have the option of immunosuppression,                or of getting around that, that that would be preferred.                And particularly when you are talking about a graft going into                a human being that may be there for 20 years, as opposed to a matter                of a few months. So I think that this is going to remain a major                issue, and there is no question about it.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Thank                you very much. Bill Hurlbut and then Paul McHugh                 DR. HURLBUT: :  John,                I hear you saying that we should pursue all lines of research, but                I want to weigh the different options here and pursue the question                of if the lines were restricted what would be gained or lost.                Specifically, I have several questions that hinge each on the                other. First of all, the cells that were implanted or tested for                their tumorigenicity effect that you spoke of in your paper were                the so-called EBDs.                Were those derived only from embryonic germ cells; is that what                is implied there?                 DR. GEARHART:  Yes.                In our paper, we took the stem cell itself and plated it out in                a variety of culture conditions, some of which are designed to enhance                or select for certain types of differentiation.                And we referred to these as embryoid body-derived cells. They                came out of this little cluster, and in our field it is essential                that we take the stem cell off the dish, and let it form into a                little ball, and which is just a multi-cellular structure, called                an embryoid body.                Now, this was an unfortunate name that was given to it by a French                pathologist back in the '30s, but as you can imagine, when someone                in a political sense talks about an embryoid body, they conjure                up embryos here.                But these are little clusters of cells, and within those or within                that cluster, the beginning of differentiation begins. These cell-cell                interactions are essential for this. We have not been able to mimic                this in a sheep yet.                So what happens is you get within that ball a variety of cell                types being formed, and all that you want to do is to disassociate                that ball after a period of time, and select out only those that                are going in the direction that you want them to go in.                So this is what we did in that experiment, and so we have now                these EBD lines, and in these lines, in these human lines, and these                lines have been placed in a large number of animals, in the grafts                that we have used, we have never seen a tumor up to this point.                And it may be unique to humans, because human primary cultures                are easy to establish and mouse aren't. I mean, there is an issue                here that we don't know that you can't do the same experiment in                the mouse.                So with our experience with the EBDs, we have never seen a tumor.                Our experience in the mouse and using what we thought were equivalent                lines, we have seen too many tumors with respect to grafts into                the central nervous system.                 DR. HURLBUT: :  Just                parenthetically haven't I been reading all along that embryoid bodies                are also formed from ES cells?                 DR. GEARHART:  Oh, yes,                absolutely.                 DR. HURLBUT: :  But the                point is that your particular lines don't produce tumors, and the                ones derived from the primordial germ cells don't seem to produce                tumors; whereas, the embryonic stem cell lines do?                 DR. GEARHART:  Well,                the only comparison that we have at this point are mouse ES lines,                in which we have derived different types of precursors under different                conditions, have been compared to human EG lines that have been                derived, or which precursors have been derived in a slightly different                manner.                You can't derive them both in the same way. We have seen nothing                up to this point on human ES derived lines transplanted. We just                have not seen any data on that.                So I don't want to make it clear that there is a difference between                the derivation either from a germ cell derived, or an inner-cell                mass derived line. Does that make sense? That comparison is not                there yet.                 DR. HURLBUT: :  Well,                obviously what I have been getting at here is if in fact your cell                lines are less likely to cause tumors, then does that imply that                there might be some advantage to using your cell lines, and if so,                would it in fact be the greatest advantage if a patient's own cell                line could be derived from primordial germ cells?                 DR. GEARHART:  Oh, boy,                this committee would -- well, wow. Now, think what this means. It                means that you would be generating an embryo, and having it implanted.                Now, what you don't know is that our fetal tissue comes from 5-to-9                weeks post-fertilization. These are therapeutic abortions.                And which means now that you are way beyond -- I mean, the point                of where a blastocyst is, and obviously way beyond I think anyone                subscribing to that approach.                 DR. HURLBUT: :  You told                us that in your paper.                 DR. GEARHART:  Okay.                 DR. HURLBUT: :  But is                it true that maybe there would be some great advantage if we could                find a legitimate way to harvest tissues generated from a specific                patient at a later date?                 DR. GEARHART:  Right.                Well, I think it would be terribly risky. We have been asked this                question a lot though; is it possible to do a biopsy on a developing                embryo, and to remove just a few germ cells.                I think at the stage that we are using these embryos are a matter                of -- or fetuses are a matter of maybe 6 or 7 millimeters in length,                and to do the surgery on this I think would just be impossible without                causing harm.                The other issue that I would contend is do you think it would                be okay to go in and remove the germ cells from an embryo and let                that individual go on and say, well, we have taken your germ cells.                Now, we have another therapy for you.                And so I don't think it is a very good thing to do.                 DR. HURLBUT: :  And that                is my final point, and I wanted to ask you personally in working                with these cells, do you see 14 days as some kind of magic marker                moment?                Do you see something crucial about implantation? And you spoke                of keeping all options open.                 DR. GEARHART:  Right.                 DR. HURLBUT: :  Why in                fact do we allow abortion fairly late in term, and yet now we are                speaking as 14 days as the sacred moment? I know that I am opening                a very difficult issue here.                But in fact wouldn't we gain a lot scientifically from extending                that 14 day limit potentially if we could find a culture median                that could sustain the embryo, or wouldn't we gain a lot from implanting,                even gestating and harvesting?                And why do we feel that we shouldn't do those things? And I would                also be interested in your personal response to these ethical issues.                 DR. GEARHART:  Wow,                you have asked a lot. As you know, stem cells have been obtained                from many stages of human fetal development, and have been found                to be useful in generating various cell types in culture.                And if we look at a variety of studies, you can find it in the                published literature. We have had a number of requests for fetal                tissue at different stages, and I think legitimate requests of investigators                willing to investigate cell lineages, et cetera, within the embryo.                So people have been thinking about it. I mean, there is no question                about that. We have found it difficult enough to be fortunate enough                to obtain the fetal tissue that we work with.                I mean, there is a consenting process and we have nothing really                to do with other than to make sure that it complies with institutional,                Federal, and State law.                To obtain viable tissue from abortuses of any kind is a major                concern. When we started our studies, we looked into using spontaneously                aborted material, which occurs across the board, but mainly in the                early stages.                And we thought that this would be a good source. As it turned                out, by the time that we were notified -- and this occurs in outlying                hospitals, and not at major medical centers, where investigators                are -- you know, a patient presents with a miscarriage, and it is                taken care of in the ER.                And it turned out that it was very ineffective, number one. And,                number two, and then I will get back to your question, we found                that most of the material that did come to us had chromosomal abnormalities                that made it less desirable for use.                Now, the issue of the 14 days, and what does it mean. Well, this                was something that really came into play in the United Kingdom when                they were trying to deal with this issue.                And it was decided at that point that at that stage the embryo                still does not have a central nervous system. It can feel no pain,                et cetera. And this was why basically that period of time was set                to be able to grow them in culture, or to remove tissue.                We, as embryologists, argue the point all the time as to what                is going on in these early stages, and we were always asked these                questions. When do you believe personhood occurs and when is it                established, and things like this.                To me that is not a biologic question. We don't have a means of                probing that. So I think that is why the 14 days was selected, and                that's why it is sort of adhered to in a sense.                Do I adhere to that? Well, to a certain degree, no. We take material                that is later on, and it is cadaveric fetal tissue. I think that                we should be able to utilize any tissue that comes out of abortion                if the alternative is that it is just going to be disposed of, which                is what happens.                The pathologist takes a look at it to make sure that all of the                parts are accounted for, and there is an issue about being concerned                about what is left in the uterus.                That is my personal opinion on that. But I don't think that we                should be going and establishing pregnancies, and to downstream                then utilize that tissue.                I mean, to then stop the pregnancy and then to recover it. I mean,                that is my personal opinion. I don't think we should be doing that.                As you know, years ago, President Reagan was faced with this, I                believe, when he heard that families were establishing pregnancies                so that regions of the brain could be harvested to treat Parkinson's                disease in the family.                And clearly we don't subscribe to that in any fashion.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Thank                you. We are coming up to the break and I have Paul McHugh, Mike                Gazzaniga, and we are running a little late because we started a                little late. We will take a break shortly. Paul and then Mike.                 DR. MCHUGH:  My point                is very brief, John, because you have touched upon it in several                places. But first of all, I want to thank you very much for that                coherent presentation, and I especially thank you for showing us                experimental data.                And that is what of course generates better questions to ask you.                And it is really out of that experimental work that I did have a                question. And that is what you showed us was fundamentally a xenograftic                experiment using human tissue, human cells, in rats.                And the results were very interesting, and not only was there                growth of cells, but you told us that there were trophic factors                that were probably acting in this way.                And I then wondered, and you can answer this, why was it necessary                to use human cells to demonstrate this phenomenon in a rat, and                why weren't you using rat cells to do rat experiments.                And if that is true, that you could do rat cells to do rat things                and the like, the development of the question is would it not be                wise of us to ask you all to go back and work with your rats and                your mice, and your cats and your sheep, and keep going at it, and                come back and tell us why you need human stuff to do this stuff,                okay?                 DR. GEARHART:  Okay.                We did it first with mouse cells. We don't have rat embryonic stem                cells. We did it first with the mouse and it worked.                And in our exuberance, saying, well, would the human cells work,                and they did. There is no question that I think that the mouse cells                worked better, and the mouse cells were from these neural precursors                that we had obtained that I had mentioned that we had this concern                about tumors.                But they did work, and so the only two cell types that we have                found at this point that work have very similar origins if you know                what I mean.                Clearly the paradigm has to be extended to other sources of stem                cells, adult and umbilical, and this is planned to say in this particular                paradigm will it work.                So, Paul, the answer is that we did it first with the rodent cells,                and we could pursue that. I mean, as far as looking for the growth                factors and what not.                But we have changed almost completely to the human cells for trying                to determine what those growth factors were that were secreted,                but we could do that again with the mouse, absolutely.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Mike.                 DR. GAZZANIGA:  Just                briefly, thank you again for a wonderful presentation. This moves                to another level, and that is how big is the American biomedical                engine.                And I ask that from the sense of having just taken a trip to China                and Japan, and England, and you read that Sweden and Singapore,                and India, and so forth, are going ahead.                If America dropped out of this for legal reasons that are on the                horizon, how big an impact would that have on the overall resolution                and development of these therapies?                In other words, if you just look across molecular genetics and                microbiology now, and prior to this issue arising, what is the size                and importance of the American effort?                 DR. GEARHART:  Well,                I don't think that there is any question that the investigators                funded through the National Institutes of Health, and our academic                establishments here, are the engine that drives biologic research,                biomedical research, in the world.                There is no question about it. I mean, the volume, the sheer volume                of this, is enormous. And if you look at this compared to even in                our country to what the biomedical industry, or I mean the private                industry is putting into this, it is dwarfed by the Federal funding.                And this is really what is enabling and this is why I think the                U.S. has been so far ahead. So it is essential I think to have Federal                funding into this area really to reach our goals as quickly as possible.                There is one last thing or one thing that I would like to say                to the committee, and it is understandable, but when you are in                and start in a business like this, you don't know the impact of                it.                The thousands of communications that we have received from patients,                and patient-based groups, about our work and about moving the work                along, not only is it emotional, it is unbelievable. I mean, from                the standpoint of just pure numbers, sheer numbers.                It doesn't just extend within the United States, but throughout                the world. In 1998 when we published our paper, within a few days                we had 10,000 e-mails alone about it.                And every day I still get hundreds of e-mails relating to this.                It extends not only to bona fide -- you know, many people don't                understand what this work is about.                They are contacting you for a brain, or a uterus, or from some                countries we have had requests, hundreds of requests for penises,                for example. And you are trying to figure out why -- you know, what                is the issue here.                We need education and we need informing to say that we are dealing                really with cells and tissues at this point. That is what we are                really about. It is going to be years away before it goes beyond                that.                And so what I am trying to say is that there are requests throughout                the world. So that is one issue. I mean, the pressure is enormous,                and also people offering you large sums of money to provide them                with cells outside of the arena that it should be done in. Do you                know what I mean?                There is desperation, and you see this, and it is tragic, and                as a researcher this is new to you. This is something that you are                not accustomed to and never will be accustomed to handling.                So I just wanted to let you know what that pressure is like. It                is enormous. I have boxes full of these things. I don't know what                I am going to do with them, but you try to respond.                There has been an issue with brain drain. We know that there has                been one investigator from the University of California system that                went to the U.K. and received one-and-a-half million pounds to pursue                this work in the U.K.                Well, this happened here. I will tell you that -- and I am talking                to students in our own group, you know, go to Europe for your post-doc,                and go to England for your post-doc if you want to continue in this                thing.                And I think you will see more of this, and whether major investigators                will leave, I don't think so. I think we will get through this,                and I hope that we will get through this period in this country.                There are many, many investigators, many investigators, and I                can't tell you what it is like not to be able to give a cell to                the person next door to you because of a policy.                I mean, this is just an incredible situation. I think we will                get through it, and I think we will be okay. But I am still concerned                about it. Sorry for the editorial, but I think it is important.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Charles,                did you want a quick word?                 DR. KRAUTHAMMER : If I could just ask                a very quick question. You said that you would oppose and you supported                the opposition of creating a fetus for, say, harvesting the brain                cells, and you talked about the example in the Reagan years.                On the other hand, there is no difficulty, at least in your estimation,                of using tissue from a discarded fetus already aborted, and tissue                which would otherwise be thrown away.                Would you apply that same distinction to the embryonic stage?                In other words, you now use -- you develop embryonic stem cells                from discarded embryos from IVF clinics, and would you be equally                opposed to the creation of embryos specifically for their use as                sources of embryos using that same analogy?                 DR. GEARHART:  No, I                would not be opposed to that. I don't give the same moral status                to that entity.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Well,                we have -- let me just make mention of one matter. Janet Rowley                has submitted in writing, and I would endorse, these questions if                we had enough time.                We would like your comments on what kind of regulation you think                might be or should be developed for this area, and what is the status                of government support for what kind of research, and what are the                limitations that are counterproductive.                If we could invite -- if you would be willing, and these are hard                questions and they are big questions, but if you would be willing                to respond if we put these set of questions to you, and perhaps                some others to you in a letter?                 DR. GEARHART:  Absolutely.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  I think                the committee would be very grateful for your help in thinking through                the regulatory questions, which are at the moment not what we have                here.                 DR. GEARHART:  Absolutely.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  I just                want to thank you very, very much, for an instructive morning, and                also for the wonderful spirit in which you presented your remarks                and engaged the questions. I am very grateful to you for coming.                We are running about 15 minutes behind, and we will reconvene                at a quarter-of. We have an hour-and-a-half for the second session                this morning as originally planned.                (Whereupon, at 10:33 a.m., the council was recessed and resumed                at 10:49 a.m.)                                                    SESSION 2: STEM                CELLS 2:                MEDICAL PROMISE OF ADULT STEM CELL RESEARCH (PRESENT AND PROJECTED)                 DR. CATHERINE VERFAILLIE                   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Would                the members please rejoin the meeting. While we are waiting in the                hope that our straggling colleagues will arrive, a couple of matters                of business.                If anyone has not turned in a request for a box lunch, please                do so now, and that should be in front of you. We will have lunch                in the room just down the hall where we gathered before.                The photographer who has been around here is doing individual                photographs for the commission and he will want to take individual                photos of members, and we can do that in connection with lunch.                And you will also have in front of you in addition to the materials                that Dr. Gearhart provided us, which by the way is -- and the lights                were out and so you couldn't see, but one could recapitulate his                talk with the help of the figures here, as well as checking his                article in Nature.                But you also have in front of you a revised version of Bill Hurlbut's                memorandum. This has been updated and corrected, and he would like                us to substitute it for the one that was sent around earlier this                week. Is that correct, Bill?                 DR. HURLBUT: :  Yes.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  All                right. Well, again, it is a great pleasure to welcome Dr. Catherine                Verfaillie, from the University of Minnesota. You have her curriculum                vitae in the briefing book, which you can consult.                I won't waste any more of her time by reading from it, and just                simply allow her to help educate us on the prospects of present                and projected of adult stem cells for regenerative medicine.                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  Good                morning. I would also like to start out and thank Dr. Kass and the                council to allow me to present this information on new findings                in adult stem cell biology which have been received with great excitement,                and correctly so. If they are, and they are actually set upside                down, the classical paradigms of biology, and so to be able to do                that you have to have full proof to actually be able to be in a                position like that.                If they are, and they are actually set upside down, the classical                paradigms of biology, and so to be able to do that you have to have                full proof to actually be able to be in a position like that.                As Dr. Gearhart already gave in his previous eloquent description                of what stem cells are and what they can do, and we will get back                to that to some extent at the end, although we are far away from                actually being able to use adult stem cells for clinical applications.                But what I would like to do is give you an overview of the greater                potential of adult stem cells, which has always been termed adult                stem cell plasticity, and what we do know and what we don't know.                And where this may actually lead us. Dr. Gearhart also indicated                that embryonic stem cells in humans are fairly or very much in their                infancy, the same as we are for adult stem cell biology, too, and                so I don't think we are anywhere close to be able to come up with                new therapies at this point in time.                I would also like to reiterate that even though my laboratory                and our group works on adult stem cells, we have actually actively                pursued investigators in embryonic stem cell research, human embryonic                stem cells, just so that within the same institution we would have                laboratories that have one cell, and other laboratories that have                the other cell, so we would be in a position to compare and contrast                the potential of the different cell populations, and I think that                is very important.                With that, I will actually start my presentation, and I will point                out that the work was mainly funded through the NIH, since it is                all adult stems that we are working on, and not embryonic stems.                And also a number of foundations and one pharmaceutical company.                Dr. Gearhart already gave you an overview of where embryonic stem                cells come from, and where primordial germ cells or stems come from.                And I am going to reiterate that for you.                I just put up this cartoon that Dr. Weissman published two years                ago in Science to point out a couple of things. During development,                cells in the inner cell mass make sequential decisions, and each                of these decisions is actually accompanied with gain of function,                but also loss of function.                The gain of function is that the cells learn how to become a more                specified cell type; and on the other hand, actually lose the potential                to become other cell types.                And so the decision to be made is somatic or germ cell, and within                the somatic lineage doing something that is called gastrulation,                cells decide to become the different parts of our body, whether                it is endoderm, which is the internal organs, mesoderm, which are                limbs and soft tissue, and ectoderm, which really comprise the skin,                the central and peripheral nervous system.                And within each of these groups cells again make decisions and                learn how to become stem cells for specific organs. And the stem                cells for specific organs that has been most well studied is actually                the hematopoietic stem cell, which is currently extensively being                used in clinical applications for bone marrow transplantations or                peripheral blood stem cell transplantations, or cord blood transplantations.                And so that actually has set the paradigm on how we decide what                stem cells are. Aside from hematopoietic stem cells or blood stem                cells, we have a number of investigators who have identified tissue-specific                stem cells in a number of different organs, including for instance                the brain, which we until about 10 or 20 years ago thought was a                final product when we were born.                But it is now clear that there are stem cells in the brain that                can recreate neurons and other components. There is also stem cells                in the liver, and stem cells in the gut, and there is stem cells                in the skin, and so forth.                The reason why I put this slide up is actually to point out that                these arrows have always gone down, and so we have always thought                that each time a cell decided to learn something new that it lost                the capability of doing something else.                And so if we envisioned beforehand that the arrows would be reversed,                we thought that was possible, but we associated that with classical                transformation, or actually cancer-forming cells.                So what do we know about hematopoietic stem cells and that is                really the paradigm to which I am going to try to talk through the                whole field of adult stem cells.                In hematopoietic stem cells, we can actually take a single mouse                bone marrow cell that we characterize by proteins on the cell surface,                and take that single cell, and for instance you can take it from                a mouse that is engineered to fluoresce green under a specific light,                and put that in a regular mouse, and ask whether they can reconstitute                the blood elements of that animal.                And a number of investigators have actually been able to do that.                You can take a single cell, and give it to a mouse that was lethally                irradiated so it has no blood, and this cell can recreate the red                cells, the white cells, platelets, lymphocytes, for the lifetime                of that animal.                And that is really the proof that you have a stem cell that can                self-renew, and a single cell can make multiple different things,                and it can repopulate functionally the organ that it needs to repopulate.                And so that is really the criteria that we have to hold ourselves                to, to actually talk about stem cells, and if you talk about plasticity,                you will have to hold us on the same criteria and showing that a                single cell can now make two tissues, and that this cell can make                two tissues from a single cell, and that these new cells can repopulate                a tissue functionally in vitro.                Now, over the last 5 or 6 years, there has been an enormous number                -- well, not an enormous number, but probably 40 or 50 papers now                that have come out in the scientific publications that have used                the word adult stem cell plasticity.                And what is meant by that is that you take a cell that was supposed                to be a one cell type. For instance, you take a bone marrow cell,                or you take cells that are enriched for hematopoietic stem cells.                And it appears that some of these cells may acquire characteristics                of cells outside of the organ where they came from. And so it has                been shown for bone marrow cells, or cells enriched for hematopoietic                cells, that if you transplant these into an animal that was irradiated,                and you look in tissues outside of the blood, that you can actually                find, for instance, skeletal-muscle cells, heart muscle cells, or                endothelial cells, that are now derived from this donor hematopoietic                cell.                There is also papers that have shown that if you take muscle from                an animal and mix it up in the laboratory, and culture it for a                few days, and then use the muscle tissue to give back to an animal,                that you could reconstitute the blood system in that animal.                Now, if you think in anatomical terms, this is still within one                of the three categories that I gave you at the beginning; mesoderm,                endoderm, and ectoderm, and all of this is still within the mesoderm.                So this is maybe not so hard to understand.                However, there is also papers that two different cells from bone                marrow, hematopoietic cells, and zymogenic cells, which are cells                that make bone and cartilage, can give rise to cells that appear                to have neuronal characteristics, both neurons and glial cells,                that support the structure of the brain.                And there is a number of studies that have shown that bone marrow                cells can contribute to liver, skin, lung, gut, and so forth, and                so you can pretty much put arrows in whichever way you want.                You know, people have published data that suggests that indeed                this may be possible. So obviously this goes against our paradigms                and this would say that either something strange is going on, and                just something in the last few years is something that we have actually                identified.                Now, if we want to talk about blastocyst, I started out with the                paradigm of stem cells, and so there is multiple different possibilities                here.                Either the bone marrow, which seems to be the organ that harbors                the most of these cells, harbors many, many different stem cells,                and it harbors the hematopoietic stem cells, but it also harbors                the neuro stem cell, and the liver stem cell, and so forth.                And which that would not be bad, but that truly would not be a                single stem cell that could be expanded and used to actually transplant                patients with all kinds of different organ diseases.                A second possibility is that somehow the cell can be ""de-differentiated""                and redifferentiated, depending on the environment that it is put                in, and that the hematopoietic stem cell can learn how to become                a liver if you put it in the liver, or it can learn how to become                a brain if you put it in the brain.                Or it could be that it is a remnant of embryonic stem cells or                the primordial germ cells that you heard about from Dr. Gearhart                that are left around in the body, and that under specific circumstances                can be reactivated and contribute to tissues.                And the issue of fusion has been brought up because of the two                papers recently in Nature, and the possibility is in theory that                what we see is actually that.                For instance, a hematopoietic stem cell fuses with a liver cell,                and now you actually have something that is a hybrid, but it has                actually liver characteristics.                The other questions that I am going to try to address, and I don't                have all the answers for this, is this actually clinically relevant?                You know, if you transplant bone marrow into a patient and you find                two liver cells that are derived from the patient, from the donor,                it doesn't necessarily mean that that is going to help anybody down                the line.                So the graft has to be robust and persistent, and there has to                really be proved that we don't just see cells that look like a tissue                that they end up in, but they also have to function like a tissue                that they end up in.                And then the question that I will bring back up at the end, the                first question, what is plasticity, and will that matter from a                clinical standpoint?                And so we started out in this field -- I am a hematologist, and                I do bone marrow transplantation as my clinical profession, and                I have been interested in hematopoietic stems in the bone marrow.                And about six years ago somebody in our group asked me whether                we could grow mesenchymal stem cells, which are cells that may grow                on cartilage, to treat children with a specific genetic disease                called Hurler's disease.                And when we did this, mesenchymal stems we happened to find, and                we went about trying to create these to be in compliance with GMP                qualifications, meaning we were trying to remove all sera out of                the system, and yet we were trying to use very well defined culture                systems.                And so while we were doing this, we came up with a cell that you                have heard Dr. Kass refer to as a multi-potent adult progenitor                cell, because we don't have a much better word for it.                And it will be appreciated as MAPC, and which appears to have                a much greater possibilities than the mesenchymal stem cell possibilities.                So we take these cells from bone marrow from humans, and we can                also take them from mice and from rats.                And you place these in a culture system that is very well defined,                and ingredients, and growth factors, and no serum, and low density,                and we expand the cells as much as we can by splitting the cultures                on a regular basis.                And if we do this, we have actually found that these cells appear                to have an enormous growth potential. And so here on the left-hand                side would be bone marrow from an individual, and we start with                about 10cc's or a spoon of bone marrow, deplete all the blood elements                from the bone marrow, and put it in a culture dish, and then grow                the cells for long periods of time.                Classical adult cells would actually not expand much more than                50 times or 60 cell population doublings, just because we have a                clock inside the cell that actually causes the cells to become senescent                or old once they go beyond a certain number of cell divisions.                And so in the human system, as well as in the mouse and the rat                system, we have been able to show that we can create or grow cells                that do not seem to conform to this internal aging clock.                And the cells can go beyond that and the human cells are now close                to a hundred population doublings, and in mouse and rat, over 150                population doublings.                If you look at the aging clock itself, which are the telomeres,                the telomeres are long and they do not seem to shorten in culture,                which goes again with the idea that the cells do not senesce in                culture.                So in this respect, they have characteristics that are similar                to what you would find in embryonic stem cells, but also this internal                clock is actually not working.                The phenotype of the cell is strange, and it doesn't really fit                anything in particular, but there is definitely no characteristics                in these cells.                These cells are blood hematopoietic stem cells, and I am not going                to go through all the details here, but if you do an extensive phenotype                characterization of the cells, they don't look like blood.                They have some characteristics of embryonic stem cells, but there                are a lot of other ones that they do not have. So they have some                genes that are turned on that are present also in embryonic stem                cells, which are the top two here, and then they have on the cell                surface antigens that you really only find on embryonic stem cells,                or primordial germ cells.                So in some respects again these cells have some features of embryonic                stem cells, even though we got these from the bone marrow of humans,                mice, and rats.                We then started trying to test initially all in culture dishes                what these cells could do, and we asked whether they could differentiate                in multiple different cell types.                And because our initial charge was actually to try to grow mesenchymal                cells and make bone and cartilage, that is what we did first. And                so what we showed in the culture dish is that if we switch the culture                conditions around, and actually use ingredients that are no longer                supported for maintaining the stem cells in an undifferentiated                state, by actually switch them such that we hope that we can turn                on the genetic programs to make bone or cartilage, and so forth,                we could indeed do this.                And this is no different than the classical mesenchymal stems                that have been described. So we can induce the cells to become bone,                and if we say that they differentiated into bone tissue, it is actually                a calcified tissue at the bottom of a dish.                We can induce the cells to become cartilage that looks like articular                cartilage, even though it isn't very well organized. And you can                induce the cells to become lipid-laden lipocytes, and we can induce                them to become skeletal muscle cells.                And these cells can actually fuse and make long muscle tubes almost,                and we can induce the cells to express a number of muscle markers                for the heart, even though we haven't really seen beating cells.                And so we don't really know whether these cells are heart muscle                cells. So this is still not that strange, because there is this                cell in the bone marrow that has been identified that can do this.                Now, we found three other lineages that are completely outside                of the mesenchymal lineage, and some of this has been published,                and most of it is actually in press currently.                One of the things that we found is that these cells can differentiate                into cells that line blood vessels, which we call endothelial cells.                And we have been able to show that these cells differentiate into                cells that look like endothelial cells, but also function as endothelial                cells.                And as shown in this picture here is actually a blood vessel from                an animal that had a tumor underneath the skin, and we actually                infused human endothelial cells derived from human MAPCs in this                animal, and showed that these endothelial cells seek out the tumor                and actually help create new blood vessels in the tumor, which the                tumor needs otherwise it can't grow.                And so this proves that these cells that are in the bone marrow                can differentiate into cells that can make endothelium. More surprisingly                is that the cells can differentiate into cells that look like neutrons,                look like astrocytes, and support themselves in the brain, and to                some extent function like these cells in the brain.                And so we show here that they differentiated into cells that look                like neurons and have electrophysiological characteristics like                neurons.                And so this is the second major layer of the embryo, and then                we also have been able to show that we can make these cells differentiate                into cells that look like liver cells, and actually function like                liver cells in a culture dish.                And so this would mean that this cell population, these MAPC cells,                can actually differentiate into all of the major components of a                human being, even though we only show a few cell lineages here.                I am not going to go through this in too much detail because it                is highly technical, but essentially we have not been able to use                genetic marking to prove that this could all be derived from a single                cell, and we don't depend on population of cells.                So this fulfills two of the criteria of a stem cell. A single                cell can differentiate and grow for long periods of time, and can                differentiate into multiple different tissue cells.                Two more sets of experiments were done to try to gauge the potential                of these cells. The first one was done in an chimeric animal model,                in which we took the adult cells, and injected even a single adult                cell into the blastocyst of a mouse and asked what would happen                in this mouse, and whether we would see contribution to some tissues,                no tissues, or all tissues.                So we injected a single cell or we injected 10 to 12 cells, and                shown here are two animals. The top one is obviously and the donor                cells here have a gene that if you stain it correctly the cells                turn blue.                So what we did is we let the animals get born, and we looked at                the animals by genetic tools to try to figure out if there were                donor cells in multiple different organs.                And we also then took the mouse and actually cut a thin slice                through the middle of the animal and asked which organs would have                blue cells contributing to the mouse.                The top mouse is an animal that if you looked in the tail by genetic                tools that we couldn't find any donor cells, and the bottom mouse                here, this is its head, and over here would be his tail, and you                can see the spine, and the brain, and all the internal organs.                And you can see that the majority of all the tissues of this animal                actually appear to be derived from a single blue adult cell that                we have put into the blastocyst.                The efficiency isn't a hundred percent, and this is shown on the                bottom here, and so if you look over here, and if you put in one                cell per blastocyst, 60 percent of the animals will not be chimeric,                but 30 percent or 40 percent of the animals will be chimeric to                varying degrees.                If you increase the cell number the chimericism goes up. So this                is probably not quite as good as embryonic stem cells, but it is                a fairly significant degree of chimericism, and actually the frequency                appears to be one in three cells.                So this would suggest that the cells can probably make under the                right circumstances more cell types than we have be able to prove                in a culture dish.                We can also ask if we now take these stem cells and give them                to a mouse that is born, and we give here again cells from the donors'                mouse, which again are blue, and we gave these to an animal that                was either not irradiated or irradiated with a small amount of radiation                therapy in the hope that maybe that would help the cells engraft.                We used an immune-deficient recipient mouse, just because we were                worried that the new genes that are in the blue mouse might actually                be a basis for rejection. So we don't know what would happen in                a non-immumodeficient mouse.                If we do this, what we found is that we do find engraftment in                some tissues, but not all. So, for instance, in the top panel, we                see that there is engraftment between 3 and 9 percent in the hematopoietic                system of this mouse, and we can find the cells, and the blood we                can find in the bone marrow, and we can bind them in the spleen.                And if we look in these animals, we can also find over here, and                what we did is we actually -- the blue color, we used an antibody                that is now green, and co-labeled it with a red stain that stains                the specific tissue.                And you can see in the liver that there is areas in the liver                where donor cells appear to be present. And there is areas in the                guts, in the villae of the gut, where donor cells appear to be present.                And there is areas in the lung where donor cells appear to be                present. The presence of these cells can be seen anywhere from four                weeks after transplantation, all the way to 24 weeks, which is about                six months, and the unfortunate thing with the mouse model that                we use is that these mice usually die from lymphomas at an early                age because of the deficiency that they have.                So we really have not been able to extend the cultures or have                the mouse experiments beyond 6 months, and so we are actually trying                to go further.                We transplant the cells in an animal that is 6 to 8 weeks old,                and so it is not a very young mouse, and it is also not an old mouse.                What we showed is that if you damage certain tissues like the hematopoietic                system, and the gut system, that you have increased engraftment,                which is consistent with the fact that these cells go to places                where the repair might be needed.                However, we did not see in this mouse model engraftment in a number                of other tissues, and mind you that we gave these cells IV to an                intact mouse, which actually was not damaged in any way, shape,                or form.                And we don't see engraftment in the heart, skeletal muscle, or                brain, and these tissues do not proliferate. We also don't see engraftment                in the skin and the kidney, and so these organs we didn't really                see very much engraftment.                However, if you infused the cells directly in the muscle, which                causes damage, and actually done the cells in response to the local                cues within the muscle, appear to be able to differentiate into                muscle cells.                So it appears that these cells have the ability and blastocyst                experiment to give rise to many, many different tissue types, if                given post-natally, and we gave them as stem cells, not as differentiated                cells.                They appear to be able to respond at least in some respects to                cues that are present in certain organs to differentiate into the                cell type that is specific for that organ.                We have looked carefully at the cells in culture and we do not                see a significant number of gross genetic abnormalities. We have                not looked with a very fine-toothed comb through whether there might                be some minor genetic abnormalities over time and culture, and these                studies are ongoing.                If we infused the MAPCs in animals, we really do not see any tumors,                and so far we have not seen that there are tumors that Dr. Gearhart                talked about, and we also have not seen any other tumors.                Obviously if these cells come from bone marrow there is lots of                precedent on bone marrow transplantations, where actually if you                do this, actually you do not cause tumors in patients.                So MAPC that we have identified in our laboratory seems to be                a cell that is not senescing and that can be found in adult tissues                of humans, as well as mouse and rats, and they seem to be capable                of giving rise to cells from the three germ layers, and it can engraft                in vitro in a limited number of tissues.                Now, what I cannot tell is whether these cells actually exist                as such in a person, in a mouse, or in a rat, or whether our culture                condition is actually such that it, quote, reprograms or dedifferentiates                the cells that we take out of the animal, and that then acquire                this much more greater potential, and I will come back to that in                just one second.                So we now go back to my initial definition of what is plasticity,                which is really at the bottom of all of the adult stem cell excitement.                I mentioned initially that we would have to show that this is a                single cell of a rat, and I think the majority of papers so far                published have actually really not been able to prove that a single                cell could, for instance, give rise to blood and muscle.                In vitro, we have evidence for that, and in the blastocyst injection,                we took a single cell and actually found multiple different tissues.                You could ask, well, does it matter?                Does it matter if there are multiple different cell types in the                bone marrow, and I think ultimately from an FDA or regulatory standpoint,                it will matter, and we will have to be able to say exactly what                cells that we are using to be able to acquire a certain function                in vitro, and so I think that will be important.                The second question is, is the differentiation or is the remnant                ES, and again you could say, well, it probably doesn't matter. But                I think at this point in time, I don't think anybody in this field                knows whether these are left-over early stem cells like ES cells,                or whether these cells are cells that can be reprogrammed, and redifferentiated,                and dedifferentiated under certain circumstances.                Now, does it matter? Well, you heard from Dr. Gearhart that embryonic                stem cells as such, and not necessarily the differentiated progeny,                but the ES cells themselves can cause teratomas, and even though                nobody in the adult stem cell plasticity era has actually shown                teratomas, it doesn't mean that it might not happen.                If it is dedifferentiation, it means that you reprogram or you                change the genetic material in a cell. But if you do that, currently                we have no proof that we actually change something and actually                cause an oncogene or something like that to be activated, but that                is definitely within the possibilities, and that definitely needs                to be looked at carefully.                Is it fusion? All the in vitro work that has been published, including                the data that I have shown to you today, I couldn't prove beyond                any doubt that that is not based on fusion.                Our in vitro data, we have never co-cultured things with anything.                So we have single cells that are deployed that can do multiple different                things, and so we can't really ascribe that to fusion.                However, in vitro, I couldn't prove it to you today, and we are                doing studies to try to address this. I think that fusion might                be the reason why some studies in which a lot of pressure has been                put on to the system, which is essentially what those two papers                had to do in vitro.                So we have a lot of pressure exerted to have that one cell survive                after it fuses, and that is a possibility. Also, single cells that                are found, rather than whole colonies, may also be the result of                fusion, more so than experiments where you see huge colonies arise                in an in vivo model.                And so I think we currently cannot exclude the possibility that                some of the data is as a result of fusion. Some would say does it                matter, and I think it matters a whole lot, even though some investigators                say, well, if you fuse the cells and it functions properly, it probably                doesn't matter.                But I think ultimately that we do need to make sure that we understand                the whole mechanism underlying everything. And is all this plasticity                clinically relevant?                And so the majority of studies published to date have actually                shown the very low numbers of tissue differentiated cells can be                found in multiple different tissues.                A number of papers have been published, two in particular. The                paper by Lagasse, et al., where they show that they could rescue                an animal with liver failure by bone marrow transplantation, but                they have significant degrees of engraftment.                So that definitely was up to 80 or 90 percent of the liver could                be replaced by bone marrow cells. And a paper by Don Orlic showing                that if they injected stem cells into the heart that was infarcted                that a significant amount of donor cells would be found in the heart.                And in the data that I have shown you, that we have up to 5 to                9 percent of the differentiated tissue that seems to be derived                from the graft.                However, the majority of studies again haven't really addressed                the other question in plasticity, meaning is it in vitro functional                differentiation?                And there is really only a single study that has been able to                show that, and it is again the same study by Lagasse, et al., who                showed that if you did bone marrow transplantation in an animal                that had a failing liver, you could rescue the animal and take it                off the drugs that kept it alive.                Some studies have shown that there is functional improvement,                although the mechanism for the functional improvement isn't completely                known, and that is to some extent similar to what you heard from                Dr. Gearhart.                And so there is a number of studies who have injected cells in                adults in organs and have shown, for instance, that there was improvement                in the neuronal function, and that there was improvement in heart                function, although there is no proof that the cells, per se, were                actually responsible for doing this.                And the question will be is this acceptable from a clinical standpoint,                and if you show only functional improvement without knowing the                mechanism for knowing why we see functional improvement, and in                the long term, again, that is not a tenable situation, and we really                have to dig into this much further.                So what can adult stem cells be used for? Well, I think like embryonic                stem cells, or primordial germ cells as you heard from Dr. Gearhart,                the cells are good tools to study five basic principles in biology.                And we can study self-renewal, and we can study differentiation                and redifferentiation if that is indeed the case, and learn what                the implications for that are.                And actually try to understand how organs are being created, and                what the genetic programs are that you need to turn on. The cells,                like other stem cell populations, could be used for drug discovery,                for drug toxicity screening.                Adult stem cells could be used as systemic therapies, and currently                systemic therapies are done with adult stem cells. Bone marrow transplantation                is done every day in many, many institutions around the world, and                so we can infuse these cells if we do not think that they make tumors.                So since adult stem cells don't seem to have that as their side                effect, theoretically, we could genetically correct cells for patients                who have deficiencies of certain enzymes. And the disease, and Hurler's                disease would be one example, and a second possibility would be,                for instance, in hemophilia, where you need to have a cell that                produces clotting factors.                Or other congenital diseases, like Alpha-1-Antitrypsin deficiency,                or it could be used for systemic cell therapy, which you would have                to treat in many, many different places in the human being. For                instance, muscular dystrophy.                So if you had a stem cell that was able to engraft in most muscles,                and you could genetically correct it, you could correct that disease                in patients with that disease.                Systemic cell therapy may be more complicated with cells that                have the inherent capability of making teratomas just because you                would always run the risk that teratomas might show up.                And then again if this field progresses further, the same diseases                that has been quoted for embryonic stem cell therapies would also                be on the list here, and if indeed the cells can differentiate into                functional neuron cells, they could be used to treat Parkinson's                disease and many other ones.                And since the cells can appear to be able to differentiate into                functional liver cells, they could be used either in vivo to replace                the liver, but also would be very useful to make bioartificial livers,                for instance.                We have shown, and others have shown, that cells from bone marrow                can contribute to new blood vessels, and so this could be harnessed                to create new blood vessels in vivo, or actually the opposite; lower                these cells with anti-cancer agents, and actually use them in a                anti-angiogenesis approach for treatment of cancer, and then many                other diseases.                Again, we are not anywhere close to being able to do this in any                way, shape, or form, and a lot of basic research still needs to                go on.                So the first point that was on my previous slide, we really need                to spend a lot of time in trying to understand what these cells                are and aren't.                And at the same time, start thinking about how we might be able                to scale these up under GMP conditions that conform with regulatory                agencies, and we will have to ask the question, as with any other                stem cell population, whether we will use the cells as stem cells,                or as more mature cells that have been educated to some extent to                become the final product are totally mature cells.                And then again perform large scale culture systems or develop                large scale culture systems. And then the last question is whether                we should use these cells in an autologous setting or in an allogeneic                setting.                Obviously adult stem cells for a number of diseases could be used                in an autologous setting. However, if they were to be capable of                repairing hearts, and you have a heart infarct today, we would not                have adult stem cells sitting around instead of your own to treat                you at that moment in time.                So I think there are some issues, and Dr. Gearhart also brought                up the idea that with diabetes, for instance, in Type-1, is an immune                problem, and again autologous transplantation may not be the way                to go.                I think that for adult stem cells, the initial trials may well                be autologous, but that in the long term, to make it more cost effective                and more available to many patients with certain frequent diseases,                that it might have to be an allogeneic therapy, and then we are                actually faced with the same questions that investigators that work                with ES cells, and primordial germ cells are faced with. I think                I will stop there. Thank you.                (Applause.)                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Thank                you very much, Dr. Verfaillie, for a clear, lucid, orderly presentation,                and it is very helpful to us. The floor is open for questions, comments,                discussion. Elizabeth Blackburn, please.                 DR. BLACKBURN:  Thank                you. Could I just ask a couple of quick clarifications. Dr. Gearhart                mentioned in response to Bill Hurlbut's question the difference                between fetally derived human cells and mouse embryonic stem cells                with respect to their teratoma producing properties.                And I could not quite gather whether it is human embryonic stem                cells that are also known to have any teratoma producing properties.                Could you clarify that for me, because you also had mentioned this,                and I wasn't sure if you were referring to the mouse embryonic stem                cell work or the human.                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  If                you use either mouse or human embryonic stem cells without predifferentiating                them into a committed progenitor cell, and you use the stem cells                as such, they will form teratomas, because it is one of the tools                that investigators use that an embryonic stem cell has that capability.                So they will form teratomas.                 DR. BLACKBURN:  And                then post-differentiation?                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  I think                there is very little data on the human embryonic stem cells, post-differentiation                in vivo, and whether there is still the tendency for these cells                to make teratomas.                 DR. BLACKBURN:  And                the second question, since I promised that I would ask you about,                is the fusion issue, and which of course you have raised in your                talk as well, but again a question of clarification for me, and                maybe expanding on your point that you said, well, fusions are going                to be problematic.                I mean, the thing that immediately occurred to me was that these                fusions, as reported from the in vitro culture, and I believe from                engraftment into mice, that they showed aneuploidy, which of course                anybody being a hallmark of tumor cells.                So I wondered if those issues and perhaps others were things you                could tell us a bit more about when you mentioned that you had concerns                about the fusions.                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  Well,                I think it is something that because of the papers that were published                that elegantly showed that if you took a somatic cell, an adult                hematopoietic stem cell or brain stem cell, and co-cultured it with                embryonic stem cells, and then put quite a bit of selectable pressure                on the system in the culture dish, they proved that an embryonic                stem cell quality could be transferred to the blood brain stem cell.                And initially they interpreted this as being reprogramming of                the cell. But then it turned out that there were four sets of chromosomes,                and that the cells fused.                And they took these fused cells and gave them to -- injected them                into a blastocyst as hyperdiploid as cells with four sets of chromosomes.                One group was not able to create chimeric animals, and the second                group, under the direction of Dr. Austin Smith, were able to create                chimeras in the mice that were what he calls unbalanced, meaning                that he saw a contribution to tissues, and that four sets of chromosomes                are actually tolerated.                For instance, the liver, where at least 50 percent of the cells,                actually half, have two nuclei. So I think that currently no investigator                who has worked with adult stem cells has set up the right experiment                to actually be able to disprove that it isn't fusion.                I would argue that the data that I showed today in vitro, where                single cells make three layers of the embryo, and these were euploid                cells, meaning that they had a normal set of chromosomes, and which                done in human, mouse, and rat, at the single cell level, we can                make the three major layers of the embryo.                So that would go against the argument that at least in vitro,                that all of it is caused by fusion. In vivo, in our blastocyst experiments,                1 in 3 cells could do it, which is much higher than the one in a                million cells that were quoted in the two papers that were in Nature,                but which indicated that one bone marrow cell out of a million could                actually make a fused cell population.                And I think one in 50,000 neural stem cells could actually cause                fusion. So that was a very rare event; whereas, our events are higher.                We are in the process of actually going back to these animals --                that we have cryopreserved, to try to identify that since some of                the transplants were done female into male, we should be able to                prove that we do not find the y chromosome in the engrafted areas                and in the chimeric areas, which would get at the question whether                it is caused by fusion.                And so I think we really need to set up experiments where we have                generic markers on both sides, meaning the donor and the recipient,                so that we can prove beyond any doubt that the in vivo results would                be the results from a fusion.                 DR. BLACKBURN:  Yes,                I totally agreement with that. I think the in vitro, and I am very                impressed by the in vitro results, and as you said, there are questions                in vivo.                I think in-part my question was addressing this issue, and I was                asking about the tumor forming ability or otherwise, because it                was not exactly 4N. It was the median number of chromosomes was                different from simply 4N, suggesting that there was aneuploidy,                and for example, one might not find Y chromosomes, for example,                because those had been selectively lost.                So one would probably have to do much more extensive genome-wide                analysis of both of those to be sure that there wasn't some genetic                contribution from the recipient cells.                But I certainly am very impressed as you say with the in vitro                results, and they seem quite unequivocal, and I guess which is the                question that you are addressing, and we will find out as the in                vitro --                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  Yes,                and I think we need to set up the experiments where we have on multiple                chromosomes genetic markers. You know, sequences that we can distinguish                the donor and recipient between. So these experiments need to be                repeated.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Questions?                Janet Rowley, please.                 DR. ROWLEY:  Well, I                would like to ask a question that will include both Elizabeth, as                well as Catherine, because I was struck in the data that you presented                on your human cell lines that you had passed for more than a hundred                generations, that telomerase was still active.                And I just am curious about that, because many of us do believe                that that is, if you will, the internal clock that limits the number                of doublings that those particular cells can undergo.                And you derive these from adults, presumably young adults in human,                but at least adults, and I am curious as to what you thought about                the mechanism of preserving the telomerase activity, and maybe if                Liz would have any further comments on that, because again one of                the critical features and potential limitations of adult stem cells                is the fact that they would have potentially fewer doublings than                would those derived from embryos.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Could                I ask as a favor to the non-scientists in the group if someone would                just give an ABCs on the telomerase matter, and just very, very                briefly, so that everybody can understand what the discussion is                about. Elizabeth, or Dr. Verfaillie, if you could just give the                barest --                 DR. BLACKBURN:  I am                the worst person, because I will fall into expert jargonese and                so I will try not to. So, telomerase keeps the DNA at the ends of                chromosomes replenished, and such replenishment is necessary, because                each time one of our cells divides, the DNA at the end of the chromosome                is a little bit whittled away.                So, telomerase keeps putting back a little extra DNA on to the                ends of the chromosomes each time on average a cell divides. So                the issue that Catherine pointed out in her talk was that if you                don't have telomerase after a number of cell multiplications, that                whittling away process would have gone too far, and that sends a                signal to cells to cease dividing.                And so many, many normal cells in culture are characterized by                the inability to keep on multiplying. Did that clarify the question?                So many cells do not keep multiplying because they turn the cells'                telomerase off as part of their natural differentiated state.                Cancer cells, on the other hand, have telomerase, almost in a                great majority of the cases, and very up-regulated, and cells of                the hematopoietic system -- and I will defer to Catherine on this                -- have an interesting intermediate situation, where they have regulated                telomerase activity that is turned on in a natural and regulated                way as the cells multiply in response to signals in the body. Is                that fair to say?                 DR. ROWLEY:  Yes.                 DR. BLACKBURN:  So I                think it is a very interesting question of why telomerases is turned                on in those cells that are multiplying so well in culture, and has                there been a selective event that has allowed those cells, that                for some reason have turned their telomerases on in the culture                conditions.                But those are the cells that are outgrowing perhaps others in                the population, and perhaps that question might be answered by what                is the clonal efficiency with which you get these lines growing                out. You may already know this.                 DR. ROWLEY:  But can                I intervene, because you assured that it was often turned on, and                maybe these cells are identified because they never turned telomerases                off.                 DR. BLACKBURN:  Yes,                and I don't know if that is the typical situation when one puts                cells into culture, and I thought that they more often would turn                off and an earlier subset would keep multiplying, and again I want                you to correct me on that cell growth phenomenon.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Thank                you.                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  So                currently we do not know whether it is often turned back on in culture.                If we look at the cultures, for the first 40 population doublings,                the cells appear to grow slightly faster.                And then a second wave of cells grows out and it grows slightly                slower. So initially we thought that maybe the more classical senescing                cells were disappearing, and that those were the cells that were                growing faster, and the you then select for the cell that has inherent                -- you know, has the system turned on to not be subject to the clock                of aging.                The frequency with which we can grow out the cells from human                bone marrow is we believe one in a million bone marrow cells. So                it is a very rare event, and so it will be quite difficult to actually                specifically ask whether it is turned on and then back off, or turned                off and then back on, unless we can actually do some genetic trapping                experiments to try to ask the question.                 DR. BLACKBURN:  I'm                thinking of David Beaches' experiments in which he was able to show                that cells would spontaneously, if you keep them in culture, turn                their telomerases back on, because that gives them some selective                advantage.                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  Right.                 DR. BLACKBURN:   And                so I was wondering if such selected advantages occur in your situation?                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  It                could well be, and so the culture conditions are very particular,                and so I didn't go into too much detail.                But if you do anything wrong to the culture conditions, we cannot                create the cell lines, and so it might well be that it is what we                call in my lab a cultural artifact what we see, which would mean                that these cells may not exist really as such, but actually are                induced to become this long-term proliferating cell by the culture                conditions that we put them under.                 DR. BLACKBURN:  Thank                you.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Janet,                again, please.                 DR. ROWLEY:  I have                two more questions. One is a follow-up of a question that I asked                you about a year-and-a-half ago, on whether out of your MAPC cells                you can get hematopoietic tissue.                 DR. VERFAILLIE:   Well,                I think I showed you in vivo that if you infuse the cells into mice                that were either not irradiated or sub-irradiated, that the cells                appear to be able to differentiate into hematopoietic elements that                have red cell, and granulocytic markers.                In vitro, we have had more difficulty to try to do that, even                though it appears now that we can at least get for people who don't                understand this, but what would be yolk sac hematopoiesis, even                though we haven't really seen hematopoiesis that would occur in                the embryo proper.                But we can find cells that look like the cells that have been                created at the earlier stages of development, where the initial                one is made, which is in the yolk sac.                 DR. ROWLEY:  And the                other question is more a more practical question. I don't know precisely                how many cells would be required to treat an adult patient with                a particular disease, and are the number of cells required, or what                kind of limitations, using your system, would be faced if you have                not one patient, but hundreds or thousands of patients that could                benefit from a particular therapy?                Is this really going to be an applicable strategy?                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  I think                it is a bit too early currently to really be able to answer that                question. We have been able to take cell populations and have them                undergo 80 to a hundred population doublings, which is really if                you were able to do that and not throw cells away along the way,                it is 10 to the 50th cells or something like that.                So it is an enormous number of cells that you can in theory create.                What I didn't go into too much detail on is that the way that we                have to grow these cells is under very low density conditions, meaning                that the cells have to be far away from one another, or otherwise                they do not maintain their undifferentiated state.                Which is quite different from embryonic stem cells, which tend                to grow in tight clusters. From a bioengineering standpoint, meaning                scaling it up to making hundreds of millions of cells, will be a                major bioengineering question of how we can actually adjust the                system to be able to do that.                But on theoretical grounds, you know, if you could overcome all                the bioengineering problems, you should be able to create enough                cells to treat multiple individuals, rather than a single individual                at a time.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Question.                Robert and then Mike.                 PROF. GEORGE:  Just                a very quick question of clarification in response to Janet's first                point. On this question of whether they were -- whether the teleomerases                were turned off and then turned back on in the culture.                If it is not that, and if that's not what is happening, the other                possibility is that they were never off to begin with?                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  Correct.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Mike                Gazzaniga.                 DR. GAZZANIGA:  Again,                thank you for a very excellent talk and a cautious talk I thought.                I thought it would be helpful for us to understand the new pressures                of a biologist like yourself, which are the following.                Here you have this fantastically interesting finding, and up until                5 or 10 years ago, the normal way that such things would be treated                is you publish the work in peer review, and then you make the stuff,                whether it is reagents, or whether it is cell lines available to                others for reproducibility.                And that is a normal sequence of events that we are all familiar                with. And now we have the bio-med inserting itself into these laboratories,                where all of a sudden it becomes proprietary goods from this work.                When the original media picked up on your story, and I guess it                was The New Scientist, there was this cryptic little paragraph in                there about how they had seen the patent on some of this work, which                is a very complete description, and how does that -- what is going                on here?                How can -- and this is where I would like to go obviously, and                obviously it is good for everybody here to get these cell lines                that you have out to other labs, and reproducibility, and then the                process goes forward.                Are you constrained in some way, and has life been made complicated                because you didn't have full public funding and you had to use this                other money, or was that your own? What is going on?                 DR. VERFAILLIE:   So                the work was really done at the university with NIH funds and university                funds, and so there was really no private funds, except for the                small amount from the company that was listed in the beginning,                has gone into the work that we have done.                And because of the possible importance of the observation, the                university, as well as myself, thought we should get some kind of                protection, even though I am not sure that you can truly patent                stem cells, because all of us have them.                But just such that we would be in a position to work with biotech                companies to be able to produce large-scale numbers of cells and                things like that, which is hard to be funded to known private funds.                So there is patents pending on the cell population. Currently,                that really has not precluded us of collaborating with other institutions,                or investigators within the same institution.                So they have collaborations with 10 or 15 different groups within                the U.S., or outside of the U.S., depending upon the expertise that                we need, to try to recreate the cells in other laboratories, and                actually use their expertise, since I am a hematologist, and not                a liver physician or a neuro scientist.                And to actually be able to use expertise in other people's laboratories                to move the research forward. So there are some minimal ties attached                to working with the cells, but I think it isn't overcomeable, and                it really has not been an issue with other academic investigators                to collaborate with them.                And teaching people from those labs to come and to grow the cells,                and at least start working with the cells. But it is a very complicated                and it is a -- and I have had myself a lot of problems in trying                to find the right patent between potential biotech interests and                academic interests.                 DR. GAZZANIGA:  Right,                and you are not alone in that dilemma. So are there other MPAC lines                at other institutions now that behave like yours, or is yours still                the Golden Grail here?                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  We                have given out the mouse, and to some extent, human MAPC lines to                other investigators who are now setting the lines back up. We are                also explaining and teaching people how to create them from beginning                bone marrow.                And I know that there is one group in Japan who I think pretty                much as the system set back up from human bone marrow. You know,                they still need to do some additional studies to prove that it is                really MAPCs, but we trained a person from there for 3 or 4 months                in my lab, and they went back to Japan, and were able to it appears                to recreate them.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Could                I ask a couple of sort of semi-scientific and semi-practical questions?                How hard is it -- I mean, you have just indicated that not many                people have already been able to do this, but how hard is it to                find these cells?                And by which I mean two pieces, and in how many individuals in                which you look for them can you find them? And how hard is it to                find -- how rare are they, and how hard is it to find in any particular                individual?                Both of these questions bear upon at least a preliminary assessment                of how useful this might be clinically speaking down the road, although                things could change where you might be able to enhance the yield.                But could you give us a preliminary sense of this?                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  I think                we have studied now between 70 and 80 normal humans to try to identify                the cells. The age range, the youngest donor was two, and the oldest                donor was 55. The majority are young adults who want some money                to donate bone marrow at the universities.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  The                two-year old?                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  No,                the 20 year olds. The 2 year old actually did a bone marrow donation                for a sibling who needed a bone marrow transplantation. So we have                been able to create the cells I would say in about 70 percent of                the individuals that we have looked at.                Whether that means that the other 30 percent didn't have it, or                there was some technical issue that came about, and we were not                able to create them, we start out with 10 milliliters of bone marrow,                and we would usually find a few clones that can actually grow out.                And so really the frequency is quite low, and it is one in a million,                and that is at least the estimate that we have right now. But there                is lots of bone marrow and so one in a million isn't an impossible                task to do it.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  And                could I also follow up on the question of these cells and their                promise, assuming the best, and the embryonic stem cells, assuming                their best.                This is not a question of whether one should prefer one line of                research or another, or whether we should now go ahead with them.                But is there anything specific that you could imagine could not                be done therapeutically with these MAPC cells that you would then                need cells derived from embryonic tissue to do?                Or is this in the rosiest division, is this really a substitute,                and one that might even have the rejection problem solved if I am                dreaming?                And this is not a question about whether the other research should                go forward, but really what is the best promise of this research                so that at least we can think about it?                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  Well,                I think that the data that we have in vitro suggests that we can                create cells of the three germ layers of the embryo, and so theoretically,                you could envision that you might be able to make more than we have                done so far.                We have made liver-like cells, and brain-like cells, and epithelial                cells, and we have not tried all the other ones. In vivo, the blastocyst                experiment, unless that is a fusion event, and if it isn't a fusion                event, would indicate that the cells hold the inherent promise of                making all the different cell types that make up the tissues, the                somatic tissues of an animal.                So again that would suggest that is under -- that if we changed                culture conditions further that we might be able to, for instance,                create insulin-producing beta cells, which we haven't done, or create                two heart muscle cells that function like heart muscle cells, and                don't just look like it.                So if all these promises hold true, and if we continue the cultures                and they can be expanded even further into 80 or 90 population doublings,                and so there are lots of ifs here, they may be able to be used to                treat a large number of diseases.                The problem at this point in time is that there is so many ifs                that it is a very difficult question to specifically answer.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Of course,                and I appreciate that, and on the question of the longlivedness,                or the half-life of these things, you have gone through -- in vitro                is what? It is what?                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  From                80 to 100 population doublings.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  And                it is obviously too early to say how much longer, and whether those                conditions are matched in vivo. But when the people say that the                promise in terms of longevity for cells derived from the adults                is really much less, is there anything to be said on that question                of the basis of knowledge now had?                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  Human                embryonic stem cells have been kept in culture now for 350 or 400                population doublings. So that is 3 or 4 times as long as the adult                cells. So we are striving to go there, but we just need time to                do that.                Are these cells going to be able to do that? As far as we can                tell, after 80 population doublings, there is no shortening of telomeres,                and so that means that there is at least another 50 or 60 left.                If for some reason telomerase is shut off along the way for reasons                that we currently don't know why that might be, then the longevity                would be less than what has been shown for embryonic stem cells.                Now, for classical adult stem cells, if you take hematopoietic                stem cells that make blood, but not something else, they would not                go for 80 population doublings.                So there is something special about these cells, that they can                overcome this senescent block at 60 or 70 population doublings,                which is actually long for any other adult stem cell.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Thank                you very much. Questions or comments? Janet again, please.                 DR. ROWLEY:  Coming                back again to partly the real world in this iffy situation, and                it is a question of the practicality for treatment for particular                individuals.                It seems to me that the notion that you might be able to derive                these MAPC cells from an individual who had some medical problem                might have some limitations because it probably takes 3 to 6 months,                or so to get enough cells to then be able to use them therapeutically                in that individual, and that is always assuming that the individual                has some kind of a somatic disease, and not the basic underlying                genetic problem.                So then the way to get around that if it really is 3 to 6 months,                and you don't have that window of time, would be to do somatic cell                nuclear transplant. Now, have you ever tried that in your MAPC cells?                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  In                collaboration with Dr. Jaenisch, and two weeks from now we will                try the mouse MAPC cells in mouse eggs, and ask whether the efficiency                of nuclear transfer would be closer to what you would see with embryonic                stem cells, and where the efficiency is much, much, much higher                than if you use a classical adult cell.                And that might improve efficiency of making cloned embryonic stem                cells.                 DR. ROWLEY:  But I am                thinking of the other experiment. You have a patient who is desperately                ill, and so you would have cells from that patient, and you would                want to use the nucleus of the patient's cells into your MAPC cells,                and so that is a different thing.                You have got these cell lines, and how can you make them more                compatible with the patient, and agreeing that you can't get rid                of the mitochondrial problem unless you do additional manipulations                and strategies.                But have you ever tried to replace the nucleus in your MAPC cell                with a nucleus from an adult somatic cell?                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  No,                we have not yet.                 DR. ROWLEY:  Do you                plan to?                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  We                might.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  We could                always get everyone at the age of 15 to put away a little bit of                marrow for the time that we might need it.                 DR. ROWLEY:  Another                reason to save cord blood.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  This                is your chance, council members. This is a wonderful opportunity.                Questions?                 DR. ROWLEY:  Well, I                would just be interested from Catherine's point of view on her answers                to some of the questions, to the two questions that I posed at the                end to John Gearhart, and again give her the option to do this as                a written response rather than a direct response, but I think it                may be easier to -- and the second question, which may be very simple                to answer in terms of the kinds of restrictions that you find now                in funding.                And I would assume since you are dealing with adult cells that                there aren't any, but I would be interested in your perspective                on the funding, in both government and other agencies.                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  Well,                currently for the work that is ongoing in my group, which works                with adult stem cells, actually the amount of funding that has become                available through the NIH has increased dramatically over the last                few years to support this kind of research.                So that has not been a problem. I have wanted to compare these                cells carefully with embryonic stem cells, and so we are in a position                currently to do this in a mouse, but mice aren't humans.                And so we have really not been able to do that until earlier this                year when human embryonic stem cell research was allowed in academic                institutions under NIH funding.                And as I mentioned, we had actually gone out and tried to recruit                an investigator with that kind of expertise to be in a position                to try to address some of the questions that have come up here,                and are these cells going to be equipotent.                And I think to date, even though they are exciting and they seem                to be quite potent, I can't really say whether that is the case.                And so ultimately we won't be able to answer this question until                we can truly compare them and not across country borders, but actually                within the same institution, where people can look at the two cell                populations at the same time.                And so in that respect, I think that the lack of funding for embryonic                stem cell research in humans has made it impossible up until just                recently to be able to do that.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Michael                Sandel.                 PROF. SANDEL:  I wonder                if I could put to you the same question I put to the previous speaker.                Given that some people regard embryonic stem cell research as morally                problematic, what would you think of the idea of imposing a moratorium                on embryonic stem cell research until we could assess what might                be achieved by adult stem cell research?                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  I think                that my answer is very much in line with what you heard from Dr.                Gearhart. I think that the main reason why we -- to investigate                in the field of embryonic stem cell -- human embryonic stem cell                research is to be able to compare and contrast the two cell populations                at the same time.                I also think that what we did in our culture dishes to try to                differentiate these MAPCs into liver-like cells or neuronal-like                cells is really based on what has been learned from mainly the mouse                embryonic stem cell field, where investigators have been able to                take these cells and drive them in vitro to become certain cell                types, even though that is not a hundred percent fool-proof, and                it is not completely figured out how you should do that.                So I think if you have a number of different cell populations                at the same time, we try to test all these different questions.                What we learned in adult cells might be applicable to embryonic                stem cells if they are the cells that ultimately will be the suitable                source for our clinical applications or the other way around.                And so I think stopping research in one field actually will slow                down research in the other field, and it would be either way. In                other words, if you stop our research in adult cells, or embryonic                stems, as I think what can be learned in the two systems should                be translatable in the other system.                And so I think if you were to ban all embryonic stem cell research,                it would really slow down the insight that could be gained in adult                stem cell research.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Rebecca                Dresser.                 PROF. DRESSER:  This                is unfair, but I am wondering if you had any ideas about the cost                of such a procedure? I mean, just based on what you have done in                mice, and you mentioned at the very end that to be cost effective                that you would probably would have to just have a number of cell                lines and not rely on the patient cell.                Is this going to be a very, very expensive technology, and where                we have to worry about -- well, if all these ifs work out, will                we have to worry about who has access, or will it be comparable                to the stem cell transplants that we do now with bone marrow now?                Or what do you think?                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  Well,                I think it will be relatively expensive if you do it on a single                person basis, and you will have to create the cell lines from the                beginning, rather than go going to a frozen stock of cells, where                you have a very well-qualified product to start with and where you                expand cells.                And so you might even have already committed cells frozen as well,                and so the cost to get to that point would have to be incurred once                rather than doing this over, and over, and over again.                The costs I think -- well, it is hard to say, because I am not                sure how much of the regulatory issues we have actually complied                by at this point in time to actually truly gauge how much it would                cost.                But I think that by the time that you do all the quality control                tests for infectious agents and things like that, that amounts to                quite a bit of money for each cell line that you try to establish.                And in the long term I think it would probably be more cost effective                if you would have a therapy for heart infarcts that you could go                to a limited number of cell lines. And to put numbers of them, I                don't really know.                It would probably be in the range of a bone marrow transplantation                currently, which is quite expensive. So it is anywhere between $50,000                and $200,000 per patient.                If you had qualified cells that were frozen, and then you could                expand them for a short period of time and do a limited number of                tests at the end, the amount of cost incurred would really be all                up-front, and then there would be a relatively small amount per                patient.                 PROF. DRESSER:  I guess                the other thing is that bone marrow transplants work fairly well                with some illnesses and not with others, and would you expect to                see those kinds of results with these kinds of therapies?                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  I think                that would highly depend on the type of disease that you tried to                treat. You know, you are all well aware of the treatments that have                been used for Parkinson's disease, which the trials that were done                in Sweden have made little complications.                But when this was extended in multiple hospitals in the West,                there were a lot more complications if it was done on a larger scale.                So I think that depending on the disease that you go after that                it may work better or worse, and it is really way to early to be                able to comment on that.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Bill,                do you have a question?                 DR. HURLBUT: :  Well,                if we have time, I would like to ask a couple of scientific questions                if that is all right.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Please.                 DR. HURLBUT: :  Do I                understand this correctly that you are saying that your MAPC is                put into the blastocyst to perform more cell lines than do other                adult stem cells?                I thought that adult stem cells generally formed lines in a blastocyst?                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  There                are 3 or 4 papers published on adult stem cells into blastocyst                experiments. There is one paper published by a German group, where                they took purified hematopoietic stem cells, and injected them into                the blastocyst, and what they were able to show was that the cells                gave rise to some hematopoietic elements, and that they actually                recapitulated the developmental behavior of hemoglobins, which switched                at different stages of development during embryos, fetuses, and                then adults.                They did not see any contribution outside of the hematopoietic                system. The second paper is a paper from a Swedish group, where                they had taken neural stem cells that have been cultured, and introduced                them in the blastocyst, and as far as I know, they have never had                animals been born alive.                And they saw a contribution to a few tissues, but not all tissues                of the mouse fetus. And in the last papers, we did a paper by Austin                Smith, the one that reported on fusion, where they had taken defused                cells and given them to a blastocyst again, and it showed a contribution                in one animal that was born, and that was really only a single animal,                to the liver and a few other tissues.                But it was not quite the amount of contribution that I showed                in the picture here, where every single tissue of the mouse appeared                to be having a fraction of the single MAPC cell.                 DR. HURLBUT: :  That                is very, very exciting. Another question that I think might be of                good general interest to our council, but he question of whether                transdifferentiation is occurring, or even the process of embryonic                stem cells just differentiating, it is always clouded by the question                of how do you know when there is actual differentiation taking place?                In other words, just because you follow one or two gene expressions,                you don't know, and one of the problems with embryonic stem cell                therapies will be to get the target tissues up to speed, like beta                cells producing enough insulin.                I know that there are advances being made on this, but can you                just give us a general description of how you identify when you                are satisfied that a tissue has in fact been produced?                And maybe tell us a little bit about the -- maybe we need a little                education on messenger RNA assays.                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  Okay.                The criteria to say that you produced tissue I think needs to include                that you turned on the genetic program that is compatible with the                tissue that you want to produce.                You find therefore proteins from the genetic program in the cells,                and the cells have morphological changes consistent with the cells                that you are looking for, and the cells have functional characteristics                of the tissue that you are looking for.                So what happens in a cell is that in an undifferentiated state                a number of gene programs are shut down, meaning there is no transcription                to the messenger RNA, and you will find no protein, and therefore                no function.                During a differentiation process, you come in with a growth factor                or a cytokine, or a stimulus from the outside, and you trigger a                certain set of signals that then open up a new genetic program and                the first thing that happens is that you transcribe messenger RNA,                that then gets translated into proteins and/or sugars, that then                supposedly give a new function to the cell.                So what we have been looking for in vitro, and that is where most                of our work has been done initially, is actually taking an undifferentiated                cell and showing that a certain genetic program isn't turned on,                meaning that you don't find mRNA, and you don't find protein, and                you don't find function.                We then switch the culture conditions and add triggers by trial                and error, to a large extent to try to activate certain genetic                programs. And if we do that, we look for protein and mRNA first.                So we look to prove that the genes are turned on, and then we                look to prove that these gene products actually give rise to proteins.                We have gone to the next step also and actually tried to then take                the cells that we believe that are like brain or like liver, and                started asking questions.                If it is a liver cell, it should secrete certain things. It should                have the machinery to detoxify blood and things like that. So we                have been able to show that in the liver lineage, for instance,                that we do turn on the programs to make albumin, which is one of                the major proteins that is being secreted in the liver and is present                in the blood.                These cells have, for instance, cytochrome p450, which is a massive                machinery in the liver that helps detoxify the blood components.                And we can show that it is there, and it responds in the correct                ways as liver cells would do.                So that is what you do in vitro, and in vivo, it is a bit more                complicated, and you really need to use animal models where there                is a disease. So you would have to show that the cells ingraft and                you can find the donor cells.                You would have to show that they turn on RNA and protein, and                therefore have this genetic program turned on. And then function,                which means that if you take an animal that has a failing liver,                and you give the liver cells to this animal, the animal will now                live without having drugs that keeps it alive.                And so that would prove that the cells that you put in have actually                acquired the ability to function like a liver cell. And so for adult                stem cell research, very little proof of the latter is actually                present.                For embryonic stem cell research in mice, there is a lot of evidence,                and in the human embryonic stem cells, that evidence is just starting                to become available, just like it is with adult stem cells.                 DR. HURLBUT: :  Could                I ask one last little question? How many genes are we talking about                here; like hundreds, or thousands, and how many do you monitor in                fact?                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  Well,                we usually monitor between -- well, there is probably hundreds of                thousands that get turned on, and so using the new technologies,                the array technology, and the proteomics technology, that is one                of the things that we are looking at, because it will give us a                much better insight in the whole programs that are being turned                on.                We just pick and choose the ones that we think are known to be                important at certain stages of the differentiation. So, for instance,                if you go from a stem cell to a liver cell, we know that you have                to turn on X number of genes that happen to be known to be turned                on.                So we look at 2 or 3 that are early, and 2 or 3 that are in the                middle, and then 5 or 6 at the end. We have not exhaustively looked                at all of them yet.                But I think with the human genome being sequenced, we now have                the tools in hand to now take cells created from stem cells and                look at the whole program of genes that is present, and what we                created in a culture dish, compared to what is actually present                in real life in vivo, and get a feel of how closely we actually                are getting to the real cell.                 DR. HURLBUT: :  Thank                you.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Could                I -- Robby, did you have a question? Why don't you go first, because                I have a couple of things as well. Please.                 PROF. GEORGE:  Actually,                I just wanted to follow up the question that Dr. Kass asked earlier                just for clarification, and I recognize that there is a great deal                of uncertainty as to what the future holds in your area for research,                as well as in embryonic stem cell research.                And estimating or evaluating what the prospects are therapeutically                is a speculative business, but having all of that in mind -- and                I was not clear in responding to Dr. Kass whether you identified                some areas in which knowing what we do know now about the differences                between embryonic stem cells and the MAPC cells, it is possible                to identify some areas where we just know that whatever the prospects                are for MAPC cells that they won't be able to do, or our therapies                won't be able to be developed based on them to do certain things.                And that there is at least a prospect of embryonic stem cells                being used to do.                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  It                is so very hard for me to answer that question, just because embryonic                stem cells have been worked with for so much longer, and so investigators                have been able to, for instance, make cells that secrete insulin                to some extent on demand, which has not been accomplished with adult                stem cells.                There is a little bit of evidence from pancreatic tissue itself                that there might be precursors that can do that, but from MAPCs,                for instance, we have not been able to do this yet.                It doesn't mean that we can't. I don't know that answer. So there                is a lot more experience with embryonic stem cells and there is                a lot more -- at least in the mouse system, there is a lot more                known on how to try to trigger certain differentiation programs                and whether the MAPCs will respond to the same extent and to the                same degree.                And I think that currently I can't really answer that question.                 PROF. GEORGE:  But asking                if you look at it and not asking what do we know MAPC cells will                be able to enable us to do, and have a prospect of doing, that embryonic                stem cells have a prospect of doing.                But if we simply ask the question as do we know just on the basis                of the facts of what we know about the differences, and that there                are in fact some things that MAPC cells, no matter what, won't be                able to do. Or is the answer that we just don't know?                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  I think                we don't know currently, and I can't really answer that question,                because we just don't know at this point in time.                 DR. FOSTER:  I just                want to interrupt with this one point. Those questions are really                hard to answer, but there is another whole area that is going to                impact what you are going to use cellular based therapy for.                And that has to do with good vectors, retroviral gene therapy,                and that you are going to accomplish with other diseases that you                don't have to use cells for at all.                I mean, the most recent thing in severe combined immunodeficiencies                in humans, is you put a retrovirus in, and you put the common gamma                chain in for about five cytokines, you know, for these kids. It                was just in the New England Journal a couple of weeks ago, or three                weeks ago, or something like that.                And they are now two years out, and so there are going to be a                whole lot of diseases that you are not going to have to use regenerative                therapy or cell therapy. You can't predict those things either at                this point.                So I think if you try to jump way ahead of what the basic science                is doing, then you are prone to error, and I know everybody wants                to know whether an adult cell is better than an embryonic stem cell,                or something like that.                And I don't think you can answer those questions, and one of the                things that we have heard from both the investigators this morning                is that they cross-fertilized with each other.                And so -- I mean, that you could not have done what you are doing                in the adult cells without what had already been done with the embryonic                cells.                So I just would argue against trying to push investigators to                say whether an adult stem cell can do this or do that at this point,                because we have not even taken into consideration many other approaches                to human disease.                I don't mean to be fussy, but I do think that that is an important                thing.                 PROF. GEORGE:  But I                was actually asking -- well, I think the question I asked was that                it really is about what we know now. The question is do we know                now that there are certain differences, that as a result of which                the prospects for the one area are different from the prospects                of the other. And I got my answer. Thank you.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Let                me take the privilege of the Chair to expand in a way Dan Foster's                comment in a direction that he might not have intended.                 DR. FOSTER:  That does                not surprise me.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Well,                I mean, you are a genial sort, and I think you won't -- I mean,                one of the things that one has to remember in this conversation                is that wonderful as the stem cell approach is from whatever source                to the treatment of these diseases, that is not the whole area here                also.                And that the gene therapy is not the whole story as well, and                there are preventive measures, and there are all kinds of other                things. I mean, the conversation, because we are taking it up, gives                it a certain type of dramatic focus and concentration.                But for the people who work in clinical medicine, they know that                this is -- that there are lots of ways to try to skin this cat.                But I wanted to ask a couple of -- to make a comment, and then ask                a couple of questions.                You have talked understandably and very welcomely to us about                your own very exciting work. There is a great deal of skepticism                about many of the published works in using adult stem cells.                And unfortunately, for better and for worse, these reports are                caught up in the political controversy that now surrounds us, with                people on both sides having a stake in either making the results                on one line of work seem better than the other, precisely because                they are wed to an either/or choice.                Can you, abstracting from all the political considerations, and                the various axes that various people are grinding on these poor                cells, can you say anything at all generally about the kinds of                initial reports of a clinical sort that we have had with alleged                adult stem cells?                Because at least according to some accounts, these have been very                exciting, and yet there is a great deal of skepticism about whether                these are in fact stem cells that are producing the results.                Can you tell the council anything at all about how we should at                the moment regard the news that is coming out to us in this area?                How should we receive it?                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  There                have been several publications that came out over the last 1 or                2 years now, where investigators or clinicians have looked at individuals                who were transplanted with classical bone marrow transplantations,                and looked in tissues outside of the hematopoietic system to ask                whether bone marrow derived of donor-derived cells could be found                in different tissues.                And the reports that have come out have indicated fairly significant                levels of contribution to certain tissues, meaning they have found                cells in the heart, and they have found cells in skin, gut, liver,                and so forth.                And we really have not looked in the same situation to see whether                we can confirm these data or not. I know that some clinical groups                have put in doubt to some extent the degree of contribution that                has been reported, and it is not quite clear whether the 5, 10,                or 20 percent that has been quoted in some papers is indeed actually                going to hold up over time.                I think there is some contribution, and the question in my mind                still is how clinically important is it what investigators have                seen or what clinicians have seen currently.                If you go strictly by the term of stem cell plasticity, none of                these studies really show that it was a single cell, or it was a                blood cell that gave rise to these tissues, and it might still be                that some contaminating cells were contributing to that.                And really none of these studies have shown that this has had                any clinical impact on what was going on in these patients. And                so they didn't really show that you restored function of the organ                that the cells were found in.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  I was                thinking of a recent report on the Parkinson's cases.                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  Correct.                So the Parkinson's cases were -- and that is with fetal brain tissues,                and are those the reports that you are referring to?                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Yes.                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  And                so there has been a series of patients transplanted in Sweden with                Parkinson's disease, where one team of investigators in a non-controlled                study, shows that implantation of the fetal tissue brain -- fetal                brain tissue into the brain of patients with Parkinson's disease                could rescue patients, and could actually correct the Parkinsonism.                And actually have now done so for some patients for more than                10 years. Now, these were highly selected patients, and done by                a single group of investigators.                The same was done in the west in 3 or 4 institutions, and some                patients got better and some patients did not get better. But I                think that gets to the proof of concept that if you have the right                cells, and if you can create the right cells, and if it is from                embryonic stem cells, or adult stem cells, or from tissues itself,                that there might be a way of correcting Parkinson's disease.                But there is again -- and I think it would behoove us to really                look carefully at exactly what single cell or fused cells that we                have to put into the brains of patients with Parkinson's disease                to try to correct the disease, and not over correct it as it was                done in some of the patients in the U.S., where they had more side                effects from the therapy than they initially had from their Parkinson's                disease.                And so even though there is an enormous amount of pressure on                all of us with stem cell research to try to come up with therapies                yesterday, I have been very, very cautious in telling people that                do the clinical work that you can't just go around and take stem                cells and put them in places in the hope that they will work.                Because we will get into situations like the gene therapy field,                where a couple of awful problems have popped up, and have actually                halted the clinical potential of these cells enormously.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Could                I follow that up, because if there had been more time, I would have                asked Dr. Gearhart this question as well, and you are a clinician                who deals with patients that are also -- now thanks to your new                results, and I am sure that you are getting lots of calls as well.                There is an ethical dimension to this area that worries not so                much about where you get the cells from, but how we deal with the                desperately sick patients looking for any sort of hope.                And let me say flat out that in-part to fend off the opponents,                the people in the scientific community and medical community, has                to some extent not been adverse to shall I say hyping the benefits                here and possibly even taking rather cruel advantage of these hopes.                And from what I hear from you, and from what I hear from Dr. Gearhart,                these therapies, there are lots of problems to be solved before                these things will be made available.                And that is not to say that there isn't this enormous promise,                but what can you tell us, or what advice would you give us about                we could responsibly speak about this promise without behaving,                let me say, unethically in dealing with the very patients who are                coming to us for help?                And I think that's something that you have probably faced directly,                and whatever help you could give us on that would be welcome.                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  Well,                like Dr. Gearhart, my e-mail and phone have a lot of messages on                them from patients locally, around the country, and around the world                who want to bring a child or a parent with a certain disease, and                want us to treat whatever disease you can come up with.                And we have to speak the truth, and even though we are excited                about the work that we have, and for the work that people do in                embryonic stem cells, at this point it is a promise, and I don't                think there is any data to say that in the next 1 or 2 years we                will actually be in clinical trials with any of this.                So we really have to tell patients, families, and whomever, that                currently we are trying to cure mice, but a lot of mice have been                cured with a lot of different things, and that doesn't necessarily                mean that it will translate into humans.                And so we need to do the regular science that needs to be done                to come up with a therapy that is both potentially useful and for                certain not dangerous.                And so that the last part of that whole thing is really where                everything sits. And so we could go ahead and do things now, but                then run into major, major complication issues which would make                patients way worse off than they started out.                You could argue that bone marrow transplantation, there was not                a whole lot known when the first bone marrow transplants were done,                and that is before I started in bone marrow transplantation, and                probably some patients didn't fare that well either in the beginning.                But people ultimately still have to learn by doing it in humans,                but we have to learn as much as we can in culture dishes, mice,                rats, and larger animals before we proceed with therapies for things                that are not immediately legal.                And so it is not because you are diagnosed with Parkinson's today                that four months from now that you will die from your disease, which                is different if you have a acute leukemia, where there is really                no other solutions.                And so I also think it will have to be graded depending on the                type of disease that you start treating.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  And                I have one last question, and I don't think we will have another                opportunity in this discussion, but this comes to Rebecca Dresser's                question about the costs, and how to think about this. And also                about the applicability.                There was recently a meeting of the major biotech companies in                Princeton, and our scientific director, Dick Roblin, was there,                and they were discussing among other things the question of the                solution of the immune rejection problem from all these various                things.                And all of the ones that were present there are putting their                research money not into somatic cell nuclear transfer to deal with                the rejection problem, but into other means, for a reason that would                have never have occurred to me until it came back from this meeting,                which is to say that if you have highly individualized treatments,                case by case, that at least under present regulatory systems, if                you call these things products, each one of them has to be approved                independently by the FDA before it can be used.                And so the question is whether or not -- and in partly thinking                about the cost and the scalability, and the things that might make                things universally applicable, doesn't it make sense more to be                thinking more in terms of cell lines, whether embryonic or adult,                and that could be made universally applicable, rather than trying                to continue to think each person, his or her own replacement, given                these practical problems of scale and product approval?                I am not sure that the question was clearly put, but it bears                upon the efficacy of this in terms of long term clinical use, and                the questions of cost.                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  Ideally,                it would be personalized therapy, and so you would create cells                that are completely compatible with the person that you need to                treat, except again in situations where there is an autoimmunity                issue, which makes it complicated.                And if it is an autoimmune problem starting out, then cell therapy                is probably not the best way to go about doing this. For instance,                Type-1 diabetes would come to mind, where there is really a rejection                of your own islet cells.                I think the costs -- and I spoke to that just a little bit before                -- of creating everybody's own cell line will in the long term will                be extremely high, and it will not be a therapy that is suitable                for acute events.                So if you have an acute stroke, or if you have an acute heart                infarct, and you try to correct that, there is no way that you can                clone ESLs to correct that, or you could create MAPCs to correct                that within the next one or two weeks.                It just takes too much time to try to do this. Then you could                argue, well, I will store our own MAPC cell lines or own ESL lines                just in case we need it, which definitely I don't think is financially                tenable.                So even though the ideal situation would be to be able to make                everybody's own cells, and I think in the long term if the cell                therapies are proven to be, for instance, very useful in patients                who have a severe MI that you can actually correct them almost immediately                after the MI has occurred, or within the next few weeks after it                has occurred, it almost has to be done on an allogeneic basis.                And in that case, trying to come up with wise ways of making the                cells acceptable to the vast majority of patients, whether it is                multiple cell lines and a minimum amount of immunosuppression, or                establishing partial chimerism by creating both blood cells and                heart muscle cells from the same cell lines, for instance, would                be one way to get around that.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Thank                you very much. Thank you very much for a wonderful presentation,                and a very generous and full response to our questions. If we might                take the liberty of just contacting you with some other things.                I know that your e-mail is full, and we will try to add very little,                but as we go along, we might have some additional things.                 DR. VERFAILLIE:  That                would be great. Thanks.                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Thank                you very much. Members are asked to go immediately from here to                the other room, where they want a group photo, and the four or five                of us who have not yet posed for our individual mug shots, are asked                to stay. I think lunch will be served there.                We will reconvene here shortly after 1:30, and let's say about                1:35 or 1:40.                (Whereupon, at 12:28 p.m., a luncheon recess was taken.)                                                    SESSION 3: STEM                CELLS 3:                ETHICS OF HUMAN STEM CELL RESEARCH                DR. GENE OUTKA                 CHAIRMAN KASS:  Well,                if I sing a song, or make some announcements, maybe we will get                the full numbers, but this is the third of our three sessions on                stem cell research, having spent the morning hearing two presentations                on the science.                And we now turn in this session to ethical questions in stem cell                research, and we are very fortunate to have as our guest Professor                Gene Outka, who is the Dwight Professor of Philosophy and Christian                Ethics at Yale University.                And for a long time one of our most careful students of the ethics                of biology and medicine among many other things.                Apart from our interest in the merits of the case, a paper written                on a subject of concern to us, I have confessed in the chairman's                cover letter, in a sentence which has a missing word, that I have                an additional purpose in mind here, namely as just as those of us                who are not experienced in science, need practice in grasping the                concepts and methods of scientific analysis, so those of us who                are not experienced in ethics would need some practice in working                with the concepts and ways of ethical analysis. And Professor Outka's                work is nothing if not careful, analytical and disciplined, and                we are very thankful that he could be with us to discuss his paper.                All of us have had a chance to read it, and I exhorted you to                read it more than once, and there is a lot packed in it. And Professor                Outka is going to lead off with a few remarks, after which I have                asked Michael Sandel to make comment that would open our discussion.                Thanks very much, Gene.                 DR. OUTKA:  Well, it                is a great honor for me to be here, and I enjoyed sitting in enormously                in the morning sessions, and noted that although the focus was on                scientific matters, moral matters also arose from time to time,                as when Dr. Gearhart told us that he doesn't give the same moral                status to the embryonic entity as he does to the fetus.                And I think that illustrates one of the claims that I actually                make in the paper, which is that on this subject, whether we like                it or not, we all have to be moralists in one way or another; that                certain moral determinations are unavoidable.                And in-part that is because the moral positions that we take have                such direct and sometimes colliding implications for the policy                and political recommendations that we make.

GX042-42-8249756	This commissioned paper was              prepared for and discussed at the Council's  July              2003  meeting. It was intended solely to aid discussion, and does              not represent the official views of the Council or of the United States              Government.    DRAFT               the Ethics of Stem Cell Research               Paul Lauritzen                Professor, Department of Religious Studies                Director, Program in Applied Ethics                John Carroll University,                 University Heights, Ohio                                 JuLY 2003                                                  . . . the final stage is come when man by eugenics, by prenatal                  conditioning, and by an education and propaganda based on perfect                  applied psychology, has obtained full control over himself. Human                  nature will be the last part of nature to surrender to man. (Lewis,                  1947)                 This sudden shift from a belief in Nurture, in the form of social                  conditioning, to Nature, in the form of genetics and brain physiology                  is the great intellectual event, to borrow Nietzsche’s term,                  of the late twentieth century. (Wolfe, 2001)                             I begin with passages from an unlikely pair of authors because                although C. S. Lewis and Tom Wolfe are somewhat distant in time,                certainly different in temperament, and extravagantly different                in personal style, they share an imaginative capacity to envision                the possible consequences of modern technology. The technology that                occasioned Lewis’s reflections?“the aeroplane, the wireless,                and the contraceptive” may now seem quaint, but his warning                about turning humans into artifacts, that accompanied the passage                quoted above, is eerily prescient. Similarly, although he does not                directly take up stem cell research, Tom Wolfe’s reflections                on brain imaging technology, neuropharmacology, and genomics are                worth noting in relation to the future of stem cell research. In                his inimitable way, Wolfe summarizes his view of the implications                of this technology in the title of the essay from which the above                passage comes. “Sorry,” he says, “but your soul                just died.”                The point of beginning with Lewis and Wolfe, then, is not that I                share their dire predictions about the fate to which they believe                technology propels us; instead, I begin with these writers because                they invite us to take an expansive view of technology. I believe                that such a perspective is needed and is in fact emerging in recent                work on stem cell research. This is not to say that the sort of                traditional analysis that has framed much of the debate on stem                cells, analysis that involves issues of embryo status, autonomy,                and informed consent, for example, is unhelpful; far from it. Nevertheless,                traditional moral analysis of stem cell research is nicely complemented                by a consideration of the “big picture” questions that                Lewis and Wolfe both wish to press. This report will therefore seek                to draw attention to the literature on stem cell research that attends                both to the narrow and to the expansive bioethical issues raised                by this research.                                The Moral Status of the Embryo                  There is little doubt that public reflection on stem cell research                  in the United States has been affected by the extraordinarily                  volatile cross-currents of the abortion debate. Although I will                  indicate below several reasons why framing the stem cell debate                  as a subset of that on abortion is problematic, nevertheless,                  in its current form, stem cell research is debated in terms dictated                  by the abortion controversy, and that has meant that questions                  about the status of the embryo have been particularly prominent. 1                   For example, the National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC)                  described the ethical issues raised by stem cell research as “principally                  related to the current sources and/or methods of deriving these                  cells” (NBAC, 1999, 45). A policy brief from the American                  Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) begins its discussion                  of the ethical dispute over stem cell research by citing the disagreement                  over the status of the embryo as the decisive variable leading                  to fundamentally different views on this research (AAAS, 1999,                  11). The National Academy of Sciences’s report on stem cell                  research claims that “the most basic [ethical] objection                  to embryonic stem cell research is rooted in the fact that such                  research deprives a human embryo of any further potential to develop                  into a complete human being” (National Academy of Sciences,                  2002, 44). The Ethics Advisory Board of the Geron Corporation                  lists the moral status question as the first moral consideration                  relevant to deciding the acceptability of stem cell research (Geron                  Corporation Ethics Advisory Board, 1999, 32). The list could go                  on.                                    Despite the fact that these statements all insist on the importance                  of the status question, they also recognize that the debate about                  the status of the early embryo is not new and that the controversy                  over stem cell research does not, strictly speaking, raise novel                  issues in this regard. Indeed, it is probably best to place the                  initial skirmishes over stem cell research in the context of moral                  debates about human embryo research generally. In fact, it is                  worth noting that the report of the NIH Human Embryo Research                  Panel (HERP), published in 1994, explicitly identified the isolation                  of human embryonic stem cells as one of thirteen areas of research                  with preimplantation embryos that might yield significant scientific                  benefit and that should be considered for federal funding (See                  NIH HERP, 1994, ch. 2).                                    Although the recommendations of the HERP were never implemented,                  the fact that a high-profile panel reviewed  ex utero                   preimplantation human embryo research and explicitly endorsed                  stem cell research, meant that the panel report would affect the                  policy debate about stem cell research, even though its recommendation                  that the derivation and use of stem cells be federally funded                  was not adopted. For one thing, the panel’s anticipatory                  support for stem cell research assured that when human stem cells                  were actually derived several years later, the debate that ensued                  would be tied to the abortion controversy. As members of the HERP                  panel have made clear, from the start, the work of the panel was                  embroiled in controversy. For example, shortly after the HERP                  was impaneled, thirty-two members of Congress wrote to Harold                  Varmus, the director of NIH, to complain about the composition                  of the panel. A lawsuit was filed in an attempt to prevent the                  panel from meeting, and members of the panel received threatening                  letters and phone calls (Green, 1994; Tauer, 1995; Hall, 2003).                                    Given the pro-life opposition to the HERP panel and its recommendations,                  it is no real surprise that initial reactions to the prospect                  of human stem cell research fell out along the fault lines of                  abortion politics in the country. By and large, individuals and                  groups opposed to abortion tended to be opposed to stem cell research,                  and individuals and groups supportive of legalized abortion tended                  to support stem cell research.  2                   For example, the testimony that Richard Doerflinger, the principal                  spokesperson for the U.S. Catholic bishops on pro-life matters,                  offered before the Senate Appropriation Subcommittee on Labor,                  Health, and Education in 1998 was substantially the same as that                  he offered before the HERP in 1994 on stem cell research (Doerflinger,                  1998, 1994). In both cases, the fundamental issue was the status                  of the embryo. Given Catholic teaching that the embryo must be                  treated as a person from conception, no experimentation on the                  embryo can be allowed that would not also be allowed on infants                  or children. Hence, the Catholic church treats stem cell research                  as it has treated previous issues involving the destruction of                  human embryos; it is condemned as morally abhorrent.                                     In similar fashion, the arguments reviewed by the HERP panel that                  supported embryo research generally in 1994, were mobilized again                  four years later when stem cell research was the specific point                  of contention; and again the focal point was embryo status. Consequently,                  just as the HERP report opted for a “pluralistic”                  view of the embryo that emphasized its developmental potential,                  so, too, did the NBAC endorse the idea that the early embryo deserves                  respect, but is not to be treated fully as a person. 3                                     Moreover, the fact that the HERP defended its support of stem                  cell research by stressing the developmental capacity of the embryo                  also shaped the trajectory of much subsequent support for this                  work, because insisting on respect for the embryo but denying                  its personhood meant explaining how one could respect the embryo                  while nevertheless destroying it. Daniel Callahan, for example,                  posed this problem very strongly in response to the HERP report.                  If “profound respect” for the embryo is compatible                  with destroying it, he asked, “What in the world can that                  kind of respect mean?” It is, he says, “an odd form                  of esteem?at once high-minded and altogether lethal” (Callahan,                  1995). Callahan was not alone in raising this issue and attempts                  to answer his question continue to appear in the literature (See                  Lebacqz, 2001; Meyer and Nelson, 2001; Ryan, “Creating Embryos,”                  2001; Steinbock, 2001, 2000).                                    In retrospect, then, it seems that the HERP report served almost                  as choreography for the initial debates about stem cell research,                  and, as a result, the steps in the debate closely followed those                  that are familiar from the abortion controversy (On this point,                  see Hall 2003). The upshot, in my view, is that much of the debate                  has been too narrowly focused and has a kind of repetitive and                  rigid quality to it. As I noted above, for example, the Catholic                  church has repeatedly claimed that the central issue raised by                  stem cell research is that it involves the destruction of human                  embryos, embryos it believes should be treated as persons. 4                   For that reason, the rhetoric with which the Catholic church condemns                  embryonic stem cell research closely parallels that used to condemn                  abortion. Yet, because the American bishops do not want to be                  perceived as anti-science, they have also repeatedly and uncritically                  praised adult stem cell research, even though there are good reasons,                  given Catholic concerns about social justice, to be concerned                  about the pursuit of adult stem cell research. I will return to                  this point below, but for now I wish simply to note that much                  of the opposition to embryonic stem cell work has resembled Catholic                  opposition in being circumscribed by questions of embryo status,                  narrowly construed.                                     A similar constriction, however, is also apparent in the preoccupations                  of supporters of stem cell research. Just as opponents of this                  research have ritualistically condemned the destruction of early                  embryos but uncritically celebrated adult stem cell work, supporters                  of embryonic stem cell research have typically insisted on using                  embryos left over from IVF procedures, while repudiating the use                  of embryos created solely for research. Indeed, insisting on the                  distinction between so-called “spare” embryos and                  “research” embryos and endorsing only the use of spare                  embryos has been one way that supporters of embryo research have                  tried to demonstrate their “respect” for the embryo.                  Yet, it is worth asking whether the spare embryo/research embryo                  distinction does not, to borrow Daniel Callahan’s image,                  provide a kind of “wafting incense” to mask what supporters                  still find a disquieting smell (Callahan, 1995). 5                                                       Although the debate about stem cell research might have been framed                  in terms of the abortion controversy in any event, the HERP report                  insured that the initial debate over stem cell work that followed                  in aftermath of the public announcement of the work of John Gearhart                  (Shamblott et al., 1998) and James Thomson in 1998 (Thomson et                  al.) would be navigated in the wake of the conflict over abortion.                  As I indicated, the upshot is that the discussion about stem cell                  research has been more cramped than it might otherwise have been.                  The discussion has been too focused on the details of embryological                  development; too focused on the differences between those who                  view the early embryo as a person and those who do not; and far                  too individualistically oriented. Before turning to ways that                  the debate might be become less cramped, let me focus more concretely                  on these difficulties.                                    The point about the debate being framed too individualistically                  is nicely illustrated in an article on abortion by Lisa Sowle                  Cahill entitled “Abortion, Autonomy, and Community”                  (Cahill, 1996). Cahill begins this article by claiming that, in                  discussing the morality of abortion, there is no way to avoid                  the question of the status of the fetus. Nevertheless, she says,                  the debate about fetal status is almost always conducted with                  the goal of determining the rights involved, where rights are                  understood very individualistically. To the degree that the fetus                  is acknowledged to have rights, those rights are pitted against                  the rights of the pregnant women. Although Cahill doubts that                  we can jettison the use of rights language altogether, if we are                  going to use rights language, she says, we must “remove                  that language from the context of moral and political liberalism”                  (361). If we do so, we might be able to see that we have duties                  and obligations to which we do not explicitly consent. As Cahill                  puts it, “such obligations originate simply in the sorts                  of reciprocal relatedness that constitutes being a human”                  (361). 6  For example, moving                  away from an individualistic liberal view of the pregnant woman                  as primarily or exclusively an autonomous moral agent might lead                  us to recognize the obligations that individuals and communities                  have to support her during and after a burdensome pregnancy (363).                                    We do not need to accept Cahill’s commitment to the Catholic                  common good tradition to recognize the truth in her conclusion                  that pitting the rights of the fetus against the rights of the                  pregnant woman individualistically construed leads us to overlook                  important social dimensions of the problem of abortion. It seems                  to me that much the same dynamic is evident in the stem cell research                  debate.                                    Consider again the central argument that the Catholic church has                  made against stem cell research. The Pontifical Academy for Life                  suggests that the fundamental ethical issue is whether it is morally                  licit to produce or use human embryos to derive embryonic stem                  cells. The reasoning the Academy provides for concluding it is                  not licit is worth reproducing in full. The Academy lists five                  points:                  1. On the basis of a complete biological analysis, the living                  human embryo is — from the moment of the union of the gametes                  — a  human subject  with a well defined identity,                  which from that point begins its own  coordinated, continuous                  and gradual development , such that at no later stage can                  it be considered as a simple mass of cells.                                     2. From this it follows that as a “ human individual ”                  it has the  right  to its own life; and therefore every                  intervention which is not in favor of the embryo is an act which                  violates that right. . . .                                    3. Therefore, the ablation of the inner cell mass (ICM) of the                  blastocyst, which critically and irremediably damages the human                  embryo, curtailing its development, is a  gravely immoral                   act and consequently is  gravely illicit .                                     4.  No end believed to be good,  such as the use of stem                  cells for the preparation of other differentiated cells to be                  used in what look to be promising therapeutic procedures,  can                  justify an intervention of this kind . A good end does not                  make right an action which in itself is wrong.                                     5. For Catholics, this position is explicitly confirmed by the                  Magisterium of the Church which, in the Encyclical  Evangelium                  Vitae , with reference to the Instruction  Donum Vitae                   of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, affirms: “The                  Church has always taught and continues to teach that the result                  of human procreation, from the first moment of its existence,                  must be guaranteed that unconditional respect which is morally                  due to the human being in his or her totality and unity in body                  and spirit: The human being is to be respected and treated as                  a person from the moment of conception; and therefore from that                  same moment his rights as a person must be recognized, among which                  in the first place is the inviolable right of every innocent human                  being to life’”(No. 60). (Pontifical Academy for Life,                  2000; emphasis in original)                              Notice that the core of the argument, namely points one and two,                is framed in terms of the rights of the individual embryo. We have                seen this emphasis already in noting Richard Doerflinger’s                various statements on stem cell research. Yet, notice also the claim                that we know the embryo to be an individual with rights on the basis                of “a complete biological analysis.” This is not, of                course, the first time that the Catholic church has made this claim.                In the Declaration on Procured Abortion, the Congregation for the                Doctrine of the Faith claimed that “modern genetic science”                confirms the view that “from the first instant, the programme                is fixed as to what this living being will be: a man, this individual-man                with his characteristic aspects already well determined” ( Congregation ,                “Declaration on Procured Abortion,”1974, 13). The Instruction                on reproductive technology,   Donum Vitae , also                makes this claim. “The conditions of science regarding the                human embryo provide a valuable indication for discerning by the                use of reason a personal presence at the moment of the first appearance                of a human life: how could a human individual not be a human person?”                ( Donum Vitae , 13).                                 One reason the Catholic church has played such a major role in framing                the stem cell debate is that, in defending its position, it combines                the two claims we have just noted, neither of which is explicitly                religious. First, the early embryo is an individual person with                rights and, second, the fact that the embryo is an individual person                is confirmed by modern science. Indeed, a fair amount of the literature                that supports embryo research generally can be read as an attempt                to answer the question posed in  Donum Vitae : How                can a human individual not be a human person?                                Certainly Catholic writers who reject the church’s teaching                on the status of the embryo have responded directly to that question                (See Cahill, 1993; Farley, 2001; McCormick, 1994; Shannon, 2001;                Shannon and Walter, 1990), but so too have non-Catholics. For example,                in a statement issued by their ethics committee, what was then called                the American Fertility Society rejected the claim in  Donum Vitae                 that science supports the personhood of the embryo. According to                the ethics committee “. . . it remains fundamentally inconsistent                to assign the status of human individual to the human zygote or                early pre-embryo when compelling biological evidence demonstrates                that individuation, even in a primitive biologic sense, is not yet                established. Thus, homologues (identical) twins may result from                spontaneous cleavage of the pre-embryo at some point after fertilization                but prior to the completion of implantation. Furthermore, during                very early development, an embryo is not clearly established and                awaits the differentiation between the trophoblast and the embryoblast”                (American Fertility Society, 1988, 3S).                                Arguably, writers like Mary Anne Warren and Bonnie Steinbock, who                distinguish between biological or genetic humanity and moral humanity,                are also at least indirectly answering the question posed in  Donum                Vitae  (Warren, 1997; Steinbock 2001, 1992). Yet, whether writers                are responding more or less directly to Catholic discourse, or not                at all, the important point is that the stem cell debate has been                remarkably preoccupied with the question of whether the early embryo                is an individual person and whether and how the minute details of                embryological development help us to answer this question. This                is one reason why a fair amount of the ethics literature on the                topic reads like a textbook on embryology.                                I want to be clear here: I am not suggesting that the details of                embryological development are unimportant. The maxim from the field                of research ethics applies here as well: bad science is bad ethics.                My point is rather that the preoccupation with the details of early                embryogenesis may lock us even more rigidly into an individualistic                human rights framework than we are in debates about abortion. It                also leads us to frame the debate as fundamentally about one question,                and, indeed, it tempts us to treat the question as if there is one                and only one answer. In this frame of mind, once we have that answer,                there is not a lot more to talk about. Either the early embryo is                a person with the right to life, in which case embryonic stem cell                research is wrong, or the early embryo is not a person with rights,                and then there is no moral reason to object to stem cell work. Gene                Outka has made a similar point in his assessment of stem cell literature.                As Outka puts it, in its starkest form, the crystallizing question                is whether it is cogent to claim that embryonic stem cell research                is morally indistinguishable from murder (Outka, 184). The problem                with framing the question this way, he says, is that it “encourages                an unfortunate tendency to restrict evaluative possibilities to                a single either/or. Either one judges abortion and the destruction                of embryos to be  transparent  instances of treating fetuses                and embryos as mere means to other’s ends, or one judges abortion                and embryonic stem cell research to be,  in themselves ,                morally  indifferent  actions that should be evaluated  solely                 in terms of the benefit they bring to others.” (Outka, 2002,                184).                                The frame of human rights reinforces this either/or because, as                I noted, a being is either a rights-bearing entity or it is not.                I have argued elsewhere, that this either/or tends to drive people                to the extremes. Either the embryo is a person or it is essentially                a kind of property (Lauritzen, 2001). Although I will not rehearse                the argument for rejecting the two extremes here, it is worth noting                that the rhetoric associated with each extreme does not appear to                match the practice of those who adopt the rhetoric or in fact to                match the considered moral judgments of most Americans on these                issues.                                I can illustrate my point in relation to the view that the early                embryo is a person with the right to life by describing a cartoon                that hangs on my office door (See appendix A). The cartoon depicts                protestors in front of a stem cell research lab condemning those                who work there as being anti-life. Down the street at the abortion                clinic, the workers are noting how quiet things have gotten at their                facility since the stem cell lab opened. The point of the cartoon,                of course, is that we may soon see protests and demonstrations of                the sort that are common at abortion clinics at facilities that                conduct stem cell research and that there is an irony in the fact                that pro-life advocates would be demonstrating against research                being done to find treatments for Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s,                and other devastating illnesses. This is not entirely fair to the                pro-life community, but it makes a point.                                In fact, I do not have trouble imaging protestors picketing stem                cell research facilities for, as we just noted, when stem cell research                and abortion are evaluated together and when the evaluative option                is a single either/or, then abortion and stem cell research may                appear indistinguishable from murder. Certainly the rhetoric of                someone like Richard Doerflinger has been consistent in condemning                both abortion and stem cell research as equivalent to murder. The                cartoon draws attention to this consistency, even while it questions                the commitment of pro-life advocates to scientific research designed                to promote the quality of life.                                In one sense, then, the cartoon probes whether there is an inconsistency                between being pro-life and opposed to research an Alzheimer’s                disease, Parkinson’s disease, and other devastating illnesses.                I do not myself think that there is any inconsistency in being pro-life                and opposed to stem cell research, but the cartoon does point in                the direction of a fairly significant disconnect between the rhetoric                and the reality of those opposed to stem cell research because they                believe the early embryo is a person. To see this point, imagine                that, instead of a stem cell clinic, the cartoon depicted on IVF                clinic down the block from the abortion clinic and that the workers                at the abortion clinic are noting how quiet things have gotten since                the IVF clinic opened. The dramatic tension that made the original                cartoon funny would be missing from our revised cartoon precisely                because it is hard to imagine protestors disrupting the work at                IVF clinics. To be sure, the Catholic church and others have argued                that IVF is morally wrong, but the rhetoric condemning IVF is exceptionally                muted compared to that condemning abortion or stem cell research.                Nor has there been a concerted effort to put an end to IVF practice                in this country as there has been in the case of abortion and stem                cell research. Yet, if the embryo is a person from conception, then                participating in IVF as it is practiced in this country, when early                embryos are routinely frozen or discarded or both, is to be complicit                with murder. Why, then, are there no organized efforts to shut down                IVF clinics in this country?  7                                Indeed, opponents of stem cell research and cloning often write                as if these technologies raise the haunting specter of human embryo                research for the first time. The reality, of course, is that the                existence of in vitro fertilization depended entirely on embryo                research and that every variation or innovation in IVF protocols                involves experimentation on human embryos. Carol Tauer is one of                the few scholars who has pressed this point. As Tauer sees it:                                              . . . the entire history of the research leading to the first                  successful IVF is the history of attempts to fertilize oocytes                  in the laboratory. Eventually these attempts succeeded, and the                  first IVF baby was born, followed by thousands of others in the                  ensuing decades.                              The ethics literature contains scholarly discussions as to whether              it is ethically permissible to make use of medical advances that result              from unethical research. This discussion sometimes focuses on medical              research conducted by the Nazis in concentration camps and institutions              for retarded, mentally ill, and handicapped persons. Yet I have never              seen reference to reproductive technologies in this context. If the              fertilization of embryos in research is a practice that is abhorrent              to many or most people, then would it not be logical to question the              continuing use of the results of such research? (Even the Catholic              Church, which opposes the use of IVF and most other forms of assisted              reproduction, does not invoke this argument to support its opposition.)              (Tauer, 2001, 153)               If the embryo research associated with IVF points to a problem                of consistency for those who oppose stem cell research because it                involves destroying persons, it is no less problematic for those                who support stem cell research but insist on respecting the embryo                and embrace the distinction between “research” and “spare”                embryos. For as Tauer points out, Robert Edwards, the scientist                involved in the first successful IVF procedure, began studying fertilization                nearly thirty years before Louise Brown was born in 1978, and the                first successful laboratory fertilization of human eggs took place                a full ten years before she was born. Tauer quotes Edwards’                report on this work: “We fertilized many more eggs and were                able to make detailed examinations of the successive stages of fertilization.                We also took care to photograph everything because we would have                to persuade colleagues of the truth of our discoveries” (Tauer,                154). 8  Nor was the creation of                these “research” embryos done secretly: Edwards and                Steptoe published their work in the journal,  Nature  in                1970 (Edwards, Steptoe, and Purdy, 1970).                                At the very least, then, there is something of an irony in the fact                that so much attention has been devoted to developing and defending                the distinctions between embryos created solely for research and                embryos left over from IVF procedures, because there would be no                embryos left over from IVF procedures had there not been embryos                created solely for research purposes to develop IVF in the first                place. Given this fact, and given that this fact is no great secret?even                though it has not been discussed very much?it appears disingenuous                to endorse the distinction between “research” and “spare”                embryos as a way of demonstrating respect for the early embryo while                nevertheless encouraging its destruction.                                I have suggested that the fact that so much of the stem cell debate                has been framed in terms of whether the embryo is a person with                rights has been unfortunate because it has cast the debate in sharply                individualistic terms and has led to a preoccupation with embryological                development narrowly construed. In addition, however, framing the                debate in terms of embryo status and embryo rights tends to exaggerate                the differences among commentators in contrast to their similarities.                Consider, for example, the response of conservative Judaism in the                United States to this issue. Rabbi Elliot Dorff has prepared a responsum                on stem cell research for the Rabbinical Assembly Committee on Jewish                Law and Standards, and his responsum is instructive. 9                                                 As responsa are, it is structured in terms of relevant questions:                in this case, two questions frame Dorff’s discussion. First,                “may embryonic stem cells from frozen embryos originally created                for purposes of procreation or embryonic germ cells from aborted                fetuses be used for research?” (Dorff, 2002, 1). Second, “may                embryonic stem cells from embryos created specifically for research,                either by combining donated sperm and eggs in a petri dish or by                cloning be used for research?” (1) I think it is noteworthy                that the very questions that frame Dorff’s analysis both reflect                and perpetuate a certain construction of the issue, but at this                juncture, my point is different: given the way the debate has been                framed, what most (non-Jewish) readers of Dorff’s analysis                are likely to focus on is the difference between his treatment of                the early embryo and that of others in the literature. Indeed, even                where you might expect to find?and do in fact find on closer inspection?similarities                between this Jewish analysis and Catholic reflection on this issue,                the first impression will be that of difference. The reason, of                course, is that our attention is drawn to Dorff’s analysis                of the early embryo, and Jewish views are sharply different about                embryo status than those of the Catholic church and other pro-life                opponents of stem cell work. 10                                For example, Dorff points out that, according to the Talmud, during                the first forty days of gestation, the embryo and the fetus are                considered as simply water. From the forty-first day until birth,                Jewish tradition considers the fetus as “the thigh of its                mother.” Moreover, says Dorff:                              As it happens, modern science provides good evidence to support                the Rabbis’ understanding. As Rabbi Immanuel Jakobovits noted                long ago, the Rabbis’ “forty days” is, by our                obstetrical count, approximately fifty-six days, for the Rabbis                counted from the woman’s first missed menstrual flow, while                doctors today count from the point of conception, which is usually                about two weeks earlier. By 56 days of gestation by obstetrical                count the basic organs have already appeared in the fetus. Moreover,                we now know that it is exactly at eight weeks of gestation that                the fetus begins to get bone structure and therefore looks like                something other than liquid. Indeed, the Rabbis probably came to                their conclusion about the stages of development of the fetus because                early miscarriages indeed looked like “merely water,”                while those from 56 days on looks like a thigh with flesh and bones.                (16)                            The contrast with Catholic teaching could hardly be more striking.              Not only are Jewish views of the status of the early embryo notably              different, but Jewish tradition claims scientific validation for its              view of the embryo, just as Catholic tradition does. Not surprisingly,              therefore, where Dorff answers both questions posed by the responsum              in the affirmative, Catholic tradition would answer both negatively.                            These differences are significant and must be attended to, but it              is worth asking whether focusing on these differences does not obscure              important similarities. Consider some of the similarities. In sketching              the Jewish view of stem cell research, Dorff notes that certain theological              commitments are central. He lists at least three that would be strikingly              similar to Catholic and other Christian theological commitments.                               Our bodies are not ours; they belong to God and God commands                  that we seek to preserve life and health.                                 All human beings, regardless of ability or disability are created                  in the image of God and are therefore to be valued as such.                                  Humans are not God. We are finite and fallible and this fact                  ought to promote humility and urge caution.                            Now if we focused merely on questions of embryo status, we would miss              entirely these similarities between Catholic and Jewish views. More              importantly, we would miss the fact that these similarities may underwrite              significant moral reflection on stem cell research that is not rooted              in concerns about the early embryo.                            For example, Dorff notes that, given Jewish theological and legal              commitments, the provision of health care must be understood as a              communal responsibility. Thus, access to therapies developed through              stem cell research is a crucial issue of justice for the Jewish community.              This theme is echoed in Laurie Zoloth’s work on stem cell research.              As Zoloth puts it:                             Research done always will mean research foregone. Will this research              help or avoid the problem of access to health, given that poverty              and poor health are so desperately intertwined in this country? .              . . How can difficult issues of global justice and fair distribution              be handled in research involving private enterprise? (Zoloth, 2001,              238)                            Surely these are questions that any Catholic moral theologian would              gladly press.                            Indeed, attending to the similarities between Zoloth’s work              and Catholic reflection on stem cell research brings us back to Lisa              Cahill’s observation about debates on abortion: they tend to              be too focused on questions of rights individually construed. When              one shifts the frame of analysis, new and different issues and new              and different ways to approach the same issues come into view. Notice,              for example, how close Zoloth and Cahill are on the issue of rights.              According to Zoloth, Jewish tradition foregrounds questions of “obligations,              duties, and just relationships to the other, rather than the protection              of rights, privacy, or ownership of the autonomous self” (96).              This leads Zoloth to ask: “Can the interests of the vulnerable              be heard in our debate?” (105). To be sure, the American bishops              have wanted to emphasize the vulnerability of the early embryo when              they have asked this question, but Catholic tradition, like Jewish              tradition, requires that we ask this question in a way that is not              captured when moral emphasis is merely about individual rights and              personal autonomy.                            Or consider another shared sensibility that emerges if we move away              from questions of embryo status, namely a wariness about the human              tendency to hubris and overreaching. Zoloth put this point eloquently              in relation to the biblical story of the Tower of Babel. She notes              a rabbinic midrash on this text: “when a worker was killed,              no one wept, but when a brick fell, all wept.” Zoloth comments              on this midrash as follows:                               It was this decentering of the human and reification of the thing                that was the catastrophe that felled the enterprise . . . It is                not just that they breached a limit between what is appropriate                to create and what is not, the process of the creation must be carefully                mediated, with deep respect for persons over the temptations of                the enterprise. Such a text elaborates on the tension between repairing                the world . . . and acts that claim that the world is ours to control                utterly (Zoloth, 2001, 106-107).               Beyond Questions of Embryo Status              This passage from Zoloth helps to illustrate the point I wish to make              in arguing that the stem cell debate has been too focused on questions              of embryo status and that we must move beyond status questions if              we are fully to do justice to the moral questions raised by technological              developments associated with stem cell work. For concern about human              efforts utterly to control the world is not a moral worry narrowly              tied to status questions.                            Let me put this point in the form of a question that has not typically              been asked in the stem cell debate: Is adult stem cell work as unproblematic              as it is often assumed to be? That this is a productive question is              suggested by testimony of Francis Collins before the President’s              Council on Bioethics in December 2002. Collins was asked to speak              about the topic, “genetic enhancements: current and future prospects”              and he specifically addressed the issue of pre-implantation genetic              diagnosis (PGD). Although PGD is usually understood to involve screening              IVF embryos and discarding unwanted ones, it is also possible to screen              gametes. Because gamete screening may not have broad utility, Collins              did not discuss the issue at length. He did, however, offer an interesting              observation about gamete selection. Focusing on gametes, he says,              is useful because it “isolates you away from some of the other              compelling arguments about moral status of the embryo and allows a              sort of cleaner discussion about what are the social goods or evils              associated with broad alterations in the sex ratio and inequities              in access to that technology” (Collins, 2002, 7). In other words,              if in the future we could screen gametes in the same way that we can              now screen embryos, most of the moral issues raised by PGD would apply              to gamete screening, even though gametes are not embryos. Might we              not make a similar claim about embryonic and adult stem cell research?              Do not many of the most pressing issues raised by embryonic stem cell              technology remain when our focus is adult stem cell work rather than              embryonic stem cell research?                            The fact that we do not immediately answer yes to this question, is              testament to how decisively the debate about abortion has structured              the stem cell debate. Nevertheless, we need to see that the answer              to this question is yes and we need to see why.                             Although I will not try to address all of the issues raised jointly              by embryonic and adult stem cell research, it is worth highlighting              several that I think require fuller discussion?particularly with respect              to adult stem cell work?than they have yet received.                             Commodification Issues              Moral concerns about the commodification of gametes and embryos have              been discussed extensively in the bioethics literature both in relation              to reproductive technology and in connection with embryonic stem cell              work (See Andrews and Nelkin, 2001; Annas, 1998; Corea, 1986; Radin,              1996; Resnik, 2002; Ryan,  Ethics and Economics , 2001). Suzanne              Holland, for example, has discussed the growing commodification of              the human body in the biotech age. She cites a series of articles              published in the Orange County Register that documents a vast for-profit              market in human body tissue (Holland, 2001, 266). The  Register’s               investigative reporters documented that most nonprofit tissue              banks obtain tissue from cadavers donated by family members of the              deceased for altruistic reasons. Most relatives are not told, and              in fact have no idea, that donated body parts will be sold for profit.              As Holland puts it:                               The “gift of life” is big business in America. For a                nonprofit tissue bank, one typical donation can yield between $14,000                and $34,000 in downstream sales, sometimes far more than that. “Skins,                tendons, heart valves, veins, and corneas are listed at about $110,000.                Add bone from the same body, and one cadaver can be worth about                $220,000.” Four of the largest nonprofit tissue banks told                the Orange County Register that together they expected to produce                sales totaling $261 million in 2000. (226)                              Nor is the issue of downstream commodification restricted to the                sale of donated cadaveric tissue; it arises in relation to IVF embryos                donated for research. As Dorothy Nelkin and Lori Andrews point out                in their book,  Body Bazaar,  IVF patients are not generally                told what the research involving their donated embryos will include.                Many will be unaware that their embryos will be used to develop                commercial stem cell lines (Nelkin and Andrews, 2001, 35).                                 It is significant that even the most vocal advocates of procreative                liberty and laissez-faire arrangements in reproductive matters recoil                from the prospect of selling human embryos. Yet, although the commodification                of tissue may be particularly troubling when it involves embryos,                if there is a problem with commodifying and commercializing human                tissue, it is a problem we confront with adult stem cell research                as well as with hES cell work. Lori Knowles has made a similar point                about being consistent in our moral judgments about commodifying                embryos. She notes that fears about commodifying reproduction have                led many to oppose the sale of embryos and to reject the idea that                couples who donate embryos have any proprietary interest in the                result of the research done with their embryos. As Knowles puts                it, “if it is wrong to commercialize embryos because of their                nature, then it is wrong for everyone. It is simply inconsistent                to argue that couples should act altruistically because commercializing                embryos is wrong, while permitting corporations and scientists to                profit financially from cells derived by destroying those embryos”                (Knowles, 1999, 40).                                Knowles draws attention here to the fact that there is a tension                between our moral and legal traditions as they apply to developments                brought about by cloning, stem cell research, and the existence                of ex utero human embryos, among other technological breakthroughs.                For example, we patent embryonic stem cell lines, thereby insuring                massive profits for patent holders, while decrying the commodification                of embryonic life. Knowles is correct that there is a tension between                our profit-based medical research model and our commitment to altruism                and the access to health care that a commitment to justice demands.                Adult stem cell research, of course, raises very similar issues,                because the same tension exists between the need for proprietary                control of technology and the need for affordable access. For example,                patents have been sought and granted for human adult stem cells                work as well as for embryonic stem cell technologies. According                to a study on the patenting of inventions related to stem cell research                commissioned by the European Group on Ethics in Science and New                Technologies, as of October 2001, two thousand twenty-nine patents                were applied or granted for stem cells and 512 patents were applied                or granted for embryonic stem cell work (Van Overwalle, 2002, 23;                see also McGee and Banger, 2002). As a result, access to therapies                developed from adult stem cell research is likely to be as serious                an issue as access to embryonic stem cell therapies.                                Indeed, issues arising from commodification of both adult and embryonic                stem cells are likely to dominate the next phase of the debate,                if only because corporate interest in this work, both nationally                and internationally, is so strong (Hill, 2003). Noting that, as                of 2002, “a dozen biotech companies have entered the stem                cell industry and have invested millions of dollars,” David                Resnik suggests that the next stage of the stem cell debate will                involve a battle over property rights relating to stem cells (Resnik,                2002, 130-31).                                To be sure, the battle over property rights raises important legal                and policy question, but it also raises ethical questions as well.                For example, Resnik provides the following table of possible ethical                objections to patenting stem cells.                                                                               Deontological Objections to Property                      Rights in ES cells                   Consequentialist Objections to Property                      Rights in ES cells                                                                        ES cells (and their products) should not be                      treated as property; they should be viewed as having inherent                      dignity or respect.   ES cells should not                      be treated as private property; they are  res communis                       or common property.                                        Treating ES cells as property will have dire social consequences,                      such as exploitation, destruction of altruism, and loss of                      respect for the value of human life.   Treating ES cells                      as property will undermine scientific discovery and technological                      innovation in the field of regenerative medicine. (Resnik,                      2002, 139)                                              Although the ethical objections to commodifying stem cell work                can not be sorted out as neatly as this table suggests, Resnik correctly                identifies a variety of such objections. I will not try to defend                it here, but my own view is that the problem is not just that stem                cells and their products may be commodified, but that market rhetoric                may come to dominate the discussion (and practice) of regenerative                medicine in a way that is dehumanizing. That is, market-rhetoric                may lead us ultimately to think of humans as artifacts. In short,                I take very seriously Margaret Radin’s argument that the rhetoric                in which we conceive our world affects who and what we are (Radin,                1996, 82). 11  At the same time,                however, stem cell research is most likely to bear therapeutic fruit,                if there is a market in stem cells and their products. The pressing                moral question, then, is how do we promote the benefits that stem                cell research may yield without succumbing to a market rhetoric                that reduces humans to commodities?                                Several writers have suggested that one answer may be to promote                greater governmental regulation. For example, Holland argues for                moving beyond a policy of restricting federal funding of stem cell                research but allowing an unregulated private market in this field                to active regulation to curb the private sector’s work on                stem cells. Lori Knowles suggests that the United States might adopt                a body like Canada’s Patented Medicine Prices Review Board                as a way to allow a market to function, but with oversight that                would provide access to potential cells for further research and                price controls of products to insure widespread access (Knowles,                1990, 40). George Annas has suggested that we need to establish                a federal Human Experimentation Agency to regulate in the area of                human experimentation. (Annas, 1998, 18). As Annas puts it:                                Virtually all those who have studied the matter have concluded that                a broad-based public panel is needed to oversee human experimentation                in the areas of genetic engineering, human reproduction, xenografts,                artificial organs, and other boundary-crossing experiments. (19)              Francis Fukuyama has argued that a new agency with a mandate to regulate              biotechnology on broad grounds and in both the public and private              sector may be needed (Fukuyama, 2002, 215). Vanessa Kuhn argues that              “it is time to put in place legislation that will deter stakeholders              from licensing their technology to one exclusive distributor and thus              creating a monopoly market, which would set artificially-high prices              and lead to less access for the sick especially for the uninsured,              the poor, and the elderly” (Kuhn, 2002). To that end, Kuhn identifies              four possibilities:               Development of a new kind of patent.               Set limits on exclusive licensing through compulsory licensing.                 Lower the lifespan of hES cell patents                  Set stricter guidelines for hES patent utility (2)              I do not have the expertise to make policy recommendations, but let              me stress two points. First, the policy issues with regard to commodifiying              adult stem cell work will be as vexing as those confronting regulation              of embryonic stem cells. Second, although these questions may at first              appear to be strictly legal or largely political matters, they involve              serious value judgments about the common good that are every bit as              morally vital as questions about the status of the embryo. I thus              agree with Gene Outka, that not to confront directly questions about              how stem cell research will be organized, financed, and overseen is              a kind of ethical failure (Outka, 2002, 177). Obviously, for example,              the institutional arrangements for conducting stem cell research have              implications for the questions of justice we previously noted. The              fact that so much stem cell research is being done by private corporations              insures future conflict. On the one hand, corporations have fiduciary              obligations to their shareholders and will therefore seek to control              access to stem cell lines or therapies developed from those lines              through patent protection and licensing agreements. On the other hand,              such a system is likely to further widen the gap between the health              care haves and have-nots (See Lebacqz 2001; McLean 2001).                             Moreover, as Karen Lebacqz notes, if justice is an important consideration              in deliberations about stem cell work, then it ought to shape the              research agenda. The example she gives to make this point is worth              noting. Just as with organ transplants, tissue rejection may be a              major problem for stem cell therapies. This is one reason that the              prospect of combining stem cell work with somatic cell nuclear transfer              (SCNT) has been so enticing. With this combination, you could in theory              develop tissue that would be completely histocompatible. Nevertheless,              according to Lebacqz, developing stem cell therapies with SCNT is              “highly questionable,” if justice is a primary consideration.              The reason is that unique cell lines would need to be created for              each patient, and that is likely to be very expensive and thus unaffordable              for many. Although it would certainly be less expensive, the same              would likely be true for adult stem work. For that reason, rather              than pursuing an individualized approach to stem cell research, concerns              about affordable access to new therapies might urge the pursuit of              universal donor cell lines.                             Embodiment, Boundary Issues, and Human Nature              In discussing the debate about embryo status, I focused primarily              on the contested question of whether the early embryo is a person              with the right to life. We saw that this question tends to lead to              the mobilization of minute details of embryological development to              support one’s view of the embryo. Yet, if attention to embryo              status tends to focus us on the microscopic, viewing stem cell research              through the lens of embryological development can also have a kind              of telescopic function through which larger issues come into view. 12               For example, Catherine Waldby and Susan Squier argue in a forthcoming              issue of the journal  Configurations  that focusing on stem              cells and embryonic life leads us fundamentally to question what it              means to be human. According to Waldby and Squier:                               Stem cell technologies have profound temporal implications for the                human life course, because they can potentially utilize the earliest                moments of ontogenesis to produce therapeutic tissues to augment                deficiencies in aging bodies. Hence they may effect a major redistribution                of tissue vitality from the first moments of life to the end of                life. In doing so however they demonstrate the perfect contingency                of any relationship between embryo and person, the non-teleological                nature of the embryo’s developmental pathways. They show that                the embryo’s life is not proto-human, and that the biology                and biography of human life cannot be read backwards into its moment                of origin. (Waldby and Squier, forthcoming)              The claim that there is a perfect contingency in the relationship              between embryo and person may at first appear to be just another “microscopic”              claim about embryo status, but it is clear that Waldby and Squier              mean to imply much more in asserting that the embryo’s development              is non-teleological. In effect, they reject the notion that there              is a meaningful trajectory to human life. What was killed, they say,              when stem cells were first derived from the inner cell mass of a blastocyte              was not a person, but a “biographical idea of human life, where              the narrative arc that describes identity across time has been extended              to include the earliest moments of ontogeny” (Waldby and Squier,              forthcoming).                             That much more is at stake here than the question of whether the embryo              is a person is clear if we attend to the notion of a trajectory of              a human life. Gilbert Meilaender, for example, has argued that our              attitudes toward death and dying are importantly shaped by our conception              of what it means to have a life (Meilaender 1993). Indeed, according              to Meilaender, two views of what it means to have a life?of what it              means to be a person?have been at war with each other within the field              of bioethics over the past thirty years and these views underwrite              sharply different views not just about the issues of abortion or euthanasia              that are implicated here but with regard to practically every moral              issue we might confront in the field of bioethics.                            On Meilaender’s view, having a life means precisely that there              is a trajectory that traces a “natural pattern” in embodied              life that “moves through youth and adulthood toward old age              and, finally, decline and death” (29). As he puts it elsewhere              in this essay, “to have a life is to be  terra animata,               a living body whose natural history has a trajectory” (31).              Although Meilaender develops the notion of a natural trajectory of              bodily life primarily to address the issue of euthanasia and not stem              cell research, his talk of “natural history,” “natural              pattern,” and “natural trajectory” draws attention              to one of the most significant issues raised by stem cell research              and related technologies. Does stem cell research undermine the very              notion of a human life constrained by natural bodily existence? The              example on which Meilaender focuses here is instructive for thinking              about the broad implications of stem cell research in this regard.              If stem cell therapies fundamentally alter our sense of a natural              pattern to aging would they not also fundamentally alter our sense              of what it means to be human? Meilaender’s answer is that such              a change would fundamentally affect what it means to be human precisely              because we are embodied creatures and for that reason our identity              is tied to the body and the body’s history.                            Leon Kass has made a similar point recently in reflecting on the prospect              that regenerative medicine might significantly lengthen the human              life span (Kass, 2003). He, too, invokes the notion of a natural trajectory,              one that stem cell research may undermine. Although it is possible              to approach the prospect of extending the human life-span in an abstract              way, he says, to think of what such a change would mean experientially              is to recognize that “the ‘lived time’ of our natural              lives has a trajectory and a shape, its meaning derived in part from              the fact that we live as links in the chain of generations”              (13). Indeed, says Kass, without something like the natural trajectory              of bodily life that currently exists, the relationship between the              generations would be decidedly different, and probably not better.              “A world of longevity,” writes Kass, “is increasingly              a world hostile to children” (13). Walter Glannon has argued              that, at the very least, increased longevity would increase competition              for scarce resources between older and younger generations. According              to Glannon, “it is at least intuitively plausible that an over              populated world with substantially extended human lives and scarce              resources could adversely affect the survival and reproductive prospects              of the young and harm them by thwarting their interest in being healthy              enough so that they could survive and procreate” (Glannon, “Extending,”              347).  13                            Francis Fukuyama has also suggested some of the reasons why increased              longevity may imperil children, but he also notes that our relationship              to death may change as well (See 2002, ch. 4). “Death,”              he says, “may come to be seen not as a natural and inevitable              aspect of life, but a preventable evil like polio or measles. If so,              then accepting death will appear to be a foolish choice, not something              to be faced with dignity or nobility” (Fukuyama, 2002, 71).                            Sometimes the question of the transformative possibilities that come              with stem cell research is raised even more starkly when the question              asked is not how may stem cell work affect what it means to be human,              but instead: Does stem cell research open the door to a post human              future? This is a point Waldby and Squier raise explicitly when they              discuss the combination of genetic engineering and stem cell therapy.              They suggest, for example, that xenotransplantation forces us to confront              the prospect of transgressing species boundaries. 14               The conclusion of their paper is worth quoting in full:                               Thus the ontological status of the embryo is not the                only thing in question. The ontological status of the graft recipient                must be negotiated, when the graft involves genetically-engineered                stem cells from another species. And the ontological status of the                illnesses to which biomedical technology responds is equally challenged,                in an endless regression, as the division between veterinary and                human medicine, or between zoonoses (diseases humans can catch from                animals) and what has recently been dubbed humanooses, is called                into question. This increasingly permeable, increasingly constructed                barrier between human and animal presents us with another form of                life to negotiate, whose boundary lies not between silicon and carbon,                but rather between steps in the evolutionary ladder?or the branching                development tree?of phylogenetic lifeforms. Stem cell technologies                thus challenge both the temporal and spatial boundaries of human                life, both our biography and our biological niche, giving a much                broader meaning to the questioning of embryonic  personhood .                (Waldby and Squier, forthcoming)                            Regrettably, with some notable exceptions, the ethical debate about              stem cell research has not taken up in a sustained way what it would              mean to pursue stem cell therapies that might significantly undermine              the notion of a natural human life or erode the boundary between human              and non-human species. When the issue is framed in terms of the status              of the embryo, the question tends to be whether the research should              be conducted at all. By contrast, when the issue is framed in terms              of adult stem cell work, the question is not whether, but how and              with what consequences. Yet, that is a question we have not systematically              answered. Given the potential for good embedded in the prospects of              adult stem cell research, it is not surprising that there appears              to be widespread and largely uncritical acceptance of adult stem cell              research. But, if the promise of stem research is as revolutionary              as is often claimed, we are going to need a much more expansive discussion              of stem cell research?both embryonic and adult?than we have had heretofore.              Obviously, I cannot explore this more expansive horizon in any detail              in this report, but let me in closing suggest one direction we need              to explore.                             To signal the decisive break that I think we may need from the usual              bioethics frame, I want to draw attention to Martha Nussbaum’s              recent article in the journal  Daedalus  entitled, “Compassion              & Terror” (Nussbaum, 2003). Discussing Euripides’              play,  Trojan Women , Nussbaum reflects on the fact that the              Greek poets returned obsessively to the sacking of Troy and the acts              of the “rapacious and murderous Greeks.” She explores              the poets’ compassionate imagining of the fate of Trojan women              and children to reflect on the conditions and limits of a compassionate              vision. Although Nussbaum is ultimately concerned about engendering              a compassionate vision for Americans in the face of terror?and particularly              compassion for innocent women and children far from our shores, her              analysis of compassion is thought-provoking in relation to stem cell              research.                            Nussbaum notes that compassion is a complex emotion requiring a series              of judgments involving another person’s suffering or lack of              well-being. We must judge that someone has been harmed, that the harm              is serious, and that it was not deserved. Moreover, says Nussbaum,              Western tradition has stressed what could be called the “judgment              of similar possibilities.” In other words, “we have compassion              only insofar or we believe that the suffering person shares vulnerabilities              and possibilities with us” (Nussbaum, 2003, 15).                            Now surely in just about everyone’s catalogue of human vulnerabilities              are illness, old age, and death. Yet, as we have just seen, stem cell              research might significantly transform the “human” experience              of illness and death, at least for some. If stem cell therapies were              to erode the notion of human nature or species membership, might they              not also erode some basic moral sensibilities? Mary Midgley, for example,              has argued that both the notion of human nature and that of human              rights are importantly tied to membership in our species because rights              are “supposed to guarantee the kind of life that all specimens              of  Homo sapiens  need” (Midgley, 2000, 9).                            Although Nussbaum avoids the language of human nature, it is precisely              this sort of point that she highlights when she argues that compassion              requires the belief that others share vulnerabilities and possibilities              with us. Indeed, like Midgley, Nussbaum ties the notion of universal              human rights to important human functions and capabilities. The basic              idea, she says, is to ask what constitutes the characteristic activities              of human beings. In other words:                               ‘What does the human being do, characteristically,                as such?and not, say, as a member of a particular group, or a particular                local community?’ To put it another way, what are the forms                of activity, of doing and being, that constitute the human form                of life and distinguish it from other actual or imaginable forms                of life, such as the lives of animals and plants, or, on the other                hand, of immortal gods as imagined in myths and legends (which frequently                have precisely the function of delimiting the human)? (Nussbaum,                1995, 72)                 Nussbaum notes that this inquiry proceeds by examining a wide variety                of self-interpretations and that comparing characteristic human                activities with non-human activities and, through myths and stories,                comparing humans and the gods is particularly helpful. For one thing,                such an inquiry helps us to define limits that derive from membership                in the world of nature.                                 Indeed, although Nussbaum is particularly attentive to the wide                variety of cultural interpretations of what it means to be human,                she insists that to ground any essentialist or universal notion                of human rights, one must attend to human biology. Although her                account of the human is neither ahistorical nor a priori, it is                linked to an “empirical study of a species-specific form of                life” (1995, 75). When she develops her account of central                human capabilities, she begins with the body. She writes:               We live all our lives in bodies of a certain sort, whose                possibilities and vulnerabilities do not as such belong to one human                society rather than another. These bodies, similar far more than                dissimilar (given the enormous range of possibilities) are our homes,                so to speak, opening certain options and denying others, giving                us certain needs and also certain possibilities for excellence.                The fact that any given human being might have lived anywhere and                belonged to any culture is a great part of what grounds our mutual                recognitions; this fact, in turn, has a great deal to do with the                general humanness of the body, its great distinctness from other                bodies. The experience of the body is culturally shaped, to be sure;                the importance we ascribe to its various functions is also culturally                shaped. But the body itself, not culturally variant in its nutritional                and other related requirements, sets limits on what can be experienced                and valued, ensuring a great deal of overlap. (Nussbaum, 1995, 76)                              Nussbaum’s work both in identifying the judgments that underwrite                compassion and in tying an account of rights to human function and                capabilities that are presumably universal highlights what is at                stake, not merely with stem cell research but with a growing list                of biotechnological developments which appear to destabilize the                concept of human nature and which require that we think carefully                and hard about what it might mean for some humans to have access                to these technologies while other humans do not. 15                 At the very least, the combination of what Rabinow describes as                the biologicalization of identity around genetics rather than gender                and race with the possibility of manipulating that genetic identity                for those with the money or power to do so does not bode well for                securing wide-spread compassion across economic or technological                divides. Even more important, however, is the recognition that the                very notion of human rights may ultimately rest on the idea (and                what, until recently has always been the reality) of a natural human                condition that is relatively stable.                                I believe that Nussbaum is correct when she claims that inquiring                into characteristic human activities and comparing these to non-human                activities helps us to define limits and thereby to promote human                flourishing. Unfortunately, what Susan Squier calls the “pluripotent                rhetoric” of stem cell research is that of limitless possibilities                (Squier, Liminal Lives). The ultimate limit, of course, is death                and yet even this limit appears illusory in some visions of our                biotech future.                                It is worth noting in closing that William Safire’s New Year’s                Day column at the dawn of the twenty-first century, in January 2000,                was entitled “Why Die?” The longing behind this question                is neither new nor unfamiliar. What is new is that this longing                to escape the vulnerabilities and limitations of the body is united                with a technology that holds out the prospect of fundamentally changing                that body. Yet, I agree with Gerald McKenny that we need to ask                whether we wish to accept and promote a view of bodily vulnerability                as merely an obstacle to human flourishing, which ought to be overcome                at any cost (McKenny, 1998, 223).                                Although a longing for invulnerability is perhaps a quintessentially                human trait, and although the quest to reduce the human suffering                wrought by illness and disease is morally admirable, there is no                mistaking the hubris behind the question, Why Die? Opponents of                stem cell research have, from the start, argued that there is a                kind of idolatry in a science that would reduce the human embryo                to just so much biological material. What I have tried to show in                this report is that such concerns need not be limited to those who                think that the early embryo is fully a person. Nor should this kind                of concern be limited to those who oppose stem cell research. I                do not think the early embryo is a person and I believe that both                embryonic and adult stem cell research should go forward under a                system of strict regulation. Nevertheless, I confess to being haunted                by the passages with which I began and I believe that future debates                on stem cell research must take very seriously the worries about                commodification and the possibility of fundamentally changing the                trajectory of a human life. 16                                                                        Appendix A                                 Jimmy Margulies, Editorial Cartoonist                The Record, Hackensack, New Jersey                Cartoon used with permission of the artist.                                          _____________________                 notes                                                Given the current status of technology, deriving                  human embryonic stem cells requires destroying embryos. If the                  cells could be derived without the destruction of embryos or if                  parthenogenetically stimulated eggs produced stem cells, issue                  of status would almost certainly fade. Nevertheless, serious ethical                  issues would still remain. This is one reason I believe it is                  a mistake to focus narrowly on embryo status.                                     Gene Outka has argued that there is an “internal                  coherence” to views of the embryo, issues of complicity,                  and views on adult stem cell research (Outka, 2002).                                       Although the HERP report claimed that “it                  is not the role of those who help form public policy to decide                  which of these views [of the embryo] is correct, there is little                  doubt that the panel adopted the pluralistic view. For that reason,                  most commentators found the above claim disingenuous.                   Compare, for example,                  the various statements that Richard M. Doerflinger has made on                  the U. S. bishops’ behalf. See Doerflinger, 1988, 1998,                  1999, 2001. Margaret Farley has argued that the Catholic preoccupation                  with abortion has eroded its credibility on other important social                  issues, including stem cell research. (See Farley, 2000).                   Another debate that is                  at least partly shaped by focusing on embryo status revolves around                  the question of complicity. For example, supporters of stem cell                  research may harbor a residual uneasiness about endorsing the                  destruction of human embryos, at least if the number of articles                  in the literature explaining the concept of complicity with wrongdoing                  is any indication. John Robertson, Ronald Green, and Thomas Shannon,                  have all written on the issue of cooperation with evil in relation                  to stem cell research. (Robertson, 1999; Green, 2002; Shannon,                  2001; see also Kaveny, 2000; and Gilliam, 1997). To be sure, the                  issue of complicity or cooperation with wrongdoing is a very traditional                  one in moral philosophy and theological ethics. Still, if the                  early embryo does not deserve the respect accorded persons and                  if destroying the embryo is compatible with respecting it, then                  deriving stem cells is not an act of wrongdoing and issues of                  complicity do not arise. Cahill also emphasizes the way a liberal                  individualist view of the person discounts the significance of                  embodiment. I will return to this point below.                  Cahill also emphasizes                  the way a liberal individualist view of the person discounts the                  significance of embodiment. I will return to this point below.                                   That both                  those who view the embryo as a person and those who do not but                  who insist on respect for the embryo, have been remarkably cavalier                  with regard to the use of embryos in IVF programs can be seen                  by the fact that there are currently over 400,000 embryos frozen                  in the United States, a number we did not even know until quite                  recently (Hoffman et al. in association with The Society for Assisted                  Reproductive Technology and RAND, 2003).                   In a commentary                  published in Nature, in September 2001, Edwards writes: “On                  the verge of clinical application, stem cells offer a startlingly                  fundamental approach to alleviating severe incurable human maladies.                  Fondly believed to be a recent development, they have in fact                  been part and parcel of human in-vitro fertilization (IVF) from                  as long ago as 1962.”                  Dorff’s                  responsum was accepted by the Committee on Law and Standards by                  a vote of twenty-two to one in March 2002. On the basis of Dorff’s                  responsum the Rabbinical Assembly passed a resolution in April                  2003 supporting stem cell research for therapeutic purposes. (Resolution                  in Support of Stem Cell Research and Education, April 2003: available                  at www.rabassembly.org.)                   Alpers                  and Lo draw the distinction between commodification and commercialization                  as follows: “The issue of commodification involves treating                  either human beings or symbols of human life as merchandise or                  vendible goods. . . . Commercialization refers to the practice                  of realizing large profits from the development and sale of techniques                  or products that involve distinctive human material, such as embryos,                  eggs, or tissue” (Alpers and Lo, 1995).                  Radin                  quotes Georg Lukács on the reification of commodities and                  the effects on human consciousness. Lukács writes: “The                  transformation of the commodity relation into a thing of ‘ghostly                  objectivity’ cannot therefore content itself with reduction                  of all objects for the gratification of human needs to commodities.                  It stamps its imprint upon the whole consciousness of man; his                  qualities and abilities are no longer an organic part of his personality,                  they are things which he can ‘own’ or ‘dispose                  of’ like the various objects of the external world”                  (Radin, 1996, 82). When we think about genes for enhancing memory                  or muscle mass, it is worth keeping in mind Lukács’s                  claim that human qualities and abilities may come to be thought                  of as objects for sale in the external world.                    Erik                  Parens has noted the importance of attending to the big picture                  raised by stem cell work and how the politics of abortion has                  obscured that picture. See Parens, 2000.                   In another                  essay, Glannon argues that substantially increasing the human                  life span would profoundly affect issues of personal identity                  and thus a sense of personal responsibility for one’s action.                  He ties his argument in interesting ways to the biology of memory                  function (Glannon, “Identity”). For a classic philosophical                  discussion of the problems associated with immortality, see Williams,                  1973.                  Although                  he is not discussing stem cell research explicitly, Paul Rabinow’s                  discussion of technological change wrought during the last two                  decades is worth noting. He writes: “In the United States,                  for example, in the last two decades, while the most passionate                  value conflicts have raged around abortion, a general reshaping                  of the sites of production of knowledge has been occurring. To                  cite the biotechnology industry, the growing stock of genomic                  information, and the simple but versatile and potent manipulative                  tools (exemplified by the polymerase chain reaction) is to name                  a few key elements; a more complete list would include the reshaping                  of American universities, the incessant acceleration in the computer                  domains, and the rise of ‘biosociality’ as a prime                  locus of identity?a biologicalization of identity different from                  the older biological categories of the West (gender, age, race)                  in that it is understood as inherently manipulable and re-formable”                  (Rabinow, 1999, 13). A couple of pages later, he writes: “My                  analysis points to the fact that the basic understanding and practices                  of ‘bare life’ have been altered. The genome projects                  (human, plant, animal, microorganismic) are demonstrating a powerful                  approach to life’s constituent matter. It is now known that                  DNA is universal among living beings. It is now known that DNA                  is extremely manipulable. One consequence among many others is                  that the boundaries between species need to be rethought; transgenic                  animals made neither by God nor by the long-term processes of                  evolution now exist (16).

The National Institute of Dental and  Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) invites applications to promote research  on the use of stem cells derived from human embryos and adults.  The source of human embryonic stem cells will be limited to federally  approved stem cell lines listed on the NIH Human Embryonic Stem Cell  Registry. Information on the lines and how to contact providers can be  found on the NIH stem cell registry  http://stemcells.nih.gov/registry/index.asp)  and bioengineering approaches for the repair and regeneration of  orofacial tissues and organs.  In particular, this Request for  Applications (RFA) encourages studies on: i) the understanding of the  unique properties of embryonic and post-natal stem cells in orofacial  tissues; ii) the development of methods to induce appropriate stem cell  expansion, differentiation and in vitro assembly of a functional tissue  prototype unit and iii) the design and development for new bio-inspired  materials for cell transplantation. (Note: FDA regulations and  requirements may restrict the selection of cells eligible for  transplantation). Collaborative projects involving interdisciplinary teams of  investigators are strongly encouraged. APPLICATIONS USING EMBRYONIC OR ADULT STEM CELLS FROM ANIMAL MODELS ARE  NOT RESPONSIVE TO THIS RFA.

Kaufman, MD and PhD, University of Wisconsin      Friday, November 16, 2001 - $5                 Prior to September 11, one of the most widely discussed topics in the current administration was stem cell research. In an effort to better understand this topic, please join us for a lecture on The Importance of Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research by Dr. Dan Kaufman on Friday, November 16, 2001 at 8 p.m. in Fermilab's Ramsey Auditorium. Kaufman is deeply involved in the research of hematopoietic (blood) development from human embryonic stem cells.  This research has important applications to the clinical fields of hematology and bone marrow transplantation.  In addition to his research, Dr. Kaufman does clinical work in these fields, regularly treating people with diseases such as leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma which may directly benefit from the application of this research,   The lecture will focus on stem cells in general, both so-called ""adult"" stem cells and embryonic stem cells. Kaufman will explain the nature of these stem cells and examine such questions as:  Why the great scientific interest?  Where do they come from? How are they used in the laboratory? He will also explain some of the clinical aspects of bone marrow transplantation - one area of medicine that now routinely uses stem cells.  His lecture will not only highlight the scientific details of this research, but also look at the potential clinical uses of these cells.      Trained as both a medical doctor and a Ph.D. in Immunology, Dan Kaufman is currently an Assistant Professor in Hematology/BMT (Bone Marrow Transplantation) at the University of Wisconsin in Madison.  A graduate of the Mayo Medical School and Mayo Graduate School, he received a grant in 1999 for the University of Wisconsin Comprehensive Cancer Center Pilot Project.  He has authored numerous articles and given many presentations on the topic of Human Embryonic Stem Cells.  In addition to his work as a physician and researcher, he is a volunteer physician at the Grace Homeless Shelter Medical Clinic in Madison.

The courses should  include hands-on experience to improve the knowledge and skills of biomedical  researchers to maintain, characterize, and utilize human embryonic stem cells  in basic research studies and be made available to investigators in research  areas of interest to all of the institutes and centers of the NIH.  RESEARCH OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE  Background  Recent scientific discoveries about the ability of human embryonic stem cells  to proliferate in an undifferentiated state and to be directed to develop  into a wide array of cell types present opportunities for research that aims  to repair or replace cells and restore vital functions.  Advancing these  discoveries will require a dissemination of technical knowledge and skills in  cell culture techniques across a variety disciplines and disease research  areas.  Because of the brief period of time these stem cells have been  available to the researchers, there is a paucity of investigators who have  experience with this research tool.  The growth and maintenance of human  embryonic stem cells in an undifferentiated state represents a significant  technical challenge.  Taken together, these issues underscore the need for  educational courses focused on the cell culture techniques for human  embryonic stem cells.  Research Objectives and Scope  The objective of this grant program is to support the development,  implementation and evaluation of short-term courses on skills and techniques  applied in human embryonic stem cell research.  The courses should improve  the skills of biomedical researchers in the maintenance of human embryonic  stem cells in culture and their application of this research tool in basic  research studies.  The long-term objective is to increase the number of  researchers who have both the knowledge and skills in the use of human  embryonic stem cells in basic research.  Further, applicants are encouraged  to propose innovative programs with new approaches for teaching and learning  the maintenance and use of human embryonic stem cells.  There is a broad array of applications for the use of human embryonic stem  cells that can benefit from the short course approach.  The following are  examples of topic areas of emphasis for the courses to enhance research  skills and knowledge. They are not all inclusive and applicants may propose  other topic areas:  o Demonstration of proper growth conditions for cells including preparation  of culture media, microseparation techniques for dissection and isolation of  cells from embryoid bodies, preparation and use of feeder/support cells and  growth factors  o Proper freeze-thaw cycling, repetition of the preparation of cell passages,  and the cryopreservation, vitrification, storage, and shipment of cells  o Use of co-culture techniques to support maintenance of the undifferentiated  cell state  o Use of cell separation procedures including fluorescence-activated cell  sorting (FACS)  o Review of basic good laboratory practices for use of human biological  materials including proper exposure precautions, safe methods of disposal,  and record keeping  o Development of protocols that support the characterization of molecular,  cellular, and genetic characteristics of embryonic stem cells including the  use of monoclonal antibodies, polymerase chain reaction techniques,  fluorescent in situ hybridization techniques and karyotype analysis  (including staining technologies and application of confocal microscopy)  o Establishment of xenograft procedures for the use of animal models (e.g.,  immune-deficient mice) for in situ culturing and differentiation of stem  cells and the pathological examination of tumor growth  o Application of standard research protocols for directed differentiation of  embryonic stem cells to specific cell populations (e.g., insulin producing  cells, cardiomyocyte, neuronal subtypes)  o Employment of standard detection methods for infectious organisms or  other contaminants  o Introduction to microarray techniques for DNA and transcriptional profiling   o Molecular biology applications to existing cell lines to create mutations  yielding cell lines with overexpressed or repressed protein expression and/or  the reporter gene constructs  o Application of single cell recording methods for measurement of electrical  potential (e.g., cardiomyocyte and neuron recordings)  o Cross-training of techniques used in other applications of stem cell  biology tools; training may also include the use of non-human embryonic stem  cells and adult stem cells (e.g., hematopoietic stem cells, neurospheres, or  other precursor/progenitor cells), but these should not be the dominant  research tools used in the training exercises  All courses should be developed to meet the training needs of junior through  senior biomedical researchers.  Each topic area of the application should be  addressed in sufficient depth to show how it significantly improves the  skills and knowledge of the trainee.  Given the complexity of many of the  areas of emphasis listed above relative to the short duration of the courses,  applicants are strongly encouraged to target the skills courses to  researchers with current expertise clearly related to human embryonic stem  cell culture.  In both developing and teaching the courses, applicants are encouraged to  take an interdisciplinary approach and involve a wide array of perspectives  of the biological sciences including genetics, reproductive biology,  physiology, cell biology, oral biology, neurobiology, biochemistry,  microbiology, immunology, and toxicology.  It is important that the teaching  program involve scientists from a variety of relevant fields and to include  those with recognized expertise in the field of embryonic stem cell biology.   Courses should include information on stem cell regulations and ethical issues. Applicants to this program will be required to disseminate their educational  materials widely.  Applicants should describe what specific mechanisms they  will employ for dissemination and should indicate what resources will be  available for continuing education when trainees return to their home  institutions.  In the case of internet-based materials used in the training,  applicants are encouraged to submit plans on how these materials will be  advertised and made available to the appropriate research communities and  evaluated for effectiveness.   Proposals for courses should indicate criteria for student selection, the  number of students expected per class, and should include clear plans for  evaluating the effectiveness of the course(s) in terms of attendees'  perceptions of the material and conduct of the course.  Importantly, there  must be plans in place to assess the longer-term impact, as measured by  attendees' subsequent activities or responsibilities in their institutions in  the areas of embryonic stem cell biology.    Applicants should also address plans to include attendees from groups  currently underrepresented in the field of embryonic stem cell biology.    MECHANISM OF SUPPORT   This PA will use the NIH Continuing Education Training Grant (T15) award that  funds institutions to establish or expand programs of continuing professional  education.  As an applicant, you will be solely responsible for planning,  directing, and executing the proposed project.   Using this PA, human  embryonic stem cell research training courses may be of any duration up to  three months as long as they are consistent with the goals of the proposed  program.  For organizations wanting to teach human embryonic stem cell  research training courses, such courses should be offered at least once a  year.  Courses can be developed that have Internet, CD-ROM, DVD, and/or  videotape components.  Although not considered for funding by this PAS, alternative mechanisms to  support training experiences for human embryonic stem cell research include  National Research Service Awards for Senior Fellows (F33), Education Project  Grants (R25), Conference Grants (R13), National Research Short-Term Training  Award (T35), existing Institutional Training Grants (T32), and courses  developed using the Fast-Track Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and  Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Grant mechanisms.   This PA uses just-in-time concepts.  This mechanism (T15) uses the non- modular budgeting format.  Applicants may request up to three years of support.  Allowable costs include  personnel, rental of laboratory facilities and equipment for the period of  the course offering, purchase of laboratory supplies required for cell  culture and supporting experiments, travel and per diem for faculty, and  other costs such as printing, telephone, audio-visuals, postage, recruitment  materials, and computer software.  The purchase of equipment is not an  allowable cost.  In addition, travel and per diem funds for trainees  attending courses developed by applicants are appropriate when necessary.   However, it is expected that courses will be partially funded through  registration fees paid for by the trainees and their home institutions.   Trainees may be recruited locally (at the grantee institution), regionally,  or nationally.  The facilities and administration rate for T15 awards is  eight percent.    FUNDS AVAILABLE  The twelve sponsoring Institutes and Centers have committed approximately  $1,000,000 for total costs for the first year of support in FY 2002.  Award  of grants is contingent upon the availability of such funds for this purpose.   It is anticipated that four to five grants may be awarded under this program  in FY 2002. The specific number to be funded will depend on the merit and  scope of the application received.  Direct costs of the awards made under the T15 mechanism are limited to  $150,000 for each of the planned years of the planned three years of support.   The facilities and administration rate for T15 awards is eight percent.   Additional solicitations may be available in FY 2003 pending availability  of funds.    ELIGIBLE INSTITUTIONS  You may submit an application is your institution has any of the  following characteristics:  o For-profit or non-profit o Public or private institutions, such as universities, colleges,  hospitals, laboratories o Units of state and local governments o Eligible agencies of the Federal government o Domestic or foreign   INDIVIDUALS ELIGIBLE TO BECOME PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS  Any individual with the skills, knowledge, and resources necessary to carry  out the proposed research is invited to work with their institution to  develop an application for support.

INTRODUCTION Since the Institute's founding in 1974, research has shed considerable light on aging and health. It is now known that aging itself is not the cause of disease, disability, and frailty. Rather, it is disease and disabling processes, influenced by age-related changes in the body and by unhealthy choices and sedentary lifestyles, that are the most important factors in compromising the quality of life for older people. This fundamental shift in thinking was reinforced most recently with insights from the National Long Term Care Survey (NLTCS). According to this study, the rate of disability among older Americans dramatically declined from the 1980s through the mid 1990s, even among people age 85 and older. These findings, along with evidence from a number of clinical trials and studies, suggest more strongly than ever that disease and disability can be delayed or even prevented through specific interventions.. The challenge now is to maintain and even accelerate the trend in declining disability and to reduce rates of disease amid a steep rise in the number and proportion of older people. The task is urgent. Demographic projections show that the U.S. population is beginning to age at a rapid pace, with the first baby boomers turning 65 in 2011. Between now and the year 2030, the number of individuals age 65 and older likely will double, reaching 70.3 million and comprising a larger proportion of the entire population, up from 13 percent today to 20 percent in 2030.1 Of great interest is the explosive growth anticipated among those most at risk of disease and disability, people age 85 and older. Their ranks are expected to grow from 4.3 million in 2000 to at least 19.4 million in Federal Interagency Forum on Aging Related Statistics. Older Americans 2000: Key Indicators of Well-Being. 2000. NIA-5 1   2050. The racial and ethnic makeup of the older population will change dramatically as well, creating a more diverse population of older Americans. These demographic factors combined threaten to increase the burden of age-related diseases and conditions on individuals, families, and society. Unless new understandings and interventions are developed and implemented to reduce disease and disability, the costs, in both human and financial terms, could be extraordinary. In the 20th century, health research and public health practices did much to extend life and improve health. At the start of this new millennium, the NIA's research portfolio is aimed primarily at increasing ""healthspan,"" or years of healthy active life expectancy. Aging research is well poised to build upon the work of recent years to improve the lives of older Americans and their families. Toward that end, NIA's overall program is wide-ranging and includes research on: the biochemical, genetic, and physiological mechanisms of aging in humans and animal models; the structure and function of the aging nervous system; social and behavioral aspects of aging processes and the place of older people in society; and the pathophysiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of age-related diseases, degenerative conditions, and disabilities. In close collaboration with the National Advisory Council on Aging and other public and private organizations, the NIA has developed a strategic plan for aging research, to identify goals for the years 20012005. These goals address scientific areas with the greatest promise for advancing knowledge, many outlined in this narrative. The NIA also recently completed a strategic plan on disparities in health status of older Americans of different racial and ethnic backgrounds. In this narrative, the Institute focuses on recent progress and future directions for research in four key areas: Section I) Alzheimer's disease and the neuroscience of aging; Section II) reducing disease and disability; Section III) the biology of aging; and Section IV) the behavioral and social aspects of growing older. In all of its efforts, the Institute is paying special attention to reducing health disparities among different groups of Americans (Section V). ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND THE NEUROSCIENCE OF AGING Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, currently irreversible brain disorder. People with AD gradually suffer memory loss and a decline in thinking abilities, as well as major personality changes. These losses in cognitive function are accompanied by pathologic changes in the brain, including the buildup of insoluble protein deposits called amyloid plaques and the development of neurofibrillary tangles, which are abnormal collections of twisted protein threads found inside nerve cells. Such changes result in death of brain cells and breakdown of the connections between them. AD advances gradually but inexorably, from early, mild forgetfulness to a severe loss of mental function called dementia. Eventually, people with AD become dependent on others for every aspect of their care. The risk of developing AD increases exponentially with age, but it is not a part of normal aging. AD is the most common cause of dementia among people age 65 and older and is a major public health issue for the United States because of its enormous impact on individuals, families, the health care system, and society as a whole. Scientists estimate that as many as 4 million people currently suffer with the disease, and annual costs associated with AD are estimated to exceed  NIA-6   $100 billion.2, 3 As the population ages, the numbers of people with AD and costs associated with increased prevalence could rise significantly. The following section on AD and related neuroscience describes recent advances in seven areas of AD research: early diagnosis, normal age-related cognitive change, the role of environmental factors in the development of AD, new animal models that may provide insights into the etiology of AD, preclinical studies of new preventive and therapeutic agents, clinical trials to test new therapies that may delay or prevent development of the disease, and studies related to easing caregivers' burdens. Early Diagnosis of AD Early diagnosis of AD benefits affected individuals and their families, clinicians, and researchers. For patients and their families, a definitive early diagnosis provides an opportunity to plan and to pursue options for treatment and care while the patient can still take an active role in decision-making. For clinicians, accurate early diagnosis facilitates the selection of appropriate treatments, particularly as new interventions are developed to stop or slow progression of symptoms. And for researchers, earlier and more accurate diagnosis may facilitate clinical studies of new therapies and preventive measures by allowing early intervention, before cognitive loss becomes significant. Research suggests that the earliest AD pathology may begin to develop in the brain 10 to 20 years before clinical symptoms yield a diagnosis. Scientists have made tremendous progress looking for ways to diagnose AD in its pre-symptomatic or pre-clinical stages. They are searching for reliable, valid, and easily attainable biological markers that can identify cases very early in the course of disease. Eventually, combinations of specific strategies to image the brain, along with genetic, clinical, and neuropsychological assessments may become the key to identifying people at very high risk of developing AD. Recently, researchers have made progress in several areas related to early diagnosis of AD: Tracking changes in brain metabolism. Investigators in several recent studies have identified specific metabolic changes in the brain that are characteristic of AD, and in one study have demonstrated that measuring patterns of brain metabolic changes can be used to diagnose AD with a high degree of accuracy. Tracking changes in brain structures. AD is associated with changes in many brain structures. Investigators have found that atrophy of the hippocampus, a part of the brain affected by AD, is a sensitive marker of AD-related pathologic damage and changes in cognitive function. MRI measurement of hippocampal volume may be useful for identifying  Small, G et al. Diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer disease and related disorders.

Imaging and evaluating AD's unique pathologic features. Researchers are developing new ways to view and track AD's characteristic amyloid plaques in the brain. In one study in mice, investigators developed a radioactive tracer that is attached to an antibody that binds to the plaques, enhancing the ability to image them. In another mouse study, researchers developed a dye-based compound that also binds to plaques, again facilitating imaging. Preliminary human studies using amyloid tracers have been described. These and other techniques may also provide effective methods of tracking early AD changes in brain as well as treatment effectiveness, particularly through imaging amyloid burden in the brain. Normal Age-Related Cognitive Change While most people remain alert and mentally able as they age, some age-related changes in memory, learning, and attention are normal. Improved characterization of normal cognitive function and underlying brain changes throughout life will help us distinguish normal from abnormal age-related cognitive changes. A better understanding of what is ""normal"" and what is not may aid the early diagnosis of AD; it could also alleviate the anxiety of people who observe modest but perceptible changes in cognitive function in themselves or a loved one and fear that such changes are the harbingers of a decline into dementia. Prevalence of cognitive impairment is high among a group of older communitydwelling individuals. Scientists are trying to determine the prevalence of cognitive impairment that is not dementia. Individuals with dementia are forgetfulness and have impairments in thinking, judgment, and the ability to perform daily activities. The condition called Mild Cognitive Impairment, or MCI, is not dementia, but it may be related to the eventual development of dementia and AD. Results from the first population-based study of cognitive impairment in the United States, composed of 2212 African-American residents of Indianapolis, Indiana, ages 65 and older, indicate that 23.4 percent of the communitydwelling participants and 19.2 percent of the nursing home residents had MCI. The prevalence of cognitive impairment grew significantly with age, with rates increasing by about 10 percent for every 10 years of age after age 65. MCI was almost five times more common in the community than dementia. In addition, the scientists found that 26 percent of those characterized with MCI at the start of the study went on to become demented only 18 months later, although 24 percent of participants who were first diagnosed with MCI appeared normal after 18 months. These results suggest that the condition may affect a significant proportion of older people. The factors that influence whether or not MCI will progress to dementia have not yet been defined. Whether the prevalence of cognitive impairment short of dementia in the Indianapolis group is any higher or lower than other population groups is unclear, although the results appear to be consistent with the few studies done so far in other countries. Neurons Know Where We're Going. Researchers are finding out the ways in which we spatially orient and maneuver ourselves in the environment. In a study of monkeys, they found that neurons in the brain's medial superior temporal area (MST) appear to encode information about direction of heading, path and place. These functions allow an individual to orient NIA-8   spatially in the environment. Since anatomical pathways from MST are associated with other brain areas that connect to the hippocampus (which is involved in AD pathogenesis), MST could play an important role in the spatial disorientation that is seen in AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. Environmental Factors and AD There is a great deal of interest in finding risk and preventative factors for age-related cognitive decline and AD. Of particular interest are those factors that are modifiable, because interventions that decrease the effect of a risk factor or facilitate a preventative factor could potentially delay the onset of the disease or prevent it altogether. Can Diet Affect Risk of AD and Dementia? Scientists increasingly believe that the answer to this question may be ""yes."" For example, researchers recently found that elevated blood levels of the amino acid homocysteine were associated with a significantly increased risk of AD. The association between homocysteine and AD was found to be strong and independent of other factors. Blood levels of homocysteine can be reduced by increasing intake of folic acid and vitamins B6 and B12; the use of these compounds is being explored in ongoing and planned clinical trials for the treatment and prevention of cognitive decline and AD. In fact, NIH investigators are elucidating the mechanisms by which folate deficiency and elevated homocysteine can influence risk of neurodegenerative disease. In a recent study, they found that folate deficiency renders neurons in the hippocampus, an area of the brain critical to learning and memory, vulnerable to degeneration in a mouse model of AD. Additional studies showed that homocysteine increases the vulnerability of neurons to being killed by amyloid beta-peptide, a toxic protein whose organization into plaques is a hallmark of the condition. In a mouse model of Parkinson's disease (PD), folate deficiency resulted in increased damage to specialized neurons in an area of the brain called the substantia nigra, worsening motor dysfunction as a result. When infused directly into either the substantia nigra or striatum, homocysteine promoted neuronal degeneration and motor dysfunction. The researchers also determined the mechanism through which homocysteine endangers neurons: It promotes oxidative stress (cellular damage caused by molecules generated during normal energy metabolism) and impairs the repair of damaged DNA, thereby triggering a form of programmed cell death called apoptosis. Active Lifestyle Generates New Neurons in Aged Brains. Human studies suggest that a mentally and physically active lifestyle gives some protection against developing dementia and neurodegenerative disorders, and a recent NIA-supported study suggests that this may be due to increased neurogenesis, or development of new neurons, in active individuals' brains. Investigators found that mice housed in an ""enriched"" environment (including exercise and play equipment) for up to 10 months showed a fivefold higher level of neurogenesis in the hippocampus (a brain area central to learning and memory) than mice housed in standard bare cages. ""Enriched"" mice also demonstrated improvements in learning, exploratory behavior, and motor activity, and showed fewer lipofuscin deposits, an age-related indicator of neural degeneration, in hippocampal neurons.  NIA-9   Diabetes, ApoEp4 and the Risk for Alzheimer's Disease. Researchers evaluated the connection between type 2 diabetes, dementia, and APOEp4 (the major AD susceptibility gene) in a large group of Japanese-American men. They found that participants with both type 2 diabetes and the APOE p4 allele had a risk for AD 5.5 times higher than those with neither risk factor. At autopsy, participants with type 2 diabetes and the p4 allele had a higher number of AD's characteristic amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the hippocampus, the region of the brain where AD is thought to start. They also had a higher incidence of amyloid deposition in the blood vessels in the brain. Further investigation is needed into the underlying pathology and effects of treatment of diabetes on the incidence of AD. Animal Models of Neurodegenerative Disease Animal models that mimic human disease are central to research for many reasons. Animals and humans share many genetic and physiologic features, so experimental results obtained in animals can frequently (although not always) be extrapolated to humans. It is much easier to create specific genetic mutations and observe their effects in animals than to search for them in humans, and because the lifespan of most animals is relatively short, it is easier to observe the effects of those mutations over several generations. A Tale of Two Proteins. Investigators engineered a fruit fly model that carried genes for human Hsp70 and alpha-synuclein, two proteins that when altered are implicated in the development of PD and other neurodegenerative diseases. Hsp70 is a chaperone protein, meaning that it aids in the proper folding of other proteins, and scientists are using this model to elucidate the roles of chaperone proteins in neurodegenerative diseases. Results to date suggest that finding ways to enhance and appropriately target chaperone proteins' activity may be an effective approach to treating neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and PD that are accompanied by altered protein conformation and aggregation. Prions, Misshapen Proteins, and Out-Of-Shape Brains. Prions are infectious proteins that transform a normal cellular protein (PrPC) into an abnormal virulent form (PrPSc) that accumulates in the central nervous system, producing fatal neurological disease characterized by sponge-like holes in the brain that result in movement, emotional, sleep, and cognitive disturbances. These and other neurodegenerative diseases, including AD, PD, and Huntington disease (HD), now are thought to be diseases of protein conformation in which a misfolded version of a normal cellular protein aggregates and causes neurodegeneration. Investigators have made a number of advances in our understanding of prion diseases. In the first study, researchers noted that, although chemically the same, PrPC and PrPSc differ in structure. A fragment of the mouse prion protein with a single alteration that causes Gertsmann-Strussler-Scheinker disease (a prion disease) can induce this disease in transgenic mice only if it is in the pathological form, indicating that prion proteins must exist in a particular structure to become infectious and produce neurodegeneration. The specificity of the prion structure may also limit transmission of prion diseases between different species: Researchers have demonstrated that breaching of the species barrier involves the generation of prions with different structural templates that slowly accumulate over multiple transmissions in recipients. In another study, investigators identified a neurodegenerative disorder that mimics the symptoms of HD, but lacks HD's characteristic NIA-10   genetic mutation. Instead, the disorder is associated with mutations in the prion protein gene. Finally, researchers have found that, in mice, specially engineered antibodies can inhibit interaction between PrPC and PrPSc, which is necessary to PrPSc replication. In cells treated with the most potent antibody, prion replication was halted and existing prions were rapidly cleared, suggesting that the antibody may cure established infection. Identification of Learning-Associated Genes in the Rat. The specific genes and proteins involved in the maintenance of long-term memory and learning remain largely unknown. NIH researchers recently trained rats in a maze, then used cDNA miroarrays  chips containing information from thousands of genes, which are electronically assessed and compared  to analyze the activity of genes known to be active in the hippocampus, a brain area central to learning and memory. They identified 18 known genes and 10 previously uncharacterized genes whose activity increased after the maze learning. These findings provide the groundwork for future, more focused research to elucidate the contribution of these genes in learning and memory processes. Pre-clinical Research There are currently no effective, generally useful treatments for AD -- i.e., a treatment that works on large numbers of patients, that maintains its effectiveness for a long period, that works in both early and late stages of the disease, that improves functioning of patients in activities of daily living as well as on sensitive neuropsychological measurements, and that has no serious side effects. In addition, none of the treatments presently approved for AD alter the progressive underlying pathology of the disease. One way to treat the disease successfully may be to interfere with early pathological changes in the brain, including the development of amyloid deposits and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. A number of promising approaches, many of them targeted at the reduction of amyloid plaques, are currently being developed and tested in various model systems. If these approaches prove safe and effective in animals, studies in humans could follow. Common Compounds May Be Effective Against Alzheimer's Disease. Recent research has suggested that use of several common, over-the-counter compounds may be associated with reduced risk of AD and dementia. For example, epidemiologic research indicates that there is a correlation between long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such ibuprofen and a reduced risk of developing AD. Several recent studies are consistent with the hypothesis that NSAIDs are effective against AD, in part through inhibition of inflammationpromoting cells within the central nervous system Clinical trials are necessary to test directly whether NSAIDs can prevent AD and dementia, and such trials are currently ongoing. Likewise, researchers are developing new ""antioxidant"" drugs that ameliorate or prevent cell damage or death caused by oxidative stress, a form of cell damage caused by molecules generated during normal energy metabolism. Oxidative stress is implicated in a number of diseases, including AD and PD, as well as in normal aging. Recently, investigators tested the activity of three new compounds in mice lacking one form of a key antioxidant enzyme; the researchers found that the drugs increased the lifespan of the diseased mice by up to 3-fold and prevented harmful pathological and behavioral changes. Continued research on such antioxidant  NIA-11   compounds may lead to new approaches to the treatment of AD, and perhaps other degenerative processes of aging. Beneficial Effects of an Anti-Diabetes Hormone on Metabolism and Brain Function. Investigators have found that GLP-1, a gut peptide hormone that is present in the blood and that has generated interest as a potential treatment for type 2 diabetes, may have beneficial effects on brain functions. In a recent study, GLP-1 and its long-acting analog, exendin-4, stimulated the growth of nerve cells in culture. Moreover, GLP-1 and exendin-4 protected neurons in culture and in the brains of adult rats against injury and death in experimental models relevant to the pathogenesis of stroke and AD. Both prevented the loss of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that plays a critical role in learning and memory, and which is depleted in AD. These studies suggest that GLP-1 and related peptides may be useful in reversing or halting the neurodegenerative processes that occur in disorders such as stroke and AD. Clinical Trials Today, the few FDA-approved drug treatments for AD maintain cognitive function in AD patients in only a subset of patients and for only a limited time. However, an estimated 30 compounds are presently or will soon be tested in human AD clinical trials. These studies are sponsored by a number of sources, including the NIA, other NIH institutes, and the private sector, primarily pharmaceutical companies. Compounds now under scrutiny focus on three major areas of treatment: short-term maintenance of cognitive function; slowing the progress of the disease, delaying AD's onset, or preventing the disease altogether; and managing behavioral problems associated with AD. Interest is currently focusing on compounds that directly target disease-related pathologies. A rapidly evolving research focus lies in prevention trials, and a number are underway to test the effectiveness of therapies in people without symptoms or who have only slight memory problems. Recruitment is now complete for the first NIH AD prevention trial, taking place at more than 70 sites across the U.S. This trial compares the effects of vitamin E and donepezil (brand name Aricept) in preventing the development of AD in people diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, a population at high risk for developing AD. Further examination of estrogen and studies of various classes of anti-inflammatory drugs and antioxidants are also ongoing, and as scientists test these currently available medications, the next generation of drugs is being developed, targeting specific abnormal cellular pathways uncovered by recent discoveries, including plaque and tangle formation and death of brain cells. Prevention trials are among the most costly of research projects, but, if successful, the payoff in terms of reduced disease and disability will be significant. Caregiving of AD Patients Most of the approximately 4 million Americans with AD today are cared for outside the institutional setting by an adult child or in-law, a spouse, another relative, or a friend. Caregivers frequently experience significant emotional stress, physical strain, and financial burdens, yet they often do not receive adequate support. Several recent studies have explored the problems faced by caregivers of AD patients, as well as possible interventions to reduce their burdens. NIA-12   Supporting Caregivers of Persons with Dementia. The National Institute on Aging's REACH Project (Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer's Caregiver Health), a large, multi-site intervention study aimed at family caregivers of AD patients, was designed to characterize and test promising interventions for enhancing family caregiving. Nine different social and behavioral interventions and two types of control conditions (usual care or minimal support) were tested at six different sites, and 1,222 culturally and ethnically diverse caregiver/patient pairs participated in the study. The investigators found that the combined effect of interventions alleviated caregiver burden, and that active treatments that enhanced caregiver behavioral skills reduced depression. The results also show that subgroups of caregivers benefit in different ways from the same interventions. Women caregivers, Hispanic caregivers, non-spouse caregivers, and those with high school or lower education benefited significantly more from active intervention when compared to similar individuals in control conditions. These results indicate that individualized, but tested, caregiver interventions and the means to deliver them are critically needed. The second phase of the study, REACH II, has combined elements of the diverse interventions tested in REACH into a single multi-component psychosocial behavioral intervention and is ongoing. Selected Future Research Directions in AD and the Neuroscience of Aging The NIA will continue to focus major efforts on two major areas of neuroscience research. The first is to characterize normal age-related changes in the nervous system, with its associated changes in function, and the other is to understand and treat the most common neurodegenerative disease of later life, AD, and related dementias. Trans-NIH initiatives are addressing these two areas. The Healthy Brain Initiative is a collaboration across Institutes to identify and understand factors impacting healthy brain aging. The AD Prevention Initiative is a similar trans-Institute collaboration with the ultimate intent of developing treatments to prevent the development of AD in susceptible individuals. Specific initiatives will be pursued to identify imaging and biological markers for prediction, diagnosis, and charting the progression of AD; to test new approaches for drug develoment for AD; and to understand how genetics, environment, and age-related changes in the brain affect the development of AD. Another important focus is the identification of risk factors for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. Since individuals with MCI are at a high risk of developing AD, it is critical for researchers to be able to define MCI and to differentiate it from normal cognitive aging and from AD. This is important not only in elucidating etiology and in targeting possible interventions, but also in understanding what the conversion rates from MCI to AD are in the general population and how this will impact the numbers of people with cognitive impairment and AD in the future. REDUCING DISEASE AND DISABILITY Chronic disease and disability can compromise the quality of life for older people. Some 79 percent of people age 70 and older have at least one of seven potentially disabling chronic conditions (arthritis, hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, respiratory diseases, stroke, and  NIA-13   cancer).4 The burden of such chronic conditions poses a challenge to individuals as well as families, employers, and the health care system. Research to improve understanding of the risk and protective factors for chronic disease and disability can lead to the development of effective prevention strategies. This section describes some of the latest findings on the treatment and prevention of various age-related diseases, as well as the molecular underpinnings of disease. Treatment and Prevention of Disease Treatment of any specific disease in older people can be complicated by the presence of other diseases and disorders and by the concomitant use of multiple medications to treat various conditions. Potential interactions of medications, including those of prescribed drugs with overthe-counter drugs and dietary supplements, represent additional concerns. Moreover, adherence to treatment regimens can be difficult, as older patients often must maintain a complex schedule for taking several different medications. Research is ongoing to determine the best treatment approaches for older patients, particularly those with concurrent medical conditions, and to identify strategies for improving adherence and minimizing potentially adverse effects of medications. Beneficial Effects of an Anti-diabetes Hormone on Metabolism. New studies show that GLP1, a gut peptide hormone that is present in the blood and that induces secretion of insulin from the pancreas, has beneficial effects on cellular absorption of glucose among people with insulin resistance, a prediabetic condition. In one study, GLP-1 increased glucose uptake among insulinresistant people over age 70 in whom insulin secretion had been artificially suppressed. The investigators also found that, in young people who were severely insulin resistant due to obesity, administration of GLP-1 brought their glucose uptake capability into line with that of their lean counterparts. Bisphosphonates May Combat Glucocorticoid-Induced Bone Loss. Glucocorticoids, often used to treat a variety of conditions that arise in the elderly, also cause a rapid and marked decrease in bone mineral density, making a population that is already susceptible to osteoporosis even more subject to bone loss. Common treatments for osteoporosis, such as calcium, vitamin D, or fluoride, are not very effective against glucocorticoid-induced bone loss. However, a class of drugs known as bisphosphonates shows promise. Now, NIH-supported researchers have dissected the individual actions and the interactions of glucocorticoids and bisphosphonates on bone. This work demonstrates that each of these drugs tips the balance between bone formation and bone resorption in mice in both an early and later phase. The early phase of bone resorption caused by glucocorticoids cannot be counteracted by bisphosphonates, but in the longer term this balance shifts as bone-resorbing cells die and the lifespan of bone-building cells is extended due to bisphosphonate treatment. Understanding how bisphosphonates work has direct implications on the treatment of osteoporosis, a common condition among older Americans, and other diseases and conditions involving bone loss.

NIA-14  4   Structured Restorative Home Care Produces Better Health and Function After Acute Illness and/or Hospitalization in Older Persons. Illness and hospitalization often initiate functional decline in older persons, and this decline can often persist long after the acute episode is over. An increasing number of older persons receive home care services after such episodes. In a recent NIA-supported study, patients on a ""restorative care program"" were significantly less likely to need rehospitalization, nursing home placement, or emergency room care after hospitalization as compared to people receiving ""usual"" home care. The restorative home care program consisted of the establishment of integrated teams of nurses and other health professionals and the application of structured interventions for disabilities, including exercises, behavioral changes, environmental adjustments and adaptive equipment, medication adjustments, and patient and family education. Functional abilities for living at home such as preparing meals, using transportation, shopping, doing laundry, and taking medicines appropriately were also significantly better in the restorative care group, as was mobility. Benefits and Costs of Cervical Cancer Screening into Old Age. Although mortality rates for cervical cancer have declined substantially because of widespread use of Papanicolaou (Pap) screening, the test may fail to detect cancer. An increased understanding of the role of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in the development of cervical cancer and advances in technologies for HPV detection have prompted exploration of HPV testing as an adjunct or primary screening tool. As with many common conditions, a critical public health issue regarding HPV screening is the cost-effectiveness of screening persons of all ages versus setting an upper age limit for screening. Researchers constructed a model based on U.S. cervical cancer incidence, current screening rates, accuracy of diagnostic tests, and effectiveness of treatment, to examine the cost-benefit ratios of different population screening strategies every two years or every three years -- joint Pap and HPV testing, Pap testing alone, and HPV testing alone. The benefits of screening were measured by the gains in years of survival adjusted for the absence or presence, and severity, of cervical cancer. This model was used to estimate cost-benefits of the different strategies for women beginning at age 20 and continuing to either age 65, to age 75 years, or death. They found that the greatest benefits of screening came from combined Pap and HPV testing every two years through death, with only a modest increase in cost above Pap screening alone. 98 percent of the benefits were retained if an upper age limit of 75 was set for screening. However, the proportion of the benefits retained was substantially lower (87 percent) if the upper age limit was set at 65. Age Does Not Influence the Response to Resistive Strength Training. Loss of muscular strength and muscle mass with age (termed sarcopenia) is associated with the development of disability and frailty in the elderly. Men and women in two age groups  20-30 and 65-75  participated in a resistive strength training program. Both age groups increased strength, and showed similar increases in muscle mass. In addition, both age groups showed similar increases in resting metabolic rates, which generally decrease with age. A Drug to Improve Bone Marrow Transplant Success. In an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT), in which the recipient receives bone marrow from a donor, the recipient must be given drugs that suppress the immune system in order to prevent the body from rejecting the transplant. Immunosuppressive drugs commonly used with BMT patients include Cyclosporin A NIA-15   (CsA) and FK506, which are also used to treat a number of autoimmune diseases. However, these drugs have a limited success rate; the body resists their activity through a specific molecular pathway. NIH researchers have demonstrated recently that the immunosuppressive drug rapamycin, an antibiotic, blocks this pathway, suggesting that the success of immunosuppressive therapy in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and autoimmune disorders could be improved by combination treatment with CsA/FK506 and rapamycin. Lifestyle Change and Medication Can Prevent Type 2 Diabetes, but Efficacy of These Interventions May Vary by Age. NIA-supported researchers participated in the Diabetes Prevention Program, a major, multi-institutional study that was initiated by the National Institute on Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and was designed to identify interventions that could prevent or delay the development of type 2 diabetes. The researchers found that people who are at high risk for diabetes can sharply reduce their risk by adopting a low-fat diet and moderate exercise regimen. This effect was most pronounced among study participants age 60 and over. Treatment with the drug metformin (Glucophage) also reduced diabetes risk among study participants, but for unknown reasons was less effective among older participants. Nearly half of the study participants were members of racial and ethnic groups that suffer disproportionately from type 2 diabetes, including African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and American Indians. Molecular Understanding of Disease Processes Old Immune Systems are Less Responsive to New Infections. The immune system becomes less effective as we age, and this loss of function contributes to illness and death in the elderly. B cells, or specialized white blood cells that produce antibodies against invading pathogens, are critical to the immune response, but their role in the aging immune system is not yet well understood. Researchers have observed that subsets of B cells respond to each new infection by producing antibodies that react specifically to the infectious agent. These ""experienced"" B cells are then highly effective at responding to re-encounter with the original infectious agent, but are less able to respond to new infections. The body also produces ""nave"" B cells that are capable of tailoring their response to new infections, but as people age, fewer new B cells are produced. In a recent study, NIH-supported investigators closely examined B cells in young and elderly mice and found that the aged mice have much higher levels of experienced, as opposed to nave, B cells when compared to younger mice. They suggest that the experienced B cells are retained in the body as a result of chronic stimulation from the environment. This is correlated with a decline in generation of new B cells in the bone marrow, with the consequence that the overall immune response is less effective for new infections. Lipid Abnormalities Linked to Lou Gehrig's Disease. NIH investigators have identified severe abnormalities in the metabolism of cholesterol and of sphingolipids, a type of fat, in the spinal cords of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease) patients and in mice that have been genetically engineered to manifest symptoms of ALS. These abnormalities result in the production of increased levels of sphingolipid byproducts and accumulation of cholesterol which prove toxic to motor neurons at high levels. In mice, the appearance of metabolic abnormalities precedes the development of symptoms, suggesting that the abnormalities have a role in killing the neurons. The researchers also found that drugs that rein in sphingolipid synthesis can prevent the accumulation of toxic byproducts and thereby protect motor neurons NIA-16   from damage. The ability of a drug that prevents accumulation of sphingolipids and their byproducts to protect motor neurons suggests that this and related drugs, as well as modifications of dietary intake of fats, may reduce the risk of ALS. BIOLOGY OF AGING Aging is accompanied by gradual changes in most body systems. Research on the biology of aging focuses on understanding the cellular and molecular processes underlying these changes as well as those accompanying the onset of age-related diseases. As scientists learn more about these processes, experiments can be designed to understand when and how pathological changes begin, providing important clues toward developing interventions to prevent or treat disease. A great deal has been learned about structural and functional changes that occur in different body systems. Research has expanded our knowledge, too, of the biologic factors associated with extended longevity in humans and animal models. Public Release of Novel Full-length Mouse cDNA Clone Collections. Arrays of DNA for specific genes permit the comparison of tens of thousands of genes at one time to determine which are turned on or off in a particular cell or condition. The NIA has assembled a collection of 7409 unique genes called the NIA mouse 7.4K cDNA clone set, which includes genes from various mouse stem cell lines, mouse early embryos, and mouse newborn organs. This set complements the existing NIA mouse 15K cDNA clone set, which has achieved international recognition as a unique and widely used resource. Like the 15K set, the 7.4K has been shipped to academic distribution centers for further replication and distribution throughout the research community. NIA scientists hope the immediate release of this additional high-quality DNA clone set to the scientific community will foster institutional collaboration and sharing of resources and speed the analysis of changes in the expression of many genes during aging processes. A New Mouse Model of Accelerated Aging Provides Insights Into the Aging Process. NIAsupported investigators recently created a transgenic mouse carrying a mutation in the Xpd gene, which codes for an enzyme involved in both repair of DNA damage and transcription of DNA into RNA (an important first step in gene activation). This new model appears normal at birth but ages rapidly and lives only about half as long as normal mice. While not an exact model of premature aging, the new mouse model will be useful for studying a number of aspects of aging, including the roles of DNA damage and cell death, as well as the mechanisms through which the genome maintains itself and how such maintenance contributes to longevity. Role of Telomeres in Cellular Senescence. Human cells have an inborn ""counting mechanism"" that tells them when to senesce, or stop dividing: Each time a cell replicates, the ends of each chromosome, called telomeres, get shorter, and once the telomeres get too short, they trigger a ""senescence program"" that arrests the cell's growth. Loss of telomere function can lead to genetic instability. Recent findings suggest that the senescence program is triggered by changes in the ""protection state"" of critically shortened telomeres, rather than their length -- in other words, the cell detects the likelihood that a shortened telomere will lead to genomic instability, regardless of the length of the telomere itself, and stops dividing as a result. Other findings suggest that the shortest telomeres in a cell become unstable and unleash the senescence program in order to avoid the propagation of genetically unstable cells. NIA-17   Genetic Influences in Human Longevity. Researchers are beginning to identify biological and genetic mechanisms that might explain exceptional longevity. Using data from a study of families in which at least one member lived to be 100 or older, researchers recently found that siblings of centenarians had about half the risk of dying at every age throughout their lives compared with people who did not have a centenarian sibling, and that brothers of centenarians were at least 17 times more likely to reach the age of 100 themselves and sisters were at least 8 times more likely to live at least a century. These findings are supported by research indicating that excess longevity (the difference between observed and expected length of life) is 15 percent heritable, and that the longevity of both siblings and more distant relatives may be predictive of one's own lifespan. Together, these findings point to strong underlying genetic components of longevity and provide an approach to mapping and identifying specific genes that may play a role in determining human longevity. New Insights Into Premature Aging Syndromes. Cockayne Syndrome-B and Werner Syndrome are devastating genetic disorders that cause accelerated and premature aging in affected individuals. The disorders are caused by mutations in the CSB and WRN genes, respectively. NIH researchers continue to elucidate the mechanisms through which the CSB and WRN genes operate, and have found that each gene is involved in DNA clean-up and repair. Recently, they found that the protein associated with the CSB gene has a role in repair of DNA damage caused by oxidative stress (cellular damage caused by molecules generated during normal energy metabolism). The protein associated with the WRN gene facilitates the activity of another protein, FEN-1, which is critical to DNA replication and repair. In fact, WRN stimulates FEN-1 more dramatically and efficiently than any other known protein. WRN also interacts with the tumor suppressor p53. The researchers conclude that mutations in the WRN gene may lead to premature aging and cancer susceptibility through dysfunction of the coordinated action of WRN protein, p53, and FEN-1 in a complex DNA repair process. These findings may suggest potential target molecules for the treatment of Werner Syndrome and Cockayne Syndrome-B, or even regulation of the aging process. Nitric Oxide Controls the Strength of the Heart Beat. The heart is the body's most powerful muscle; its fibers stretch and contract to form the heartbeat. During periods of stress, including physical exercise, blood is pumped more rapidly throughout the body, and heart muscle stretch increases in response. Stretch also affects contraction strength; when heart muscle fibers stretch, calcium ions, which regulate contraction, are released from a part of the fiber called the sarcoplasmic reticuluum (SR). The efficiency of this process is critical to the quality of life during periods of good health, as well as during periods of disease. NIH researchers have found that heart muscle stretch activates a particular pathway that generates nitric oxide (NO). NO, in turn, enhances the fibers' capacity to release calcium ions from the SR. When the stretch is increased, as in periods of physical exertion, NO release is increased, strengthening the contraction. This mechanism could determine an important part of intrinsic cardiac reserve capacity. In addition, the researchers hypothesize that the loss of naturally occurring NO mechanisms in the body could contribute to the development of functional impairments of heart muscle when other compensatory mechanisms fail.  NIA-18   Extending the Lifespan In order to understand the aging process, it is important to identify those factors that affect the overall life span of an organism. Understanding the responsible physiological mechanisms and, further, identifying ways to slow down age-related changes are important. Beyond any gains in life span, studies in this area are aimed more importantly at developing interventions to keep older people healthy and free of disease and/or disability as long as possible. Experiments in a number of animal models are providing valuable insights into the mechanisms of longevity. A Pharmacological Intervention to Delay Aging in Fruit Flies. Using animal models, researchers are identifying possible pharmacological interventions that might be useful in delaying aging in humans. In a recent study, fruit flies fed the chemical 4-phenylbutyrate (PBA) throughout adulthood lived significantly longer than average, with no negative effects on physical activity, stress resistance, or fertility. The investigators found that two genes that became overactive in response to PBA treatment code for specific proteins that could have an impact on longevity; thus, these results also suggest a new approach in the search for genes that may play a role in longevity regulation. More research is needed to determine whether PBA treatment of other animals also affects their longevity. The Promise of Stem Cell Research Human pluripotent stem cells  that is, cells that are capable of dividing extensively and of giving rise to most tissues of an organism  hold enormous potential for cell replacement or tissue repair therapy in many degenerative diseases of aging. For disorders affecting the nervous system, such as AD and PD, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and spinal cord and brain injury, transplantation of neural cell types derived from human pluripotent stem cells offers the potential of replacing cells lost in these conditions and of recovery of function. Human pluripotent stem cells can also provide a model for studying fundamental molecular and cellular processes important in understanding aging and age-related diseases. Another type of stem cell, multipotent or ""adult"" stem cells, are committed to producing cells that have a particular function. For example, stem cells circulating in the blood give rise to red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets, but not bone cells or liver cells. Until recently, there was little evidence in mammals that multipotent cells could ""change course"" and produce cells of a different type. However, recent findings suggest that under certain conditions, some adult stem cells previously thought to be committed to the development of one line of specialized cells are able to develop into other types of specialized cells. Neural stem cells are of particular interest to the study of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases of aging. Through several recent studies, we have found that environmental cues, which vary among brain subregions, may determine the fate of a stem cell, that neurogenesis may require the cooperation of multiple protein factors, and that neural stem-like cells taken from post-mortem brain tissue can form neurons. Together, these studies continue to show the potential of adult-derived neural stem cells to make different kinds of brain cells. Adult Neural Stem Cells Make Functional Neurons. The generation of new functional neurons from neural stem cells (neurogenesis), either from those present in the brain or from NIA-19   those transplanted into the brain, could be harnessed to regenerate damaged brain tissue, to replace dying neurons, or to enhance the ability of the brain to respond to age-related impairments. Adult neurogenesis occurs in the hippocampus, a brain region important for learning and memory, which shows degenerative changes in aging and AD. Although the new cells resemble mature neurons, until recently it was unclear whether the new neurons are functional or integrate into existing neural circuits. Two studies now show that neural stem cells in the adult hippocampus develop essential properties of functional neurons. In the first study, investigators labeled stem cells in the hippocampus of adult mice by tagging them with a protein called GFP. When the hippocampus was examined 2 days after the injection, the GFP-labeled cells looked like immature neurons, whereas by one month the GFP-labeled cells looked and behaved like authentic hippocampal granule neurons. Close examination showed that the new neurons had properties similar to their mature neighbors, and that they received input from other cells. In the second study, researchers isolated stem cells from the hippocampus of adult rat brain and then tagged the cells with the GFP protein. When these tagged stem cells were cultured along with normal hippocampal neurons or astrocytes, support cells that foster neuron growth, they formed neurons with axons and dendrites, which are structures critical for communication with other cells. In fact, these stem cell-derived neurons made functional connections, called synapses, with normal hippocampal neurons and with each other, and released neurotransmitters, the chemical mediators of neuronal communication. Isolation of Neuron-Restricted Precursor Cells from Human Embryonic Stem Cells. Cells in the brain and central nervous system differentiate through a multi-step process. As development progresses, stem cells  cells with a unique capacity to regenerate and give rise to many tissue types  generate a class of cells known as precursors or progenitors, which in turn generate the highly specialized cells of the brain and nervous system. Scientists now have the ability to isolate human embryonic stem (hES) cells, and have found that hES cells proliferate and maintain their pluripotency (ability to give rise to different tissue types) in cell culture5. NIH researchers have recently developed a method for inducing hES cells to differentiate into neural progenitor cells and neurons. The newly-derived cells exhibit the appearance and properties of cells ordinarily found in the brain and central nervous system. These data indicate that hES cells could provide a source for neural progenitor cells and mature neurons for therapeutic and toxicological uses. Selected Future Research Directions in the Biology of Aging The Aging Intervention Testing Program. In 2002, the NIA issued a Request for Applications (RFA) for the Aging Intervention Testing Program, a large-scale initiative to test potential intervention strategies that may slow the rate of aging in animal models. It is anticipated that positive results could be followed up with clinical trials to establish safety and efficacy in humans. A secondary goal is to identify interventions that are not safe or are not effective; such knowledge would be highly relevant in assessing appropriate candidates for clinical trials.

NIA-20 5   BEHAVIORAL AND SOCIAL RESEARCH Behavioral and lifestyle factors have a profound impact on health throughout the life span. Older adults can help to prevent disease and disability and improve their quality of life through healthy behaviors such as proper nutrition, exercise, use of preventive health care, and avoiding smoking and alcohol abuse. Several particularly encouraging studies have shown that disability rates are declining, and NIA research is focusing on ways to sustain and even accelerate the decline in disability, including the use of behavioral interventions and the health care system by older people. In addition, important research efforts, such as the national Health and Retirement Study, continue to collect and analyze demographic data that inform public policy and planning for the health, economic, and social needs of a growing older population. Potential Impact of Attitudes on Health and Behavior Emotional state has been associated with health and functional status in old age. Both positive and negative attitudes or emotions can influence health and physical and cognitive function. Personality and Risky Behaviors. A recent study examined relationships between a comprehensive measure of personality, the Revised NEO Personality Inventory, and condom use and other HIV risk behaviors. Participants consisted of 201 disadvantaged, primarily AfricanAmerican participants of an HIV risk reduction program. Participants were divided into three risk groups (high, medium, and low risk) based on their self-reported sexual history, sexual behaviors, and intravenous drug use with shared needles. Results indicated that high-risk behavior was associated with emotional distress, poor self-control, and hostile and antagonistic attitudes and behaviors. The high-risk group demonstrated less ability to resist cravings and urges than the medium- and low-risk groups. The high-risk group also scored lower on measures of feelings of self-efficacy, motivation to carry tasks through to completion, and aspiration levels. All participants, regardless of risk classification, scored within the average range on measures of excitement-seeking. These results suggest that individuals who engage in high-risk sexual behaviors are motivated less from a desire for ""thrills"" than for temporary relief from psychological suffering. Successful intervention in these AIDS-related behaviors may require interventions tailored to at-risk individuals' basic tendencies. Story of Discovery: Disability Rates Continue to Decline Among American Elders When scientists assess disability in the population, they may look at a number of factors. One is the extent to which individuals can conduct basic activities of daily living such as eating, dressing, or bathing or participate in routine care activities such as everyday household chores or managing money. Scientists also track the extent to which cognitive disabilities such as memory loss are present in the population. The 1999 National Long Term Care Survey (NLTCS), the latest of a series of surveys of the elderly population (particularly those who are functionally impaired), continues to document a dramatic decline in the overall prevalence of physical disability among older Americans over the past two decades. While 26.2 percent of the elderly were assessed as disabled in 1982, this figure dropped to 19.7 percent in 1999. Of particularly note is the reduction in disability rates among African Americans during the 1990s, reversing trends from the 80s. Results from the 1999 NLTCS also indicate the possibility that rates of severe cognitive impairments may also be declining, with 900,000 fewer cases in 1999 than expected based on the 1982 rates  a decline in prevalence from  NIA-21   5.2 to 2.7 percent. The finding that cognitive disability may be declining is supported by evidence from the Health and Retirement Study, a major national study of the lives of older Americans. In this study, declines were especially large among those with less than a high school education and those ages 80 and older. These findings are potentially of great significance in identifying and addressing causes of disability, as well as informing national health care policy. Declining rates of chronic disability may also moderate the burden of caregiving, including the informal care provided within families, the care provided through home health services, and the care provided in long-term care institutions. Most importantly, they indicate that elderly Americans are more likely than ever to enjoy the robust health and independence that characterize a life free of chronic physical or cognitive disability.  HEALTH DISPARITIES The health status of racial and ethnic minority groups in the U.S. has improved steadily over the last century. Despite such progress, disturbing disparities in health persist between majority and minority populations. For example, the average life expectancy for a white infant born in 1999 is 77.3 years, but is only 71.4 years for an African American infant.6 Demographic projections predict a substantial change in the racial and ethnic makeup of the older population, heightening the need to examine and reduce differences in health and life expectancy. Research to date has shown that health disparities are associated with a broad, complex, and interrelated array of factors. Disease risk, diagnosis, progression, response to treatment, caregiving, access to care, and overall quality of life each may be affected by variables such as race, ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status, age, education, occupation, country of origin, and possibly other lifetime and lifestyle differences. The NIA is committed to addressing health disparities through its research programs. For example, Satellite Diagnostic and Treatment Centers, part of the national Alzheimer's Disease Centers (ADC) Program, have successfully recruited African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, and American Indian/Alaska Natives to AD prevention and treatment studies. Researchers on the NIA's Religious Orders Study have made a major effort to enroll African American members of the Catholic clergy; the nature of the study population enables the etiology and pathology of AD to be established among individuals with similar educations, occupations, socioeconomic status, and lifestyles. Five ADCs received funding in 2000 and 2001 specifically to encourage minority-related research, and in 2001 half of the NIA Director's Reserve funds, which encourage collaborative research projects, were allocated to minorityfocused research. In addition, the NIA recently completed a year-long review of these issues and developed a comprehensive strategic plan to address health disparities in the older population. Water, Race, and Health. During the early 1900s, the United States began to notice a dramatic decrease in mortality rates from infectious diseases. The tremendous decline in infectious disease prevalence was due primarily to increased sanitation and hygienic practices that were implemented at the community level. For instance, the advent of waste disposal services had a profound impact on declines among certain population groups, as did water purification measures. However, most sanitation services were reserved for affluent communities, which  6  National Center for Health Statistics. National Vital Statistics Report 50 (March 21, 2002), pp. 33-34. NIA-22   consequently resulted in health disparities between social classes. Given the demographic profile in the United States, these disparities were particularly apparent between different immigrant and racial groups. An NIH-supported researcher investigated the claim that public water companies provided black communities with better service than private water companies. The research drew from three independent sources of econometric evidence: 1) an analysis of typhoid fever rates in crosssections of American cities in 1911 and 1921; 2) an analysis of waterborne disease rates in a panel of fourteen North Carolina towns between 1889 and 1908; and 3) an analysis of investment patterns in cities with public and private water companies. A case study of New Orleans, which municipalized its water system in 1908, complements the statistical evidence. All of these sources indicate public ownership reduced white disease rates only slightly, but reduced black disease rates sharply. This research both underscores the importance of public health in reducing mortality and shows how public health innovations can be used as a mechanism to reduce health disparities. Medical Care and Racial Disparities in Survival After a Heart Attack. In a study of Medicare beneficiaries ages 66 to 74 who were admitted to a U.S. hospital due to a heart attack, NIH-supported researchers found that the black patients did not live as long after discharge from the hospital as white patients. Much of this disparity could be explained by the lower rate among black patients in the use of cardiac procedures such as revascularization (one of several surgical procedures to reestablish blood flow to part of the heart) and implantable cardioverter defibrillators (devices that regulate heartbeat). This result suggests that expanded use of effective procedures in black patients would substantially reduce racial differences in long-term survival, and that racial disparities in lifespan following a heart attack could be reduced if systematic medical procedures were employed. Selected Future Research Directions in Health Disparities Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Lifespan (HANDLS). The need to understand the driving factors behind persistent black-white health disparities in overall longevity, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease has led to the development of the HANDLS study, a community-based research effort designed to focus on evaluating health disparities in socioeconomically diverse African-Americans and Whites in Baltimore. This study is unique because it is a multidisciplinary project that will assess physical parameters as well as evaluating genetic, demographic, psychosocial, and psychophysiological parameters over a 20-year period. It will also employ novel research tools, mobile medical research vehicles to improve participation rates and retention among non-traditional research participants. HANDLS will investigate the longitudinal effects of socioeconomic status and race on the development of cerebrovascular disease and cardiovascular disease; changes in psychophysiology, cognitive performance, strength and physical functioning, health services utilization, and nutrition, and their influences on one another and on the development of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and cognitive decline. Selecting a cohort that spans ages 30-64 at baseline enhances the opportunities to gain insights into minority aging and the development of age-related disease over the planned 20 years of this study.  NIA-23   CONCLUSION: Meeting New Challenges through Aging Research As our population rapidly grows older, it is ever more urgent that we find effective ways to address the often devastating diseases and conditions associated with advanced age. Since the NIA's founding in 1974, groundwork has been laid for today's important advances in understanding basic aging, preventing disease and disability, including AD, and defining special social and behavioral issues for older individuals, their families and caregivers, and clinicians. The latest studies provide additional basic understandings as well as improved interventions to treat and even prevent some of the more devastating and disabling aspects of aging. With such research continued and intensified, we can move forward in meeting the promise of extended life by improving the health and well being of older people in America.  Budget Policy The Fiscal Year 2004 budget request for the NIA is $994,411,000 including AIDS, an increase of $36,785,000 and 3.8 percent over the FY 2003 amended President's Budget Request. A five year history of FTEs and Funding Levels for NIA are shown in the graphs below. Note that Fiscal Years 2001 and 2000 FTEs are not comparable for the NIH Human Resources functional consolidation.

Support for RPGs allows NIH to sustain the scientific momentum of investigator-initiated research while providing new research opportunities. In FY 2004, NIA will provide an aggregate average cost increase of 2.6 percent for Research Project Grants. Also in FY 2004, NIA will fully fund 13 grants. NIA continues to support funding of AREA awards. Promises for advancement in medical research are dependent on maintaining the supply of new investigators with new ideas. In the Fiscal Year 2004 request, NIA will support 571 pre- and postdoctoral trainees in full-time training positions, the same number as in FY 2003. Stipend levels for NRSA trainees will increase by 4 percent over Fiscal Year 2003 levels for predoctoral fellows, and from 4-1 percent, based on years of experience, for postdoctoral fellows. The Fiscal Year 2004 request includes funding for 67 research centers, 213 other research grants, including 181 clinical career awards, and 101 R&D contracts. Intramural Research receives a 3% increase and Research Management and Support receive a 1.8 percent increase over FY 2003.

These actions discussed below are contingent on inclusion of similar language and funding in the final FY 2003 appropriation and related reports. Additional items may be transmitted at a later date as a result of the final Conference report. Item Alzheimer's disease research  The Committee urges the NIA to expand its investment in Alzheimer's disease research, focusing especially on its pathology, the identification of risk factors, more effective treatments, and large-scale clinical trials. In addition, advances in genetics and imaging now make it possible to study Alzheimer's in ways that were never before possible. The Committee encourages the NIA to apply this new knowledge to ongoing longitudinal studies. (Page 126) Action taken or to be taken In 1999, at the direction of Congress, the NIA, in conjunction with the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), and the National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR), embarked on the Alzheimer's Disease Prevention Initiative, which encompasses a number of interrelated efforts including basic, epidemiological, behavioral, and clinical research. To identify targets for prevention efforts, basic research on Alzheimer's disease (AD) illuminates the mechanisms underlying disease pathology and determines the stages at which intervention might slow progression of dementia, delay onset of symptoms, or eventually prevent the disease. Expanded investment in basic research is identifying potential biomarkers (indicators of biological changes with age) that can aid in diagnosis and in understanding the progression of AD. New findings from basic research are also enabling analyses of disease progress and assessment of treatments in tissue culture and animal models. Epidemiological research on populations suggests genetic and environmental protective and risk factors for the disease and has led to new trials of anti-inflammatory drugs and other agents, such as statins, to treat or prevent AD. Recently funded epidemiological studies also include genetic analyses and neuroimaging components. Expanding clinical trials, and in particular prevention trials, is another critical objective of the Alzheimer's Disease Prevention Initiative. Until recently, clinical trials have only studied persons who already have clinically detectable mild to moderate AD. While NIA is continuing to evaluate treatments for the cognitive and behavioral symptoms of AD, it is also going beyond treatment to initiate studies on prevention strategies. Under the auspices of the Alzheimer's Disease Prevention Initiative, substances are now being tested on individuals who are at high risk for developing AD in order to prevent or delay the onset of clinical disease.   Item Early detection of Alzheimer's disease  The Committee also urges the NIA to focus on early detection of Alzheimer's disease so that clinical interventions to slow or stop the progression of the disease may be undertaken. The Committee notes that positron emission tomography (PET) may identify Alzheimer's disease at an early stage and encourages the NIA, in collaboration with the NINDS and the NIMH, to expand its research efforts into early diagnosis of Alzheimer's using PET and other brain imaging methods. (Page 126) Action taken or to be taken Neuroimaging studies are continuing to assess whether it is possible to measure aspects of brain function and/or structure that will identify those individuals who are at-risk for AD years before they develop the symptoms of the disease. As possible treatments for AD become more promising, diagnosing the disease at its earliest stages has become increasingly important, and a reliable biological marker of disease progression would also be useful for monitoring treatment response. A number of recently published brain imaging studies have reported results that hold promise for using regional changes on PET and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans as early markers for disease. Progress is being made in understanding the earliest brain changes that occur in the transitions from normal cognition to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and from MCI to AD, but more research is needed before we know whether and how imaging methods such as MRI and PET can be used most effectively and efficiently in the identification of early presymptomatic changes leading to AD. Therefore, NIA is expanding its focus on early, presymptomatic diagnosis. The NIA, in conjunction with other NIH Institutes such as NIMH and NINDS, is also developing an Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. This is being planned as a partnership among the NIA/NIH, academic investigators, the pharmaceutical industry, and the imaging equipment industry, with participation from the Alzheimer's Association and the Institute for the Study of Aging. This proposed longitudinal, multi-site study will include older cognitively normal individuals, people with MCI, and people with early AD. The overall study will be of 5 years duration, and will follow subjects over 3 years to collect serial MRI scans and serial PET scans, clinical and neuropsychological information, and biological fluids and cells for other potential biomarkers. An important aspect of this initiative is that the clinical, imaging, and biological data and samples will be made available to all qualified scientific investigators from both the public and private sectors; there will be no intellectual property claims attached to the data generated from this initiative. Results from this initiative will help to provide information that will allow early identification of those who may benefit from emerging preventative and treatment medications. The data gathered will also help to determine whether neuroimaging outcomes may serve as surrogate endpoints in AD clinical trials, information critically needed to facilitate the development and testing of new drugs for the treatment and prevention of AD. Item Cardiovascular aging research  Cardiovascular diseases remain America's leading causes of death of older men and women and a significant cause of disability. The Committee urges the NIA to make cardiovascular research a priority. (Page 127)   Action taken or to be taken In FY 2002, NIA grantees further characterized a second and distinct type of heart failure (diastolic heart failure) - a progressively debilitating condition common among older people. The new information will help physicians better understand this form of heart failure, and suggests that additional research be undertaken to see if diastolic heart failure is as amenable to treatment as the more well-recognized form of the disease. NIA began support for two basic research projects on adult stem cells and heart disease in FY 2002. NIA is also continuing support for a clinical trial on B-vitamin supplementation and progression of atherosclerosis in healthy older persons. Important research continues on establishing links between high blood pressure, coronary heart disease, and coronary artery bypass surgery with brain changes, including changes in mental capacity. Using state-of-the-art technology, NIA's intramural research program continues to lead the NIH in determining the importance of age-related blood vessel stiffening on the development of cardiovascular disease in minority populations, including novel treatments for blood vessel stiffening. NIA also continues to facilitate the development of promising new investigators in aging research through its annual small grants program and also remains committed to fostering research training and career development of new investigators in the cardiovascular aging field. Item Claude D. Pepper Older American Independence Centers  The Committee continues to strongly support these successful centers, which focus on developing innovative and cost effective ways to enhance the independence of older Americans. The centers also play the critical role of developing top level experts in geriatrics. The Committee strongly urges the NIA to make all possible efforts to expand these centers to include a school of nursing. (Page 127) Action taken or to be taken NIA continues to value this important program and in FY 2002 has funded two applications that were judged to be of high quality; an additional high quality application will be funded in FY 2003. The most recently reviewed applications were in response to a RFA for Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Centers (OAICs) that was open to applications from schools of nursing along with other institutions. Unfortunately, no applications were received from schools of nursing. At the current time, nursing faculty are actively involved in OAIC research, making important contributions to better our understanding of interventions to improve and maintain health and function among older persons. One of the currently funded OAICs is directed by a nurse with a faculty appointment in the school of nursing at her institution. NIA will continue to welcome applications from schools of nursing for inclusion in the Claude D. Pepper Older American Independence Centers Program. Item Demographic and economic research  The Committee commends the NIA for its demography and economic research. It is impressed by the importance of the findings from the Health and Retirement Study and the National Long Term Care Survey regarding the continuing decline in physical and cognitive disability. The Committee urges the NIA to expand funding for these studies and to explore the economic and social impact of the decline for families and society. The Committee also encourages the NIA to assess the role of health as a factor in premature retirement. (Page 127)   Action taken or to be taken Development, collection, and analysis of longitudinal data on demographics, health, work, retirement, and savings are an NIA priority. NIA supports eleven ""Demography and Economics of Aging"" centers that are vital sources of information on: trends in population age structures; changes in levels of disease and disability; cost-effectiveness of interventions; decisionmaking about retirement, pensions and savings; relationship between health and wealth; and health disparities by gender and race. Research areas include: structural retirement analysis, pathways linking education and health, national health accounts, and the relationship between socioeconomic status and health. The Demography Centers will be recompeted this year. The competitive renewal for the National Long Term Care Survey (NLTCS) also is under review. Item Older Americans with mental illness  The Committee is concerned about the growing population of older Americans who suffer from mental illness. This is often an underserved population, particularly in rural areas. The Committee encourages the NIA to target funds to study and identify vulnerable older adults who are at risk for such mental illnesses as depression, anxiety, and psychoses. Because advanced practice psychiatric nurses work in a variety of settings, the Committee believes they may be in a unique position to be a critical component of research related to the assessment and treatment of older adults with these disorders. (Page 127) Action taken or to be taken NIA and NINR funded a large caregiver clinical intervention, Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer's Caregiver Health (REACH II), to assess a tailored behavioral/cognitive strategy in (a) reducing caregiver depression and burden and (b) increasing caregiver health. New data suggest that HIV+ adults may suffer from subtle cognitive and affective changes. NIA sponsored workshops on ""Mental Health Research Issues in HIV and Aging"" with NIMH and ""Neurobiology of Alcohol and Aging"" with the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) to reveal gaps in our knowledge and develop research initiatives. Studies of physical exercise interventions suggest that such programs may be useful to abate depression, while loneliness and lack of social contact may respond to sociobehavioral interventions.   NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH National Institute on Aging Salaries and Expenses FY 2003 Amended OBJECT CLASSES Pres.

GX008-18-13533338	"[Print Friendly Version]      Saddam's Chemical Weapons Campaign: Halabja, March 16, 1988  Bureau of Public Affairs Washington, DC  March 14, 2003 ( PDF )           S addam Hussein is the first world leader in modern times to have brutally used chemical weapons against his own people. His goals were to systematically terrorize and exterminate the Kurdish population in northern Iraq, to silence his critics, and to test the effectiveness of his chemical and biological weapons. Hussein launched chemical attacks against 40 Kurdish villages and thousands of innocent civilians in 1987-88, using them as testing grounds. The worst of these attacks devastated the city of Halabja on March 16, 1988.       Halabja Casualties     5,000 civilians, many of them women, children, and the elderly, died within hours of the attack. 10,000 more were blinded, maimed, disfigured, or otherwise severely and irreversibly debilitated.   Thousands died of horrific complications, debilitating diseases, and birth defects in the years after.             Immediate Medical Effects in Halabja     Chemical Weapons Used         Death by asphyxiation    Skin burns and blisters    Impaired vision, blindness    Breathing difficulty, respiratory shutdown    Vomiting, diarrhea, digestive shutdown    Neurological disorder    Convulsions, coma         Saddam's regime purposefully mixed mustard gas and nerve agents to magnify their initial and long-term effects.     Mustard gas , a blistering agent, affects membranes of the nose, throat, and lungs.    Nerve agents such as  sarin ,  tabun , and  VX  attack eyes and respiratory tracts.    Chemical weapons contaminate the food and water supplies, soil, and animal populations .        Long-term Medical Effects   Halabja: A Testing Ground         Permanent blindness    Disfigurement    Respiratory, digestive, and neurological disorders    Leukemia, lymphoma, and colon, breast, lung, skin, and other cancers    Increased miscarriages and infertility    Severe congenital malformations and other birth defects       Iraqi soldiers in protective gear returned to Halabja to study the effectiveness of their weapons and attacks. They divided the city into grids, determining the number and location of the dead and extent of injury. Halabja helped Saddam Hussein gauge the ability of his chemical agents to kill, maim, and terrorize population centers.      ""Iraqi government troops would be surrounding the attack site and they would have chem-bio suits on...included would be doctors and interested observers...they would go in and find out how many people were dead...and how many survived. What ages ...did men, women or children or the elderly suffer more? From there they would shoot the survivors and burn the bodies...

PLASTICITY OF HUMAN STEM CELLS IN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM  Release Date:  December 3, 2001  PA NUMBER:  PA-02-025  National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke  ( http://www.ninds.nih.gov ) National Institute on Aging  ( http://www.nia.nih.gov ) National Institute of Mental Health  ( http://www.nimh.nih.gov ) National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute  ( http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov )  THIS PA USES ""MODULAR GRANT"" AND ""JUST-IN-TIME"" CONCEPTS.  MODULAR  INSTRUCTIONS MUST BE USED FOR RESEARCH GRANT APPLICATIONS UP TO $250,000 PER  YEAR. MODULAR BUDGET INSTRUCTIONS ARE PROVIDED IN SECTION C OF THE PHS 398  (REVISION 5/2001) AVAILABLE AT   http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/phs398/phs398.html .  PURPOSE  The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), the  National Institute on Aging (NIA), the National Institute of Mental Health  (NIMH) and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) invite  applications for studies on the plasticity and behavior of human stem cells,  and regulation of their replication, differentiation and function in the  nervous system. Because of their ability to generate neurons and glia, stem  cells are promising candidates for the development of cellular and genetic  therapies for neurological disorders, including congenital,  neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases, as well  as neuroregulatory problems in heart, lung, and blood diseases, and sleep  disorders. Animal studies demonstrate that stem or progenitor cells can be  derived from a variety of tissues and from hosts of different ages; however,  the requirements and potential for differentiation of each cell type appears  to be unique. In a recently-issued Program Announcement (PA-01-078)), NINDS  and other institutes at NIH invited studies to investigate the influence of  extrinsic signals in the nervous system on the biology of non-human stem  cells. Development of treatments for human conditions ultimately will require  understanding the biology of human stem cells. To achieve this goal, NINDS,  NIA, NIMH and NHLBI encourage applications to study the fundamental  properties of all classes of human stem cells, and to confirm, extend, and  compare the behavior of human stem cells that are derived from different  sources and ages or exposed to different regimes in vitro and in vivo. Of  high priority are studies to develop methods for identifying, isolating and  characterizing specific human precursor populations at intermediate stages of  differentiation into neurons and glia.  Because our current understanding of  stem cell biology comes mainly from studies conducted on murine stem cells, a  comparison between human and non-human cells will be crucial for translating  the results of animal studies to clinical trials. This Program Announcement  (PA) invites applications for support of research that characterizes  cellular, molecular and genetic mechanisms that allow human stem and  precursor cells to express plasticity and lineage choices. Projects that  address comparisons between different classes of human stem cells, and  between human and non-human stem cells would also be directly relevant to  this PA.  RESEARCH OBJECTIVES  Background  Stem cell research offers enormous potential for treating a host of  congenital, developmental, psychiatric or degenerative diseases for which  there are no cures. In animal studies, multipotent progenitor cells from many  different sources have been reported to generate cells with neuronal or glial  properties, raising expectations that they could be used to replace lost  neurons and glia, repair defective circuits, and restore functions  compromised by abnormal development, age, physical damage or disease. In  addition to cell and tissue therapy, the ability to selectively produce one  or more differentiated cell types at will from pluripotent stem cells would  be of clinical importance in investigating the effects of drugs and  environmental factors on differentiation and cell function in the human  nervous system.    Major challenges have to be overcome before any human cells can be harnessed  and translated to meaningful treatments for patients.  These challenges  include identifying the optimal type of stem cell or stem cell derivative for  specific assays and therapies for individual disorders, harvesting and  growing sufficient quantities of the appropriate cell type, deciding the best  therapeutic strategy for each condition to be treated, and assessing the  often-unexpected side effects that may arise when such versatile cells are  introduced into a patient. In addition, examples of the enormous plasticity  exhibited by stem cells raise fundamental questions about the comparative  potential of precursor cells derived from different sources and different  stages of development; the nature of the conditions that regulates stem cell  behavior; and the genetic, molecular and cellular mechanisms that result in  functional integration within the host nervous system over the lifespan of  the organism.   Of the many types of progenitor cells competent to develop neuronal and glial  features, embryonic stem (ES) cells, derived from embryos at the blastocyst  stage, may have the broadest natural potential because, during development,  they normally produce all the cells of an organism. These pluripotent cell  lines are characterized by nearly unlimited self-renewal and differentiation  capacity.  During differentiation in vitro, mouse and human ES cells express  properties of mature tissues such as muscles, several classes of neurons,  glia, pancreatic islet cells, cartilage and blood. When transplanted into the  central nervous system (CNS), ES cells that have been coaxed along an  oligodendrocytic lineage will form myelin and ensheath axons. Some improved  function was reported in rodent models of demyelination and spinal cord  injury that received these ES cell-derived transplants. However, how the  transplanted cells contributed to the restoration of function is unclear.       Another source of progenitors are neural stem cells that are derived from  neurogenic regions in the developing and adult CNS. They integrate seamlessly  into the host when transplanted into the developing nervous system, but their  fate appears highly dependent upon the local environment that they encounter.  This is particularly true when these cells are introduced into the adult CNS.   Cells that can become neurons in the hippocampus, generate only astrocytes  when placed into the spinal cord. Under appropriate conditions, some neural  stem cells can even develop into non-neural cell types.    Of particular interest are recent reports from a number of investigators that  stem cells present in adult, non-neuronal tissues also appear to show  surprising plasticity or versatility.  For example, under specific culture  conditions, bone marrow stromal cells can give rise to cells with neuronal or  glial features.  Following bone marrow transplantation, donor-derived cells  could be found in many tissues including the CNS, skeletal muscle, liver,  heart, vascular endothelia, and bone. One group reports that systemic  injections of bone marrow stromal cells resulted in significant functional  recovery in a rodent model of ischemia. Before we can design therapies using  human stem cells, we must understand how ""plastic"" or malleable are these  different classes of cells, the environmental cues that drive their choice of  fates, and how reversible are these fates.      For unknown reasons, select populations of cells are destroyed in specific  neurological disorders and diseases - dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's  Disease (PD), cholinergic neurons in Alzheimer's Disease(AD), motor neurons  in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and myelinating oligodendrocytes in  Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Because there is great diversity of neurons and  glia, studies to develop treatments for these and other diseases with less  well defined etiologies will require the characterization and acquisition of  unique populations of neurons and glia. While dopaminergic neurons clearly  are the target of studies on PD, defining the specific features of the  dopaminergic neurons needed to treat PD is less obvious.  Each neuronal and  glial phenotype is defined by a constellation of morphological, biochemical,  genetic, and electro-physiological properties, and the functional  significance/impact of a neuronal population depends on connectivity with  appropriate afferent and efferent populations. It is necessary to determine  the particular stem cell and protocol to generate a differentiated phenotype  that best replicates the significant properties of the endogenous target  cell. This requires direct comparison in the same in vitro and in vivo assay  systems between the numerous types of stem and progenitor cells.  The easiest  features to evaluate include morphology, biochemical and gene expression, and  physiology.  Less often described are quantification of protein and gene  levels, acquisition and maintenance of phenotype over time, cell division and  migration, and the simultaneous tracking of multiple properties in a  population of cells.  Least studied is the functional integration and  functional consequences of the transplanted cells in the host, and the long- term behavior of the transplanted population within the host. At present we  know little about the biology and comparative differentiation potential of  different types of stem cells, or their potential for use in developing  treatments for neurological disease.    Much of our understanding of the neural potential of different stem cells  comes from animal studies. It is still unclear if the many varieties of stem  cells described in animals are also present in humans, or how they can be  harvested, expanded, purified and induced to differentiate into neurons and  glia. We lack an understanding of the conditions required to support the  development of human cells along specific lineages in a reproducible manner.  Because most studies on human stem cells have been conducted in culture, it  is unclear whether the differentiated cells will persist, how they will  behave in the environment of the healthy brain, or their potential in the  nervous system altered by trauma, disease, or age.  A few studies, carried  out in animal models of dysfunction, hold promise that differentiated donor  cells can maintain neuronal markers for long periods in vivo.  However, there  is as yet no demonstration that these cells integrate functionally into the  existing nervous system of the host and contribute to behavioral recovery.  There are few studies on the long-term fates of any transplanted cells within  the nervous system or at other sites within the host.  Objectives and Scope  This Program Announcement is intended to promote studies of human stem cell  biology and the regulation and control of stem cells in the nervous system.    Of special interest are research efforts on cellular, molecular and genetic  mechanisms that influence the lineage choices of human stem cells, and the  development of methods for isolating specific cell populations, and studies  that demonstrate or enhance the safety of human stem cells in treatments for  neurological conditions. The following examples illustrate areas that are of  high interest; other innovative projects are also encouraged.   o  Comparison of the mitotic potential and fates of different types of human  stem and progenitor cells in vitro and in vivo in the CNS.  o  Comparison of the structural and functional integration of different types  of human progenitor cells into the healthy versus the injured or diseased  host nervous system.   o  Determination of the functional properties of human progenitor cells  implanted during progressive developmental stages of the host CNS, and with  aging.  o  Comparison of the functional properties of human stem and precursor cells  implanted at different stages of differentiation along neuronal or glial  lineages.  o  Comparison of the behavior of human stem cells with that of their non- human counterparts in vitro and in vivo.  o  Investigation of the ability of different human stem cells to revert to a  more plastic, multipotent state, under normal conditions and following  injury.  o  Examination of changes in gene and protein expression as human stem and  progenitor cells differentiate along specific neuronal and glial lineages.   o  Identification of signals, signaling pathway components and  transcriptional factors that regulate the fate(s) of transplanted human stem  cells and their derivatives.  o  Development of assays and markers that permit accurate and reliable  characterization of the state of differentiation of human stem or neural  precursor cells.  o  Development of methods for identifying, isolating and enriching select  human precursor populations, intermediate states, and differentiated neuronal  and glial phenotypes.    o  Development of a public database of gene expression patterns for human  stem cells as they differentiate and mature into specific neuronal and glial  fates.    o  Development of informatics models that integrate the results from studies  of different human and non-human stem and neural precursor cell types.  o  Use of animal model systems of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders  for screening and comparing the functional capabilities of implanted human  stem cells and their progeny.  o  Assessment of the long-term fates and the consequences of transplanted  human cells and their progeny in the nervous system, and in ectopic sites  within the host.   o  Assessment of the connectivity and integration of transplanted cells  within the host nervous system and across the lifespan.   o  Assessment and comparison of the immune responses generated by different  human stem cells and their progeny in the host.  o  Assessment of the behavior of host cells in response to the short-term and  long-term presence of transplanted human stem cells and/or their derivatives.   SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS  Use of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs): Criteria for federal funding of  research on hESCs can be found at   http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-02-005.html .   All cell lines that meet these criteria and are therefore eligible for research  with federal funding are identified and registered in the NIH Human Embryonic  Stem Cell Registry ( http://escr.nih.gov ).  NIH has established a website  ( http://grants.nih.gov/grants/stem_cell_faqs.htm ) that provides information  in the form of answers to frequently asked questions about implementation  issues for human embryonic stem cell research (see also:   http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-02-014.html ). Only  research using hESC lines that are registered in the NIH Human Embryonic Stem  Cell Registry will be eligible for funding.  Each approved cell line is  specifically identified by an NIH code in the Registry.  It is the  responsibility of the applicant to provide in their application the official  NIH identifier(s)for the hESC line(s)that they will use as found in the NIH  Registry ( http://escr.nih.gov ).  Applications that do not provide this  information will be returned without review.   MECHANISM OF SUPPORT  The Exploratory/Developmental Grants (R21) mechanism and the Research Project  (R01) grant mechanism will be used to support projects under this Program  Announcement(PA).  Under these mechanisms, responsibility for the planning,  direction, and execution of the proposed project will be solely that of the  applicant.  The proposed project period during which the research will be  conducted should adequately reflect the time required to accomplish the  stated goals and should be no more than 5 years for R01 grants. The R21  grants are one-time awards to support innovative, high impact research  projects that would either 1) generate pilot data to assess the feasibility  of a novel avenue of investigation, 2)involve high risk experiments that  could lead to a breakthrough in a particular field, or 3) demonstrate the  feasibility of new technologies that could have major impact in a specific  area. For this PA, participating NIH institutes will use the NINDS guidelines  for the R21 mechanism, which can be found at   http://www.ninds.nih.gov/funding/r21guidelines.htm .  As described in these  guidelines, R21 proposals are limited to two years with a maximum of $125,000  direct costs per year.  This program is appropriate both for new investigators  seeking to establish independent research careers and for established  investigators wishing to explore new areas of neuroscience or develop novel  technologies.   Specific application instructions have been modified to reflect ""MODULAR  GRANT"" and ""JUST-IN-TIME"" streamlining efforts that have been adopted by the  NIH. Complete and detailed instructions and information on Modular Grant  applications have been incorporated into the PHS 398 (rev. 5/2001).

Only  limited budgetary information is required under this approach.  The  just-in-time concept allows applicants to submit certain information only when  there is a possibility for an award. It is anticipated that these changes will  reduce the administrative burden for the applicants, reviewers and NIH staff.   The research grant application form PHS 398 (rev. 5/2001) at   http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/phs398/phs398.html  is to be used in  applying for these grants, with modular budget instructions provided in  Section C of the application instructions.    REVIEW CONSIDERATIONS  Applications will be assigned on the basis of established PHS referral  guidelines.  Applications will be evaluated for scientific and technical  merit by an appropriate scientific review group convened in accordance with  the standard NIH peer review procedures. As part of the initial merit review,  all applications will receive a written critique and undergo a process in  which only those applications deemed to have the highest scientific merit,  generally the top half of applications under review, will be discussed,  assigned a priority score, and receive a second level review by the  appropriate national advisory council or board.  Review Criteria  The goals of NIH-supported research are to advance our understanding of  biological systems, improve the control of disease, and enhance health.  In  the written comments reviewers will be asked to discuss the following aspects  of the application in order to judge the likelihood that the proposed  research will have a substantial impact on the pursuit of these goals.  Each  of these criteria will be addressed and considered in assigning the overall  score, weighting them as appropriate for each application.  Note that the  application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely  to have major scientific impact and thus deserve a high priority score.  For  example, for R01 applications, an investigator may propose to carry out  important work that by its nature is not innovative but is essential to move  a field forward.  (1) Significance:  Does this study address an important problem?  If the aims  of the application are achieved, how will scientific knowledge be advanced?   What will be the effect of these studies on the concepts or methods that  drive this field?  (2) Approach:  Are the conceptual framework, design, methods, and analyses  adequately developed, well-integrated, and appropriate to the aims of the  project?  Does the applicant acknowledge potential problem areas and consider  alternative tactics?  (3) Innovation:  Does the project employ novel concepts, approaches or  method? Are the aims original and innovative?  Does the project challenge  existing paradigms or develop new methodologies or technologies?  (4) Investigator:  Is the investigator appropriately trained and well suited  to carry out this work?  Is the work proposed appropriate to the experience  level of the principal investigator and other researchers (if any)?  (5) Environment:  Does the scientific environment in which the work will be  done contribute to the probability of success?  Do the proposed experiments  take advantage of unique features of the scientific environment or employ  useful collaborative arrangements?  Is there evidence of institutional  support.  (6) For R21 applications:  Could these high risk experiments lead to a  breakthrough in the field? Could the proposed studies demonstrate the  feasibility of new technologies that could have a major impact in a specific  area?  In addition to the above criteria, in accordance with NIH policy, all  applications will also be reviewed with respect to the following:  o  The adequacy of plans to include both genders, minorities and their  subgroups, and children as appropriate for the scientific goals of the  research.  Plans for the recruitment and retention of subjects will also be  evaluated.  o  The reasonableness of the proposed budget and duration in relation to the  proposed research  o  The adequacy of the proposed protection for humans, animals or the  environment, to the extent they may be adversely affected by the project   proposed in the application.  AWARD CRITERIA  Award criteria that will be used to make award decisions include:  o  scientific merit (as determined by peer review) o  availability of funds o  programmatic priorities.  INCLUSION OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES IN RESEARCH INVOLVING HUMAN SUBJECTS  It is the policy of the NIH that women and members of minority groups and  their sub-populations must be included in all NIH-supported clinical research  projects unless a clear and compelling justification is provided indicating  that inclusion is inappropriate with respect to the health of the subjects or  the purpose of the research. This policy results from the NIH Revitalization  Act of 1993 (Section 492B of Public Law 103-43).  All investigators proposing clinical research should read the AMENDMENT ""NIH  Guidelines for Inclusion of Women and Minorities as Subjects in Clinical  Research - Amended, October, 2001,"" published in the NIH Guide for Grants and  Contracts on October 9, 2001  ( http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-02-001.html );  a complete copy of the updated Guidelines are available at   http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/women_min/guidelines_amended_10_2001.htm . The amended policy incorporates: the use of an NIH definition of  clinical research; updated racial and ethnic categories in compliance with  the new OMB standards; clarification of language governing NIH-defined Phase  III clinical trials consistent with the new PHS Form 398; and updated roles  and responsibilities of NIH staff and the extramural community.  The policy  continues to require for all NIH-defined Phase III clinical trials that: a)  all applications or proposals and/or protocols must provide a description of  plans to conduct analyses, as appropriate, to address differences by  sex/gender and/or racial/ethnic groups, including subgroups if applicable;  and b) investigators must report annual accrual and progress in conducting  analyses, as appropriate, by sex/gender and/or racial/ethnic group differences.  INCLUSION OF CHILDREN AS PARTICIPANTS IN RESEARCH INVOLVING HUMAN SUBJECTS  It is the policy of NIH that children (i.e., individuals under the age of 21)  must be included in all human subjects research, conducted or supported by  the NIH, unless there are scientific and ethical reasons not to include them.   This policy applies to all initial (Type 1) applications submitted for  receipt dates after October 1, 1998.  All investigators proposing research involving human subjects should read the  ""NIH Policy and Guidelines on the Inclusion of Children as Participants in  Research Involving Human Subjects"" that was published in the NIH Guide for  Grants and Contracts, March 6, 1998, and is available at the following URL  address:  http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not98-024.html   Investigators also may obtain copies of these policies from the program staff  listed under INQUIRIES.  Program staff may also provide additional relevant  information concerning the policy.  URLS IN NIH GRANT APPLICATIONS OR APPENDICES  All applications and proposals for NIH funding must be self-contained within  specified page limitations.  Unless otherwise specified in an NIH  solicitation, internet addresses (URLs) should not be used to provide  information necessary to the review because reviewers are under no obligation  to view the Internet sites.  Reviewers are cautioned that their anonymity may  be compromised when they directly access an Internet site.  REQUIRED EDUCATION IN THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS  NIH policy requires education on the protection of human subject participants  for all investigators submitting NIH proposals for research involving human  subjects.  This policy announcement is available in the NIH Guide for Grants  an Contracts, June 5, 2000 (Revised August 25, 2000), available at:    http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-00-039.html .  PUBLIC ACCESS TO RESEARCH DATA THROUGH THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT  The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-110 has been revised to  provide public access to research data through the Freedom of Information Act  (FOIA) under some circumstances.  Data that are (1) first produced in a  project that is supported in whole or in part with Federal funds and (2)  cited publicly and officially by a Federal agency in support of an action  that has the force and effect of law (i.e., a regulation) may be accessed  through FOIA.  It is important for applicants to understand the basic scope  of this amendment.  NIH has provided guidance at:  http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/a110/a110_guidance_dec1999.htm   Applicants may wish to place data collected under this PA in a public  archive, which can provide protections for the data and manage the  distribution for an indefinite period of time.  If so, the application should  include a description of the archiving plan in the study design and include  information about this in the budget justification section of the  application. In addition, applicants should think about how to structure  informed consent statements and other human subjects procedures given the  potential for wider use of data collected under this award.       HEALTHY PEOPLE 2010  The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health  promotion and disease prevention objectives of ""Healthy People 2010,"" a PHS  led national activity for setting priority areas.

The courses should  include hands-on experience to improve the knowledge and skills of biomedical  researchers to maintain, characterize, and utilize human embryonic stem cells  in basic research studies and be made available to investigators in research  areas of interest to all of the institutes and centers of the NIH.  RESEARCH OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE  Background  Recent scientific discoveries about the ability of human embryonic stem cells  to proliferate in an undifferentiated state and to be directed to develop  into a wide array of cell types present opportunities for research that aims  to repair or replace cells and restore vital functions.  Advancing these  discoveries will require a dissemination of technical knowledge and skills in  cell culture techniques across a variety disciplines and disease research  areas.  Because of the brief period of time these stem cells have been  available to the researchers, there is a paucity of investigators who have  experience with this research tool.  The growth and maintenance of human  embryonic stem cells in an undifferentiated state represents a significant  technical challenge.  Taken together, these issues underscore the need for  educational courses focused on the cell culture techniques for human  embryonic stem cells.  Research Objectives and Scope  The objective of this grant program is to support the development,  implementation and evaluation of short-term courses on skills and techniques  applied in human embryonic stem cell research.  The courses should improve  the skills of biomedical researchers in the maintenance of human embryonic  stem cells in culture and their application of this research tool in basic  research studies.  The long-term objective is to increase the number of  researchers who have both the knowledge and skills in the use of human  embryonic stem cells in basic research.  Further, applicants are encouraged  to propose innovative programs with new approaches for teaching and learning  the maintenance and use of human embryonic stem cells.  There is a broad array of applications for the use of human embryonic stem  cells that can benefit from the short course approach.  The following are  examples of topic areas of emphasis for the courses to enhance research  skills and knowledge. They are not all inclusive and applicants may propose  other topic areas:  o Demonstration of proper growth conditions for cells including preparation  of culture media, microseparation techniques for dissection and isolation of  cells from embryoid bodies, preparation and use of feeder/support cells and  growth factors  o Proper freeze-thaw cycling, repetition of the preparation of cell passages,  and the cryopreservation, vitrification, storage, and shipment of cells  o Use of co-culture techniques to support maintenance of the undifferentiated  cell state  o Use of cell separation procedures including fluorescence-activated cell  sorting (FACS)  o Review of basic good laboratory practices for use of human biological  materials including proper exposure precautions, safe methods of disposal,  and record keeping  o Development of protocols that support the characterization of molecular,  cellular, and genetic characteristics of embryonic stem cells including the  use of monoclonal antibodies, polymerase chain reaction techniques,  fluorescent in situ hybridization techniques and karyotype analysis  (including staining technologies and application of confocal microscopy)  o Establishment of xenograft procedures for the use of animal models (e.g.,  immune-deficient mice) for in situ culturing and differentiation of stem  cells and the pathological examination of tumor growth  o Application of standard research protocols for directed differentiation of  embryonic stem cells to specific cell populations (e.g., insulin producing  cells, cardiomyocyte, neuronal subtypes)  o Employment of standard detection methods for infectious organisms or  other contaminants  o Introduction to microarray techniques for DNA and transcriptional profiling   o Molecular biology applications to existing cell lines to create mutations  yielding cell lines with overexpressed or repressed protein expression and/or  the reporter gene constructs  o Application of single cell recording methods for measurement of electrical  potential (e.g., cardiomyocyte and neuron recordings)  o Cross-training of techniques used in other applications of stem cell  biology tools; training may also include the use of non-human embryonic stem  cells and adult stem cells (e.g., hematopoietic stem cells, neurospheres, or  other precursor/progenitor cells), but these should not be the dominant  research tools used in the training exercises  All courses should be developed to meet the training needs of junior through  senior biomedical researchers.  Each topic area of the application should be  addressed in sufficient depth to show how it significantly improves the  skills and knowledge of the trainee.  Given the complexity of many of the  areas of emphasis listed above relative to the short duration of the courses,  applicants are strongly encouraged to target the skills courses to  researchers with current expertise clearly related to human embryonic stem  cell culture.  In both developing and teaching the courses, applicants are encouraged to  take an interdisciplinary approach and involve a wide array of perspectives  of the biological sciences including genetics, reproductive biology,  physiology, cell biology, oral biology, neurobiology, biochemistry,  microbiology, immunology, and toxicology.  It is important that the teaching  program involve scientists from a variety of relevant fields and to include  those with recognized expertise in the field of embryonic stem cell biology.   Courses should include information on stem cell regulations and ethical issues. Applicants to this program will be required to disseminate their educational  materials widely.  Applicants should describe what specific mechanisms they  will employ for dissemination and should indicate what resources will be  available for continuing education when trainees return to their home  institutions.  In the case of internet-based materials used in the training,  applicants are encouraged to submit plans on how these materials will be  advertised and made available to the appropriate research communities and  evaluated for effectiveness.   Proposals for courses should indicate criteria for student selection, the  number of students expected per class, and should include clear plans for  evaluating the effectiveness of the course(s) in terms of attendees'  perceptions of the material and conduct of the course.  Importantly, there  must be plans in place to assess the longer-term impact, as measured by  attendees' subsequent activities or responsibilities in their institutions in  the areas of embryonic stem cell biology.    Applicants should also address plans to include attendees from groups  currently underrepresented in the field of embryonic stem cell biology.    MECHANISM OF SUPPORT   This PA will use the NIH Continuing Education Training Grant (T15) award that  funds institutions to establish or expand programs of continuing professional  education.  As an applicant, you will be solely responsible for planning,  directing, and executing the proposed project.   Using this PA, human  embryonic stem cell research training courses may be of any duration up to  three months as long as they are consistent with the goals of the proposed  program.  For organizations wanting to teach human embryonic stem cell  research training courses, such courses should be offered at least once a  year.  Courses can be developed that have Internet, CD-ROM, DVD, and/or  videotape components.  Although not considered for funding by this PAS, alternative mechanisms to  support training experiences for human embryonic stem cell research include  National Research Service Awards for Senior Fellows (F33), Education Project  Grants (R25), Conference Grants (R13), National Research Short-Term Training  Award (T35), existing Institutional Training Grants (T32), and courses  developed using the Fast-Track Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and  Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Grant mechanisms.   This PA uses just-in-time concepts.  This mechanism (T15) uses the non- modular budgeting format.  Applicants may request up to three years of support.  Allowable costs include  personnel, rental of laboratory facilities and equipment for the period of  the course offering, purchase of laboratory supplies required for cell  culture and supporting experiments, travel and per diem for faculty, and  other costs such as printing, telephone, audio-visuals, postage, recruitment  materials, and computer software.  The purchase of equipment is not an  allowable cost.  In addition, travel and per diem funds for trainees  attending courses developed by applicants are appropriate when necessary.   However, it is expected that courses will be partially funded through  registration fees paid for by the trainees and their home institutions.   Trainees may be recruited locally (at the grantee institution), regionally,  or nationally.  The facilities and administration rate for T15 awards is  eight percent.    FUNDS AVAILABLE  The twelve sponsoring Institutes and Centers have committed approximately  $1,000,000 for total costs for the first year of support in FY 2002.  Award  of grants is contingent upon the availability of such funds for this purpose.   It is anticipated that four to five grants may be awarded under this program  in FY 2002. The specific number to be funded will depend on the merit and  scope of the application received.  Direct costs of the awards made under the T15 mechanism are limited to  $150,000 for each of the planned years of the planned three years of support.   The facilities and administration rate for T15 awards is eight percent.   Additional solicitations may be available in FY 2003 pending availability  of funds.    ELIGIBLE INSTITUTIONS  You may submit an application is your institution has any of the  following characteristics:  o For-profit or non-profit o Public or private institutions, such as universities, colleges,  hospitals, laboratories o Units of state and local governments o Eligible agencies of the Federal government o Domestic or foreign   INDIVIDUALS ELIGIBLE TO BECOME PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS  Any individual with the skills, knowledge, and resources necessary to carry  out the proposed research is invited to work with their institution to  develop an application for support.  Individuals from underrepresented racial  and ethnic groups as well as individuals with disabilities are always  encouraged to apply for NIH programs.

GX001-77-14917650	"Argonne home page  ||      Argonne news releases  ||      Argonne Virtual Newsroom        Argonne researchers create  powerful stem cells from blood             May revolutionize medical research and transplantation                                          FROM BLOOD CELLS TO STEM CELLS — The       images show peripheral blood monocytes. Figure A (left) shows freshly isolated,       untreated cells. Figure B (right) shows similar cells 14 days after treatment,       when they have morphed into pluripotent stem cells.                      ARGONNE, Ill. (Feb. 24, 2003) — The particularly powerful     — and very scarce — flexible forms of stem cells needed for medical     research and treatment may now be both plentiful and simple to produce, with a     new technology developed at the U.S. Department of Energy's Argonne National     Laboratory — and the source is as close as your own bloodstream.         These flexible stem cells, able to morph into a variety of cell     types, are called ""pluripotent,"" and before this Argonne research, they have     been found only in fetal tissue, which is limited, and in bone marrow, which is     difficult to collect. Pluripotent stem cells are important because they can     generate all types of tissues found in the body, and the Argonne-developed     technology can produce them from adult blood cells.         The finding may eventually offer researchers a practical     alternative to the use of embryonic stem cells for research, drug discovery,     and transplantation.         Argonne scientist Eliezer Huberman and his colleagues, Yong Zhao     and David Glesne, examined adult monocytes, a type of white blood cells that     act as precursors to macrophages. The researchers found that when monocytes     were exposed to a growth factor, they created a set of pluripotent stem cells.     After cultivating the stem cells, the scientists were able to make the cells     differentiate into nerve, liver, and immune system tissue by delivering more     growth factors.         ""Because of its great promise in medicine, I'm prouder of this     work than of anything else I've done,"" Huberman said.                                  Subscribe to        What's New at Argonne , a monthly       e-mail newsletter that summarizes stories from Argonne's home page and other       Argonne news and provides links to additional information.                      The research is being published in the      Proceedings of the National Academy of     Sciences .         Storing the precursor cells in liquid nitrogen had no effect on     their differentiation later. Because monocytes can be easily gathered from a     patient's own blood supply, the researchers suggest that treating disease with     a genetic match to prevent rejection may be possible in the future.         This means that the material should produce valuable candidates     for transplantation therapy, useful to replenish immune cells that have been     eradicated by cancer therapy or to replace neuronal tissue damaged during     spinal cord injury, stroke, Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease.         Funding for the research is from the  National Institutes of Health . The researchers     have applied for a patent on the new technology.

GX230-95-4435875	"SCIENCE CAPSULES Sugar May Help Cystic Fibrosis Patients Avoid Infection. A sugar known as xylitol, reported to prevent dental caries and acute ear infections, may offer protection against bacteria that would otherwise infect cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Researchers demonstrated that xylitol prevents infection in respiratory tissues by lowering the salt concentration of liquid secreted by tissues from CF and non-CF subjects. In addition, xylitol given in the form of a nasal spray significantly decreased the number of staphylococci present in the nasal passages of healthy volunteers. These results support the concept that lowering the salt concentration on airway surfaces enhances the airway's innate antibacterial defense system and suggest that xylitol-like therapeutics may prevent or slow the onset of bacterial infection in CF.

Asthma is a chronic lung disease that affects more than 15 million Americans and is estimated to cost the U.S. economy $12.3 billion a year in health care expenditures and lost productivity. Two NIH studies comparing treatments for adults with mild-to-moderate persistent asthma recently established that long-acting beta-agonists (LABs) are not as effective as inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) for reducing asthma attacks. However, when LABs are used regularly to supplement treatment with ICS, they can improve asthma control and enable substantial reductions in steroid doses. Providing the approximately 6 million patients who have moderate persistent asthma with what is scientifically demonstrated to be the best available treatments not only will reduce their morbidity from the disease, but also will reduce the burden asthma imposes on the U.S. economy.

One of the major hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the appearance of senile plaques in brain. These plaques are primarily composed of amyloid _-peptide (A ), a toxic fragment formed when a larger protein called _-amyloid precursor protein ( APP) breaks down. Researchers are working to develop agents that reduce APP expression. This study identified a new target for reducing levels of APP in brain. The 605   investigators tested a drug called phenserine, originally developed to increase levels of the chemical messenger acetylcholine, which is depleted in the brains of people with AD. They discovered that phenserine can reduce levels of APP in cells, through a mechanism independent of acetylcholine activity. It does this by inhibiting the formation of APP. Current research is directed towards the design, synthesis, and development of agents that optimally and safely regulate APP and A_ levels with the aim of slowing or halting the molecular events that lead to AD.

Abnormal accumulation of the amyloid-_ peptide (A_) in the brain may be crucial to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Epidemiological studies as well as studies of inflammation in AD brain have suggested that an overall reduction in brain inflammation might reduce the risk of developing AD. In addition, it is known that high levels of transforming growth factor-_1 (TGF- _1, a cytokine that is part of the inflammatory response to injury) can increase the deposition of amyloid in cerebral blood vessels and may have a role in AD pathology. New lines of transgenic mice were established in which the effect of TGF-_1 on deposition of human A_ plaques in the brain and its blood vessels can be examined. Results from this study suggest that particular components of the inflammatory response in brain, for example microglial activation in response to high levels of TGF-_1, might act to reduce, not elevate, plaque levels in brain tissue. Better understanding of this process could lead to the development of treatments for AD as well as for the hemorrhage that can occur with vascular disease and stroke.

Following severe burn, individuals often have an elevated metabolism characterized by significant breakdown of skeletal muscle mass (catabolism) that can extend well past wound healing and dramatically hinder a return to normal life. In a series of studies, important variables that predict the risk of excessive catabolism have been identified, and anabolic therapies (oxandrolone and recombinant human growth hormone) to counteract these effects have been tested with positive results.

Investigators in two academic medical centers tested the relative efficacy in ameliorating bulimic symptoms of two forms of psychotherapy  cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), an approach that concentrates on defining how a person's behaviors have an impact on problems that contribute to illness, and interpersonal therapy (IPT), an approach that addresses health problems by focusing strictly on current conflicts and interpersonal problems. Subjects with the eating disorder bulimia nervosa were randomized to receive either CBT or IPT weekly over 20 weeks, and then followed up 1 year post-treatment. Among those completing the full course of treatment, 45 percent of the CBT group versus 8 percent of the IPT group achieved recovery by the end of the acute treatment period. CBT responders also showed quite stable maintenance of their treatment gains, with 40 percent of treatment completers still recovered at the 1-year follow-up point. While IPT acted more slowly, however, it tended to produce delayed improvements that continued to mount subsequent to treatment, such that 27 percent of IPT completers were judged recovered at follow-up (less than for CBT, but not a statistically significant difference). Analysis of change in different symptom clusters indicated that CBT was superior in altering the primary behavioral symptoms associated with bulimia nervosa, whereas both therapies were equivalent in treating depressive symptoms that are also common in these patients (as measured on such dimensions as weight and shape concerns, self-esteem, and interpersonal functioning). The investigators concluded that CBT is to be considered the preferred treatment for bulimia nervosa because it produces clinical benefits more quickly than IPT and, overall, is efficacious with a larger percentage of patients.

Eighty percent of patients who have recovered from major depressive disorder (MDD) relapse in the absence of prophylactic treatment. To reduce this risk, clinicians often prescribe continuation phase antidepressant medication to prevent relapse (should the index episode continue) and maintenance medication to prevent recurrence (i.e., a new episode). Although cognitive therapy (CT) may reduce relapse and recurrence when patients learn to use the associated skills over time, the long term effects of CT have not been well specified. Investigators have developed an intervention called ""continuation-phase CT"" (C-CT). Initially, they treated patients with major depression for 20 sessions of CT. Unmedicated responders were randomized to either 8 months of C-CT or control (evaluation without CT). Over the 8-month intervention period, C-CT significantly reduced relapse rates more than control (10 percent versus 31 percnet). Over 24 months, C-CT significantly reduced relapse and recurrence estimates among patients with early onset MDD (16 percent versus 67 percent in control) and among those with an unstable remission during the acute treatment phase (37 percent versus 62 percent for the control group). 607   Findings suggest that 8 months of C-CT significantly reduced relapse and recurrence in the highest risk patients with recurrent MDD.

A recent clinical trial compared treatment with a modern antidepressant (sertraline) to placebo in 22 depressed individuals with Alzheimer's disease. Preliminary results indicated that more of the antidepressant-treated subjects improved compared to the placebo-treated ones. These results underscore the need to treat the depression that co-occurs with Alzheimer's disease.

American Journal of Psychiatry 157: 1686-1689, 2000.  Antisense Therapy May Make Sense for Alzheimer's Disease. The logic of antisense therapy is quite compelling. The DNA of our genes directs the formation of RNA which cells read out to form proteins. Every DNA and RNA strand has an exact complement, like the two strands of the DNA double helix. So, introducing a molecule that is the exact match (antisense) for an RNA that codes for a harmful protein should lock up the RNA and prevent the production of that protein. In practice, however, success has been limited by the difficulty of delivering antisense molecules where needed. Now, scientists have developed a chemically modified type of antisense molecule directed against amyloid beta protein, which forms clumps in the brains of people with Alzheimer's and contributes to the disease. When introduced intravenously, the antisense agent reversed learning and memory deficits in mice with an Alzheimer's-like disease. Much work is needed before such a treatment could safely be applied to people, but the tantalizing potential of antisense therapy for many diseases may be moving closer.

Neurotrophins are natural chemical signals that regulate survival of cells during development of the nervous system and in the adult brain. Animal studies show the promise of these chemicals for therapy of several brain disorders, but neurotrophins, like many large molecules, do not pass through the protective ""blood-brain barrier"" that isolates the brain from the general circulation. Now, two independent strategies in animals have circumvented the blood-brain barrier and invoked the beneficial effects of neurotrophins. One study administered adenosine, a smaller signaling molecule that penetrates the blood-brain barrier and mimics, indirectly, neurotrophins. The other approach linked the neurotrophin molecule to a chemical tag that directs cells of the barrier to actively transport it 608   into the brain. Enough neurotrophin reached the brain in this study to protect rats from an experimental stroke. Lee FS and Chao MV: Activation of Trk neurotrophin receptors in the absence of neurotrophins.

Scientists have identified barriers to growth in the adult brain and spinal cord that are partly responsible for the failure of nerve cells to regenerate following damage. We know less about why adult nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord seem to have diminished intrinsic growth ability even in conditions that encourage growth. New findings show that the adult cells make less of proteins called integrins through which nerve cells interact with their surroundings. When researchers restored the embryonic levels of integrins in adult cells through genetic engineering, the cells showed dramatically improved growth ability in cell culture conditions designed to mimic the adult brain and spinal cord. Manipulating the intrinsic growth potential of adult nerve cells, combined with procedures to counteract growth inhibitors, may yield new approaches to repairing the damaged brain and spinal cord.

Scientists have learned how to encourage nerve fibers, or axons, to grow by mechanically stretching them. Researchers developed the idea by considering the ability of axons that are already connected to grow as the body grows. They devised a method of growing nerve cells on a material that can be naturally absorbed by the body and used a motorized device to slowly pull connected nerve cells, at a rate of 3.5 thousandths of a meter every 5 minutes. The axons elongated by a remarkable 1 centimeter in 10 days of stretch and formed bundles, like those that occur naturally, which might serve as a framework to encourage other nerve cells to grow across damaged areas. Adapting this procedure may someday allow transplanting bridges to help foster recovery from spinal cord injury and other damage to long nerve fibers, such as the optic nerve or the nerves of the body.

Less Toxic Treatment for Patients with Chronic Granulomatous Disease. Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD) is an inherited immune deficiency characterized by a defect in a specific white blood cell, the phagocyte, which renders the affected individual susceptible to bacterial and fungal infections. CGD patients suffer from severe recurrent infections and have a 609   shortened life expectancy. While immune therapy and antibiotics are utilized as the first line of treatment to prevent infections in patients with CGD, transplantation of stem cells derived from the bone marrow of a matched donor has also been utilized for patients with chronic illness and debilitation. This treatment is suboptimal, however, as it requires toxic levels of radiation to eliminate immune cells in the patient's bone marrow prior to replacement with donor-matched cells. Recently, NIH scientists developed a new transplantation regimen for CGD patients that involves chemotherapy but does not require the use of radiation, and demonstrated its effectiveness as an alternative treatment for CGD. This advance should lead to increased life expectancy for chronically ill CGD patients who require transplantation.

Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) involving treatment with a combination of several antiretroviral drugs (ARs), has dramatically improved the long-term prognosis for individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), resulting in reduced morbidity and mortality rates in the U.S. and other developed countries where HAART has become the standard treatment for HIV/AIDS. Unfortunately, patients on HAART, which is taken daily for the remainder of life, often suffer from toxic side effects characteristic of ARs. Several groups of investigators have attempted to alleviate these side effects by experimenting with structured treatment interruptions (STI), periods of drug treatment interspersed with periods when therapy is discontinued. Recently, NIH scientists demonstrated in monkeys infected with the simian immunodeficiency virus, the analog of HIV in humans, that implementing STI shortly after infection is as effective as continuous HAART treatment. This advance provides validation for the continued pursuit of STI regimens to treat humans with HIV/AIDS.

What makes HIV such an insidious infectious disease is that it attacks the immune system, which is the system the body uses to clear infection. HIV disables the immune system by infecting ""helper T cells,"" the subset of immune system cells that play a central role in the immune response by signaling to other immune cells to perform their special functions. Studies involving patients who have been treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) during the acute (early) stage of HIV infection, demonstrate that HAART can successfully control HIV virus replication, enabling the immune system to mount a strong response during this stage of infection. However, the impact of early HAART treatment on the long-term performance of the immune system remained undetermined. Recently, NIH scientists demonstrated in patients who had received early phase treatment, but subsequently discontinued 610   (and later restarted) the treatment, that the benefits of early HAART treatment on immune system function are maintained for at least 5 to 8 months. These findings provide a rationale to explore the development of therapies that strengthen immune response by augmenting helper Tcell function.

Morbidity and mortality in neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) disease remain high despite treatment with acyclovir. Recently, NIH-supported scientists demonstrated that administration of high-dose acyclovir reduced mortality by 50 percent in newborns with disseminated herpes simplex virus, the most severe form of HSV disease. Although treatment side-effects are a consideration, this information will aid physicians in the management of neonatal HSV disease.

Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules are present on the surface of almost every cell. Two individuals rarely share a matching set of MHC molecules, and in a solid organ transplant, graft rejection results when the recipient's immune system targets the mismatched MHC molecules. Graft recipients, therefore, must rely on potent immunosuppressive medications to control rejection. An alternative to lifelong immunosuppression is immune tolerance, that is, turning off the immune response to the grafts while leaving other protective immune responses intact. An NIH-supported researcher and colleagues have induced miniature swine to tolerate MHC-mismatched kidney transplants. Prior to transplantation, the researchers genetically modified the bone marrow of the recipient swine so that the marrow cells expressed the MHC genes of the kidney donor. With only a short course of immunosuppressive agents, treated animals maintained their transplants for up to three years. Control animals rejected their kidney transplants within two months. These results suggest that gene therapy has the potential to prevent graft rejection without long-term immunosuppression.

An experimental program has been successful in helping drug-abusing women stay free of drugs by paying them a salary to attend a work/training program. In the Therapeutic Workplace, women in drug treatment are hired and paid to either perform assigned jobs or to participate in job training. To link salary to drug abstinence, patients are required to provide drug-free urine samples to gain daily access to the workplace. Program participation nearly doubled the patients' abstinence from opiates and 611   cocaine, as determined by urine samples collected three times a week during the six-month study. Over the course of the program, 59 percent of the urine samples from the workplace women were drug-free, compared to 33 percent of the samples from a control group of women. Forty percent of the Therapeutic Workplace participants had drug-free urine samples on at least 75 percent of testing occasions; in contrast, only 10 percent of the control participants did so. This project confirms the results of many years of previous research that demonstrate that reward-based treatment programs do result in decreased drug use. This program also exemplifies how research findings can be applied in real-world settings.

Therapy for acute ischemic (inadequate blood flow) stroke focuses on improving blood flow and minimizing biochemical and physiological responses that increase cell losses. Administration of hyperbaric oxygen, or oxygen at greater than atmospheric pressure, is one of the therapies that has been studied for this purpose. In an experimental rat model system, investigators demonstrated that by administering hyperbaric oxygen, the damaging effects of a stroke could be reduced. They proposed that the therapy prevents normally circulating white blood cells from becoming trapped in the area of the brain subject to reduced circulation during a stroke. When trapped, these cells break down and release toxic products that damage the vulnerable brain tissue. Further studies of the novel mechanism of action of hyperbaric oxygen may lead to improvements in our ability to reduce the consequences of a stroke.

Consumers of the dietary supplement ginseng believe that its use will increase the user's strength and energy. Ginseng-containing supplements are among the most popular medicines worldwide. However, because they can be prepared from a variety of plants, they are subject to botanical misidentification. With such a premise, one group of investigators examined 25 commercial products containing ginseng to determine if they contained the amount and type of ginseng consistent with their product labeling. The study showed that, although each product was appropriately labeled for the type of ginseng contained within, the concentrations of ginseng, as determined by analysis of marker of compounds, differed widely from that stated on the label. These results suggest that careful characterization and standardization of herbal products is a necessary step in the design and evaluation of studies using those products.

Women are increasingly using herbal remedies to treat menopausal symptoms, even though little is known about their efficacy or safety. Recent studies have begun to reveal underlying biochemical properties of some of these herbs. In a recent study, investigators evaluated eight of the botanical preparations most commonly purchased by women for the treatment of menopausal symptoms and found that three  red clover, hops, and chasteberry  showed significant estrogenic activity. This suggests that the three herbs might be popular remedies because they supplement the decreased estrogen in menopausal women. Additional studies are needed to determine whether the estrogen-like compounds work similarly to conventional estrogen replacement therapy or have different properties, and what effect those differences might have on the health of menopausal women.

Hepatitis C virus infects millions of people worldwide and in the U.S. Chronic hepatitis C is the most common cause of chronic liver disease and the most common indication for liver transplantation in this country.

Past research has shown that adult cancer survivors often have impaired memory and concentration after treatment with chemotherapy. Researchers reviewed previous research on this topic and concluded this area is understudied. In particular, they note that there has been no published research on the impact of various genetic factors on response to chemotherapy, and that the measures currently used to determine changes in cognitive functions are not sufficiently sensitive for standard-dose chemotherapy patients. Their review supports the need for additional research in the area. Ahles TA: Cognitive effects of standard-dose chemotherapy in patients with cancer. Cancer Investigation (in press 2001).  Mechanism of HIV Drug Resistance. Soon after the introduction of the first anti-HIV drug zidovudine (AZT), mutations that confer resistance to the drug arose in some strains of the virus. It had been clear for some time that some of these mutations interfere with the incorporation of 613   AZT-like drugs into the virus's self-replication machinery. Recently, a second possible mechanism has been demonstrated  that the mutations actually cause the drug molecules to be excised (cut out) after they are incorporated into the virus. Scientists have now made an important discovery that provides new insights into how these mutations enhance the excision process, and how the mutations are able to target the excision specifically to AZT but not other drugs in the same class. Because the chemotherapeutic agents used to treat other microbial infections, as well as cancer, target similar molecular structures, this discovery may provide valuable clues to the mechanisms of drug resistance in a number of life-threatening diseases.

Interleukin 15 (IL-15) is a protein that helps regulate the number of white blood cells in the body. High levels of IL-15 have been associated with childhood leukemias involving two types of white blood cells  T-cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Recently, researchers developed a mouse model that produced very high levels of IL-15. They found these mice first produced high levels of natural killer cells and CD8+ T cells; as the mice aged, they developed fatal leukemias. These results suggest that monitoring IL-15 levels in people with leukemia may be a way to track cancer progression or remission, or to better tailor chemotherapy to the individual patient.

Cells with functional p53 can be destroyed with radiation, while cells with mutated p53 often cannot. In some skin cancers (melanomas), p53 appears to be functional, but the cells do not respond to radiation. A recent study found that radiation leads to the removal of a phosphorus group on the p53 gene in normal skin cells, but not in skin cancer cells. If researchers could find a way to remove this phosphorus group in cancer cells, they may be able to make these cells respond to radiation therapy, thus increasing the effectiveness of the treatment.

Prior studies have suggested a potential benefit of removal of the affected kidney (nephrectomy) in patients whose renal cell cancer had spread beyond the kidney (metastatic disease). In a recent study of 246 persons with metastatic renal cell cancer, patients were either given interferon-alpha therapy alone or received a nephrectomy followed by the same dose and schedule of interferon-alpha as those patients who did not undergo surgery. Results demonstrated that patients who underwent nephrectomy lived longer, and were more likely to be alive one year after treatment, than those who did not have a nephrectomy. These findings show that nephrectomy prior to adjuvant biologic therapy (interferon-alpha) improves the outcome in patients with metastatic kidney cancer. For patients who are fit enough to undergo nephrectomy and adjuvant interferon therapy, this two-phase treatment regimen may define a new standard of care and will serve as a reference for future clinical trials.

Cells have many mechanisms to prevent damage by toxic agents. Breakdown in these mechanisms can eventually lead to cancer. Researchers have uncovered two important functions of the enzyme p38 that offer insight into how cancer is initiated: 1) p38 activates the p53 gene, which normally responds to toxic agents by initiating the death of damaged cells. Without p38, p53 does not function properly. If researchers could find a way to block p38, they could protect normal cells from death after exposure to chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Tumor cells usually lack functional p53, so inhibition of p38 will protect normal cells but not tumor cells from chemotherapy-induced apoptosis (cell death). And, 2) p38 inhibits an enzyme called Cdc25B phosphatase, which helps initiate mitosis (cell division). When p38 is present, cell division is delayed, giving cells time to repair damage caused by toxins. Without p38, damaged cells will divide, which could lead to cancer. These results indicate that p38 may well be an important molecular target for experimental therapies.

Improved Outcomes for Children with a Deadly Form of Leukemia. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common cancer in children. In about 15 percent of cases, children have a form of the disease known as T-cell ALL; these children tend to have poorer prognoses than children with other forms of the disease. Now, results from a clinical trial provide 615   convincing evidence of improved outcomes for children with T-cell ALL who receive high-dose methotrexate in addition to a multi-drug chemotherapy regimen. In this study, eighty-six percent of children who received high-dose methotrexate survived disease-free for at least three years, compared with 72 percent of children who received standard therapy. These are the best results for treatment for T-cell ALL published to date; the investigators anticipate that future trials attempting to improve outcome for children with T-cell ALL will build upon this treatment approach.

Lifestyle factors, such as diet and physical activity, are thought to influence the development of colorectal cancer, the second leading cause of cancer death in the U.S. Researchers at the NIH conducted a nutritional intervention study to determine whether adults at high risk for colorectal cancer can reduce their risk through diet. This study, the Polyp Prevention Trial, looked at the effect of the levels of dietary fat and fiber, and the number of fruits and vegetables consumed each day, on the growth of new adenomatous polyps in persons with a prior history of polyps. Adenomatous polyps are precursors of most large-bowel cancers, and individuals whose polyps are removed often have a recurrence of polyps within 3 years. The study failed to show that a diet low in fat and high in fiber, fruit, and vegetables reduced the risk of recurrent colorectal adenomas. Additional studies are needed, however, since the study had some limitations. Furthermore, a low-fat, high fiber diet is still beneficial in preventing and managing heart disease and other medical conditions.

Successful treatment of persons with gastric (stomach) cancer who have undergone surgery for their disease varies considerably, with only 5 to 40 percent of these patients considered cured of their cancer. A recent study of 603 patients with cancer of the stomach or gastroesophagus (GE) showed that both disease-free survival and overall survival were improved in patients who had surgery followed by chemotherapy and radiation treatment, as opposed to the standard treatment of surgery alone. On the basis of these findings, postoperative chemoradiation may now be considered a standard of care for high risk patients with resected locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the stomach and GE junction. The investigators did note that despite the success of this trial, caution is warranted because the tolerability of the combined treatment depended on extremely fastidious radiation quality control, including frequent adjustments to minimize serious toxicity. 616   Macdonald JS, Smalley S, Benedetti J, Estes N, Haller DG, Ajani JA, Gunderson LL, Jessup M, and Martenson JA: Postoperative combined radiation and chemotherapy improves disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in resected adenocarcinoma of the stomach and G.E. junction.

Researchers have developed a new anti-cancer vaccine using recombinant yeast  that is, yeast that has been engineered to produce specific antigens, or substances that activate the immune system. This vaccine, when administered to mice who were inoculated with lymphoma cells, was found to activate dendritic cells, which are specialized cells that are important to the immune response, and to boost immune function; the vaccine proved to protect the mice against the lymphoma cells. While this approach is still under study, the use of recombinant yeast in vaccines could provide a powerful strategy against cancer and a variety of other infectious diseases.

To prevent infection and restore visual clarity, the cornea must respond rapidly to injury. NIH researchers have found a new protein that promotes wound healing in the eyes of animal models. The protein, Thymosin beta 4, accelerates epithelial cell migration and decreases damaging inflammation. It enhances the tight connection between the cells, thereby preventing fluid loss and penetration by bacteria. This compound will have clinical use in repairing surgically treated eyes as well as injuries induced by trauma.

Antigene radiotherapy is a new approach for targeting disease-related genes with special type of radioisotopes, so-called Auger-electron emitters that produce damage within an extremely short range. This approach is being applied to target and ""knock out"" the human multidrug-resistance gene (MDR1) that encodes a multidrug transporter, responsible for the increased resistance to anti-cancer drug therapies. The problem of multidrug-resistance is a major impediment in successful cancer chemotherapy. Short pieces of DNA carrying Augerelectron emitters were designed to target specifically a sequence within the MDR1 gene. Experiments with cultured KB-V1 cancer cells showed that the designed radiopharmaceuticals can produce breaks in both DNA strands of the target sequence that should result in ""knock out"" of the MDR1 gene.  617   Sedelnikova OA, Panyutin IG, Luu AN, Reed, MW T.

Media reports on the nursing shortage, medical errors, and uneven quality of patient care have gained public attention. A recent survey of over 43,000 nurses in 5 countries found widespread discontent. In the US, more than 40 percent of responding nurses expressed dissatisfaction with their jobs, and 43 percent scored in the high burnout range for job-related stress. Across all five countries, 17 to 39 percent of nurses plan to leave their jobs within the next year. General concerns included poor workplace environment, adequacy of staffing, scheduling problems, provision of ancillary services, loss of nurse executive positions, and lack of management support, while areas of job satisfaction included good working relationships with physicians and satisfaction with current pay. These responses reflect long-term problems within the profession.

A model of delivering care by advanced practice nurses has been tested with other patient populations. The 170 women and 194 infants randomized into a treatment group, compared to those in the ""usual care"" group, had 2 versus 9 infant deaths, 11 fewer preterm births, 77 percent versus 33 percent of twin pregnancies carried to term and fewer prenatal and infant rehospitalizations. Compared to ""usual care"" mothers and infants, the improved outcomes among the mothers and infants in the new model of care saved 750 hospital days and about $2.5 million. The new model of care has addressed an important health disparity for a vulnerable population subject to poor pregnancy outcomes.

Researchers examined data from women before, during, and after pregnancy, to study the prevalence of restless legs syndrome (RLS), a sleep disturbance involving unpleasant sensation and movement in the legs. Of those women who became pregnant, 23 percent reported experiencing RLS during their third trimester. The RLS sufferers had significantly lower serum levels of folate. They also had more difficulty falling asleep and a more depressed mood state. These findings indicate a need to reconsider what normal values are for ferritin and folate during pregnancy, as  618   well as dietary recommendations for folate in pregnant women. Results may be better night time sleep, improved daytime mood, and higher quality of life among pregnant women with RLS.

Maternity care is one of the most common health care services provided in the U.S., with total costs exceeding $20 billion in 1992. Nurse researchers analyzed the total costs in a small rural community of lowrisk maternity care for a freestanding birth center (FSBC), and compared those costs with those for the traditional medical model of care. While patient satisfaction was higher with the FSBC, and clinical outcomes were similar, the total costs were not significantly different, perhaps due to lower patient volumes at the FSBC.

Studies of cell-based therapies to treat a number of diseases have found that the transplantation of umbilical cord cells can be a useful alternative to the transplantation of bone marrow. Cord blood stem cells have a number of important advantages over bone marrow: They are easier to obtain than stem cells from bone marrow; treatments using cord blood stem cells can be less costly than bone marrow transplants; and, perhaps most importantly, cord blood stem cells are a perfect match for the child from whom they are collected, thus eliminating the difficult process of finding a matching donor and minimizing the risks of rejection. This is especially significant for ethnic minority populations who tend to be under-represented in the National Marrow Donor Program. The number of stem cells from the cord and placenta is usually insufficient for successful transplantation of those recipients who have a large body mass. Scientists, therefore, seek to improve culture systems in order to ""expand"" umbilical cord blood stem cells  the higher the dose of cells, the faster the transplanted cells will engraft and the better the chance of cure. To this end, researchers developed a culture method to successfully expand a population of stem cells (called CD34+) from umbilical cord blood for as long as 14 days. Moreover, after transplantation to an immunodeficient strain of mouse, some of the cells differentiated into mature blood cells, while other cells retained their stem cell status. When the progeny of the stem cells were recovered from the animals, they were found to retain their multilineage differentiation potential for up to 28 additional days. When the cells were then re-transplanted to a secondary animal and harvested once again, the stem cell progeny of the transplanted cells could be maintained for up to 14 more days in culture. This series of experiments showed, for the first time, that umbilical cord stem cells can be maintained and expanded while retaining multilineage differentiation potential over an extended period of time. This knowledge could lead to the development of culture systems for clinically feasible expansion of cord stem cells, and to long-term engraftment of these cells in human clinical trials.  619   Lewis ID, Almeida-Porada G, Du J, Lemischka IR, Moore KA, Zanjani ED, and Verfaillie CM: Umbilical cord blood cells capable of engrafting in primary, secondary, and tertiary xenogeneic hosts are preserved after ex vivo culture in a noncontact system.

I am a university research administrator and one of our NIH-funded investigators     would like to use a cell line that was created after August 9th, 2001, and it is not eligible for research using Federal funds. What should I tell the     investigator who wants to work with these cells in his laboratory?                 22.   I am an investigator that receives NIH funding and I am planning to derive   new human embryonic stem cell lines. Can I conduct the derivations in my laboratory, or do I need to find a non-university funded laboratory to do this work?                 23.   Can you explain what accounting principles are necessary to demonstrate that   unallowable charges are not being absorbed by NIH funded research, e.g., indirect costs?                 What are human embryonic stem cells?  Stem cells are cells that have the remarkable potential to develop into many different cell types in the body. Serving as a sort of repair system for the body, they can theoretically divide without limit to replenish other cells for as long as the person or animal is still alive. When a stem cell divides, each ""daughter"" cell has the potential to either remain a stem cell or become another type of cell with a more specialized function, such as a muscle cell, a red blood cell, or a brain cell.   Return to top   What classes of stem cells are there?  There are three classes of stem cells; totipotent, multipotent and pluripotent.      A fertilized egg is considered totipotent, meaning that its potential is total; it gives rise to all the different types of cells in the body.   Stem cells that can give rise to a small number of different cell types are generally called multipotent.   Pluripotent stem cells can give rise to any type of cell in the body except those needed to develop a fetus.     Return to top   When does NIH anticipate that more stem cell lines will become available?  As of April 18, 2003, there are 11 human embryonic stem cell lines that federally-supported researchers may purchase. This number is up from only one or two lines in Spring of 2002. The increased availability of the lines is a direct consequence of NIH’s funding of infrastructure awards to support cell providers to develop their eligible lines into distribution-quality, well-characterized cell lines. NIH anticipates adding at least one more line to this list in the very near future, with more to come. Up-to-date information on available lines can be found on the human embryonic stem cell  registry .   Return to top    Why not use adult stem cells instead of using human embryonic stem cells in research?  Human embryonic stem cells are thought to have much greater developmental potential than adult stem cells. This means that embryonic stem cells may be pluripotent –that is, able to give rise to cells found in all tissues of the embryo except for germ cells rather than being merely multipotent--restricted to specific subpopulations of cell types, as adult stem cells are thought to be.   Return to top    Who is responsible for setting the policy to allow Federal money to be used for human embryonic stem cell research?  As the head of the Executive Branch of the Federal Government, which includes the National Institutes of Health, the President of the United States has the final responsibility and authority to set Federal government policy for funding human embryonic stem cell research. But Congress has appropriations authority and can possibly override President’s decision.    Return to top    I have Parkinson’s Disease. Is there a clinical trial that I can participate in that uses stem cells as therapy?  The public may search a database of NIH-sponsored clinical trials at  http://www.clinicaltrials.gov . Enter the search terms of interest (in this case, “Parkinson’s Disease and stem cells”) to search for applicable clinical trials.   Return to top    I am a scientist funded by the NIH. How many cell lines are available to me and how do I get them?  As of April 18, 2003, there are 11 human embryonic stem cell lines that federally-supported researchers can purchase. NIH anticipates adding more cell lines in the very near future. The cell lines can be purchased by contacting the cell line providers directly. Information on the lines and how to contact providers can be found on the  NIH stem cell registry .    In addition, this site provides researchers with a unique NIH identifier code to apply for Federal funds to do research using human embryonic stem cells.   Return to top    Where can I donate umbilical cord stem cells?  NIH cannot accept donated umbilical cord stem cells from the general public. The American Red Cross maintains a Web page on donating cord blood at  http://www.redcross.org/services/biomed/0,1082,0_108_,00.html .   Return to top    May individual states pass laws to permit human embryonic stem cell research?  Individual states have the authority to pass laws to permit human embryonic stem cell research using state funds. Unless Congress passes a law that bans it, states may pay for research using human embryonic stem cell lines that are not eligible for Federal funding.   Return to top    I support the NIH using human embryonic stem cells in research. Can I donate money to the NIH to be used in this capacity?    Return to top   I'm interested in purchasing more than one cell line from the  NIH Stem Cell Registry . What is known about the status of the cell lines and their availability?    Many of the cell lines have been characterized as embryonic stem cells by detecting expression of surface antigen markers specific to embryonic stem cells, determining if the cells are pluripotent, and demonstrate that the cells are undifferentiated. A number of scientific publications have described the characterization of human embryonic stem cells. Although the characterization approaches may differ across laboratories, an example of the strategies used can be found in Thomson et al. (1998), Science, 282,1145-1147.     Providers of the federally eligible cells are working to make them available to researchers. This includes developing quality control measures to grow and reproduce the cell lines in sufficient numbers, having the administrative structure to receive and process requests, and establishing material transfer agreements with research purchasers. The providers of federally eligible cell lines have the most up-to-date information on availability. A list of these sources and contact information is available on the  NIH Stem Cell Registry    Return to top   Who owns the cells?  The stem cell lines remain the property of the individual stem cell providers, as listed on the  NIH Stem Cell Registry . Researchers may negotiate a material transfer agreement (MTA) with the cell providers in order to specify their rights and responsibilities concerning resulting data, publications, and potential patents. Examples of MTAs negotiated between the Department of Health and Human Services/NIH and various stem cell line providers are listed at  http://stemcells.nih.gov/news/transferAgreements.asp .   Return to top    I would like information on the NIH Symposium in June.  Please refer to the symposium website at:  http://www.masimax.com/nihstemcells/ .    Return to top    Why are doctors and scientists so excited about human embryonic stem cells?    Stem cells have potential in many different areas of health and medical research. To start with, studying stem cells will help us to understand how they transform into the dazzling array of specialized cells that make us what we are. Some of the most serious medical conditions, such as cancer and birth defects, are due to problems that occur somewhere in this process. A better understanding of normal cell development will allow us to understand and perhaps correct the errors that cause these medical conditions.     Another potential application of stem cells is making cells and tissues for medical therapies. Today, donated organs and tissues are often used to replace those that are diseased or destroyed. Unfortunately, the number of people needing a transplant far exceeds the number of organs available for transplantation. Pluripotent stem cells offer the possibility of a renewable source of replacement cells and tissues to treat a myriad of diseases, conditions, and disabilities including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, spinal cord injury, stroke, burns, heart disease, diabetes, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.    Return to top    Have human embryonic stem cells been used successfully to treat any human diseases yet?    Scientists have only been able to do experiments with human embryonic stem cells (hESC) since 1998, when a group led by Dr. James Thompson at the University of Wisconsin developed a technique to isolate and grow the cells. Moreover, Federal funds to support hESC research have only been available since August 9, 2001, when President Bush announced his decision on Federal funding for hESC research. Because many academic researchers rely on Federal funds to support their laboratories, they are just beginning to learn how to grow and use the cells. Thus, although hESC are thought to offer potential cures and therapies for many devastating diseases, research using them is still in its early stages.   Adult stem cells such as blood-forming stem cells in bone marrow (called hematopoietic stem cells, or HSCs) are currently the only type of stem cell commonly used to treat human diseases. Doctors have been transferring HSCs in bone marrow transplants for over 40 years. More advanced techniques of collecting, or ""harvesting"", HSCs are now used in order to treat leukemia, lymphoma and several inherited blood disorders.   The clinical potential of adult stem cells has also been demonstrated in the treatment of other human diseases that include diabetes and advanced kidney cancer. However, these newer uses have involved studies with a very limited number of patients.   Return to top    Where do stem cells come from?    Pluripotent stem cells are isolated from human embryos that are a few days old. Cells from these embryos can be used to create pluripotent stem cell ""lines""-- cell cultures that can be grown indefinitely in the laboratory. Pluripotent stem cell lines have also been developed from fetal tissue obtained from terminated pregnancies.   Return to top    Why do scientists want to use stem cell lines?  Once a stem cell line is established from a cell in the body, it is essentially immortal, no matter how it was derived. That is, the researcher using the line will not have to go through the rigorous procedure necessary to isolate stem cells again. Once established, a cell line can be grown in the laboratory indefinitely and cells may be frozen for storage or distribution to other researchers.     Stem cell lines grown in the lab provide scientists with the opportunity to “engineer” them for use in transplantation or treatment of diseases. For example, before scientists can use any type of tissue, organ, or cell for transplantation, they must overcome attempts by a patient's immune system to reject the transplant. In the future, scientists may be able to modify human stem cell lines in the laboratory by using gene therapy or other techniques to overcome this immune rejection. Scientists might also be able to replace damaged genes or add new genes to stem cells in order to give them characteristics that can ultimately treat diseases.   Return to top    What will be the best type of stem cell to use for therapy?  Pluripotent stem cells, while having great therapeutic potential, face formidable technical challenges. First, scientists must learn how to control their development into all the different types of cells in the body. Second, the cells now available for research are likely to be rejected by a patient's immune system. Another serious consideration is that the idea of using stem cells from human embryos or human fetal tissue troubles many people on ethical grounds.     Until recently, there was little evidence that multipotent adult stem cells could change course and provide the flexibility that researchers need in order to address all the medical diseases and disorders they would like to. New findings in animals, however, suggest that even after a stem cell has begun to specialize, it may be more flexible than previously thought.    There are currently several limitations to using adult stem cells. Although many different kinds of multipotent stem cells have been identified, adult stem cells that could give rise to all cell and tissue types have not yet been found. Adult stem cells are often present in only minute quantities and can therefore be difficult to isolate and purify. There is also evidence that they may not have the same capacity to multiply as embryonic stem cells do. Finally, adult stem cells may contain more DNA abnormalities – caused by sunlight, toxins and errors in making more DNA copies during the course of a lifetime. These potential weaknesses might limit the usefulness of adult stem cells.    Return to top    Does NIH fund embryonic stem cell research?    Research on human embryonic stem cell lines may receive NIH funding if the cell line meets the following criteria: removal of cells from the embryo must have been initiated before August 9, 2001, when the President outlined this policy; and the embryo from which the stem cell line was derived must no longer have had the possibility of developing further as a human being. The embryo must have been created for reproductive purposes but no longer be needed for them. Informed consent must have been obtained from the parent(s) for the donation of the embryo, and no financial inducements for donation are allowed.     In order to ensure that federal funds are used to support only stem cell research that is scientifically sound, legal, and ethical, NIH examines stem cell lines and maintains a  registry  of those lines that satisfy the criteria.   Return to top    Which research is best to pursue?    The development of stem cell lines that can produce many tissues of the human body is an important scientific breakthrough. This research has the potential to revolutionize the practice of medicine and improve the quality and length of life. Given the enormous promise of stem cells therapies for so many devastating diseases, NIH believes that it is important to simultaneously pursue all lines of research and search for the very best sources of these cells.   A more detailed primer on stem cells can be found at  http://stemcells.nih.gov/infoCenter/stemCellBasics.asp .    Return to top   I am a university research administrator and one of our NIH-funded investigators     would like to use a cell line that was created after August 9th, 2001, and     it is not eligible for research using Federal funds. What should I tell the     investigator who wants to work with these cells in his laboratory?    Institutions need to provide clear instructions to investigators who conduct   research that is ""unallowable"" under Federal research funding policy.   In laboratories where there is both Federal and non-Federal funding, investigators   and their staffs must separate allowable and unallowable activities in such   a way that permits the costs incurred in the research to be allocated consistently   to the appropriate funding source. In your example, for instance, the time   and effort of laboratory personnel working on the stem cell line created after   August 9, 2001, may not be charged to any Federal grant. Acquisition of equipment,   use of cell and tissue culture supplies in the project, and travel to a conference   to discuss or present this work likewise may not be federally supported.       Return to top      I am an investigator that receives NIH funding and I am planning to derive   new human embryonic stem cell lines. Can I conduct the derivations in my laboratory,   or do I need to find a non-university funded laboratory to do this work?      You may do the derivation in your university supported laboratory as long as:   1) you carefully and consistently allocate all costs of doing the derivation   to a non-Federal funding source; and 2) your university or research center   has in place a method of separating the costs of supporting your laboratory   so that any of the facilities and administrative (F&A) costs allocable   to your new stem cell line work are excluded from the federal share of the   organized research cost base, per the provisions of OMB Circular A-21.       Return to top      Can you explain what accounting principles are necessary to demonstrate that   unallowable charges are not being absorbed by NIH funded research, e.g., indirect   costs?      The cost principles contained in OMB Circular A-21,  http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a076/trans21final.html    particularly with regard to treatment of allowable and unallowable costs, contain   the necessary guidance. Federal policy is explicitly clear that no Federal   funding may be used, either directly or indirectly, to support human embryonic   stem cell research outside the criteria established by the President on August   9, 2001, i.e., it is unallowable. Therefore, the direct costs of such work   must be charged only to non-Federal sources of funding. With respect to indirect   costs, also known as facilities and administrative (F&A) costs, institutions   engaged in unallowable stem cell work must be able to demonstrate that none   of the costs of supporting this work have been included in the rates established   and used to charge F&A costs to federally funded research.

Dr. Richard J. Hodes, Director, National Institute on Aging (NIA), presided. In accordance with the provisions of Public Law 92-463, the meeting was open to the public on Wednesday, February 9, from 8:00 to 11:00 a.m. and again from 12:45 to 2:45 p.m. The meeting was closed to the public on Wednesday, February 9, from 11:00 to 11:45 a.m. for the discussion of the Intramural Research Program and from 3:00 p.m. to adjournment for the review, discussion, and evaluation of grant applications in accordance with the provisions set forth in Sections 552(b)(c)(4) and 552(b)(c)(6), Title 5, U.S. Code, and Section 10(d) of Public Law 92-463.1 Council Participants: Dr. Dennis Ausiello Dr. Elizabeth Barrett-Connor Dr. John Cambier Dr. Judith Campisi Dr. Rose Dobrof Dr. Fred H.

This procedure only applied to applications that were discussed individually, not to ""en bloc"" actions.  1   Absent: Dr. John Rowe The Council Roster, which gives titles, affiliations, and terms of appointment, is appended to these minutes as Attachment A. Members of the Public Present: Nancy Aldrich, Aging Research & Training News Shirley V. Brown, Gerontology News Tom Hogan, The Blue Sheet Sharon Moss, American Speech, Language, and Hearing Association In addition to NIA Staff, other Federal employees attending were: Jill Einstein, CSR/RRB/NIH Elliott Postow, CSR/RRB/NIH I. CALL TO ORDER  Dr. Hodes called the meeting to order at 8:00 a.m. and welcomed members and introduced new members. Other announcements included the appointments, within NIA, of Dr. Huber Warner as the Associate Director of the Biology of Aging Program, and Dr. Mark Mattson as the new laboratory chief of the Laboratory of Neurosciences. He also commented on the current status of the NIA strategic plan--that it has now been submitted for review by NIH, may be further modified to reflect comments that result from that review, and will ultimately be released to the public. Director's Status Report After introductions, Dr. Hodes began the meeting with a tribute to the late Ms. Gail Jacoby, formerly NIA's Director of the Office of Planning, Analysis, and Evaluation. Ms. Jacoby, her husband, and younger daughter died in a private plane crash. She is sorely missed by the NIA and NIH community. Dr. Hodes reported that Dr. Harold Varmus, NIH Director, had resigned, effective December 31, 1999. Dr. Ruth Kirschstein is Acting Director while the search for a new director is ongoing. Other staff changes are described in the Director's Status Report which is attached to these minutes as Attachment B. Dr. Hodes noted that for FY 2000, 64.3 percent of the NIA budget is in the Research Project Grant category (RPG), which is above the NIH average and reflects the NIA commitment to investigatorinitiated research. The Research Management and Support (RMS) category, at 3.4 percent, represents a relative decrease in resources to carry out scientific management activities and program development. The Intramural Research Program constitutes about 9.9 percent of the Institute budget, approximately the NIH average level. Contracts and training components received increases of 4.3 and 6.0 percent respectively. 2   In pointing out budget trends, Dr. Hodes noted that from 1993 through 1998 increases to the NIA budget ranged between three and seven percent; from 1999 through 2000 increases ranged from 15 to 16 percent--two years of substantial growth. Although the success rate increased with modest increases in appropriation, paradoxically the greater increase in appropriations in 1999 was accompanied by a drop in success rates. A major factor contributing to this paradox was that average grant costs increased substantially as the budget increased substantially. Another contributing factor was that the number of applications increased as the budget was expected to grow. A final factor is that years in which there is a large increase in appropriation, in turn, create pressure on the out-year commitment base. Strategies are being examined that may reduce the extent of the out-year commitment that is occasioned by a single year in which a large increase is received. These include (1) supporting shorter-term research projects, (2) supporting infrastructure projects which are much needed and which usually have high first year costs and low out-year costs, and (3) forward funding outstanding projects from the following year. Council members asked what level of increase would be needed to sustain current success rates and about methods of tracking performance that include the number of funded projects from new as well as established investigators. Dr. Hodes acknowledged that there are other measures of success than success rate but pointed out that all such measures are poor surrogates for the scientific advances that are enabled by the kind of funding increase that NIA has received. He commented that it was through the determined efforts of Senator Hatfield and a few colleagues that these increases have been possible. Dr. Hodes also pointed out that it is impossible to predict reliably what grant costs will be; therefore, it is difficult to provide an accurate estimate of what will be needed to sustain or improve upon current success rates. Future Meeting Dates May 25-26, 2000 (Thursday-Friday) September 27-28, 2000 (Wednesday-Thursday) February 6-7, 2001 (Tuesday-Wednesday) May 22-23, 2001 (Tuesday-Wednesday) September 24-25, 2001 (Monday-Tuesday) A change in the meeting date in September 2001 was pointed out. Consideration of Minutes of Last Meeting The minutes of the September 23-24, 1999 meeting were approved as submitted. II. REVIEW OF THE NIA MINORITY RESEARCH PROGRAM  Dr. Taylor Harden, Assistant to the Director for Special Populations, NIA, presented an update on the NACA review of the minority aging research programs at NIA. The review panel, headed by Dr. James Jackson, was charged to review NIA's programs on minority aging. At the same time, the 3   committee was asked to assess NIA's programs to recruit and train researchers from diverse ethnic and racial backgrounds. The panel plans to have a final draft of their recommendations ready for Council's perusal and adoption at the May 2000 Council meeting. In Council discussion, it was suggested that a copy of the data put together for the review panel which covered all four NIA Extramural Programs should be given to new Council members. III. WORKING GROUP ON PROGRAM  The first topic at the Working Group on Program (WGOP) was discussion of a recommendation for Council review of programs. Discussion focused on ways to standardize the review process to facilitate extramural program comparisons and to reduce staff burden in preparation of materials for reviewers. NIA staff recommended using sourcebooks as basic material (data) for review. WGOP members noted that sourcebooks do not include quantitative indices of outcome measures such as lists of publications in prominent journals (by grantees), grantee awards, or other objective measures of success. In addition, sourcebooks do not focus on where a field is going and how much of the program's success is attributable to NIA grantees versus what is attributable to efforts outside of NIA-supported research. A subgroup--Drs. Vaupel and Siegler in conjunction with Dr. Gage--was asked to work with staff to modify this proposal to supplement the sourcebook with outcome measures and other comparison data. Drs. Vaupel and Siegler reported on a short meeting about improving efficiency and efficacy of review by using Council and staff time more efficiently, and by balancing outcome measures of past performance with consideration of future opportunities for research and resource allocations. They will continue to work, communicate with staff, and then meet and report at the May meeting. Council discussion revealed expressions in favor both of more direct interaction between Council and staff and of benchmarking as an approach to evaluating NIA-supported research in the context of the broader fields of science. The next topic was the May review of the Behavioral and Social Research (BSR) Program. The BSR program has functioned with its current organization for 25 years. A different program structure might be more appropriate as a consequence of scientific progress and a greater focus on interdisciplinary research. Reviewers will be encouraged to examine gaps in the program areas such as behavioral and social aspects of genetics and an interface between psychology and physiology. The next topic was Advisory meetings. One of Council's responsibilities is to review concepts for workshops and conferences that are to be advisory to the Institute. The NIA is required to have all advisory input from groups, organizations, or processes that come to the Institute channeled through appropriate means and mechanisms as set forth in the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act. These generally involve action by a chartered advisory group. An example of a meeting that fits the advisory meeting criteria is one in which a group is brought together by NIA to advise the Institute in a manner likely to have direct implications for allocation of resources. Because advisory meetings benefit from the broad vision and perspective of Council, Council members are invited to attend; the meetings and recommendations from them are presented to Council for advice and 4   comment. There were reports of two meetings held--""Testing Biological Intervention to Promote Healthy Aging,"" and ""Genetics of Alzheimer's Disease."" Council accepted these reports. There were actions on meetings planned including ""Social Personality in Adulthood and Aging Research Opportunities,"" ""Health Care Organization Research,"" ""Behavioral Intervention Research,"" ""Behavioral Medicine and Biopsychology,"" ""Testosterone Replacement in Men,"" and an advisory panel on ""Exceptional Longevity."" After discussion and recommendations by Council, Council approved these and recommended to Dr. Hodes that they be supported. The fourth item on the agenda, the progress report on the review of minority aging programs, was spoken of earlier in the Council meeting. Dr. Gage summarized the WGOP's discussion of microarray resources for extramural use. As information emerges about the genome, there is interest in how multiple genes are expressed within a particular setting at a given time. The NIA Intramural Program has expertise in the production of microarrays that allows multiple genes to be screened simultaneously. Given strong interest in such arrays among the extramural community, Dr. Kevin Becker is leading an intramural effort to tie a service of providing arrays to the community to the goal of collecting from the community data obtained via the arrays. The Intramural Research Program (IRP) thus intends to develop a central data bank on genetic expression. The proposed intramural facility is meant to complement rather than compete with existing commercial facilities. In discussion, staff commented that a parallel effort has been going on among the NIA's extramural staff to make administrative supplements available for extramural investigators to purchase or use equipment to facilitate this kind of genome research. Council members commended the NIA leadership for this activity and asked how NIA's effort relates to similar efforts in other Institutes. Dr. Hodes responded that other intramural efforts are ongoing and coordination is developing. Although the WGOP had discussed review issues concerning the Center for Scientific Review (CSR), discussion at Council was held until after the presentation from Dr. Ehrenfeld, the Director of CSR. The seventh topic on the WGOP agenda was: Coding Grant Awards for Alzheimer's Disease relevance. Coding of grants was said to be helpful to document to Congress and the public the levels of expenditures for various types of research. Discussion followed on the NIA staff efforts to develop a more accurate and useful coding system and evaluate the extent to which NIA-supported research is investigating Alzheimer's disease. The procedures will be shown to outside scientists and representatives of the Alzheimer's Association to obtain their input and comments. The final topic was the Statement of Understanding which is the agreement on operating procedures between the Council and the Institute staff that defines which applications and actions come to the Council and which the Council allows the staff to act on without consulting Council. The Working Group recommended approval.  5   The Council voted to approve the Statement of Understanding. Council then reviewed and discussed the data presented both in the Annual Data Report and in the Statistical package for the current Council round. Dr. Hodes explained that the data provide a snapshot of NIA activities and provide a first-cut on some outcome measures of NIA initiatives and programs. Council discussion centered on the sharp increase in success rate for program project applications. These large grants may be seen as limiting opportunities for new investigators seeking support for regular research grants, although members acknowledged that the large projects themselves may support new investigators. Dr. Hodes indicated that the topic of large (PO1-like) grants and smaller grants will be placed on the agenda of a future meeting of the WGOP. IV. REVIEW OF THE INTRAMURAL PROGRAM LABORATORY OF NEUROSCIENCE  Dr. Dan Longo, Scientific Director, explained that review of each intramural laboratory takes place on a four-year cycle, a timeline that allows for review of all components of the intramural program. Presentations of intramural laboratory reviews made to Council are based upon reviews that have taken place one calendar year before, providing time for response to the review to have occurred. In the past year, many changes have been made in the Intramural Program prompted by the peer review from the Board of Scientific Counselors in May 1998. The work of the Laboratory of Neurosciences (LNS) has been strengthened. Dr. Stanley Rapoport, former Chief of the LNS based in Bethesda, now heads the Laboratory's Section on Brain Physiology and Metabolism. Dr. Mark Mattson was recruited as the new Chief of the LNS based in Baltimore at the Gerontology Research Center (GRC). A new Clinical Director, Dr. Darryl Abernethy, joined the Intramural Program in April 1999. Several other areas of active growth are the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging and the Laboratories of Endocrinology and Cardiology and recruitments in those areas are underway. The first speaker of the session, Dr. Stanley Rapoport, reported on his research on phospholipid action and brain signal transduction. Phospholipids participate in brain signal transduction and neuroplasticity. Furthermore, abnormal phospholipid metabolism contributes to numerous human brain diseases, including neuropsychiatric disorders, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and Parkinson's disease. Yet, compared with recent advances in imaging and understanding in vivo brain glucose metabolism and blood flow, progress on brain phospholipid metabolism in vivo has been limited. Dr. Rapoport's goal has been to develop and apply a new ""fatty acid"" method to quantify and image the in vivo kinetics of brain phospholipid metabolism in health and disease. With regard to signal transduction, it is known that neurotransmitters, after binding to receptors at nerve synapses, can activate certain signaling enzymes, including phospholipase A2, phospholipase C, and adenylate cyclase. Activation releases ""second messenger"" molecules that engender biochemical reactions to change behavior. One of these molecules, arachidonic acid, is released by activation of phospholipase A2.  6   Over the last 10 years, Dr. Rapoport reported that his laboratory has developed a method to image and quantify arachidonate release in the brain in vivo. The method involves injecting intravenously a radiotracer of arachidonic acid, then measuring its incorporation into brain phospholipids by quantitative autoradiography or direct chemical analysis in animals, or positron emission tomography (PET) in humans (Robinson, P. J., et al., Brain Res. Rev., 17: 187-214, 1992; Rapoport, S. I., Neurochem. Res., 24: 1403-1415, 1999). With this method, his group has shown in rats that the rate of arachidonate release from brain phospholipids is very dynamic, some 100-fold more rapid than previously thought, consistent with the roles of this second messenger in signaling. Release of arachidonic acid in rat brain is suppressed 80 percent by chronic treatment with lithium (Chang, M. C. J., et al., Neurosci. Lett., 220: 171-174, 1996), a drug that has been used to treat bipolar (manic-depressive) disorder for 50 years without its mechanism of action being agreed on. The suppression is due to reduced molecular activity (reduced mRNA and protein levels) of a phospholipase A2 that selectively releases arachidonate from brain phospholipids (Rintala, J., et al., Neuroreport 10(18): 3887-3990, 1999). Thus, Dr. Rapoport proposes that the mechanism of action of lithium in bipolar disorder is to reduce the turnover of arachidonic acid in brain. In animal models of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, his laboratory has also shown that disturbed arachidonate-related signaling occurs in response to stimulation by the neuroreceptors, acetylcholine and dopamine, respectively. With Dr. William Eckelman at the Department of Nuclear Medicine at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Dr. Rapoport's group then showed that arachidonate-related brain signaling can be imaged in humans using positron emission (PET) (Rapoport, S. I., J. Neurochemistry, Suppl., 74: S21, 2000). On the basis of these studies, they propose that it is possible to extend the method with PET to examine and understand altered cholinergic and dopaminergic signaling in patients with Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease, respectively. Such altered signaling likely underlies characteristic memory and motor disabilities in these patients. Questions from Council members focused on whether the time course of lithium induction was of the same order as the rate of arachidonate release observed in the reported research (The research team is currently exploring time-course effects.); whether the specificity of the effect (which is specific to one of thirteen phospholipids identified in humans) would hamper attempts to use it to image lithium activity in humans (Dr. Rapoport's proposed approach is to use a provocative test of a drug to stimulate arichidonate activity and thus increase sensitivity.); the many effects that lithium has in the central nervous system (Dr. Rapoport is proposing the phospholipid-arichodonate route as a final common pathway of action.); whether the research team has used in vitro techniques to investigate mechanisms of action (Dr. Rapoport indicated that the long-term effects of lithium require an intact brain in which to be demonstrated. However, follow up studies on hypothesized mechanisms would be appropriate for in vitro techniques.); whether, in neurodegeneration, the effects of disturbed arachidonate-related signaling lead to cell loss, or to change of receptor activity (The studies have not yet revealed evidence one way or another.); the potential of the imaging method to be sensitive to changes in receptor action prior to cell loss (Dr. Rapaport believes that the technique is very promising in this regard and could lead to presymptomatic identification of Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease.). Members also commented that given data on the down-regulation of neurotransmitter receptors in normal aging, the method offers potential to link this action to the 7   responsible signaling pathways and sought whether other investigators were able to image signaling in vivo. (Though one Japanese researcher is making some progress, no other investigators have developed a successful method.) Dr. Longo introduced the second speaker, Dr. Mark Mattson, NIA's new Chief of the Laboratory of Neurosciences. Dr. Mattson recently joined the NIA, coming from the University of Kentucky. He has already published over 250 papers on a variety of aspects of neurodegenerative diseases. Dr. Mattson's goals are to understand why neurons degenerate by using genetic models, cell culture, and in vivo models where nerve cells are subjected to conditions that are thought to be occurring in the brain during aging and during major degenerative disorders. His move to NIA lets him link his ongoing research with resources that allow research findings from related areas to be linked to research on neurodegeneration. To illustrate the approach, he described work completed while at the University of Kentucky and ongoing work at NIA's Gerontology Research Center (GRC). The studies completed at Kentucky included:  Work on a proposed free radical-calcium pathway that may be causally involved in the toxic effects of amyloid beta peptide. (The amyloid beta peptide [A] is widely thought to play an important role in the cascade of events that lead to Alzheimer's disease.)  Research using both cultured neurons and a mouse model found that presenilin mutations cause alterations in calcium regulation in the endoplasmic reticulum (an organelle within nerve cells) that render the cells vulnerable to increased oxidative stress, impaired energy availability, and impaired glucose availability. Mutations in presenilin have been causally linked to early onset Alzheimer's disease. (Guo, Q., et al., Nature Med. 5: 101-107, 1999.)  Work focused on properties of synaptic terminals and dendrites. Dr. Mattson's work has contributed to the accumulating evidence that the factors initiating cell death can all occur in synaptic terminals and dendrites. His research team has also found that neurotrophic factor receptors are located in synaptic terminals. These can stabilize mitochondrial function at the synapse independently of transcription-mediated effects. Among the ongoing work that Dr. Mattson reviewed:  Dr. Kruman working in Dr. Mattson's laboratory has been exploring the effects of homocysteine on neurons. Homocysteine, a compound whose levels are elevated in plasma and which appears to be a prominent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, also shows elevated levels in Alzheimer's patients. Dr. Kruman has found using in vitro hippocampal preparations that homocysteine does induce neuronal cell death and that it induces DNA damage in cells. However, that damage can be prevented by treating neurons with the compound, 3-amino-benzamide.  8    Working with Dr. Nigel Greig at GRC, Dr. Mattson is taking advantage of work on the P53 protein. Much evidence indicates that the P53 protein plays a role in tumor suppression by initiating cell death in cells that appear to be precancerous. Additional work had found that pifithrin-alpha, PFT-Alpha, is itself a selective inhibitor of P53. Dr. Mattson reported that P53 levels are elevated in degenerating neurons and raised the possibility that, although P53 is protective against cancer formation, the same action on neurons may lead to neuronal degeneration. He and Dr. Greig found that at moderate concentrations in in vitro preparations, PFT-Alpha is protective against A and staurosporine, a drug that induces cell death.  Working with Dr. Hodes, Dr. Mattson is exploring telomerase as a way to protect neurons in the adult brain from insult. The telomerase enzyme protects loss of DNA from chromosome ends during cell division. Dr. Mattson has found that agents that suppress TERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase, the catalytic subunit of telomerase) activity in developing neurons also make the neurons more vulnerable to various insults. TERT is not normally present in the adult brain. Therefore, with Dr. Hodes, he is trying to express TERT in transgenic mice such that neurons in the adult brain will have telomerase in order to investigate whether its presence protects against neuronal insults associated with neurodegenerative disorders. (Fu, W., et al., J. Mol. Neurosci. 14: 3-15, 2000.)  Dr. Mattson is also taking advantage of expertise on dietary restriction at GRC to further his work on dietary restriction and neurodegeneration. He is focusing both on identifying the full range of effects of dietary restriction on the brain and exploring whether a model that considers dietary restriction a mild stressor accounts for its effects on the brain. In prior work, his group has found both that dietary-restricted rats are more resistant to several neuronal insults than control rats and that dietary-restricted rats show elevated levels of heat-shock protein and neurotrophic factors in parts of the brain--suggesting that dietary restriction is acting as a mild stressor. In addition:  Recent work by Zhihong Guo, a postdoctoral researcher in Dr. Mattson's group, has shown a possible link between dietary restriction and Alzheimer's disease. It is known that A impairs the ability of cells to take up glucose and maintain ion homeostasis. It also impairs mitochondrial function. Using a preparation from isolated synaptic terminals, Dr. Guo has found that the terminals of dietary-restricted animals appear to be more resistant to neuronal insult and to show elevated levels of heat-shock proteins. Similarly the effects of neuronal insult on mitochondrial function are reduced in dietary restricted animals.  In related work at GRC, Drs. Lane, Roth, and Ingram had found that dietary supplementation with 2-deoxy-D-glucose, which restricts energy availability to cells, also mimics some of the effects of dietary restriction. Dr. Mattson's group found that when the same compound is administered to rats who are later exposed to neuronal insults that mimic Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases, and stroke, neurons in the brains of the rats administered the compound are more resistant to the insults than control animals. The team also reported evidence that the compound appears to act as a mild stressor. (Duan, W. and M. P. Mattson, J. Neurosci. Res. 57: 185-206, 1999.)  9   Questions from Council members included: (1) whether episodic feeding with maintained calories has the same effect as dietary restriction (Episodic feeding in rats leads to reduced calorie consumption which has the same effect as continuous feeding at the same reduced calorie level.); (2) why telomerase is favored as an approach with post-mitotic cells (The neurons on which the reported effects of telomerase were observed were not dividing. Dr. Mattson's group is exploring another effect of telomerase beyond adding DNA onto chromosomes during meiosis.); (3) whether drugdiscovery targets are suggested by the amyloid-free radical-calcium pathway (Antioxidants and agents that stabilize calcium homeostasis are logical candidates. Inhibitors of beta-secretase are also suggested. However, the approach depends on whether the target is a final common pathway that may be associated with several diseases, or an earlier part of the cascade that may be associated with a single disease.); (4) whether fluid intake was controlled in the dietary restricted animals (It was not.); (5) whether the endoplasmic reticulum might be a common site for the aberrant processing that leads to Alzheimer's disease (Dr. Mattson concurred and acknowledged that the work from several laboratories is implying a common abnormality in the endoplasmic reticulum.); and (6) whether the manipulations reported had been investigated on P53 knockout mice (No.). V. DISCUSSION OF THE INTRAMURAL RESEARCH PROGRAM  This portion of the meeting was closed to the public in accordance with the determination that it was concerned with matters exempt from mandatory disclosure under Sections 552b(c)(4) and 552b(c)(6), Title 5, U.S. Code and Section 10(d) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. Appendix).2 VI. PEER REVIEW ISSUES  Dr. Ellie Ehrenfeld, Director, Center for Scientific Review, reviewed her efforts to manage review in a way that would serve the scientific community well. Therefore, when she came to NIH, she reached out to the community and learned that most concerns about review focused on the organization and composition of study sections. Specifically, there was concern that emerging areas of science do not fit into existing review groups and that existing review groups lack the breadth to conduct quality reviews of the increasing multi- and interdisciplinary research projects. On the other hand, some expressed concern that areas of science that are relatively unproductive are garnering more resources than they should. In short, she pointed out that review groups have evolved over time and that it is appropriate to do a comprehensive assessment to see if NIH has the right spectrum of study sections to adequately review current and future science. A panel was convened in 1998 with members selected for vision, breadth, and past contributions to development and directions of various scientific fields. The panel was asked to examine the organization of integrated review groups. These are clusters of study sections organized to review applications in a broad field with flexibility to move applications easily within the cluster to the study 2  For the record, it is noted that members absented themselves from the meeting when the Council discussed items which may have resulted in a conflict of interest for the member.  10   section that can offer a particular application the best review. Phase I of the assessment considered the structure, scope, and organization of the clusters and how they function. The Phase I Boundaries Report proposed a set of integrated review groups, cultural norms that affect reviewer behavior, and principles for establishment of study sections. The report was posted for comment, and more than 800 comments from individuals and groups were received and considered. A Phase II implementation plan is being completed with the goal of choosing individual sciencedriven study sections to populate the integrated review groups. The scientific community will be involved in study section design and in the evaluation that will take place once the new organization is operational. Challenges to be dealt with in Phase II include the need for a critical mass of applications to review, a balance between depth and breadth, and the decision that study sections should serve more than a single Institute. Changes already have been made in response to comments received, including the addition of an aging research review group. Phase II is expected to include interaction with several advisory groups. While the system is being designed, plans for its evaluation are being developed. These include clearance to survey reviewers, applicants, and Institute staff before the new study sections are in place (baseline data collection) and afterwards. Lastly, external advisory groups are being formed for each integrated review group. About once every five years, each integrated review group will be site visited and assessed by its advisory/oversight committee on, e.g., scope of the science being considered by the study section, study section composition, and expertise. The Scientific Review Administrators (SRAs) and study section chair will be evaluated as well. Dr. Ehrenfeld emphasized that the task is exciting and challenging but the result should be a more flexible review system that attends to scientific status, future directions, and quality review. A Council member asked whether Councils will be involved in the process, particularly in the evaluation. Dr. Ehrenfeld noted that Council members might help suggest external scientists to help with design issues as well as with the evaluation that will occur about 18 months after the changes are in place. Another Council member suggested that the definition of a reviewer's term be made more flexible in order to make recruitment of qualified reviewers more likely. Dr. Ehrenfeld indicated awareness of this issue and said that some accommodations already are being made, but the options need to be systematized and advertised. The difficulty of recruiting adequate numbers of outstanding reviewers in a small field like aging was addressed. Dr. Ehrenfeld also noted that changes in academic health centers also impact on availability of reviewers in clinical areas. In response to an inquiry about the kinds of pilot studies underway, Dr. Ehrenfeld said that they include shared slots (two or three people fill a single area of expertise but only one attends any given meeting). When asked about senior observers or participants who assume different roles in review from the other members, Dr. Ehrenfeld said that that experiment yielded mixed response. There was resentment from some reviewers that the senior members spoke but did not study and prepare reviews on the applications. Having two classes of study section members may bring more problems than desirable--much depends on the individual. Training study section chairs and members is particularly important to maintain balance and high quality review. A well-trained chair who is 11   sensitive to the group dynamics may be a better solution than bringing in an overseer or senior scientist whose role is different from that of the other members. The option was brought up of a continuous off-line (in contrast to traditional in-person meetings of NIH review groups) review process that might expedite review and enable more reviews to occur simultaneously, or for pre-meeting electronic communication among reviewers to better focus the discussion that takes place at meetings. Another issue raised was conflict of interest and its impact on review, particularly in small fields of science. Dr. Ehrenfeld mentioned that Dr. Varmus appointed a trans-NIH committee to look at conflict of interest rules and NIH's interpretation of them. NIH is grappling with how to find a better balance between regulations that will allow expertise for high quality review yet maintain aspects of conflict of interest rules that protect their intent. The need for reviewers representing cultural, ethnic, race, income, and gender diversity was raised. Dr. Ehrenfeld responded that there are many constraints placed on nomination slates. Databases are searched to develop them. Scientific societies are especially useful when they provide staff with pre-vetted lists of potential reviewers whom they know are qualified, having good judgment and a good sense of fairness. In the end, the quality and success of the peer review system rests with the reviewers. Therefore, it is important that they be active scientists who are familiar with writing grant applications and who are grant recipients. Dr. Ehrenfeld was thanked for an informative, open, and stimulating discussion. VII. PROGRAM HIGHLIGHTS  Dr. Warner, Associate Director of the Biology of Aging Program, introduced Dr. Carol Greider who spoke on: The Role of Telomeres in Cellular Senescence and Aging. Telomeres are highly repetitive sequences of DNA located at the ends of chromosomes. Telomeres protect the ends of chromosomes from both shortening and from participating in deleterious rearrangements. Experiments conducted over the last 15 years have shown that telomeres are maintained by the enzyme telomerase, which is a DNA polymerase with an essential RNA component that provides the template for the addition of telomeric DNA repeats to chromosome ends. The enzyme telomerase has been implicated in both cancer and cellular senescence. If one looks at the length of telomeres in primary human cells that are dividing in culture, telomerase activity is off and the telomeres shorten progressively each time the cell replicates its DNA and divides. However, in mammalian germline cells, including humans, telomerase activity is on and telomere length is maintained because telomerase is able to add lost sequences to the chromosome ends. Normal human cells have a limited division potential (50-60 divisions per individual cell). After a predetermined number of cell divisions, normal cells undergo a process of replicative senescence and cease dividing. However, immortalized cell lines and cancer cells are able to reactivate the silent telomerase enzyme and maintain telomere length after several hundred cell divisions, thus promoting unlimited cell divisions without cellular senescence.  12   To further study the role of telomeres and the telomerase enzyme in normal biology, Drs. Carol Greider and Ron DePinho created a knockout (KO) mouse that completely lacked the telomerase enzyme. This was accomplished by deleting the mTR gene that encodes the essential RNA template of the telomerase enzyme resulting in a total lack of telomerase activity in the mTR KO mice. Extended breeding of the telomerase KO mice to generation 7 revealed a progressive shortening of the telomeres and increasing chromosome fusions with each generation accompanied by a progressive decline in fertility. Therefore, the inability to maintain the length of telomeres when the function of telomerase is compromised actually leads to chromosome fusion events that can lead to genetic instability and trigger the apoptosis program and cell death. Further analysis of the telomerase KO mice suggested that telomerase activity is actually required for the growth of tumor cells in vivo. This was studied by cross breeding the telomerase KO mice with INK4a mice, mice that lack two tumor suppressor genes, p16 and p19, and normally develop tumors at a very high rate compared to normal mice. Comparison of INK4a mice with and without telomerase activity revealed a 50 percent reduction in tumor incidence in the telomerase deficient mice after the fifth generation. In mice of earlier generations no difference in tumor incidence was noted indicating that it is not the absence of the telomerase enzyme per se but rather the short telomeres generated after five generations that leads to the inability of spontaneous tumors to grow. However, unexpected results were found when the telomerase KO and p53 KO tumor prone mice were crossbred. The p53 tumor suppressor gene is involved in the maintenance of genome stability. In the absence of p53 and telomerase activity, an increased tumor incidence was noted. Thus, loss of both genes acts cooperatively to increase genetic instability that ultimately results in an increased tumor incidence in mice with non-functional p53 and telomerase genes. (Blasco et al., Cell 91: 2534, 1997; Lee et al., Nature 392: 569-574, 1998; Chin et al., Cell 97: 527-538, 1999) Dr. Elizabeth Barrett-Connor, Council member, was introduced by Dr. Evan Hadley, Associate Director of the Geriatrics Program. She presented data from the Rancho Bernardo study that has been ongoing for 28 years. Participants were enrolled between 1972 and 1974 and attended a follow-up visit between 1984 and1987 when blood was drawn for the evaluation of sex hormone levels. The objective was to determine the role of sex hormones as predictors of chronic diseases of aging, such as diabetes, heart disease and osteoporosis. It was observed that while total testosterone changes little in men until very old age, bioavailable testosterone decreases markedly with age. Thus at ages 50-59 only 2.5 percent of men are hypogonadal, while 35 percent are hypogonadal in the ninth decade. In women with intact ovaries, total testosterone increases with age so that premenopausal levels of testosterone are maintained or even increase, and bioavailable testosterone remains constant postmenopause. Women who had a hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy have significantly lower levels of both total and bioavailable testosterone than women who had a natural menopause. Interestingly, hysterectomized women whose ovaries were conserved have intermediate testosterone levels.  13   Because men have 20 times as much testosterone, but also 4 times the amount of estrogen as postmenopausal women, attributing gender differences between postmenopausal women and men on the basis of estradiol may be unwarranted. Dr. Barrett-Connor's group had hypothesized that testosterone would correlate positively with bone density, and indeed there is a significant association at radius, spine, and hip in men. However, only a weak association between testosterone and bone density is observed in women. In contrast, in both sexes, estrogen is significantly associated with bone density at all sites measured. (Ferrini and Barrett-Connor, Am. J. Epidemiol. 147, 1998) Although testosterone is reputed to be a health hazard for men, when relationships between testosterone and common risk factors for cardiovascular disease and depression were examined, no significant associations were found between testosterone and blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, or BMI (body mass index). Total testosterone did not appear to be associated with cardiovascular death. Similarly, neither testosterone nor estradiol were related to heart disease in women. In men (but not in women) higher testosterone levels were associated with less depression as measured by Beck's Depression Index. (Barrett-Connor et al., J. Clin. Endocrinol. and Metab. 84, 1999) Twelve cognitive measures were evaluated to examine the relationship between estradiol and testosterone and cognitive performance. In men, low estradiol and high testosterone levels predicted better performance on cognitive function tests. Women who had higher testosterone levels scored better on the MiniMental Status test, but higher estrogen levels were not associated with better cognitive function scores. (Barrett-Connor and Goodman-Gruen, J. Am. Geriatric Soc. 47, 1999; J. Clin. Endocrinol. and Metab. 84, 1999) Intervention studies using improved methods to deliver physiologic doses of testosterone by dermal patch are being contemplated to clarify the clinical relevance of observed interesting relationships with sex hormones. A better understanding of testosterone and estrogen metabolism may provide useful insights into differential susceptibilities to some of the chronic diseases of aging. Council members asked Dr. Barrett-Connor to clarify the nature of the sample. Dr. Barrett-Connor explained that women on hormone replacement therapies were excluded and, because of limited funding, the study sample was largely Caucasian. They asked whether a ratio measure of testosterone to estradiol levels would provide a clearer picture. Dr. Barrett-Connor responded that when her group had employed ratio measures, testosterone levels alone continued to drive the effects. Finally, a Council member asked Dr. Barrett-Connor's opinions on why her data show no relation between estrogen and cognitive function. Dr. Barrett-Connor expressed the view that prior reports of relationships were confounded by inadequately controlled selection effects. VIII.
