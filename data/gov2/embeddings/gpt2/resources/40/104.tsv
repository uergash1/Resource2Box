Inaugurated in 1997, Yahoo! Mail serves over 260 million users. [ 2 ]  Currently, Yahoo! offers two versions of Yahoo! Mail: an  Outlook -like  Ajax  interface powered by Yahoo!'s  Zimbra  introduced in 2007, as well as the traditional static-web-page ""Yahoo! Mail Classic,"" which continues the availability of the simpler 1997-2006 interface for the brand's considerable installed base of users. In early 2008, Yahoo! started offering unlimited mail storage even to its non-paying users, in response to heated competition in the free-webmail market segment.

Mail began with  JoJo Healy ,  Yahoo! 's resident  investment banker  since November 1996, who has dealt with every Yahoo! acquisition since it was created. ""No one knows your business like your employees,"" he said. According to him, the main question was always to consider whether to ""build, buy or rent."" The answer really depended on the growth of competitors and the current position of the company. The main reason to buy things was to gain speed to market.   The growth in the number of  Internet  users eventually boosted the  e-mail  technology, but also created a very competitive environment where the winner was the first company to launch a successful e-mail service and attract potential users. E-mail became one of the most important features of a Web company as it would mean regular visits from e-mail users to the website.   When Hotmail and Mirabilis (the creator of the instant messenger  ICQ ) were looking to be bought, Yahoo! was the first company to which both made offers. Yahoo!, however, passed on both companies as they were too expensive for Yahoo! at that time. In the end, Microsoft ended up buying  Hotmail  for  $ 400 million and  AOL  bought  Mirabilis  for $288 million.   Later there was also to be another battle to acquire the online communications company  Four11 . Yahoo! made a deal with the company for co-branded white pages. Marvin Gavin, who worked at Four11 as director of international business development said, ""We always had a bias about being acquired by Yahoo! They were more entrepreneurial than Microsoft. We had a great cultural fit  it made a lot of sense."" The real point in acquiring Four11 was that in March 1997, the company had launched  Rocketmail , a webmail system that could be offered to users. In the end, Yahoo! concluded a deal with Four11 for $96 million. Yahoo! announced the acquisition [ 4 ]  on  October 8 ,  1997 , very close to the time that Yahoo! Mail was launched. [ 1 ]  Yahoo! Mail resulted from an acquisition rather than internal platform development because, as Healy said, ""Hotmail was growing at thousands and thousands users per week. We did an analysis. For us to build, it would have taken four to six months, and by then, so many users would have taken an e-mail account. The speed of the market was critical.""   The transition to Yahoo! Mail was not easy for many Rocketmail users at first. Yahoo! released various  help pages  to try and help these users. [ 5 ]  Soon after, on  March 21 ,  2002 , Yahoo! cut free software client access and introduced the $29.99 per year Mail Forwarding Service. [ 6 ]  Mary Osako, a Yahoo! Spokeswoman, told CNET, ""For-pay services on Yahoo!, originally launched in February 1999, have experienced great acceptance from our base of active registered users, and we expect this adoption to continue to grow.""   During the summer of 2002, the Yahoo! network was gradually redesigned. On  July 2 , Yahoo.com was redesigned and it was announced that other services like Yahoo! Mail would enter the same process. [ 7 ]  Along with this new design, new features were to be implemented, including new navigation tools, such as drop-down menus in  DHTML  and different category tabs, and a new user-customizable color scheme.   In November of the same year, Yahoo! launched another paid service:  Yahoo! Mail Plus . [ 8 ]  Yahoo! Mail Plus offered a number of new features, including:     25 megabytes of e-mail storage   10 megabyte message size limit   Ability to send up to 10 attachments per e-mail   POP Access and Forwarding   Archiving of e-mail messages to a hard drive for offline access   Ability to send messages from Yahoo! Mail using other e-mail domains   200 blocked addresses and 50 filters to help screen unsolicited e-mails   No promotional taglines in messages   No account expiration.         The launch of Yahoo! Mail Plus is part of Yahoo!'s strategic initiative to offer premium services that deliver innovative, reliable and relevant services to consumers"", said Geoff Ralston, senior vice president, Yahoo! Network Services, and creator of the original Yahoo! Mail technology in 1997. ""In just five years, Yahoo! Mail has grown from one million to tens of millions of users, illustrating how consumers have made e-mail an essential part of their daily lives. Through Yahoo! Mail Plus, Yahoo! continues to demonstrate leadership and innovation by offering consumers the industry's most complete and powerful e-mail solution.      [ 8 ]     On  April 1 ,  2004 , Google announced a free  webmail  with 1 gigabyte of storage. Though  Gmail , Google's e-mail service, offered a large amount of storage, its invitation-only accounts kept the other webmail services at the forefront. Most of the major webmail providers like Yahoo! Mail, Hotmail, and AOL followed Google's lead and increased their mailbox storage considerably. Yahoo! was the first provider to announce 100 MB of storage for basic accounts and 2 GB of storage for premium users. [ 9 ]  Determined not to lose customers, Yahoo! Mail then countered Hotmail and Google by increasing the storage quota of its free email accounts to 1 GB, and eventually removing a storage limit altogether and allowing unlimited storage.   On  July 9 ,  2004 , Yahoo! acquired  Oddpost , a strong webmail offering that simulated a desktop email client like Microsoft Outlook. Oddpost had new innovative features such as drag-and-drop support, right-click menus, RSS feeds, and a preview pane, but it also had incredible speed, using e-mail caching to shorten response time, and many of these features were incorporated into an updated Yahoo! Mail service. [ 10 ]   On  August 30 ,  2007 , Walter Mossberg wrote in the  Wall Street Journal  that Yahoo! will be releasing the new version over the next few weeks. [1]     [ edit ]   New Yahoo! Mail          Y! Mail Final Version              Mail Beta and Messenger integration.              Calendar event in Mail              Mail RSS feed reader              Login screen       The New Yahoo! Mail has a revised interface which contains mostly  Ajax  ( JavaScript  and  XML ). It is very similar to a heavy mail client like Outlook (Drag and drop capabilities, Mail search, tabs). The new Yahoo! Mail comes with an integrated Messenger; as a result, users are able to chat with Yahoo! Messenger and Windows Live Messenger contacts while reading their email.   As of  August 26 ,  2007 , the new Yahoo! Mail came out of Beta period. The development of what has now become the new interface, started since July 2004, although it is possible other prototypes were in development before then. It is currently compatible with  Internet Explorer 7 ,  Firefox  and  Safari  as well as  Camino  and other  Gecko  based browsers. (As part of Yahoo!'s plan to eventually upgrade all of their sites to be compatible with Firefox [ 11 ] ). Although it is usable under  Opera , there are slight visual problems regarding the layout.   In September 2005 Yahoo! began beta testing a significantly enhanced version of their e-mail service, based on  Ajax  scripting acquired from  Oddpost , along with new philosophical approaches to email, including the Oddpost design philosophy (which Google made heavy use of in Gmail):   Given that the All-New Yahoo! Mail is based on Oddpost, it features the same underlying code base, including the implementation of this design concept to minimize the amount of data sent during an email session by creating a JavaScript UI engine on the client side and sending ""Datapacks"" instead of reloading the whole interface on every click like a traditional webmail service [2]  (e.g. traditional Yahoo! Mail). This makes the service much faster than its counterparts.   However, unlike Oddpost, All-New Yahoo! Mail runs on a variety of OS's and browsers, and runs perfectly under  Internet Explorer 7  and  Firefox . On February 13, 2008, Yahoo! announced on the  Yahoo! Mail blog  that it would begin supporting version 3 of the Mac OS X default browser  Safari , as well as the Mac versions of  Firefox .   The  look and feel  of the new version is designed to mimic a  desktop   e-mail client , and it offers unlimited storage space, tabbed emails,  RSS  feeds, drag-and-drop capabilities, advanced keyboard shortcuts, advanced search, integration with Yahoo!  Calendar  and  Messenger ,  Domain Keys , address auto-complete and more.   The All-New Yahoo! Mail also has a mascot called Liam, who is basically a little boy, who is shown in the ""Help"" panel as well as in the loading screen. Liam is ""mail"" spelled backward.     [ edit ]   Introduction   Wide-scale beta release of the new version was introduced in late 2006. In November 2006, the Mail Beta team announced plans of integrating  Yahoo! Messenger  functionality with the Mail Beta interface.  [ 12 ]  This service was deployed in March, 2007.   Public and critical reaction to the new product has been positive, [ 13 ]  although a number of users have encountered speed issues, which can render the client very difficult to use, especially on older hardware. Each update to the Beta has included significant speed improvements, and the Mail Beta team is still focused on improving speed issues. For example, the earlier versions of Mail Beta featured a loading screen every time you access mail. However, with various updates Mail Beta now appears immediately (no loading screen).   On  August 26 ,  2007 , Yahoo! Mail left beta and now the two versions which exist are known as Yahoo! Mail (the default interface) and Yahoo! Mail Classic (an updated version of the current interface). The announcement was made on the  Yahoo! Mail blog  by John Kremer, Vice President, Yahoo! Mail and the major improvements relate to intelligent shortcuts,  SMS  Messaging, and improved search.   The final version was released on October 9, 2007.     [ edit ]   Features   Some of the new or improved features included in the New Yahoo! Mail are:     Yahoo! Calendar integration   Yahoo! Messenger integration   Windows Live Messenger integration   SMS Messaging in certain countries   Keyboard shortcuts   Unlimited storage   Improved search facilities     In addition, an  Easter egg  was added called a  Subject-O-Matique . This hidden feature displays a random message in the subject line when the subject button is clicked. The messages range from cultural references (""I AM the  walrus "") to sarcastic (""If you don't tell lies, at least you don't have to remember what you have said."") to unusual and outlandish (""the art of driving a giant, nuclear powered duck"").   On December 15, 2008, Yahoo! Mail introduces features to make it more social. [ 14 ] [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Open source   In late 2006, Yahoo launched an API for Yahoo! Mail Plus. [ 16 ]     [ edit ]   Yahoo! Mail Classic          Screenshot of the 'Classic' version of Yahoo! Mail.       Mail Classic  is, since the launch of the new Yahoo! Mail, an optional secondary User Interface for Yahoo! Mail. Although the AJAX interface is the default one, Classic is available for users who are unable to, or prefer to use the legacy style interface.     [ edit ]   Features   Starting in May 2007, Yahoo! started to roll out to its users an ""unlimited"" amount of email storage. [ 17 ]   Yahoo! Mail has the following features:     [ edit ]   Free version     Unlimited Mail Storage.   10 MB attachments (20 MB for the Plus version)   Protection against spam and viruses. ( See:  DomainKeys )   Advertising is displayed on the screen while working with the e-mail account.   POP3 support, Mail Forwarding facility, and  SMTP  support in some countries (but not in the US).   Accounts not logged into for four months get deactivated (The account can be retrieved but all stored data such as email is lost).   Early in 2006, Yahoo! Mail introduced aliases to its repertoire of features. Users could now add a (single) alias username containing a dot character for a pre-existing account.   The Chinese version of Yahoo! Mail  offers 3.5 GB quota and 20 MB attachments.  [3]   Some users get features added if they are long time users.   Latest beta of Yahoo! Zimbra desktop allows for all Yahoo! users to use the software     Users can get around the  Web browser  access restriction by using software that simulates a POP3 server to which the e-mail application connects.  YPOPs!  and  FreePOPs  are examples of  free software  applications that allow  e-mail clients  access to webmail (including Yahoo! Mail) services through POP3.     [ edit ]   Business   Yahoo! Business E-mail is a combination of all their e-mail services with 10 distinct accounts each with the same features of the  plus version  and personalized domain name and e-mail address. Accounts can be managed by an administrator. There is $25 set-up fee and $9.99 monthly fee to use this service. Unfortunately yahoo is apparently still working out how to allow their business mail clients to access their email accounts from certain mobile smart phones and pdas. According to yahoo's website, for now, you can access your Business Email only from a BlackBerry. Yahoo says it plans to make business email compatible with more devices in the future.     Unlimited Mail Storage   10 E-mail quota.   Additionally, a user can pay $35 per year to have up to five custom e-mail addresses and a  domain name .   Yahoo! mail underlines addresses and phone numbers in email and allows the user to add them to the address book.       [ edit ]   Ymail and Rocketmail   Yahoo! Mail Vice President  John Kremer  on  June 19 , 2008 announced the tripling of the size of its free  online e-mail  service with the launching of 2 domains as options for its 266 million users of ""@yahoo.com"" addresses: the new, simpler e-mail addresses ending in ymail.com and rocketmail.com. Rocketmail has a ""hip retro feel"" since it is a resurrected email address of a 1997 Yahoo service. [ 18 ]  E-mail under the ymail and rocketmail will offer all the same features as the Yahoo domain, with an unlimited amount of storage capacity, with ability to instant message from within their e-mail inbox and spam and virus protection. [ 19 ] [ 20 ]     [ edit ]   Spam policy   Like most free Webmail providers, Yahoo! Mail is often used by  spammers  to provide a ""remove me"" email address. More often than not, these addresses are used for the express purpose of verifying the recipient's address--thus opening the door for more spam. However, Yahoo! does not tolerate this practice. It terminates accounts connected with spam-related activities without warning, and spammers lose access to any other Yahoo! services connected with their ID. [4] [5]   In February 2006, Yahoo! also announced their decision (along with AOL) to give some organizations the option to ""certify"" mail, by paying up to one cent for each outgoing message, allowing the mail in question to bypass Yahoo's and AOL's inbound spam filters.  [6]     [ edit ]   Filters   In 2002, in order to prevent abuse, Yahoo! Mail had filters that changed certain words (that could trigger unwanted  Javascript  events) and word fragments into other words. "" Mocha "" was changed to "" espresso "", ""expression"" became ""statement"", and perhaps most damaging, ""eval"" (short for ""evaluation"") became ""review"". The widespread unintended effects of this can be seen by using search engines to find such  nonsensical  terms as ""prreviewent""(prevalent), ""reviewuation""(evaluation) and "" medireview ""(medieval).   When asked about these changes, Yahoo! explained that the changed words were common terms used in  Web scripting , and were blacklisted to prevent  hackers  from sending damaging commands via the program's  HTML  function.   As of  February 7 ,  2006 , the Yahoo! Mail filters no longer substitute certain words for others. Although the change may have occurred prior to this date, Yahoo! Mail now prefixes an ""_"" ( underscore ) to certain suspicious words and word fragments.   Sending a test email from a non-Yahoo! Mail account to a Yahoo! Mail account with the words ""Mocha"", ""eval"", ""Javascript"", and ""expression"" in a sentence resulted in the Yahoo! Mail filters prefixing an ""_"" (underscore) to those words, resulting in ""_Mocha"", ""_eval"", ""_Javascript"" and ""_expression"". This prefixing removes the threat of the words acting as commands via the program's HTML function by rendering them as non-commands or unrecognizable commands. As of  June 9 ,  2006 , only the terms ""expression"" and ""javascript"" were prefixed with an underscore (""_"").   There is also offered a spam filter called SpamGuard and an ability to set up custom filters. One problem that can be encountered is that the spam filter is applied before any custom filters you create. This results in some emails which you may wish to have directed to your Inbox or some other folder to be sent to your Bulk folder instead.     [ edit ]   Greylisting   Incoming mail to Yahoo! addresses can be subjected to  deferred  delivery as part of Yahoo!'s incoming  spam  controls. This can delay delivery of mail sent to Yahoo! addresses without the sender or recipients being aware of it. The deferral is typically of short duration, but may extend to several hours. Yahoo! does not specifically document this policy in detail, although some information is available. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]     [ edit ]   Controversy     [ edit ]   Interference with  Gmail  Conversations   Messages replied or forwarded from local Yahoo! Mail accounts split up conversations in Gmail, because their subjects contain parameters in the local language, instead of ""Re"" or ""Fwd:"".     [ edit ]   User name bans   On  February 20 ,  2006 , it was revealed that Yahoo! Mail was banning the word "" Allah "" in e-mail user names, both separate and as part of a user name such as  linda.callahan . [ 23 ]  Shortly after the news of the ""Allah"" ban became widespread in media, it was lifted on  February 23 ,  2006 . Along with this action, Yahoo! also made the following statement: [ 24 ]       We continuously evaluate abuse patterns in registration usernames to help prevent spam, fraud and other inappropriate behavior. A small number of people registered for IDs using specific terms with the sole purpose of promoting hate, and then used those IDs to post content that was harmful or threatening to others, thus violating Yahoo!'s Terms of Service.   'Allah' was one word being used for these purposes, with instances tied to defamatory language. We took steps to help protect our users by prohibiting use of the term in Yahoo! usernames. We recently re-evaluated the term 'Allah' and users can now register for IDs with this word because it is no longer a significant target for abuse. We regularly evaluate this type of activity and will continue to make adjustments to our registration process to help foster a positive customer experience.         [ edit ]   Search function failure   Since the beginning of 2008, many users have experienced a failure of the search function in which it either fails to retrieve any messages, or (occasionally) just a small subset. Despite Yahoo being informed of this by many users for many months [ citation needed ] , they have failed to fix it.

Search          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Yahoo search )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search          This article is about the Yahoo! Search Engine.  For the corporation, see  Yahoo! . For other uses, see  Yahoo! (disambiguation) .     Yahoo! Search             Yahoo! Search       URL   search.yahoo.com       Type of site   Search Engine       Available  language (s)   Multilingual       Owner   Yahoo!       Created by   Yahoo!       Yahoo! Search  is a  web search engine , owned by  Yahoo!, Inc.  and is currently the second largest search engine on the web, after its competitor Google.  [ 1 ]   Originally  Yahoo! Search  started as a web directory of other websites, organized in a hierarchy, as opposed to a searchable index of pages. In the late 1990s,  Yahoo!  evolved into a full-fledged portal with a search interface and, by 2007, a limited version of  selection-based search .   Yahoo! Search, originally referred to as  Yahoo! provided Search interface , would send queries to a searchable index of pages supplemented with its directory of sites. The results were presented to the user under the Yahoo! brand. Originally, none of the actual web crawling and storage/retrieval of data was done by Yahoo! itself. In 2001 the searchable index was powered by  Inktomi  and later was powered by  Google  until 2004, when Yahoo! Search became independent. Yahoo! Search major competitors are:  Google Search ,  Live Search  and  Ask Search .           Contents       1   Search technology acquisition   2   Yahoo!

In  2002 , they bought  Inktomi , a ""behind the scenes"" or OEM search engine provider, whose results are shown on other companies' websites and powered Yahoo! in its earlier days. In 2003, they purchased  Overture Services, Inc. , which owned the  AlltheWeb  and  AltaVista  search engines. Initially, even though Yahoo! owned multiple search engines, they didn't use them on the main yahoo.com website, but kept using  Google's search engine  for its results.   Starting in  2003 , Yahoo! Search became its own  web crawler -based search engine, with a reinvented crawler called  Yahoo! Slurp . Yahoo! Search combined the capabilities of all the search engine companies they had acquired, with its existing research, and put them into a single search engine. The new search engine results were included in all of Yahoo!'s sites that had a web search function. Yahoo! also started to sell the search engine results to other companies, to show on their own web sites. Their relationship with Google was terminated at that time, with the former partners becoming each other's main competitors.   In  October 2007 , Yahoo! Search was updated with a more modern appearance in line with the redesigned Yahoo! home page. In addition,  Search Assist  was added; which provides real-time query suggestions and related concepts as they are typed.   In  July 2008 , Yahoo! Search announced the introduction of a new service called ""Build Your Own Search Service,"" or BOSS. This service opens the doors for developers to use Yahoo!'s system for indexing information and images and create their own custom search engine. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Yahoo! Search blog & announcements   The team at Yahoo! Search frequently blogs about search announcements, features, updates and enhancements. The Yahoo! Search Blog, as stated provides  A look inside the world of search from the people at Yahoo!. [ 3 ]  This includes index updates named  Weather Updates  and their  Yahoo! Search Assist  feature.     [ edit ]   International presence   Yahoo! Search also provides their search interface in at least 38 international markets and a variety of available languages. [ 4 ]  Yahoo! has a presence in Europe, Asia and across the Emerging Markets.     [ edit ]   Search results   Yahoo! Search indexes and caches the common HTML page formats, as well as several of the more popular file-types, such as  PDF ,  Excel spreadsheets ,  PowerPoint ,  Word documents , RSS/XML and plain text files. For some of these supported file-types, Yahoo! Search provides  cached  links on their search results allowing for viewing of these file-types in standard HTML.   Using the Advanced Search interface or Preferences settings, Yahoo! Search allows the customization of search results and enabling of certain settings such as: SafeSearch, Language Selection, Number of results, Domain restrictions, etc. [ 5 ]   For a Basic and starter guide to Yahoo! Search, they also provide a  Search Basics  tutorial. [ 6 ]   In the first week of May 2008, Yahoo! launched a new search mash up called  Yahoo! Glue , which is in beta testing. Currently it is only available on the Yahoo! India Search Page.  [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Selection-based search   On  June 20 ,  2007 , Yahoo! introduced a  selection-based search  feature called Yahoo! Shortcuts. When activated this selection-based search feature enables users to invoke search using only their mouse and receive search suggestions in floating windows while remaining on Yahoo! properties such as Yahoo! Mail. This feature is only active on Yahoo web pages or pages within the  Yahoo! Publisher Network . Yahoo! Shortcuts requires the content-owner to modify the underlying HTML of his or her webpage to call out the specific keywords to be enhanced. The technology for context-aware selection-based search on Yahoo pages was first developed by Reiner Kraft. [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   SearchScan          SearchScan in action.       On  May 11 ,  2008 , Yahoo! introduced SearchScan. If enabled this  add-on /feature will enhance Yahoo! Search by automatically alerting users of  viruses ,  spyware  and  spammy  websites. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Search verticals   Yahoo! Search provides the ability to search across numerous vertical properties outside just the Web at large. These include Images, Videos, Local, Shopping, Yahoo! Answers, Audio, Directory, Jobs, News, Mobile, Travel and various other services as listed on their  About Yahoo! Search  page.

clueweb09-enwp02-05-01050	"                     Yahoo! Search          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search          This article is about the Yahoo! Search Engine.  For the corporation, see  Yahoo! . For other uses, see  Yahoo! (disambiguation) .     Yahoo! Search             Yahoo! Search       URL   search.yahoo.com       Type of site   Search Engine       Available  language (s)   Multilingual       Owner   Yahoo!       Created by   Yahoo!       Yahoo! Search  is a  web search engine , owned by  Yahoo!, Inc.  and is currently the second largest search engine on the web, after its competitor Google.  [ 1 ]   Originally  Yahoo! Search  started as a web directory of other websites, organized in a hierarchy, as opposed to a searchable index of pages. In the late 1990s,  Yahoo!  evolved into a full-fledged portal with a search interface and, by 2007, a limited version of  selection-based search .   Yahoo! Search, originally referred to as  Yahoo! provided Search interface , would send queries to a searchable index of pages supplemented with its directory of sites. The results were presented to the user under the Yahoo! brand. Originally, none of the actual web crawling and storage/retrieval of data was done by Yahoo! itself. In 2001 the searchable index was powered by  Inktomi  and later was powered by  Google  until 2004, when Yahoo! Search became independent. Yahoo! Search major competitors are:  Google Search ,  Live Search  and  Ask Search .           Contents       1   Search technology acquisition   2   Yahoo!

In  2002 , they bought  Inktomi , a ""behind the scenes"" or OEM search engine provider, whose results are shown on other companies' websites and powered Yahoo! in its earlier days. In 2003, they purchased  Overture Services, Inc. , which owned the  AlltheWeb  and  AltaVista  search engines. Initially, even though Yahoo! owned multiple search engines, they didn't use them on the main yahoo.com website, but kept using  Google's search engine  for its results.   Starting in  2003 , Yahoo! Search became its own  web crawler -based search engine, with a reinvented crawler called  Yahoo! Slurp . Yahoo! Search combined the capabilities of all the search engine companies they had acquired, with its existing research, and put them into a single search engine. The new search engine results were included in all of Yahoo!'s sites that had a web search function. Yahoo! also started to sell the search engine results to other companies, to show on their own web sites. Their relationship with Google was terminated at that time, with the former partners becoming each other's main competitors.   In  October 2007 , Yahoo! Search was updated with a more modern appearance in line with the redesigned Yahoo! home page. In addition,  Search Assist  was added; which provides real-time query suggestions and related concepts as they are typed.   In  July 2008 , Yahoo! Search announced the introduction of a new service called ""Build Your Own Search Service,"" or BOSS. This service opens the doors for developers to use Yahoo!'s system for indexing information and images and create their own custom search engine. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Yahoo! Search blog & announcements   The team at Yahoo! Search frequently blogs about search announcements, features, updates and enhancements. The Yahoo! Search Blog, as stated provides  A look inside the world of search from the people at Yahoo!. [ 3 ]  This includes index updates named  Weather Updates  and their  Yahoo! Search Assist  feature.     [ edit ]   International presence   Yahoo! Search also provides their search interface in at least 38 international markets and a variety of available languages. [ 4 ]  Yahoo! has a presence in Europe, Asia and across the Emerging Markets.     [ edit ]   Search results   Yahoo! Search indexes and caches the common HTML page formats, as well as several of the more popular file-types, such as  PDF ,  Excel spreadsheets ,  PowerPoint ,  Word documents , RSS/XML and plain text files. For some of these supported file-types, Yahoo! Search provides  cached  links on their search results allowing for viewing of these file-types in standard HTML.   Using the Advanced Search interface or Preferences settings, Yahoo! Search allows the customization of search results and enabling of certain settings such as: SafeSearch, Language Selection, Number of results, Domain restrictions, etc. [ 5 ]   For a Basic and starter guide to Yahoo! Search, they also provide a  Search Basics  tutorial. [ 6 ]   In the first week of May 2008, Yahoo! launched a new search mash up called  Yahoo! Glue , which is in beta testing. Currently it is only available on the Yahoo! India Search Page.  [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Selection-based search   On  June 20 ,  2007 , Yahoo! introduced a  selection-based search  feature called Yahoo! Shortcuts. When activated this selection-based search feature enables users to invoke search using only their mouse and receive search suggestions in floating windows while remaining on Yahoo! properties such as Yahoo! Mail. This feature is only active on Yahoo web pages or pages within the  Yahoo! Publisher Network . Yahoo! Shortcuts requires the content-owner to modify the underlying HTML of his or her webpage to call out the specific keywords to be enhanced. The technology for context-aware selection-based search on Yahoo pages was first developed by Reiner Kraft. [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   SearchScan          SearchScan in action.       On  May 11 ,  2008 , Yahoo! introduced SearchScan. If enabled this  add-on /feature will enhance Yahoo! Search by automatically alerting users of  viruses ,  spyware  and  spammy  websites. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Search verticals   Yahoo! Search provides the ability to search across numerous vertical properties outside just the Web at large. These include Images, Videos, Local, Shopping, Yahoo! Answers, Audio, Directory, Jobs, News, Mobile, Travel and various other services as listed on their  About Yahoo! Search  page.

Launched   February 26 ,  2008       Yahoo! Buzz  is a community-based news article website, much like  Digg , that combines the features of  social bookmarking  and  syndication  through a user interface that allows editorial control. Users can be allowed to publish their own news stories, and link to their own or another person's site that links to a full story of the information, therefore driving traffic to that person's website and creating a larger market for sites that research and publish their own news articles and stories, such as  CNN  or smaller, privately owned websites.   Yahoo!  created the service in hopes that it would drive larger traffic to their site and would give them an advantage over larger online media companies such as  Google  or  MSN , which are Yahoo!'s largest competitors in terms of  search engines  that provide services and web features to its customers. Unlike other social networking sites, Buzz allows the publisher to modify the submission. [ 1 ]     [ edit ]   See also     Yahoo!

User Interface Library (YUI)     The YUI Library is a set of utilities and controls, written in JavaScript, for building richly interactive web applications using techniques such as DOM scripting, DHTML and AJAX.  YUI is available under a  BSD license  and is free for all uses.   The YUI project includes the YUI Library and two build-time tools:  YUI Compressor  (minification) and  YUI Doc  (documentation engine for JavaScript code).    Download YUI version 2.6.0 , including  full API documentation  and  more than 290 functional examples  from Sourceforge.    A preview release of YUI's next-generation 3.x codeline  is also available.  YUI 3.x is not production-ready, but we're looking forward to your feedback  on the YUI 3 forum  as we prepare this new codeline for a 2009 GA release.          The library's developers blog  at the YUI Blog  and the YUI Library community exchanges ideas at  YDN-JavaScript on Yahoo! Groups .                   Using YUI:            FAQ       Getting Started       Licensing       Cheat Sheets       Support & Community       Filing Bugs & Feature Requests             Searchable API Documentation:            Browse and search the complete YUI API .                            The YUI Compressor:                            YUI Compressor  is a build-process component that helps you minify your JavaScript and CSS.                YUI Doc:                            YUI Doc  creates beautiful, searchable API docs for JavaScript code.

We recommend starting with the  Event Utility  and  Dom Collection  examples; Event and Dom are part of the YUI Core (along with the  YAHOO Global Object ) and provide an important foundation for JavaScript developers using YUI. Once you've reviewed those  foundational pieces, go on to explore utilities like  Drag and Drop  and  Animation  or UI controls like  Button ,  Calendar  and  TabView . If you're interested in YUI's CSS components, read through the examples for  Reset ,  Base ,  Fonts , and  Grids  in that order.     Remember that there are full user's guides  for each component here on the website. If you have any questions about a component as you play with the examples, check out the component's user's guide (by following any of the links along the left side of the page) or the  searchable API documentation .     Articles:  You may also want to check out "" Writing Your First YUI Application ,"" an article designed to help you get up and running with YUI, and "" Loading YUI: Seeds, Core, and Combo-handling ,"" an article that explores the three most common strategies for including YUI on the page.     You have  cheat sheets  for each component available on landing pages and  downloadable as a full set . These documents support the online user's guides by providing concise print documentation for YUI components.      Start building.  You can include YUI scripts and CSS from  the YUI download  (in the download's  /build  directory) or  directly from Yahoo! servers .  The YUI Loader Utility  is a client-side loading package that can dynamically pull in YUI scripts as needed, whether from your servers or from ours.  And the  YUI Dependency Configurator  is a great way to calculate an optimized list of script/css includes for your particular implementation.     Become a member of the YUI community.  YUI developers and implementers share thoughts and solutions and provide a helping hand  in our forums . YUI developers also contribute to  the YUIBlog , where you'll find in-depth articles, videos and other great content about YUI and the world of frontend engineering.        Licensing    All of the YUI Library components are provided free of charge under a liberal  BSD license .     Articles          Graded Browser Support : This article details the browser-support philosophy we use in  developing the YUI Library. Graded Browser Support provides a sane path to achieving accessibility and graceful degradation while still building richly interactive interfaces in the browser.    Skinning YUI : YUI components get their look and feel from a visual ""skin"" that you can modify or replace in your own applications.    Building Your Own Widget Library with YUI : This article explores the creation and extension of YUI components using core YUI tools.       Cheat Sheets    Cheat Sheets  for the YUI Library provide quick references to the key methods, properties, and syntax patterns of each component.  When you find yourself elbow-deep in a coding problem, sometimes it's quicker to turn to these rather than firing up a browser to review documentation and examples — and reviewing the cheat sheets can help you discover hidden gems you didn't know were there.    These one page references aren't comprehensive, but we think you'll find them valuable to have on hand.     Support & Community    The YUI Library and related topics are discussed on the on the  ydn-javascript  mailing list.                                       In addition, please visit the  YUIBlog  for updates and articles about the YUI Library written by the library's developers.      Filing Bugs & Feature Requests      The YUI Library's public bug tracking and feature request repositories are located on  the YUI SourceForge project site .  Before filing new feature requests or bug reports, please review  our reporting guidelines .          Guidelines for YUI feature requests and bug reports .

Developer Network Blog      « Previous  |   Main  |  Next »            June  4, 2008    Yahoo! Address Book API Delivered    Were excited to announce the public release of the  Address Book API .  I say  public  release because while the API is newly launched here on YDN, its been up and running with some of the most contact-aware applications on the Internet, including  Plaxo  and  LinkedIn .    Its been a long time coming, both for us and for all of you.  Yes, we see the question come up often on the  ydn-mail: Developer Community group  and were pleased beyond measure to finally be able release the API.     This new API provides access to one of the largest collections of address books on the Internet--the contact system behind Yahoo! Mail, Yahoo! Messenger, and Yahoo! Go. This means your applications already have a built-in audience. The Address Book API supports a wide range of third-party apps, such as sending invitations to seed social networks or social apps, looking up postal addresses for shipping services for online retail, and providing address ""auto-complete"" for messaging apps.       The API has extensive search capabilities. Once a user authorizes your application, youll be able to easily access that users address book and look for specific contacts. If you want to see which contacts are new, you can ask whats changed since the last time you accessed the API. More details are available in the  documentation .    Here are some highlights of what you can do with the API:      Obtain unique identifiers (i.e., email addresses) to help build a social network.     Look up phone numbers for mobile and SMS applications.    Look up email addresses for content-sharing applications. For example, you can enhance the ""share with friend"" capability of your site. Make it easy for users to look up their contacts by combining the Address Book API with the  YUI auto-complete widget .     Make it a breeze for your users to send gifts easily. They can add addresses from their Yahoo! Address Book with almost no typing.      While we are excited about  what  the Address Book API can do, we are just as excited about  how  it works. Today, the new API provides access to a users Address Book via BBAuth (our browser-based authentication). Users authorize your application to access their address book data through the Yahoo! login process. Access to their address book data is done safely.     What about OAuth?  Support for OAuth is coming, my friends, in due time& Seriously. At Yahoo! were already doing a lot with OAuth (think Fire Eagle) and its a big part of our plans.    The new  Yahoo! Address Book API  unlocks the relationships that Yahoo! members have  developed on Yahoo! and makes them easy to tap into on your site. We hope you love it as much as we do and we can't wait to see what you build!     Charles Wu  Product Manager, Yahoo! Address Book platform          Posted at June  4, 2008  9:00 AM     Comments      This is great news! Very exciting. Folks may want a link to the main Address Book api microsite, too:  http://developer.yahoo.com/addressbook/     Posted by: Bryce at June  4, 2008 10:51 AM     congrats to Charles & team.  great stuff :)    would be even more useful if you can take this just 2 baby steps further, by enabling filtered access to contacts as follows:   1) prioritized by messaging frequency (how often i contact them)   2) prioritized by keyword relevance (show me who i email about 'frisbee')   3) combine both of the above, and let me constrain to top X most relevant contacts    while this may seem like a rather detailed set of requested enhancements, by providing these basic filters you can actually simplify the user experience dramatically, and greatly enhance the utility by 3rd-party developers.    in short, what i want isn't the ability to access my list of 1000-2000 contacts, but a quick & easy way to popup a list of 3-5 contacts who i share an interest with.    example:   * show me top 3 people i share interests: ""children"" & ""preschool education""   * show me top 10 people i share interests: ""science fiction"" & ""iron man""   * show me top 5 people i share interests: ""new car"" & ""toyota prius""    these could be used to let people share information, do a group purchase at a discount, or send a more constrained (& less spammy) invite to join a new site / service.    more details on these concepts in post below:   Memo to Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, & AOL:    How to Turn 500M email logins into Facebook Platform & a Crapload of Revenue    http://500hats.typepad.com/500blogs/2008/05/memo-to-google.html    (apologies in advance for profanity & ransom-note fonts ;)    regards & keep on truckin',    - dave mcclure     Posted by: dave mcclure at June  4, 2008 10:57 AM     This is excellent news -- have been waiting for this for a long time and now I actually have a reason to use it!

Posted by: Greg at June  4, 2008 11:27 AM     Congrats Charles and team! I'm so excited to see this finally get out. [This is good]      Posted by: Veronique at June  6, 2008 10:08 PM     That's great news... Address Book is very useful stuff provided by Yahoo... I like the user interface of it...    dot net web services     Posted by: DOT NET Web Services at September 18, 2008  5:14 AM     Hi, I want to know if we can use addressbook api to develop the application for sync the Yahoo address book records with my PC Outlook or my mobile phone? thanks a lot in advance.     Posted by: Chunrong Chen at October  8, 2008  1:16 AM     @Chunrong, yes it is possible to develop applications for sync with the Yahoo Address Book, however you will need to apply for write access to the Address Book. Obtaining write access is an application process.

Adware is often hidden alongside other programs, and you may unknowingly install it when you download a program from the Internet or install software from disks. You usually need a specialized anti-adware or anti-spyware program to remove adware from your computer.        anonymity         Inability to identify a person from known information.        anti-spam        A program that filters spam in an email inbox and moves it to a bulk or spam folder, where it can be deleted.        anti-spyware        A program that finds and removes spyware. Some anti-spyware programs can also find and remove other malware, like keyloggers, Trojan horses, worms, and more.        anti-virus        A program that is designed to identify, prevent, and eliminate viruses and other malicious software.        attacker        A person who intentionally attempts to defeat a system.                     bulk folder         A folder in some email programs that is used to hold email identified as spam.                    case-sensitive        Distinguishing between uppercase (or capital) letters and lowercase (or small) letters. Yahoo! passwords are case-sensitive, which means that a capital A is different from a lowercase a. So when you enter your password, make sure to type it with the correct capitalization.        cookie         A small amount of data, often including an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard disk. Web sites use cookies to ""remember"" details about you, such as your user name or site preferences, in order to personalize your experience on that web site. Your browser transmits information back to the site each time you view that site until the cookie expires. Yahoo!, for example, uses cookies to remember your personal preferences, allowing us to display customized content on pages such as My Yahoo!.                     download        The transfer of a copy of program or file from a network to a single computer.                    email header         Part of an email message that describes the path that the email took to go from the sender to the recipient. Email headers are generally hidden, but can be displayed if necessary. If you report spam or phishing emails to Yahoo!, you'll be asked to include the email headers to help identify the source of the email.        encryption         The process of converting data or other information into code so that unauthorized people cannot access it.                    firewall         Hardware or a program that prevents unauthorized users from accessing a computer network or that monitors the transfer of information to and from a network. A personal firewall is a program that filters traffic to or from a single computer. Many operating systems (such as Microsoft Windows XP and Mac OS X) include firewall protection.         A computer firewall gets its name from the fireproof wall in buildings that acts as a barrier to prevent the spread of fire.        freeware         Software (or programs) available for free, usually over the Internet. These programs can be sources of hidden spyware and adware.                    hacker        A person who uses programming skills to gain illegal access to a computer, network, or file.        header         Another name for an email header.        hijacker         A malicious program that takes control of a browser and may redirect it to a fraudulent site for the purpose of committing identity theft or fraud.        hoax        Something meant to deceive or trick. Hoaxes involving threats to computers usually arrive in an email and contain bogus warnings designed to frighten or mislead you. Unsuspecting recipients may forward the email to friends and colleagues, spreading the hoax.                    keylogger        Software (or a program) that secretly tracks and records all activities on a computer, including keystrokes, web sites visited, and potentially more. The information captured is transmitted back to a third party, who can then use the information to access online accounts and sensitive personal and financial information.                    mail header        Another name for an email header.        malware        Software designed to infiltrate or damage a computer without the owner's knowledge. Malware is a general category of software that includes viruses, worms, Trojan horses, spyware, adware, and other malicious software.                    phishing        An attempt to steal passwords and private account information through fake web sites and emails that look like those of trusted companies. A phishing web site or email can look identical to the real thing, so it can be hard to tell that it's fake. Phishing schemes can also use instant messages, typically when an account is compromised. In this case, the fraudster sends phishing messages to the contacts in the account's Messenger or friend list.        pop-under        A form of online advertising designed to attract viewers to a web site or to capture email addresses. This type of ad ""pops under"" the current web page in a new window and isn't seen until the browser window is closed, making it more difficult to determine which web site opened it.        pop-up        A form of online advertising designed to attract viewers to a web site or to capture email addresses. This type of ad ""pops up"" in a new window, covering all or part of the current web page.        pop-up blocker        A program designed to prevent pop-ups and pop-unders.        pretexting        Using false pretenses (such as a false identify or name) to get personal information, which may be used to fraudulently obtain credit or assets.                    shareware        Copyrighted software (or programs) available for free on a trial basis. Usually you'll be asked to pay a fee if you want to continue using the software after the trial period. These programs are sometimes sources of hidden spyware and adware.        sign-in seal        A feature of Yahoo! that helps to protect you against phishing scams. You create your personalized sign-in seal and then look for it every time you sign in to Yahoo!. If your sign-in seal isn't displayed, or isn't the one you created, you might be on a fraudulent web site, designed to look like a legitimate Yahoo! site.        social engineering        A common ploy used to gain access to accounts by manipulating unsuspecting victims into revealing confidential information. Perpetrators may befriend potential victims and use information provided by them to guess a password or other secret data, which they use to access the victim's online accounts.        spam        Any message, regardless of its content, that is sent to multiple recipients who haven't specifically requested it. Spam can be an email message or an instant message. Posting the same message multiple times to newsgroups or list servers is also considered spamming — especially if it isn't related to the topic. Spam is also called UCE (unsolicited commercial email) and UBE (unsolicited bulk email).        Spam folder        A folder in Yahoo! Mail used to hold email identified as spam.        spearfishing or spearphishing        A kind of phishing scheme that targets a specific organization or individual in an attempt to gain access to confidential data. Like phishing messages, spearphishing messages appear to come from a trusted source, and may even appear to be from an employee within the recipient's company. Typically, a spearphishing email asks for user names and passwords or instructs the recipient to click on a link. That link could result in the downloading of spyware or other malicious programs. If a single employee falls for the spearphishing scam, the attacker can pretend to be that individual and gain access to sensitive data.        spoofing        Imitating a legitimate web site. Phishing scams use spoofing to create site that looks like a legitimate web site to fool potential victims into signing on with their user ID and password. The spoofing site captures this information and uses it to gather personal and financial information.        spyware        A program or technology that aids in gathering information about a person or organization, often without their knowledge. It includes programs like hijackers and keyloggers. Spyware is often hidden alongside other programs, and you may unknowingly install spyware when you download a program from the Internet or install software from disks. You usually need a specialized anti-spyware program to remove spyware from your computer.        SSL        Abbreviation for Secure Sockets Layer. A set of rules that defines the format and sequence of messages sent over the Internet to provide a level of security when transmitting private information. When you sign in to Yahoo!, your password is always transmitted over a SSL encrypted connection.                    Trojan        A shortened name for Trojan horse.        Trojan horse        A program that disguises itself as another program. Similar to a virus, a Trojan horse is hidden and usually causes an unwanted effect, such as installing a ""back door"" in your computer that can be used by hackers. Unlike a virus, a Trojan horse typically doesn't create copies of itself.                    UBE        Abbreviation for unsolicited bulk email. More commonly known as spam.        UCE        Abbreviation for unsolicited commercial email. More commonly known as spam.                    virus        A program that hides in other programs or documents and spreads as a side-effect of something you do, like opening an attachment to an email. Viruses come in many forms, and you don't need to install a program for your computer to be infected. For example, some viruses are spread when you open a word-processing document, particularly if you enabled macros in your word processor. An email virus may create copies of itself and automatically mail itself to everyone in your address book or attach itself to outgoing files.                            worm               A malicious program that spreads without your taking any action, typically by exploiting vulnerabilities in popular programs like Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Outlook Express email software. Once activated, a worm generally uses the Internet or your local network to spread to other computers.                           zombie               A computer that has been attacked by a hacker, virus, or Trojan horse and is then used to perform malicious acts, such as sending spam, under remote direction. The zombie computer gets its name from the zombie — an undead or apathetic person — because the computer and its owner are unaware that the computer is controlled remotely.

Andrew Houston, Mississippi                                  Dear Andrew:                                                        Your question led us to  whatis.com , a friendly source of definitions for computer, Internet, and telecommunications technology. There we learned that cache, pronounced  cash , is a temporary storage place inside your computer for frequently or recently accessed data.   We also learned that there are different kinds of cache. For instance, your web browser stores recently visited web pages in a cache directory on your hard disk, so that you can return quickly to the page without requesting it from the original server. When you hit the ""Reload"" button, your browser compares the cached page with the current page out on the network, and updates your local version if necessary.   You can customize the size of your browser's memory cache and disk cache to optimize your web surfing experience. Go to ""Preferences"" in the Edit menu of your Netscape Navigator browser; click on ""Advanced,"" then go into ""Cache."" From this control panel you can also clear or empty the browser caches in order to free up space and, hopefully, improve the data transfer rate. Make similar adjustments on Microsoft's Internet Explorer by going to ""Internet Options"" at the bottom of the Tools menu.   At  PC Webopaedia  we learned about two other types of caches used in personal computers. Memory cache (or cache memory) is a portion of computer storage that consists of high-speed RAM (random access memory), specially designated to facilitate quick retrieval of data by the computer as it processes information.   Finally, there's disk cache. This uses files on our hard drive to store recently accessed data, again, in an effort to improve performance speed. (Your browser cache is a subset of this kind of cache.) Caching strategies are continually being explored and refined by programmers and chip designers to enhance machine performance.                                                                                                                                                                                        More Questions About   · Computers & Internet   · Yahoo!

This example shows a layout similar to the new Yahoo! Mail look and feel.  This is not a new product from Yahoo! or YUI, just a demonstration of how YUI components can work in concert in the context of a more complex application.                             View example in new window.                                Note:  There is a unresolved performance issue with this example on pre-Intel Macs running the latest Opera browser.    Getting Started    This example contains a few YUI Utilities and Controls as well as the use of a few Yahoo! Services. Here is the complete list of items used:   YUI Utilities:        YAHOO       Dom       Event       Animation       Selector       Get       YUI Loader       YUI Controls:        AutoComplete       Button       Calendar       DataTable       Editor       Layout Manager       Logger       Menu       SimpleDialog       Slider       TabView       Tooltip       Yahoo!

Each important piece of the puzzle is created and stored in a separate Javasript file.

Do you avoid new websites because they come with yet another username and password? Do you paste stickies with password hints all over your computer monitor?                                   OpenID is an open technology standard that solves all of these problems. The OpenID technology will allow you to use your Yahoo! account to sign in to hundreds of websites! And this list is growing every day...                                   Once you enable your Yahoo! account for OpenID access, you can simply tell any OpenID enabled website that you are a Yahoo! user. You will be sent to Yahoo! to verify your Yahoo! ID and password and then signed in to the website. Its that easy!                                                                                          Still not convinced?                                                                 Take our  handy-dandy OpenID tour  to learn more or  visit the OpenID homepage                                                                                                                                          Why Yahoo!?                                                                 You already enjoy a bunch of great services with your Yahoo! account.

In a nutshell, the OpenID technology makes life simpler by having only one username and password to remember.                                                                                                         Once you have enabled your Yahoo! account for OpenID access, you only need to remember your Yahoo! ID and password to use hundreds of websites... So bid farewell to password spreadsheets and stickies all over your desk!                                                                                                                                                                                              Bada bing, bada boom! It's that simple.                                                                                                                   When you are on a website that supports OpenID login, simply look for a Yahoo! login button. Or if you see a text box with an OpenID icon, simply type in ""yahoo.com"". You will be sent to Yahoo! to verify your Yahoo! ID and password, and then you will be able to continue on.                                                                                             For people who prefer pictures, here are the steps:                                                                                                                                                                                         A quick note on security                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  When using OpenID, you should not enter your Yahoo! ID and password on any website other than Yahoo!.                                                                                                     If you haven't already done so, we strongly recommend setting up your free Yahoo! sign-in seal. A sign-in seal is a personalized image or a message that will only appear on genuine Yahoo! pages.                                                                                                     To help prevent the bad guys on the Internet from stealing your Yahoo! account data, always look for your sign-in seal before typing your Yahoo! ID and password.                                                                                                          Set Up A Sign In Seal                                                                             Link will open in a new window.                                                                                                                                                                    Copyright © 2009 Yahoo!

Any time we ask for a credit card number we transmit that credit card number in an encrypted format. We use industry-standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption.  Yahoo! is TRUSTe-certified.

Yahoo! collects information in several ways from different parts of our network of web sites. Some personal information is gathered when you register. During registration, Yahoo! asks for your name, email address, birth date, gender, zip code, occupation, industry and personal interests. The more information you volunteer (and the more accurate it is), the better we are able to customize your experience. Once you register you are no longer anonymous to Yahoo! - you are given a Yahoo! ID and are able to take full advantage of Yahoo!'s many offerings. In addition to registration we may ask you for personal information at other times, including (but not limited to) when you enter a sweepstakes, contest or promotion sponsored by Yahoo! and/or our many partners; when you make a purchase using Yahoo! Shopping; when you make travel arrangements using Yahoo! Travel; when you post a Yahoo! Classified ad; when you submit a listing for a web site; and when you report a problem with one of our sites or services. If you contact Yahoo! we may keep a record of that correspondence. Yahoo! also occasionally asks users to complete surveys that we use for research purposes. Wherever Yahoo! collects personal information we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page. What are cookies and how does Yahoo! use them? As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services, Yahoo! uses cookies to store and sometimes track information about you. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. All sites on Yahoo! where you are prompted to log-in or that are customizable require that you accept cookies. (See ""What are my choices regarding collection, use and distribution of my information?"" for more information on cookies.) Generally, we use cookies to: (1) Remind us of who you are and to access your account information (stored on our computers) in order to deliver to you a better and more personalized service. This cookie is set when you register or ""Sign In"" and is modified when you ""Sign Out"" of our services. Yahoo! also uses cookies to store your zip code for other services, such as Yellow Pages. (2) Estimate our audience size. Each browser accessing Yahoo! is given a unique cookie which is then used to determine the extent of repeat usage, usage by a registered user versus by an unregistered user, and to help target advertisements based on user interests and behavior. (3) Assist merchants in Yahoo! Stores to track visits to and business at their stores, and to process the items in your shopping basket. This information collected by cookies is sometimes called ""clickstream"" or ""click trail"" and may also describe which pages you have seen in each merchant's store. (4) Track your progress and number of entries in some of our promotions, sweepstakes and contests. When a Yahoo!-hosted promotion uses cookies, the information written to the cookie indicates the player's progress through the promotion, and may be used to track entries, submissions, and status in prize drawings. (5) Measure certain traffic patterns, which areas of Yahoo!'s network of web sites you have visited, and your visiting patterns in the aggregate. We use this research to understand how our users' habits are similar or different from one another so that we can make each new experience on Yahoo! a better one. We may use this information to better personalize the content, banners, and promotions that you and other users will see on our sites. Advertising networks that serve ads onto Yahoo! may also use their own cookies. Yahoo! also collects IP addresses for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. In addition, Yahoo! Mail includes IP addresses in outgoing mail message headers. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- How does Yahoo! use my information? Yahoo!'s primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you, the user, with a customized experience on our network of sites. This includes personalization services, interactive communications, online shopping and many other types of services, most of which are completely free to you. In order to provide services free of charge, we display advertisements. By knowing a little about you, Yahoo! is able to deliver more relevant advertisements and content, and hence better service, to you. In our role of delivering targeted advertisements, Yahoo! plays the middleman. Advertisers give us an advertisement and tell us the type of audience they want to reach (for example, males over 35 years old). Yahoo! takes the advertisement and displays it to users meeting that criteria. In this process, the advertiser never has access to individual account information. Only Yahoo! has access to individuals' accounts. This kind of advertisement targeting is done with banner ads as well as promotional email through Yahoo! Delivers. You will only receive special offers via email from Yahoo! if you have indicated in your account preferences that you would like to receive them. You can change your account preferences at any time. Yahoo! does research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior based on the information provided to us upon registration, during a promotion, from our server log files or from surveys. We do this to better understand and serve our users. This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis. Yahoo! may share this aggregated data with advertisers or business partners. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Who is collecting information? When you are on a Yahoo! site and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with Yahoo! alone, unless it is specifically stated otherwise. For example, some Yahoo! services, like Yahoo! Travel, are offered in conjunction with a partner company. In order to provide this co-branded service to you, it is necessary for us to share your personal information with our partner company. If data is being collected and/or maintained by any company other than Yahoo!, you will be notified prior to the time of the data collection or transfer. If you do not want your data to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by not using that particular service. Promotions that run on Yahoo! may be sponsored by companies other than Yahoo! or may be cosponsored by Yahoo! and another company. Some or all data collected during a promotion may be shared with the sponsor. If data will be shared, you will be notified prior to the time of data collection or transfer. You can decide not to participate in the promotion if you don't want your data to be shared. Currently, most Yahoo! promotions are limited to US or North American residents. Please be aware that Yahoo! Internet access partners, advertisers, and web sites that have links on our site may collect personally identifiable information about you. The information practices of those Internet access partners, advertisers, and web sites linked to Yahoo! are not covered by this privacy statement. With whom does Yahoo! share my information? As a general rule, Yahoo! will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it or under the circumstances described below. Please see the Terms of Service or Use Agreements for each of our products and services for more detailed information about how your personal information may be shared. The following describes some of the ways that your information may be disclosed. Business Partners & Sponsors: Yahoo! may disclose your personal information to business partners or sponsors, but this is specifically described to you prior to data collection or prior to transferring the data. Details of shared use can be found in specific Terms of Service or Use Agreements, and sweepstakes and promotions rules. Some or all data collected during a Yahoo! promotion may be shared with a sponsor. If personally identifying data about you will be shared, we will tell you before we collect or transfer the data. Many promotions offer opportunities to request additional information from sponsors. By requesting more information, you give Yahoo! permission to transfer your personal information to the sponsor so they can fulfill your request. In many instances, only your email address will be shared. If more information will be shared with the sponsor, you will be notified prior to the transfer. Yahoo! Stores & Shopping: If you make a purchase from a store hosted by Yahoo! Store, or a merchant in Yahoo! Shopping, the information obtained during your visit to those stores, and the information you give such as your credit card number and contact information, is provided to the merchants. This is to enable transactions to take place. Merchants listed in Yahoo! Shopping or site or in Yahoo! Stores have separate privacy and data collection practices. Yahoo! has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies. For more information regarding the merchant, their store, and their privacy policies, return to that store's home page and click on their Information link. Yahoo! Auctions: On the Yahoo! Auctions site, we currently provide the information necessary to facilitate the auction transaction between the buyer and the seller. Yahoo! GeoCities: If you have a personal home page on Yahoo! GeoCities you may choose to participate in the Pages That Pay program. If you sign up to become an affiliate with this program, Yahoo! will share certain personal information of yours with BeFree, Inc. and each merchant you select. This includes information from the affiliate application and a unique Yahoo! GeoCities identifier number. This information is transmitted in order for you to participate in the program and to receive compensation for the sales and traffic to the merchants' sites generated from your web site. For more detailed information about the Pages That Pay program, please click here. From time to time, you may be offered the opportunity to receive materials or special offers from third parties. If you opt-in to receive information from these third parties, Yahoo! will (with your permission) share your name and email address with them . Third Party Data & Data in the Aggregate: Under confidentiality agreements, Yahoo! may match user information with third party data. Also, Yahoo! discloses aggregated user statistics (for example, 45% of our users are female) in order to describe our services to current and prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes. Other: Yahoo! may also disclose account information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating Yahoo!'s Terms of Service or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Yahoo!'s rights or property, other Yahoo! users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. Yahoo! may disclose or access account information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain, service, and improve our products and services. What are my choices regarding collection, use, and distribution of my information? Yahoo! may, from time to time, send you email regarding our products and services. In addition, if you indicated upon registration that you are interested in receiving offers or information from Yahoo! and our partners, we may occasionally send you direct mail about products and services that we feel may be of interest to you. Only Yahoo! (or agents working on behalf of Yahoo! and under confidentiality agreements) will send you these direct mailings and only if you indicated that you do not object to these offers. If you do not want to receive such mailings, simply tell us when you give us your personal information. Or, at any time you can easily edit your Yahoo! Account Information to no longer receive such offers and mailings. You will need your Yahoo! ID and Password in order to access your Yahoo! Account Information. On some types of Yahoo! promotions, we will ask for your email address in order to update you on your score, entries, and status in prize drawings. When you participate in these types of promotions, you automatically receive promotion-related email, unless you choose the no-email option that some promotions offer. Occasionally these promotion-related email messages may include targeted advertisements. You also have choices with respect to cookies. By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject all cookies you will be unable to use those Yahoo! services that require registration in order to participate. These services include (but are not limited to): Yahoo! Mail, My Yahoo!, Calendar, Chat, Message Boards, and creating a portfolio in Yahoo! Finance. You can still use Yahoo! Shopping and Yahoo! Auctions and many other Yahoo! sites even if you do not accept cookies. Yahoo! does not sell or rent user information to anyone. We will notify you at the time of data collection or transfer if your data will be shared with a third party and you will always have the option of not permitting the transfer.

Profile at any time by using your Yahoo! ID and password. If you have forgotten your password, please click here to request a new password. For all other problems signing in to Yahoo!, please click here and complete this form. Your Yahoo! account can be deleted or deactivated, but doing so will result in not being able to access any members-only area of the Yahoo! network, including your Yahoo!

Keeping your personal financial and health-related information private is vitally important to us. As with all information, Yahoo! will never rent or sell your personal financial or health-related information. This includes information kept in your Yahoo! Portfolio or from any Yahoo! Health assessment tools. For more specific information about health-related data, please see the Yahoo! Health Data Privacy and Security Policy. If you use Yahoo! Online Banking Access, Yahoo! will work with your financial institution to present your account balances and history to you on your customized Yahoo! pages. In order to present your financial information to you, Yahoo! receives that information from your financial institution in an encrypted format and presents it to you over a secure-server. Yahoo! Online Banking Access is regu larly updated. Yahoo! encrypts this data and stores it on our secure servers. Knowing that you use certain services or features may help us to offer you better and more relevant content and advertisements. But as with all personally identifiable information, we do not make this available to any third parties without your permission. Any user statistics that we may provide to prospective advertisers or partners regarding financial product or service usage on Yahoo! are provided in the aggregate only and do not include any personally identifiable information about any individual user. Please note that there are several places on the Yahoo! network of Web sites where you can transmit credit card information in order to complete a purchase transaction or for verification purposes. Any time we ask for a credit card number we transmit that credit card number in an encrypted format. We use industry-standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- What security precautions are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of my information? Your Yahoo! Account Information and Yahoo! Profile are password-protected so that you and only you have access to this personal information. You may edit your Yahoo! Account Information and Yahoo! Profile by using your Yahoo! ID and password. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Yahoo! will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. Also remember to sign out of your Yahoo! account and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe. As a global company Yahoo! has international sites and users all over the world. When you give Yahoo! personal information, that information may be sent electronically to servers outside of the country where you originally entered the information, such as to the United States or other countries. In addition, that information may be used, stored and processed outside of the country where you entered that information. Whenever Yahoo! handles personal information as described above, regardless of where this occurs, Yahoo! takes steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with the relevant Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Yahoo! cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. What about children's privacy? Naturally, the safety of children is very important to us. Yahoo! recommends that parents and kids try Yahooligans!, a web guide designed especially for users between the ages of 7 and 12. Sites listed on Yahooligans! have all been selected by a team of experienced educators. This selection process ensures that these sites are fun and age-appropriate for our younger audience. Yahoo! is a general audience web site that complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. When a child under age 13 attempts to register with Yahoo!, we ask that they have a parent or guardian establish a Yahoo! Family Account. This is to ensure that the parent or guardian consents to the collection and use of personally identifying information from that child. Yahoo! Family Accounts allows parents to review, edit and delete information relating to their child's Yahoo! account. If a parent wishes to refuse to permit further collection or use of their child's information by Yahoo!, that parent can send an email to account-remove@yahoo-inc.com to request deletion of their child's account. Under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, no web site operator is permitted to require a child under the age of 13 to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an activity as a condition of participation. Yahoo! abides by this requirement. Yahoo! does not share personally identifying information about users who are under the age of 13 with business partners or other third parties. Yahoo! will not contact users who are under the age of 13 about special offers or for marketing purposes. All Yahoo! account holders, including parents and children with Yahoo! Family Accounts, are subject to this Privacy Policy. What else should I know about my privacy? Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example on message boards, through email, or in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online.

Friday November 19, 1999             Previous  |  Next                                                                                               Dear Yahoo!:                 What is a cgi-bin?                 Peter Toronto, Ontario                                  Dear Peter:                                                        We happen to know that ""cgi-bin"" refers to a certain type of directory found on web servers. Just as you might name a directory ""img"" if it contained images, or ""text"" if it contained text files, webmasters create directories titled ""cgi-bin"" to contain programs that let you do things via web pages.   But why ""cgi-bin,"" you might ask? Unlike the two previous examples, it's definitely a little arcane, we'll admit, but there is a method to the madness. Here's how we found out:   The hyphen suggests that the term has two parts, so we broke it up and first searched on the term "" cgi ."" That led us to the Yahoo! category  World Wide Web > Common Gateway Interface . Aha! CGI is an acronym for ""Common Gateway Interface.""   To find out exactly what that meant, we visited the category and clicked on the  Common Gateway Interface  site, which happens to have a sunglasses icon ( ) next to the title, meaning it has been judged as highly valuable within its category. We learned that Common Gateway Interface is ""a standard for interfacing external applications with information servers.""   That fits nicely into our understanding of the ""cgi-bin"" directory, which holds those ""applications"" or programs while they wait to be executed via web pages (the ""information servers"").   Lastly, we needed to know what the ""bin"" stands for. We doubted that it meant ""bin"" as in ""laundry bin"" or ""dustbin."" So we did another search. This time our Yahoo! search didn't pan out -- too many other uses of those three letters. That meant we had to go to a specific reference site. One of our favorites is called  PC Webopaedia , a computing dictionary of terms, acronyms, and phrases related to technology.   We searched for "" bin "" in the Webopaedia and, sure enough, we hit paydirt! ""Bin"" is an abbreviation for  binary  and is used as ""a name for directories that contain files stored in binary format -- computer-readable but not human-readable files."" Case closed.                                                                                                                                                                                        More Questions About   · Computers & Internet   · Yahoo!

Yahoo!                                  Yahoo! Inc.    is an American  computer services  company with a mission to ""be the most essential global internet service for consumers and businesses"". It operates an  Internet  portal, a  web directory  and a host of other services including the popular  Yahoo! Mail . It was founded by  Stanford  graduate students  David Filo  and  Jerry Yang  in January  1994  and incorporated on  March 2 ,  1995 .  The company is headquartered in  Sunnyvale, California .  According to  Alexa Internet , a web trends company, Yahoo is the most visited website on the Internet today. The global network of Yahoo websites received 3 billion page views per day  as of October 2004 .      Contents     1 History   2 Important events   3 Yahoo-owned services     3.1 Yahoo!

The name  Yahoo  is an  acronym  for "" Yet Another   Hierarchical  Officious Oracle,"" but Filo and Yang insist they selected the name because they liked the general definition of a  yahoo , as in  Gulliver's Travels  by  Jonathan Swift : ""rude, unsophisticated, uncouth."" Yahoo itself first resided on Yang's  student   workstation , "" Akebono ,"" while the  software  was lodged on Filo's computer, "" Konishiki ""—both named after legendary  sumo wrestlers . The ""yet another"" phrasing goes back at least to the  Unix  utility  yacc , whose name is an acronym for ""yet another  compiler compiler "".  Yahoo had its  initial public offering  on  April 12 ,  1996 , selling 2.6 million shares at $13 each.  As Yahoo's popularity has increased, so has the range of features it offers, making it a kind of one-stop shop for all the popular activities of the Internet.  These now include:  Yahoo! Mail , a  web-based e-mail  service,  an instant messaging client , a very popular  mailing list  service ( Yahoo! Groups ), online gaming and chat, various news and information portals, online shopping and  auction  facilities. Many of these are based at least in part on previously independent services, which Yahoo has acquired - such as the popular  GeoCities  free web-hosting service,   Rocketmail , and various competing  mailing list  providers such as  eGroups . Many of these take-overs were controversial and unpopular with users of the existing services, as Yahoo often changed the relevant  terms of service . An example of this would be their claiming  intellectual property  over content on their servers, which the old companies had not.  Yahoo has now begun making partnerships with  telecommunications  and Internet providers - such as  BT  in the  UK ,  Rogers  in  Canada  and  SBC  in the  US  - to create content-rich  broadband  services to rival those offered by  AOL . The company offers a branded  credit card ,  Yahoo! Visa , through a partnership with First USA .  Beginning in late 2002, Yahoo quietly began to bolster its search services by acquiring competing technologies.  In December 2002, it acquired  Inktomi , and in July 2003, it acquired  Overture Services, Inc. , and through it, search sites  AltaVista  and  AlltheWeb .  On  February 18 ,  2004 , Yahoo dropped  Google -powered results and returned to using its own technology to provide search results.  As of  2005  Yahoo!'s news message boards have gained somewhat of a cult following.  Attached to every story is a discussion board, yet rarely are the posts pertinent to the story.

Inc.  (NASDAQ:  YHOO )                  is an internet services company. It is an American company.It                  operates an Internet portal and provides a full range of products                  and services including a search engine, the Yahoo! Directory and                  Yahoo! Mail. It was founded by Stanford graduate students Jerry                  Yang and David Filo on January of 1994 and incorporated on March                  2, 1995. The company is headquartered in Sunnyvale, California.                 According to Web trends companies Alexa Internet and Netcraft,                  Yahoo! is the most visited website on the Internet today with                  more than 412 million unique users. The global network of Yahoo!                  websites received 3.4 billion page views per day on average as                  of October  2005 .

History                             Yahoo! started out as ""Jerry's Guide to the World Wide Web"", a                web site featuring a directory of other sites, organized in a hierarchy                (rather than a searchable index of pages). It was renamed ""Yahoo!""                shortly thereafter. ""Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle""                is a backronym for this name, but Filo and Yang insist they selected                the name because they liked the word's general definition, as in                 Gulliver's Travels  by Jonathan Swift: ""rude, unsophisticated,                uncouth."" [1]                 As the backronymed version of the name implies, it was not the first                directory of its kind, but it was the first to become widely popular                as ""the"" directory of the fledgling Web. Yahoo! itself first resided                on Yang's student workstation, ""Akebono"", while the software was                lodged on Filo's computer, ""Konishiki"", both named after famous                sumo wrestlers. The ""yet another"" phrasing goes back at least to                the Unix utility yacc, whose name is an acronym for ""yet another                compiler compiler"".               Yahoo! had its initial public offering on April 12, 1996, raising                $33.8 million, by selling 2.6 million shares at US$13 each.               As Yahoo!'s popularity has increased, so has the range of features                it offers, making it a kind of one-stop shop for all the popular                activities of the Internet. These now include: Yahoo! Mail, a Web-based                e-mail service, Yahoo! Messenger, an instant messaging client, a                very popular mailing list service (Yahoo! Groups), online gaming                and chat, various news and information portals, online shopping                and online auction facilities. Many of these are based at least                in part on previously independent services, which Yahoo! has acquired                - such as the popular GeoCities free Web-hosting service, Rocketmail,                and various competing mailing list providers such as eGroups. Many                of these take-overs were controversial and unpopular with users                of the existing services, as Yahoo! often changed the relevant terms                of service. An example of this is their claiming intellectual property                rights for the content on their servers, which the original companies                had not done.               At the pinnacle of the Internet boom in the year 2000, the cable                news station CNBC reported that Yahoo! and eBay were discussing                a 50/50 merger. [2] ,                Although the merger never materialised the two companies decided                to form a marketing/advertising alliance six years later in 2006.                 [3]               Yahoo! has partnerships with telecommunications and Internet providers                - such as BT in the UK, Rogers in  Canada ,                and AT&T, Verizon [4]                 and BellSouth in the US - to create content-rich broadband services                to rival those offered by AOL. The company offers a branded credit                card,  Yahoo! Visa , through a partnership with Chase.               Beginning in late 2002, Yahoo! began to bolster its search services                by acquiring relevant companies. In December 2002, Yahoo! acquired                Inktomi, and in July 2003, it acquired Overture Services, Inc. and                its subsidiaries AltaVista and AlltheWeb.               As of  2005  Yahoo!'s news message boards                have gained something of a cult following. Attached to every story                is a discussion board, yet rarely are the posts pertinent to the                story. Often, the posts are deliberately outrageous, attempting                to provoke angry responses which, in turn, lead to more offensive                posts and so on.               In June  2005  Yahoo! acquired blo.gs,                a service based on RSS feed aggregation, primarily from weblogs                (hence the name), which produces a simple list (and also an RSS                feed thereof) of freshly updated Weblogs, ordered according to recentness                of update. blo.gs was the first Internet company hosted on a domain                hack Yahoo! acquired, del.icio.us being the second.                                                                       Important events               Please note that this list is merely partial.                               January 1994: Jerry Yang and David Filo create ""Jerry's Guide                  to the World Wide Web"" while studying at Stanford University.

[14]                 February 7, 2000: Yahoo.com was brought to a halt for a few                  hours as it was the victim of a distributed denial of service                  attack (DDoS).  [15]                    [16] .                  On the next day, its shares rose about $16, or 4.5 percent as                  the failure was blamed on hackers rather than on an internal glitch,                  unlike a fault with eBay earlier that year.                 June 28, 2000: Yahoo! acquires eGroups.                 March 7, 2001: Yahoo! CEO Tim Koogle announces he will step                  down and remain only a company board member.

Developer Network Blog      « Previous  |   Main  |  Next »            March 28, 2007    Introducing the Yahoo! Mail Web Service    At Yahoo!, we pride ourselves on helping people around the world (over 500 million of them!) connect and communicate with each other using the vast array of communications platforms we offer. Of those platforms, the most popular is  Yahoo! Mail , with nearly 250 million users worldwide, making Yahoo! Mail the #1 email provider in the world. I've had a Yahoo! Mail account for years, and for me, Yahoo! Mail passes the proverbial ""mom test"" -- my mother is a loyal Yahoo! Mail user. Chances are that you use Yahoo! Mail to communicate with someone you care about, and we're proud that Yahoo! Mail continues to be integral to so many lives.    While we are certainly proud of the success of Yahoo! Mail, today we are announcing how we are going beyond the boundaries of the Yahoo! network and enabling developers to build new tools or applications around Yahoo! Mail. We are thrilled to announce the open availability of the  Yahoo! Mail Web Service , web service for Yahoo! Mail (accessible via SOAP or JSON-RPC) that we  previewed to Yahoo! Hack Day attendees . With the Yahoo! Mail Web Service, you can connect to the core mail platform to perform typical mailbox tasks for premium users such as list messages and folders, and compose and send messages (you can also build mail preview tools for free users with limited Web Service functionality). In other words, developers outside of Yahoo! can now build mail tools or applications on the same infrastructure we use to build the highly-scaled Yahoo! Mail service that serves nearly 250 million Yahoo! Mail users today -- users who might want to help you make some cash with your application.    Yes, cash. With this release, Yahoo! Mail Web Service developers can earn referral commissions by building compelling applications targeted at our premium email users. For a trial period, Yahoo! Mail is offering an incentive for developers to build applications using the full functionality available for premium Yahoo! Mail accounts. Specifically, Yahoo! Mail is currently providing a commission of $10.00 for every new  Yahoo! Mail Plus  account referred by approved developers. Read the Yahoo! Mail Web Service documentation for more details on how to participate. As the program evolves, we will continue to evaluate and consider additional business models for developers, ISVs, and partners. Let us know what you would like to see in the comments, or post to our  suggestion board  -- we're listening.    The Yahoo! Mail Web Service is a big release for Yahoo! and the Internet, and it's only the beginning of what you'll be seeing from Yahoo!. Jump into our  code samples for Java, .NET, PHP, Perl and Python , and build your dream mail app today, then be sure to give us feedback on your experience so we can continue to make the API even better. Be sure to leverage the  online Yahoo! Mail Web Service support group  where you can get help from the Yahoo! Mail Web Service team and your fellow developers. We can't wait to see what applications you will build when you add your imagination to the platform. Maybe you want to build an application that backs up Yahoo! mail targeted at a large number of Yahoo! users, or maybe you just want to add a niche feature that makes Yahoo! Mail better for your mom. For inspiration, we've gathered a few applications:    Yahoo! Mail Search  (Mail Plus) Flickr Postcard Yahoo! Mail with Flickr Image Association    You can show your applications to the world by adding them to the  Yahoo! Developer Network Gallery  under the  Mail category . This is an exciting time for us at Yahoo! as we continue to push innovations like the Yahoo! Mail Web Service to the developer community. By offering a platform that is scalable, reliable, and already being used by nearly 250 million customers worldwide, we're enabling developers of all types to harness the massive power of the Yahoo! network and platform. We can't wait to see what you build on the world's #1 email platform!    You can watch a short screencast here (or  download the full video ) with  Ryan Kennedy  as he explains more about the Yahoo! Mail Web Service in detail:       To post this video on your web site, use the following embed code:       And Hack Day hacker  Leah Culver  demonstrates her Flickr Postcard hack which uses Yahoo! Mail Web Service too ( full download here ):       To post this video on your web site, use the following embed code:         Chad Dickerson, Head of Yahoo! Developer Network          Posted at March 28, 2007  2:00 PM     Comments      Try my threaded Yahoo! mail reader (read only)    http://web32309.mail.mud.yahoo.com/tapestry/    Nothing else works except for viewing mails & threading.    (thanks to Ryan for putting it up)     Posted by: t3rmin4t0r at March 29, 2007  3:10 AM     So does this all affect in any way the non-premium or the non-paying users of yahoo mail? Except for the unlimited storage in May.  Actually, right now I'd prefer Yahoo! Mail to provide the free users with support for e-mail programs.     Posted by: dmitri at March 29, 2007  3:54 AM     Unfortunately the Flickr postcard hack has nothing to do with using the Yahoo Web Mail Services.  It is an exercise in javascript via greasemonkey.  The code that actually uses the web service resides in a PHP form submission handler.  No details about this script are included.   Please either include the PHP example code that actually uses the API or eliminate this non-example.         Posted by: Toady at March 29, 2007  8:46 AM     We have been talking about Yahoo! a lot over at Highbrid Nation. You gotta admit they have really stepped up thier game against Google. As these big companies battle it out, it just means better products for us :)     Posted by: Evorgleb at March 29, 2007  8:52 AM     We forgot to mention that the Flickr Postcard hack was a collaborative effort, and, though Tantek Celik was unable to join us in the screencast, he certainly deserves a mention here.  Here's his blog post regarding the hack:    http://tantek.com/log/2006/10.html#d05t1826    ""We were so relieved to have successfully finished and demonstrated a hack: our first Greasemonkey hack, first Flickr DOM walking/scraping, and first Yahoo Mail API app, that we just sat back and enjoyed watching the rest of the demos. But surprise surprise, our simple little hack was deemed worthy of 2nd place Yahoo Mail API hack!""     Posted by: Matt McAlister at March 29, 2007 11:00 AM     Here's a sample Rails app (and plugin!).  The plugin wraps up BBAuth and the Mail API and is your's at  http://richarddcrowley.org/blog/view/124   The sample app is really just a sample and currently only views your inbox.  Once I snag a premium account I'll add full message viewing.     Posted by: Richard Crowley at April  3, 2007  7:48 AM     Can we create a yahoo e-mail account using Yahoo Mail Web Service or using nay other APIs?    Regards  Sanjay     Posted by: Sanjay at April 25, 2007 11:12 PM     No, that's not allowed. It would make abuse too easy.    Ryan Kennedy  Yahoo! Mail     Posted by: Ryan Kennedy at April 28, 2007 11:26 AM     Is it possible to use this API to serve more than one user simultaneously if I am using a server (3-tier) for handling my users mail? If its cookie based authentication, I suspect its not possible.    Thanks.     Posted by: Manohar at May 13, 2007 10:49 AM     Manohar:    I can't see any reason why that shouldn't work.  I'm not sure why cookies would make this a problem for you.  Can you be more specific about what wouldn't work?     Posted by: Jeremy Zawodny at May 14, 2007 11:31 AM     I can't tell whether the terms of use for the new Yahoo Mail Web Service  API would allow someone to develop a JavaMail provider that  allowed access to Yahoo Mail using the JavaMail API  (http://java.sun.com/products/javamail).    Could someone please explain whether this would be allowed  by your terms of use?    For example, in your terms:    1. You must use the Browser Based Authentication API to enable access to the user's Yahoo! account through your Application.  2. You may not use the Yahoo! Mail Web Service API to mine or scrape user data from the user's Yahoo! account.  3. You may not use the Yahoo! Mail Web Service API to recreate a mimicked version of Yahoo! Mail on your site.  4. You may not use the Yahoo! Mail Web Service API to display the user's Yahoo! account information in a third party email client.    Does ""user data"" and ""account information"" include the content of email  messages?    Thanks.     Posted by: Bill Shannon at May 14, 2007 11:38 AM     Bill...the TOS doesn't seem to be very clear there. I'll see what I can do to get that cleared up. The short answer is yes...it's fine to write a JavaMail provider for the Yahoo! Mail Web Service.     Posted by: Ryan Kennedy at May 15, 2007 10:13 AM     i wish yall would make the home page to where you can personalize it the way you want to. like adding your aviator, and stuff like you would on yahoo!360, etc... BUT!!! u guys are making yahoo! mail even more awsome! i have been with you guys since i was 16 and now im gunna be 21 n oct. so yall have improoved alot since ive been with you all.     Posted by: kathleen Taylor at June 18, 2007 10:12 AM     How can I retrive contacts as shown on screencast? I didn't see anything useful in documentation. :(     Posted by: 0cool at July  6, 2007  9:48 AM     Where did you see the list of contacts retrieved? The address book isn't available via the Yahoo! Mail Web Service.    Ryan Kennedy  Yahoo! Mail Web Service     Posted by: Ryan Kennedy at July  7, 2007 10:22 PM     I see from the above that the address book is not available via Yahoo Mail Web Service. Is is accessible via any other API, even in a limited form ?   My app presents the user's name / phone number list aggregated from various services they configure.  Have had a request to include Yahoo address book.  Is that (or will it be) possible ?   Thanks!  Dave.

Posted by: Dave Curley at July 19, 2007  4:45 AM     Dave, it's been brought up many times. I've been asked that question a few times a month since we released the mail web service. There is currently no web service for the address book. That being said, it would be silly to offer mail and then not offer address book. So my guess is that you'll see one offered by us eventually.     Posted by: Ryan Kennedy at July 21, 2007  8:27 PM     i cant seem to open my mail     Posted by: winkie at July 24, 2007  1:11 AM     i cant seem to open my mail     Posted by: Rakhi at July 24, 2007  1:12 PM     If all I want is a summary of the inbox and sent items, would that fall under item 2 (You may not use the Yahoo! Mail Web Service API to mine or scrape user data from the user's Yahoo! account) of the TOS? For example, if I want to loop through the emails and identify the sender, the recipients and the date on which the mail was sent and show the summary to the user, would that be a ""mine or scrape user data from the user's Yahoo! account""?

Posted by: Mauricio Chica Patio at August 24, 2007  2:24 PM     whenever my friend from japan sends me mail using yahoo, she has some very colorfull background. I need to know how to get some of those too. Is it thats she's using a different yahoo?     Posted by: candy at November 27, 2007  1:50 PM     Does yahoo APIs allow programatic access to body of mail.I mean if I have one mail in my yahoo account.Can I access the body of mail through yahoo APIs.

Posted by: badar at March 30, 2008  3:09 AM     Does there any other provision to read yahoo address book since it is not available from web service api?     amar     Posted by: amar at March 31, 2008  4:25 AM     I want to use my yahoo contacts in my own site . is there any provision for that?     Posted by: mani at March 31, 2008 10:39 PM     can i import my yahoo contacts to my own site using web service api?       Posted by: vmanikandan at March 31, 2008 10:43 PM     This is exactly what I was looking for developing the email stuff. I think with this much much resources could be saved for a small scale business.

clueweb09-en0000-05-25774	"                 Chat Home  -  Help          Chatting Safely on Yahoo!         Yahoo! Chat allows people from all over the world to chat, make  friends and build communities. Chat can be an enriching experience but  everyone should be aware that, like in any public area on the Internet  or the ""real world"", there are people who want to take advantage of  people’s trust.     To help create a safe chatting experience, we have put together this  guide to help our customers protect themselves while online.     Creating an ID for Chatting     Each person who ventures online needs an ID - a unique nickname (or  alias) that allows him or her to be recognized while participating in  the Internet community.      Yahoo! Chat offers members the ability to chat under aliases, which  allows them to hide their email addresses. We encourage you to use  these features to protect your identity and prevent random contact with  people you do not know or trust.     For instructions on creating and using an alias,  click here .     Remember, your alias is one way that the Yahoo! online community  will be able to identify you; let them wonder. You don't want strangers  to know too much about you just from reading your ID.     Online IDs can communicate something about the person behind them,  so be certain of what you are willing to share. For example, the name  ""Butterflyfan"" communicates that this user might be fond of  butterflies. There is little risk of someone being able to distinguish  one fan of butterflies from the millions of others who exist in the  world. On the other hand, the name ""Butterflies4Jane"" may go too far.  It provides someone with a name - both a conversation starter and a  misguided sense of familiarity.     When creating a new online ID, you may want to leave out the following personal information:                  First and last name        Address        Phone number        Family names         Whatever you choose, remember that your ID should be suitable, not too revealing, and (most important) fun.     Using an Alias     Use following steps to pick your alias before entering Yahoo! Chat:            Click the File menu in Yahoo! Messenger and select select ""Yahoo! Chat"" and then ""Join a Room.""        Select the Alias that you would like to use from the “Enter Chat room as” menu.        Select a Category on the left and a Room on the right.         Double click the room that you would like to enter.          A Chat window will pop up with your ID on the right side of the  screen. You will also see a list of all the people that are currently  in the room.     Tips for Safe Chatting     Don’t chat about things that could enable a stranger to locate you.  That includes your last name, the name of your school or work place,  the city you live in, and where you hang out.     Protect your info. Don’t put identifiable information in your user  profile, including photos. What's uploaded to the Internet can be  downloaded and shared by everyone. Avoid posting photos that allow  people to identify you, especially sexually suggestive images. Before  uploading a photo, think about how you'd feel if it were seen by a  parent, friend, or future employer.     Never meet with someone you encounter in a chat room unless you already know who they are.      Be honest about your age. Yahoo Chat is restricted to users who are  18 years of age or older. If you are too young to sign up, do not  attempt to lie about your age. Talk with your parents about alternative  sites that may be appropriate for you.

Use feature detection when you can.  Use the user agent as a last resort.  YAHOO.env.ua stores a version number for the browser engine, 0 otherwise.  This value may or may not map to the version number of the browser using the engine.  The value is  presented as a float so that it can easily be used for boolean evaluation  as well as for looking for a particular range of versions.  Because of this,  some of the granularity of the version info may be lost (e.g., Gecko 1.8.0.9  reports 1.8).

Revolutionary hacks from the heart of Yahoo!                   Posted December 9, 2008                   Last week's Winter Hack 2008 brought together Yahoo! technologists and tinkerers for a show of coding ingenuity. We had a new video player platform to hack on, tools and components from  Yahoo's ""open stack,""  plus  all our public APIs . Hackers had 24 hours to play.                   We saw hacks from Bangalore, Boston, New York, and Dallas, as well as Silicon Valley.  CentMail  won the ""most socially responsible hack,"" presenting a novel way to fight email spam.

Video: Test-Driven Development with YUI                   Posted November 5, 2008                    Nicholas Zakas is the author of the YUI Test component and a principal front-end engineer on Yahoo!'s Front Page team.  He recently spoke at the 2008 Yahoo! Frontend Engineering Summit on test-driven development in the browser, walking through the fundamental concepts of TDD and applying those to some specific use cases.                    YUI Test  is part of the YUI Library, and we use it extensively, but it's suitable for testing any JavaScript code you've developed, regardless of whether that code is YUI-based.

Tuesday June 1, 1999             Previous  |  Next                                                                                               Dear Yahoo!:                 What does ""UNIX"" stand for?                 Shell Shocked Motherwell, Scotland                                  Dear Shell:                                                        Short answer: Unix stands for UNiplexed Information and Computing System. (It was originally spelled ""Unics."")   Long answer: Coined in 1969 to describe a specific computer operating system, the term ""Unix"" now covers a whole host of variations, including Linux, FreeBSD, and Solaris. The name was intended as a pun on an earlier system called ""Multics"" (Multiplexed Information and Computing Service).   That sidesplitting pun is the key to understanding the acronym, since the word ""uniplexed"" doesn't seem to mean anything in particular. (""Multiplexed"" refers to a communications system able to carry many messages simultaneously.)   Here's how we found all this out:   Since we were looking for a specific term, a dictionary seemed like a good place to go. By entering the terms ""computer"" (we knew that ""Unix"" related to computers) and ""dictionary"" into the Yahoo! search box, we landed at the  Computers and Internet > Dictionaries  category.   There, we clicked off to both the  PC Webopaedia  and the  Free On-Line Dictionary of Computing , where we began to get a sense of the meaning and history of Unix.   At the Webopaedia, we spotted a promising crosslink to the  Unix FAQ , where we got confirmation of the punning aspect of the term.   Finally, to understand just what was being made fun of, we visiting the  Multics  page that we found through a conventional keyword search of Yahoo!                                                                                                                                                                                        More Questions About   · Computers & Internet   · Words & Wordplay   · Yahoo!
