Please  introduce links  to this page from other  articles related to it .  (October 2008)           Living With Fibromyalgia: A Journey of Hope and Understanding       Directed by   Stephen Eyer       Produced by   Daneen Akers,  Stephen Eyer       Written by   Daneen Akers,  Stephen Eyer       Distributed by   Trillusion Media       Release  date(s)   March 22 ,  2007       Running time   71 mins       Language   English       Budget   N/A       Living With Fibromyalgia: A Journey of Hope and Understanding  is a  2007   documentary film  by Stephen Eyer and Daneen Akers from Trillusion Media, Inc. that explores the  chronic pain  condition known as  fibromyalgia .   The film was created as a resource for  fibromyalgia  patients and their families and to help create awareness about this condition. It tells the stories of seven patients suffering from  fibromyalgia  including Darlene Akers, the mother of one of the filmmakers, and Lynne Matallana, the president of the National Fibromyalgia Association and the author of The Complete Idiots Guide to Fibromyalgia. The documentary premiered in  San Diego  on  March 22 ,  2007  at the  Hillcrest  Landmark Theatre and has garnered wide praise within the  fibromyalgia  community for its empathetic approach and hopeful message.

The patients share how they were diagnosed, how  fibromyalgia  has changed their lives, how they deal with  fibromyalgia , and their advice for other patients and family members of patients.   Interwoven with the patient stories are experts from the Fibromyalgia Rehabilitation Program at  Cedars-Sinai Medical Center  in  Los Angeles ,  California . The filmmakers talk to Judy Fishman, an  occupational therapist , Dr. Michael Gilewski, a  psychologist , Miriam Siegal, a  physical therapist , and extensively to Dr. Stuart Silverman, a  rheumatologist  and long-time  fibromyalgia  researcher.   While patients do share how they personally have dealt with the  pain ,  fatigue , and related symptoms of  fibromyalgia , no specific medications are endorsed, rather a broad approach tailored for individual patients combining a mixture of traditional and alternative practices is advocated. The films overall message is that  fibromyalgia  is a real, extremely difficult and often debilitating condition, but there is still  hope  for a fulfilling and even healthy life after a diagnosis.   The filmmakers have stated that Living With Fibromyalgia is the film they wished their family could have sat down to watch together when they first heard the word "" fibromyalgia .""     [ edit ]   Funding   Funding for the film was primarily provided by the filmmakers, one of whom sold her house as part of their fundraising efforts. [ 1 ]  The filmmakers have donated up to 10 percent of all sales of the film to the National Fibromyalgia Association to support fibromyalgia research and education.     [ edit ]   Reception and Legacy   The documentary was the centerpiece of the National Fibromyalgia Associations  2007  Fibromyalgia Awareness Day campaign, screening at over 125 locations nationwide over the  May 12  weekend.

Quit Smoking     Note: You need javascript to open and use the calculator or form in this article.     It can be one of the hardest things to do: quit smoking. But medical experts say it can also be one of the best things you can do for your health. It can also save you money.    Just use our handy  calculator  to compute how much it costs in a year to smoke. Then read on to learn about the health costs - and find out some tips that have helped others quit for good.     NOTE: You need Javascript to open and use the calculator, which your browser has apparently disabled. You can simply multiply the price you pay for a pack of cigarettes times the number of packs you smoke in a week times 52 instead.     One in every five deaths in the United States is smoking-related according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In fact, the CDC points out about 10 million people in the United States have died from causes attributed to smoking (including heart disease, emphysema, and other respiratory diseases) since the first Surgeon General's report on smoking and health in 1964. (Read about "" Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease "" "" Coronary Heart Disease "" "" Respiratory System "") Two million of those deaths were the result of lung cancer. (Read about "" Lung Cancer "") Heavy smokers, or those who smoke over a pack of cigarettes a day, can find themselves at the greatest risk. The CDC also says exposure to secondhand smoke causes an estimated 3,000 deaths from lung cancer among American adults. Scientific studies also link secondhand smoke with heart disease. In addition, the American Cancer Society (ACS) says 90 percent of people with oral cancer use tobacco. (Read about "" Oral Cancer "")   More health risks   According to the National Women's Health Information Center (NWHIC), women have seen the highest increase in smoking related diseases. Since 1960, lung cancer deaths in women are up 400 percent, according to CDC. NWHIC says tobacco use by pregnant women has been linked with increased risk for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and mental retardation. (Read about "" Healthy Pregnancy "")   Smoking is also considered a trigger for asthma, according to the American Lung Association (ALA), and secondhand smoke worsens the health of children with asthma. (Read about "" Asthma "") Studies also show that cigarette smokers have more than double the risk of a heart attack compared to non-smokers; and according to ALA, the earlier you start smoking, the greater the health risk. (Read about "" Coronary Heart Disease "") Smoking is also considered a risk factor for developing cataracts, according to CDC. (Read about "" Cataracts "") Smoking can also increase your risk of developing pneumothorax, a condition that can cause the lung to collapse. (Read about "" Pneumothorax "")   Smokeless tobacco   Spit tobacco (also called snuff or chewing tobacco) is not a safe alternative either. According to CDC, one ""dip"" of smokeless tobacco can deliver as much nicotine as several cigarettes. CDC also says that using spit tobacco can cause cracked lips, bleeding gums and sores of the mouth that never heal. (Read about "" Oral Health "") Worst of all, use of spit tobacco can cause mouth cancer and other kinds of cancer. (Read about "" Oral Cancers "") Chewing tobacco also may play a role in heart disease and stroke. (Read about "" Stroke "")   Quitting for good   There is some good news, though. The American Heart Association says that when you quit, your risk of disease diminishes rather quickly. Eventually your risk will be about the same as that of someone who never smoked.   Unfortunately, it can be very hard to quit because nicotine is a very addictive drug. (Read about "" Addiction "") CDC says that for some people, it can be as addictive as heroin or cocaine. Often people make multiple tries, before finally being able to quit. As a result, you may worry that - since you've tried before and failed - it will never happen.   It can help if you stop focusing on the past and start picturing yourself as a non-smoker. Think of the benefits you can have: better health, better breath and more money because you won't be spending it on tobacco products.   The U.S. Public Health Service says that the more support you have, the greater your chance for success. Some of its recommendations:     Talk with your doctor or health care provider to choose a quit smoking plan that is best for you.   Get individual, group, or telephone counseling. The more counseling you have, the better your chances are of quitting.   Ask about programs at your hospital, or call your local health department for information about programs in your area.   Ask about programs at your local chapters of the American Cancer Society, American Lung Association, or American Heart Association     Some other ideas from the American Cancer Society and the American Lung Association include:     Avoid smoking ""cues""  - Remove all reminders of smoking from your house, such as ashtrays and lighters. The adage ""out of sight, out of mind"" can apply here.   Set a date to stop  - Some people find it easier to set a date when they'll stop completely, then work up to that date.   Keep a journal  - Before your ""quit date"" keep a journal of when you're most likely to smoke. Do you light up after meals? Then plan some activity to use after mealtime as a substitute.   Ask for help  - Enlist the help of family and friends. If they smoke too, see if you can get them to join you in a mutual program to stop smoking. You may also want to join a support group through your local hospital or American Lung Association.   Change your routine  - Smoking is often linked with certain habits or routines, so you may find it helpful to change those routines. If you light up with a cup of coffee, for example, switch to tea instead. If you smoke while watching TV, try keeping your hands busy with some handicraft work or do crossword puzzles.     Medications   Some smokers may want to consider using medication to try to stop. There are nicotine and non-nicotine medications available. Examples include:     nicotine patch   nicotine gum and lozenges   nicotine nasal spray   nicotine inhaler   non-nicotine medication that helps ease withdrawal symptoms and block nicotine receptors in the brain   for some people, a non-nicotine antidepressant may also be recommended     According to NWHIC, the nicotine substitutes can help you work on the ""habit"" and ""social"" parts of quitting first. Generally, you quit smoking, and use the nicotine substitute for one or two months, then gradually cut down on the nicotine substitute until you stop that, too. Some nicotine substitutes require a prescription; gum and patches can be bought without one. There is also non-nicotine medication that acts at sites in the brain (Read about "" The Brain "") affected by nicotine and may help ease withdrawal symptoms. Your doctor may also recommend a non-nicotine antidepressant. Keep in mind, however, that all medications can have side effects. For example, nicotine replacement gums and lozenges can sometimes cause dizziness, headaches and rapid heart rate. (Read about "" Headaches "" "" Arrhythmia "") Some non-nicotine anti-smoking medications have been linked to severe mental problems. So always talk to your doctor or healthcare provider first, especially if you are pregnant or have heart or other medical problems. (Read about "" Medicine Safety "")   Avoiding relapses   Whatever method you choose to quit, remember that there will still be temptation, even after you quit. According to the U.S. Surgeon General, most relapses occur within the first 3 months after quitting, so don't be discouraged if you start smoking again. Try again, remembering that most people try several times before they finally quit.   Here are some difficult situations the Surgeon General suggests you watch for:     Alcohol  - Avoid drinking alcohol. Drinking lowers your chances of success.   Other smokers  - Being around smoking can make you want to smoke.   Weight gain  - Many smokers will gain weight when they quit, usually less than 10 pounds. Eat a healthy diet and stay active. Don't let weight gain distract you from your main goal of quitting smoking. You can lose the weight later. (Read about "" Losing Weight "")     If you are having problems with any of these situations, talk to your doctor or other healthcare provider.   Above all, many former smokers say that once you do stop, NEVER have that first cigarette again. Even if you tell yourself it will be ""just this one,"" that first cigarette can lead you right back where you started.

However, if you are considering stopping smoking, you may already realize that quitting requires more than willpower or scaring yourself with statistics of why smoking is bad. Conventional smoking cessation systems often don't work in the long term because they do not address the real reasons that people smoke. Listed below are five often unidentified reasons that people smoke. These reasons might surprise you. Before you engage in your stop smoking process, take some time and identify the important underlying motivations of why you choose to smoke. By understanding those real reasons, you can generate a personalized stop smoking plan that incorporates new strategies of coping and dealing with life. 1. Smoking Is A Lifestyle Coping Tool For many people, smoking is a reliable lifestyle coping tool. Although every person’s specific reasons to smoke are unique, they all share a common theme. Smoking is used as a way to suppress uncomfortable feelings, and smoking is used to alleviate stress, calm nerves, and relax. No wonder that when you are deprived of smoking, your mind and body are unsettled for a little while. Below is a list of some positive intentions often associated with smoking. Knowing why you smoke is one of the first steps towards quitting. Check any and all that apply to you. ___ Coping with anger, stress, anxiety, tiredness, or sadness ___ Smoking is pleasant and relaxing ___ Smoking is stimulating ___ Acceptance – being part of a group ___ As a way to socialize ___ Provides support when things go wrong ___ A way to look confident and in control ___ Keeps weight down ___ Rebellion – defining self as different or unique from a group ___ A reminder to breathe ___ Something to do with your mouth and hands ___ Shutting out stimuli from the outside world ___ Shutting out emotions from the inside world ___ Something to do just for you and nobody else ___ A way to shift gears or changes states ___ An way to feel confident ___ A way to shut off distressing feelings ___ A way to deal with stress or anxiety ___ A way to get attention ___ Marking the beginning or the end of something 2. Smoking Tranquilizer The habit of cigarette smoking is often used to tranquilize emotional issues like anxiety, stress, or low self-esteem. In addition, smoking provides comfort to people with conditions of chronic pain and depression. Smokers with emotional stress or chronic pain often turn to smoking as an attempt to treat their pain. For instance, they may use it to reduce anxiety, provide a sense of calmness and energy, and elevate their mood. Some evidence does suggest that nicotine has some pain-relief benefits. Nicotine releases brain chemicals which soothe pain, heighten positive emotions, and creating a sense of reward. However, any benefit from smoking only eases the pain for a few minutes. Cigarettes contain many other chemicals shown to worsen healing ability of bone, tooth, and cartilage. The mental association between smoking and pain relief can make quitting quite difficult, as can the increased short-term discomfort that quitting smoking adds to a person already suffering with chronic pain, depression, or emotional distress. What are effective ways for people with chronic pain – whether physical or emotional – to make the decision to quit smoking? First, evidence shows that in people who suffer chronic pain, smokers have more pain than nonsmokers do. Also, accept that smoking cessation may indeed make you feel worse in the short run, but may be key to regaining enough vitality to live fully with pain. 3. The Feel Good Syndrome Smoking is a way to avoid feeling unpleasant emotions such as sadness, grief, and anxiety. It can hide apprehensions, fears, and pain. This is accomplished partly through the chemical effects of nicotine on the brain. When smoking, the release of brain chemicals makes smokers feel like they are coping and dealing with life and stressful emotional situations. Nicotine brings up a level of good feelings. Cigarette smokers are aware when nicotine levels and good feelings begin to decrease, and light up quickly enough to stay in their personal comfort zone. However, they may not realize that avoiding their feelings is not the same as taking positive steps to create a life of greater potential and meaning. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) reports that people suffering from nicotine withdrawal have increased aggression, anxiety, hostility, and anger. However, perhaps these emotional responses are due not to withdrawal, but due to an increased awareness of unresolved emotions. If smoking dulls emotions, logically quitting smoking allows awareness of those emotions to bubble up to the surface. If emotional issues aren’t resolved, a smoker may feel overwhelmed and eventually turn back to cigarettes to deal with the uncomfortable feelings. 4. Smoking Makes You Feel Calm and Alive Smokers often say that lighting up a cigarette can calm their nerves, satisfy their cravings, and help them feel energized. Indeed, nicotine in tobacco joins on to receptors in your brain that release “feel good” chemicals that can make you feel calm and energized all at once. Smoking acts as a drug, inducing a feeling of well-being with each puff. But, it’s a phony sense of well-being that never produces a permanent satisfying or fulfilling result. Smoking lures you into believing that you can escape some underlying truth or reality. However, smoking doesn’t allow you to actually transform your day-to-day life and live connected to your deeper hopes and dreams. Instead, when you smoke, the carbon monoxide in the smoke bonds to your red blood cells, taking up the spaces where oxygen needs to bond. This makes you less able to take in the deep, oxygen-filled breath needed to bring you life, to active new energy, to allow health and healing, and bring creative insight into your problems and issues. 5. You Are In The Midst Of Transition If you previously quit smoking, and then resumed the habit once again, consider the idea that perhaps you are in the midst of some “growing pains.” Perhaps you were feeling dissatisfied with some aspect of your life and contemplating making change. However, developing spiritually, emotionally, and physically brings with it the experience of discomfort. Old beliefs rise up, creating sensations of hurt, pain, sadness, anxiety, and uneasiness. You were feeling dissatisfied, restless, ready to change, but then felt the fear that change often ignites. Smoking provides an escape from those uncomfortable feelings. However, smoking also brings an abrupt halt to personal transformation and the evolution of self. Although painful, these feelings are necessary in your personal development. Learning to accept feelings in a new way can help lead you out of disempowering or limiting beliefs, and into a life filled with greater happiness, satisfaction, contentment, or purpose. When you stop smoking and start breathing – conscious, deep, smoke-free, oxygen-filled breaths – your evolution will start up once again. Why Do You Smoke?  If you smoke, then you do so because the act of smoking is personally meaningful to you. Therefore, if you are considering quitting, take some time and explore the reasons underlying your decision to smoke. Become interested, observe yourself, and get curious. Allow yourself an opportunity to turn into a smoking journalist, ready to uncover an intriguing mystery. Before lighting up your next cigarette, ask yourself: a. What positive functions do I believe smoking provides me? b. How will smoking help or change the situation? c. What situations make me smoke the most? d. What emotions or feelings am I trying to avoid or deny? e. If I didn’t smoke right now, what would I feel? How would I handle that feeling? f. What would I do with the energy that is freed up from smoking cessation? The most important factor in stopping smoking is a genuine desire to stop smoking. You were not a born smoker; it’s something you learned to do. Learning new ways of coping with stress is possible, as is learning new ways to relax and raise confidence levels. Use the reasons presented above as clues to uncover the underlying reasons why you smoke. Then, in addition to making a firm decision to stop smoking, also make a firm plan to address your underlying needs. You’re not only kicking the habit, you’re also creating a new balance with your body, mind, and self!

Go to your pantry and look for a white vinegar. Also go to your bathroom and pick your favorite toothpaste. I prefer the sweet Colgate toothpaste. The key to forget smoking (even if you don't want to quit) is by doing a general and thorough clean-up of one's taste buds and mouth walls. That's right - Clean your mouth immaculately! It is filled with garbage called cigarette or tobacco tars (the color tainter of the tip of a smoker's thumb and forefinger) that further cause bad odor mouth emission. They are the culprits (and the poison in fact) that induce a smoker to salivate to light up when seeing another smoking or smells cigarette smoke. The smoker is like an addicted ice cream consumer that makes a person fatter and fatter (another curse of affluence) whose mouth walls and taste buds are like motels for rotten ice cream residues and cause a person also to salivate when seeing someone eats ice cream. Do yourself a favor after reading this article and it will induce you to forget smoking even if you don't want to quit because, at least, you have given your mouth a break from that cancer causing tar and rotten ice cream residues. They progressively rout your throat or lungs for some months or years now without knowing or else it would be too late and incurable when you start feeling ""feverish"" or unusually weak to get up one morning from a budding cancer pain or an onset of diabetes that is caused by the destruction of your pancreas due to smoking. Fill up to 1/3 of a regular drinking glass with vinegar and dilute it with water within your level of tolerance. Use up successively in one session the whole quantity of the vinegar to gargle the mouth. If you are curious, catch the gargled vinegar in another crystal clear glass and see how much blacken tars and other particles have been dislodged that have been comfortably residing in your taste buds and mouth walls for so many months or years. Follow through with water gargle as much as you wish to wring out any remaining tars or rotten ice cream residue, as the case may be. Thereafter, promptly squeeze out an inch of toothpaste and use it to gargle with water. Do this at least twice successively after the vinegar gargle. In the next two days, do this toothpaste gargle twice a day - with no more vinegar - once after breakfast and before going to bed. On the third day and every 4 or 5 days thereafter, do the toothpaste gargle once a week. If at any time you feel like smoking or have an unusual taste in your mouth, gargle or drink water instead of lighting another stick of cigarette. Do not re-infect your immaculately cleaned food portal or else you will get a relapse in your addictions. If you smoke again, you will become like a defeated coward warrior. Are you? After two weeks doing the toothpaste gargles, you will end up hating the smell or smoke of cigarettes - GUARANTEED. Question: Why smoke when you now hate the taste or smell of cigarette? This is how I accidentally forgot and quit smoking. Accidentally because all I wanted for gargling vinegar and toothpaste was to sweeten my breath instead of covering it with oral deodorants. Do yourself and your love ones an additional favor with the following: No if's and but's - > Throw away; empty your pocket; do not keep within your reach, any pack or stick of cigarettes, lighters and ashtrays. Disable the cigarette lighter; thoroughly clean the ashtray; spray deodorant to remove cigarette odor, in your vehicle. Keep a bottle of drinking water handy in the car or handbag. When the urge to smoke comes up, simply drink water. Do not allow anyone to smoke inside your car. If you are a musician, avoid playing with a mouthpieced musical instrument like the saxophone or harmonica. Do what a non-smoker does. Don't be a slave to cigarettes . Beware: According to statistics, smoking a stick of cigarette can shorten a person's life by  eleven minutes . That's around 3-1/2 hours loss of life expectancy for smoking every regular pack, or 5-1/2 hours for every long size pack, of cigarettes. Sickly children are often caused by a cigarette smoker in the family. Do them a favour. QUIT SMOKING. Consult your doctor before using this plan.

If you've finally resolved to stop smoking, good for you! You've made the right choice. Use the following tips and suggestions to help you stick true to your word and avoid a relapse. Know the Ugly Truth about Smoking Concerned family members and friends have always told you about the bad things that could happen to smokers but you've always turned a deaf ear to their words, haven't you? TV ads and shows also tried giving you the same information but didn't you turn a blind eye to them? Ignorance is bliss but if you want to quit smoking for good, it's time to take your head out of the sand. Confront the ugly truth about smoking. Read and watch everything you can about the deadly consequences of smoking - it's terrifying, but it will also remind you about the rightness of your decision. Let the Right People Know about Your Resolution Your most trusted loved ones should definitely know about your resolution. They can help you stick to your word by keeping an eagle eye of your cigarettes. They'll warn you beforehand and remind you about your promise. They'll give you praise and encouragement when you need it. A hug may not be scientifically proven to be as potent as any medicine but we can't deny how good it feels to be hugged when we're in need of help. You'll definitely need lots of it when you're working on eliminating nicotine from your system! Get Professional Help Why make it harder for you than you should? Professional help and treatment is available in every corner of the world. Take it! You might not think you don't need anyone's help except yours, but you do. Believe it or not but smoking is also a medical problem. Your mind and body has an unreasonable dependency on nicotine and that's what you're fighting against. These medical professionals have studied for years to develop the right program that will help smokers get rid of their unwanted habit. You now have the opportunity to work with them. It's definitely your loss if you refuse their help. Use Water as a Weapon Water is incredibly important in any quit-smoking journey. Water detoxifies your body and cravings for nicotine are swept along by the current of harmful substances being flushed out of your body. Drinking lots of water will also help you feel better about yourself and that always count in the battle against nicotine dependency. Keep a Journal There will be times that you'll feel like no one in the world understands what you're going through, not even your fellow smokers who are also struggling to eliminate smoking from their lives. These are dangerous times and if you waver during these moments, you might end up lighting a stick and doing the worst thing you could do. During these times, a journal might just be the lifeline you need. A journal won't talk back, will always listen readily and patiently, and allow your feelings to settle down by itself until the moment of crisis has passed. A journal is also important because it allows you to look back and see how far you've grown. Your progress is the best source of comfort and inspiration: it's proof that you've come a long way and if you keep up the good work then quitting smoking might just no longer be a dream but a very possible reality. Rejoice on How Much You're Saving Consider this. How much does a pack of cigarettes cost? How many packs can you consume in a week? Multiply that figure with the number of weeks in a year. That's how much you spend in one year for smoking alone - a habit that erodes the health of your lungs and later on, damages other parts of your body as well. If you quit smoking, you immediately save the same amount and yes, you definitely deserve to spend some or even all of it to reward yourself. The resolution to quit smoking is never easy for anyone. It can wreak huge changes on your life or your very own personality. Regardless of this, know that your decision is the right one and if you work hard, you'll soon have the opportunity to enjoy unimagined rewards because of it.

Laser teeth whitening is undertaken in salons where clients have a gum dam applied to protect their gums and then a stain removing gel is applied before the laser light is activated. The gel then gains deep in to the enamel removing the staining and this is all done just under one hour. Typically the teeth are lightened by 6-8 shades and the treatment can last up to 18 months depending on how and when the staining that caused the problem is then minimized otherwise the benefit is decreased. Nicotine is not the only bad habit to cause staining to the enamel but caffeine, red wine, gravy and sauces will also stain the teeth but like many things it will depend on the frequency of usage but with such a simple and time effective treatment available for your teeth then no need to worry. Laser teeth whitening is also known as zoom whitening which is a commonly used name in the USA and even the Americans have developed Zoom 2 teeth whitening which is essentially the same but early adopters will want to try new names and ideas. The name aside laser teeth whitening is a huge growth industry and with added benefits like helping clients to quit smoking then no wonder customers are prepared to travel to get the treatment.

I've done it a thousand times."" -- Mark Twain   If Mark Twain were alive today, he could have been more successful in his efforts to quit smoking -- thanks to what modern science has learned about smoking cessation.   In Twain's time -- and for several decades after his death in 1910 -- many people thought of smoking tobacco as merely a habit, and they believed that quitting was simply a matter of individual choice and willpower. Smoking was not then widely recognized as  addictive , but we know now that it can be a strong addiction and that for many smokers willpower alone is not enough to give up tobacco permanently.   In recent years, researchers have learned a great deal about the factors that help people quit smoking successfully, the barriers that may interfere with smoking cessation, and the special problems faced by particular populations -- including teenagers. Scientists have also developed new techniques for smoking cessation -- including both drugs and counseling methods -- that substantially increase the chances of success.    If you have a friend or relative who would like to stop smoking, you might want to suggest that the person make a doctor's appointment to talk about quitting. People often don't think of going to their doctors for advice in this situation, perhaps because they don't consider smoking to be a medical problem, but doctors are actually a very useful resource. They usually know about organized stop-smoking programs in the community, and they can prescribe medicines that can help a person quit smoking successfully.     Counseling  and  medication  -- especially if they're used together -- can increase the likelihood that a smoker will be able to quit permanently. However, even with these types of help, quitting smoking is difficult. Everyone who has ever quit smoking will tell you that quitting is one of the toughest things they have ever done. The best way to avoid facing this tough problem, of course, is never to start smoking to begin with.   Stopping smoking is one of the most important and most challenging lifestyle changes an individual can make. Considering the many health, social, and economic benefits of quitting it is in the smoker's best interest to quit. More than 45 million Americans have liberated themselves from smoking, so it is possible to quit -- and quit for good.   Note:   This section of the website is based on a report by the American Council on Science and Health ( Kicking Butts in the 21st Century ) that summarizes what science has learned about smoking cessation -- with an emphasis on methods that have been proven to work. The report also describes some new smoking cessation techniques that are currently under development and evaluates some alternative methods that have been advocated as aids to smoking cessation. This report is not intended as a stop-smoking guide; instead, it is best used as a source of background information to complement the stop-smoking advice available from local and national health organizations, government agencies, and physicians.        background -- the magnitude of the problem   Because cigarettes are  addictive , quitting smoking can be difficult, and people who try to quit often fail. Recent surveys show that among current smokers, about 40% had attempted to quit at least once in the previous year, and nearly 70% want to quit. But only about 5% of smokers who try to quit each year succeed in stopping smoking permanently. These numbers look rather dismal, don't they? Actually, though, the situation is not quite that bad. The likelihood that a person will quit smoking successfully increases with each attempt to quit. After several tries, nearly 40 to 50% of smokers eventually succeed in quitting. More than 45 million Americans have stopped smoking.    More than 46 million American adults currently smoke, and the number of adolescent smokers is increasing annually.(1)  Cigarette smoking contributes to more than 430,000 deaths in the United States each year. Tobacco dependence is now recognized as a clinical addiction and even as a chronic disease -- one of the most widespread in the world.   Quitting smoking has major health benefits. In the long term, smoking cessation reduces the risk of  lung cancer  and other  cancers ,  stroke ,  heart disease ,  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (chronic bronchitis and emphysema) , and a host of other diseases. In the short term, quitting has some immediate health benefits such as reducing fatigue and shortness of breath and increasing arterial circulation and libido.(2)    Recent U.S. surveys show that among current smokers, nearly 41% had attempted to quit at least once in the previous year, and nearly 70% want to quit.(1)  But only about 4-5% of smokers who try to quit each year succeed in stopping smoking permanently.(1)  The prospects for successful smoking cessation are not as dismal as these numbers seem to indicate, however. The chance of success increases with each quit attempt and with the use of effective smoking cessation methods. After repeated attempts, nearly 40 to 50% of smokers eventually succeed in quitting. Presently, more than 45 million Americans have quit smoking, and the total number of smokers has slowly declined in recent years.(1)    The first smoking cessation programs began in the 1950s, after research had shown that smoking was a serious health hazard. In 1955, public ""stop smoking clinics"" were introduced in Sweden; they used medications, pamphlets, lectures, and physician counseling to help people quit. These clinics spread to the rest of Europe and the United States in the 1960s and have evolved into what are now comprehensive, multi-faceted, individualized programs.   Smoking cessation rates in the United States started to stabilize in the 1990s, after having increased over the prior few decades.(1)  Evidence suggests that this is because the number of quit attempts as well as the success of each attempt stabilized.(3)  However, in 1990, only 10% of quitters used some form of treatment,(4)  whereas as many as 35% do so today.(5)  There are several ways to approach smoking cessation, and individuals must decide for themselves which program or method is right for them. However, the more programs and methods available -- and the more a smoker is educated about quitting -- the greater the likelihood of success.       successful quitter   All smoking cessation programs have at least one thing in common - a flexible notion of what it takes to become a successful quitter. The prerequisites for success vary from individual to individual, but tend to include the following:     Motivation, Desire, Commitment:  Smokers who choose to quit should have strong personal reasons that motivate them to do so. People who attempt to quit solely to please others are usually headed for failure. Successful quitters must make a firm commitment to stop.     Social Support:  Since quitting smoking is incredibly difficult, it is no surprise that support from other people can be helpful in aiding a smoker in quitting. In one study of former adolescent smokers, 8 of the top 11 factors that had helped them to quit smoking involved a form of help from friends and/or family members.(69)   Support  for smoking cessation can come from both close to home (such as friends and relatives), or further away (such as  support groups ,  counselors , or an  online  quitting buddy).      Timing:  The time at which a smoker chooses to quit is very important to the outcome. A quit attempt can temporarily affect a person's lifestyle, state of mind, and general wellbeing. Trying to quit in the midst of an important business deal or a difficult family or personal situation can lower the chances of success.     Choice of Method:  No particular smoking cessation method is right for everyone. However, the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) suggests that all smokers trying to quit should use some form of  drug therapy  (such as nicotine replacement therapy or  bupropion ), if possible, in combination with some form of  counseling , behavioral therapy, or social support.  However, not all experts agree that pharmacological agents are needed by all smokers. Smokers should plan ahead and choose the methods that most closely conform to their personal needs. Since some types of medication are only available by prescription, it is a good idea for smokers to discuss their smoking cessation plans with a physician. Physicians can also provide counseling, and they can refer smokers to organized smoking cessation programs in the community.     Repetition:  One of the main keys to successful quitting is repetition. Most smokers will try to quit several times before succeeding. With each attempt, the smoker learns more about what to expect from the quitting process, and the chance of success increases. Many smokers are not aware of this fact and may become needlessly discouraged when they relapse after an initial unsuccessful attempt.       motivators for quitting   Although smokers must make their own decisions to quit, several common factors often serve as motivators for quitting.     Health Benefits:  Improved health seems to be the primary motivator for quitting. Many of the adverse health effects of smoking can be greatly reduced or even reversed through cessation.(2)  Immediate benefits of quitting include a decrease in blood pressure, a lowered pulse rate, an increased oxygen level in the blood, and a decreased blood carbon monoxide level.(7)  Also, the ability to smell and taste is enhanced. After two weeks of abstinence, circulation to the extremities improves, blood pressure remains lower, and lung function improves. After just a few weeks to a month, cough, sinus congestion, fatigue, and shortness of breath all decrease, although cough may actually worsen right after quitting. Further, ex-smokers are less likely than current smokers to have colds, develop  gum disease , experience fertility problems (in both  males  and  females ), or experience  erectile dysfunction .   Long-term benefits may also motivate smokers to quit. One year after quitting, the risk of developing symptomatic coronary artery disease (e.g., angina) is reduced by nearly half compared to those who continue to smoke.(7,8)  And after as little as two to five years, that risk can be decreased to levels approaching those who have never smoked.(8,9)  After five years of abstinence, the risk of  stroke  is reduced, approaching that of people who have never smoked. The risk of  lung cancer  decreases with the number of years of abstinence and can be reduced by as much as 40% after ten years; however, it never returns to that of people who have never smoked.(10)  The risk of other cancers such as those of the  mouth ,  throat ,  esophagus ,  bladder, kidney , and  pancreas  also decreases after several years of abstinence.(2)  After nearly fifteen years of abstinence, the overall risk of mortality tends to approach a level similar to that of lifelong nonsmokers.(7)  Unfortunately, quitting does not reverse  chronic obstructive lung disease (chronic bronchitis or emphysema) , but it does slow its progression.(2)  For women who stop smoking before  pregnancy  or during the first trimester, the risk of having a  low-birth-weight baby  is decreased.(2)  Because the reversibility of the risks of smoking is greatly influenced by the duration of smoking prior to quitting, smokers should be encouraged to quit as soon as possible.(11)      Social Pressure:  The increasing social pressure from tobacco control efforts may motivate smokers to quit. For example, workplace and public space restrictions -- including recent bans or proposed bans on smoking in restaurants and bars in many locations -- can increase the motivation or stimulus to quit.   The institution of totally smoke-free workplaces can motivate some people to quit smoking. A recent combined analysis of 26 studies showed that smoke-free workplaces encourage smokers to either quit or decrease their smoking, thus reducing total cigarette consumption per employee by an average of 29%.(12)    Anti-tobacco campaigns and anti-smoking messages in the media can also provide some much-needed motivation and may cause smokers to worry about the effect of smoking on their family's health and well-being.(13)  Parents who smoke may be motivated to try to quit when they learn that exposure to tobacco smoke in the environment is harmful to the health of their children or another loved one. In addition, it is well known that children of parents who smoke are more likely to become smokers themselves. Fortunately, if a parent quits while a child is young, that child has a lower chance of becoming a smoker than if the parent continues to smoke.(14)      Personal Requests:  Many smokers receive personal requests to quit from family members, friends, and physicians who are concerned about the smoker's health and/or are bothered by their habit. Although one request may not be enough motivation, each subsequent request may increase a smoker's probability of quitting.     Economic Aspects:  Although health is usually the main motivator for quitting, the economic cost and burden of the habit may also influence some smokers' decisions. Depending on the individual, smoking can be quite expensive -- costing as much as $70.00-80.00 per week. Recently, many states have increased cigarette taxes, raising the cost of a pack of cigarettes by more than a dollar in some areas. (In New York City, the combination of city and state taxes increases the cost of cigarettes by almost three dollars a pack.) Although the main public health objective of raising the price of cigarettes is to deter adolescents from smoking, increasing cigarette prices does seem to increase smoking cessation.(15)  The economic benefits of quitting may be especially important for the 30% of smokers who have incomes below the national poverty level.(1)    The cost of cigarettes isn't the only economic cost of smoking. Smokers' health care expenses are as much as 21% higher than those of nonsmokers.(16)  It is estimated that smoking costs the U.S. $158 billion each year in productivity losses and excess medical expenditures.(17)        barriers to quitting   So, exactly how hard is it to quit smoking? The answer to this question differs among individuals. Success in quitting is related to personal characteristics, the length of smoking history, the level of cigarette use, the intensity of  addiction , and the smoking cessation methods utilized. Those smoking more cigarettes for a greater time period may find it more difficult, but by no means impossible, to quit. Some studies show that women find it harder to quit than men do, although the reasons for this are unclear.    There are several common barriers to quitting. While these vary from one individual to the next, major barriers that most smokers can expect to encounter include the following:       Withdrawal :  Probably the greatest barrier to quitting -- and the hardest for smokers to overcome -- is withdrawal. Withdrawal is the body's response to the physical need for nicotine and the psychological need or desire for a cigarette. Immediately after quitting, many smokers will experience headache and dizziness, coughing and sore throat, and hunger.(18)  These symptoms usually last a few days to a week. As cessation progresses, other symptoms can develop, including anger, frustration, irritability, difficulty in concentrating, impatience, insomnia, fatigue, and even intense anxiety and depression.(18)  Also, because of the body's dependence on nicotine, the most common symptom is intense nicotine craving, or the overpowering desire to smoke. The physiological symptoms and psychological desire to smoke are the major factors in relapse (resumption of smoking). The use of nicotine replacement therapies in a smoking cessation program can help ease the symptoms of withdrawal. Physical withdrawal typically peaks at one to three weeks after quitting; ""psychological withdrawal"" and the desire for a cigarette can last anywhere from weeks to a few years, but for most people not much more than six months.     Behavioral Addiction:  Behavioral, or psychological, addiction to or dependence on the practice of smoking may make quitting difficult. Many people associate smoking with other actions or situations such as eating, drinking, and social or stressful events -- associations that are sometimes hard to change. Also, many smokers enjoy the oral activity of smoking a cigarette and the physical comfort of holding it between their fingers.     Social Circumstances:  Another barrier to cessation can be the presence of smokers in the household, workplace, or social or recreational environments. This can deter smokers from trying to quit or provoke smokers to relapse by providing an unsupportive environment or easy access to cigarettes. Many smokers are so-called social smokers; they find it difficult to be in a social environment without smoking.       Fear of weight gain:   Fear of weight gain makes many people hesitant to quit smoking. The truth is that most smokers do gain weight after quitting. The average weight gain is 5 to 10 pounds,(2)  but as many as 10% of people trying to quit will gain more than 30 pounds.(6)  This usually occurs because smokers snack or eat more to compensate for the lack of cigarettes and withdrawal symptoms. Also, many quitters experience an enhanced sense of taste and smell, which may increase the desire to eat. Others need to replace the behavioral aspect of smoking with eating. Smokers must remember that a slight weight gain is not nearly as harmful to health as the hazards from continued smoking. They should not let the fear of temporary weight gain deter them from trying to quit.      Existing Mental Problems:  People with psychiatric disorders, such as  anxiety  or  depression , have higher smoking rates than other people do. It is possible that some of these people smoke to abate the symptoms of these disorders.(19)  Successfully treating the anxiety or depression might increase the likelihood of successful smoking cessation; however, this idea has not yet been evaluated directly.     Difficulties Gaining Access to Treatment:  Some smokers do not have easy or affordable access to smoking cessation treatments. Some smoking cessation products require a prescription, and most are not covered by insurance plans. Increasing the number of over-the-counter medications, reducing the cost of some treatments, and extending insurance coverage should improve cessation outcomes.     Relapse:  The occurrence of relapse is another barrier to cessation. Many smokers who try to quit on their own will suffer a relapse at some point. Those who use drugs or counseling to help them quit have an increased chance of success, but the majority experience some form of relapse. A relapse can set smokers back to the point where they abandon the quest for cessation.       cost effectiveness   Smoking cessation treatment is not integrated into the general U.S. healthcare system at the present time. Few insurance companies and only some Medicaid and state health agencies reimburse for smoking cessation treatments.(16,62)  When coverage is provided, there may be qualifications and limitations -- such as lifetime caps or time constraints -- that may make it difficult to utilize services effectively. Some plans that do cover smoking cessation cover 50% of behavioral services and 100% of nicotine replacement therapy.(63)  Currently, 34 states provide some form of Medicaid coverage for tobacco dependence treatments for low-income smokers, while the remaining states do not.(64)  Many smokers live below the poverty line and have no healthcare coverage whatsoever, making it very difficult to gain access to treatment.   The United Kingdom recently announced that it would reimburse for nicotine replacement products under the National Health Service prescription and will also provide additional benefits for bupropion.(65)  Some think that offering more drug therapies over the counter will result in a higher utilization of these treatments and thus a higher success rate.(66)  Studies show that providing the nicotine patch over the counter doubles quit rates compared to placebo,(6)  and NRTs such as the patch and gum available over the counter have success rates comparable to when they are delivered via prescription.(67)  Most importantly, over the counter status increases the number of smokers who have access to the treatments and the likelihood that they will use the products.   According to healthcare professionals, smoking cessation treatment is the ""gold standard"" of preventive healthcare services.(68)  Given the substantial costs of smoking and its effects on health and healthcare costs, smoking cessation treatment should be encouraged and integrated into the healthcare system.       background -- the magnitude of the problem   Because cigarettes are  addictive , quitting smoking can be difficult, and people who try to quit often fail. Recent surveys show that among current smokers, about 40% had attempted to quit at least once in the previous year, and nearly 70% want to quit. But only about 5% of smokers who try to quit each year succeed in stopping smoking permanently. These numbers look rather dismal, don't they? Actually, though, the situation is not quite that bad. The likelihood that a person will quit smoking successfully increases with each attempt to quit. After several tries, nearly 40 to 50% of smokers eventually succeed in quitting. More than 45 million Americans have stopped smoking.    More than 46 million American adults currently smoke, and the number of adolescent smokers is increasing annually.(1)  Cigarette smoking contributes to more than 430,000 deaths in the United States each year. Tobacco dependence is now recognized as a clinical addiction and even as a chronic disease -- one of the most widespread in the world.   Quitting smoking has major health benefits. In the long term, smoking cessation reduces the risk of  lung cancer  and other  cancers ,  stroke ,  heart disease ,  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (chronic bronchitis and emphysema) , and a host of other diseases. In the short term, quitting has some immediate health benefits such as reducing fatigue and shortness of breath and increasing arterial circulation and libido.(2)    Recent U.S. surveys show that among current smokers, nearly 41% had attempted to quit at least once in the previous year, and nearly 70% want to quit.(1)  But only about 4-5% of smokers who try to quit each year succeed in stopping smoking permanently.(1)  The prospects for successful smoking cessation are not as dismal as these numbers seem to indicate, however. The chance of success increases with each quit attempt and with the use of effective smoking cessation methods. After repeated attempts, nearly 40 to 50% of smokers eventually succeed in quitting. Presently, more than 45 million Americans have quit smoking, and the total number of smokers has slowly declined in recent years.(1)    The first smoking cessation programs began in the 1950s, after research had shown that smoking was a serious health hazard. In 1955, public ""stop smoking clinics"" were introduced in Sweden; they used medications, pamphlets, lectures, and physician counseling to help people quit. These clinics spread to the rest of Europe and the United States in the 1960s and have evolved into what are now comprehensive, multi-faceted, individualized programs.   Smoking cessation rates in the United States started to stabilize in the 1990s, after having increased over the prior few decades.(1)  Evidence suggests that this is because the number of quit attempts as well as the success of each attempt stabilized.(3)  However, in 1990, only 10% of quitters used some form of treatment,(4)  whereas as many as 35% do so today.(5)  There are several ways to approach smoking cessation, and individuals must decide for themselves which program or method is right for them. However, the more programs and methods available -- and the more a smoker is educated about quitting -- the greater the likelihood of success.   successful quitter   All smoking cessation programs have at least one thing in common - a flexible notion of what it takes to become a successful quitter. The prerequisites for success vary from individual to individual, but tend to include the following:     Motivation, Desire, Commitment:  Smokers who choose to quit should have strong personal reasons that motivate them to do so. People who attempt to quit solely to please others are usually headed for failure. Successful quitters must make a firm commitment to stop.     Social Support:  Since quitting smoking is incredibly difficult, it is no surprise that support from other people can be helpful in aiding a smoker in quitting. In one study of former adolescent smokers, 8 of the top 11 factors that had helped them to quit smoking involved a form of help from friends and/or family members.(69)   Support  for smoking cessation can come from both close to home (such as friends and relatives), or further away (such as  support groups ,  counselors , or an  online  quitting buddy).      Timing:  The time at which a smoker chooses to quit is very important to the outcome. A quit attempt can temporarily affect a person's lifestyle, state of mind, and general wellbeing. Trying to quit in the midst of an important business deal or a difficult family or personal situation can lower the chances of success.     Choice of Method:  No particular smoking cessation method is right for everyone. However, the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) suggests that all smokers trying to quit should use some form of  drug therapy  (such as nicotine replacement therapy or  bupropion ), if possible, in combination with some form of  counseling , behavioral therapy, or social support.  However, not all experts agree that pharmacological agents are needed by all smokers. Smokers should plan ahead and choose the methods that most closely conform to their personal needs. Since some types of medication are only available by prescription, it is a good idea for smokers to discuss their smoking cessation plans with a physician. Physicians can also provide counseling, and they can refer smokers to organized smoking cessation programs in the community.     Repetition:  One of the main keys to successful quitting is repetition. Most smokers will try to quit several times before succeeding. With each attempt, the smoker learns more about what to expect from the quitting process, and the chance of success increases. Many smokers are not aware of this fact and may become needlessly discouraged when they relapse after an initial unsuccessful attempt.   motivators for quitting   Although smokers must make their own decisions to quit, several common factors often serve as motivators for quitting.     Health Benefits:  Improved health seems to be the primary motivator for quitting. Many of the adverse health effects of smoking can be greatly reduced or even reversed through cessation.(2)  Immediate benefits of quitting include a decrease in blood pressure, a lowered pulse rate, an increased oxygen level in the blood, and a decreased blood carbon monoxide level.(7)  Also, the ability to smell and taste is enhanced. After two weeks of abstinence, circulation to the extremities improves, blood pressure remains lower, and lung function improves. After just a few weeks to a month, cough, sinus congestion, fatigue, and shortness of breath all decrease, although cough may actually worsen right after quitting. Further, ex-smokers are less likely than current smokers to have colds, develop  gum disease , experience fertility problems (in both  males  and  females ), or experience  erectile dysfunction .   Long-term benefits may also motivate smokers to quit. One year after quitting, the risk of developing symptomatic coronary artery disease (e.g., angina) is reduced by nearly half compared to those who continue to smoke.(7,8)  And after as little as two to five years, that risk can be decreased to levels approaching those who have never smoked.(8,9)  After five years of abstinence, the risk of  stroke  is reduced, approaching that of people who have never smoked. The risk of  lung cancer  decreases with the number of years of abstinence and can be reduced by as much as 40% after ten years; however, it never returns to that of people who have never smoked.(10)  The risk of other cancers such as those of the  mouth ,  throat ,  esophagus ,  bladder, kidney , and  pancreas  also decreases after several years of abstinence.(2)  After nearly fifteen years of abstinence, the overall risk of mortality tends to approach a level similar to that of lifelong nonsmokers.(7)  Unfortunately, quitting does not reverse  chronic obstructive lung disease (chronic bronchitis or emphysema) , but it does slow its progression.(2)  For women who stop smoking before  pregnancy  or during the first trimester, the risk of having a  low-birth-weight baby  is decreased.(2)  Because the reversibility of the risks of smoking is greatly influenced by the duration of smoking prior to quitting, smokers should be encouraged to quit as soon as possible.(11)      Social Pressure:  The increasing social pressure from tobacco control efforts may motivate smokers to quit. For example, workplace and public space restrictions -- including recent bans or proposed bans on smoking in restaurants and bars in many locations -- can increase the motivation or stimulus to quit.   The institution of totally smoke-free workplaces can motivate some people to quit smoking. A recent combined analysis of 26 studies showed that smoke-free workplaces encourage smokers to either quit or decrease their smoking, thus reducing total cigarette consumption per employee by an average of 29%.(12)    Anti-tobacco campaigns and anti-smoking messages in the media can also provide some much-needed motivation and may cause smokers to worry about the effect of smoking on their family's health and well-being.(13)  Parents who smoke may be motivated to try to quit when they learn that exposure to tobacco smoke in the environment is harmful to the health of their children or another loved one. In addition, it is well known that children of parents who smoke are more likely to become smokers themselves. Fortunately, if a parent quits while a child is young, that child has a lower chance of becoming a smoker than if the parent continues to smoke.(14)      Personal Requests:  Many smokers receive personal requests to quit from family members, friends, and physicians who are concerned about the smoker's health and/or are bothered by their habit. Although one request may not be enough motivation, each subsequent request may increase a smoker's probability of quitting.

""After                                       years of trying to quit smoking I tried                                       your Quit Smoking Right Now Program.

I smoked, like                       a champion, for all but 10 of my 49 years of living. By the time I finally quit                       last year, I could hardly crawl up a flight of stairs without                       being barely able to catch my breath. Last year I had                       developed a smokers cough so bad that during a hacking fit                       I actually tore a chest muscle. Just a few weeks prior to                       quitting I began waking up in the middle of the night,                       gasping for breath. I had to borrow a friends asthma puffer.                       My teeth were a sickening yellow, my eyes disgustingly dull,                       my skin that ungodly grayish color that branded me ""a                       smoker"" and I always seemed to be the only one at                       social gatherings having to hide somewhere just to                       steal a few puffs. I had tried valiantly to quit twice before,                       but failed miserably.                                                                                                             The                               Tobacco Industry kills more people in North                               America from Monday to Thursday of each week than                               the terrorists murdered in total on Sept. 11, 2001                               Some                               family members and friends had started almost                               pleading with me to 'save my own life' but I was                               totally convinced that after failing to quit                               before, I was a lifelong 'nicotine                               addict' - and would probably be sucking on a                               cigarette with my dying breath. The way I had                               started to feel last year, it seemed like it wouldn't take too                               much longer.                                 In fact, these are                               the untouched words of my eldest daughter, a                               registered nurse, who was the MOST surprised of                               anyone that I had  really  quit smoking for                               good: ""Dad, you know how much I wanted you to quit                               smoking for a long time but especially after the                               birth of Corbin and Cameron. I couldn't be more                               proud of you, and happy for my sons, that their                               grandfather will now be around a lot longer to be a                               great influence in their lives.""  Sara                               N. Wilson RN                                                                                                       Well, this was                       Beneteau - the Smoker, just last year. Coughing, hacking,                       gasping for breath with everyone griping at him to ""just be a                       man and quit!"" But despite even this pressure and how                       bad my health was becoming, another attempt at quitting was not even close to                       being on my radar screen. Ahhh, the seductive power of                       puffing!!                                                                        A Chance Meeting                         In 2003, I met a                       man named  Rick                       Saruna . At the time, I had been looking for a local practitioner of                       NLP (neuro-linguistic programming) and relaxation therapy to help a                       relative of mine through a difficult time. I came across                       Rick and his clinic in my hometown of Windsor, Ontario.                      If you want to                       know the entire truth, Rick was flabbergasted when I                       called the first time as a few weeks prior he had written  my                        name down to contact me after buying a book at a                       conference he had attended in New Hampshire -  my                       company was listed in the book's resource section. So we                       had 2 reasons to meet.                         We met a few                       days later at his clinic and discussed a plan of action                       for my loved one. I noticed that a large part of his                       practice was devoted to helping people quit smoking and he                       claimed a 90% success rate. Knowing what I knew then about                       the horror stories of myself and others who tried to quit                       smoking, I was quite skeptical of this claim. Making one                       of my notoriously off-handed remarks, I commented about my                       being in the 10% -  the stereotypical, weak-minded,                       incurable addict.                         Rick replied SO                       matter-of-factly that the 10% who failed to quit represented those who                       didn't follow his simple program and that in a couple of hours he                       could get me to give up smoking for good!                      He added                       though that this time, I would quit  for good ,                         without  major stress and                         without  suffering through weeks or months of painful cravings and                       withdrawals (that eventually led to my failure before) and                   * without  gaining any extra weight                   whatsoever. In fact he said I would lose weight with his                   program if I wanted to!                         Sure I                       would:-)                                                                                                                                     90%                               of lung cancer occurs in those who have smoked.                               Each package delivers the equivalent of one chest                               x-ray.                                                               Look,                               I wasn't even close to thinking about making yet                               another                               mother-of-all-painful-decisions-to-quit-smoking,                               so Saruna's promise would have been an absolute                               miracle in my case! All he said I had to do to was                               set aside 3 hours of my time and pick the date for                               what I now call                               ""D-Day"", or ""done                               day"". I did just that. Afterall, what                               could having at least a semi-open mind and                               investing 3 hours really cost me in the bigger                               scheme of things?                                                                                                                                                           After                     3 hours, I really did Quit!                       My 9:00 a.m. session with                     Rick lasted 3 hours.                        As an early                     riser I had already been up for 5 hours when I arrived - without a                     cigarette - and I was not in a great                     mood. I believe in the power                     of the mind and all, but at this point I just 'knew what I                     knew' about cigarette addiction and it just felt like this                     exercise would be one of total futility. Actually, I saw myself taking a break to light up                     outside just as soon as I could:-)                       Maybe this is how                     you feel right now. Doubtful? Even skeptical? If that's                     true, I encourage you to                     please, please read on. Everything changed VERY quickly for me from                     this point forward!                     See, I made a commitment to                   at least have an open mind,                     the very same kind of commitment I will be asking you to make                     here, so I started listening to what Rick began telling me - the real truth about my                   addiction to tobacco.                       Everything                     he said soon made a whole lot of sense - including why                     it would be very easy for me to finally quit smoking this                     time.                       You are about to                     read just some of what I was shocked to learn. Afterall, it   IS  these ""truths"" that make the                     difference between smokers being able to quit, and not. And just so you know, I shook my head in                     disbelief at some of these the first time I heard them!                                                                   The Real Deal about Smoking                     and WHY You Can Quit Easily Too!                                                                                                                                                                                   Smoking                             cigarettes is   NOT  a natural or pleasurable thing to                             do. The body rejects it, ie: hack, cough, spit and                             did someone say, horrible taste? Your body tells you                             this is really bad stuff! However, I must have said                             a thousand times, ""I enjoy smoking"" or                             ""that cigarette will taste good right after                             dinner"", but that was because  they   (the                             Tobacco Industry) made                             me believe smoking cigarettes was a natural and                             pleasurable thing to do. What I soon learned was                             that   I really love NOT SMOKING!  You know, lungs full of clean air, tons more energy, no                             shortness of breath, nice bright white teeth,                             increased mental clarity, the amazing taste of foods, a more radiant                             complexion and increased self-esteem simply because                             of being victorious in the war of tobacco addiction!                                                                                                                                           It was  your                             mind  that convinced your body to start smoking                             in the first place so you could look cool/be                             accepted/whatever reason your mind came up with, and                             it is    only      your mind   that can convince                             your body to stop. This  IS  the focal                             point of our program and the reason it really works.                             No other program I am aware of takes  your belief                             system , the most important ingredient in the                             successful quit smoking equation, into consideration                             - hence the staggering failure rate of theirs and                             the  90% success of ours!                                                                                                                                              Here is                             something that has got to shock you - nicotine is  not                              what you are mainly addicted to in cigarettes! The tobacco                             companies and even the government and health care industry                             would have you believe this is true but there is another                             ingredient in the highly guarded, patent protected                             list (imagine that, it's the public's health at                             stake and this is a trade secret!) among  the                             1000's of chemicals  in each cigarette that  really  is the one                             responsible for your addiction - and - the terrible                             struggle for most people to quit. In our program we                             reveal this ingredient (it will amaze you!) and more                             importantly, we teach you how to control and easily                             counteract your addiction to this substance - a                             simple and painless thing to do.                                                                                                                                           While                             every other quit smoking program is                             focused on helping you fight off false cravings for                             nicotine, hundreds of thousands of people who are sincere about quitting are                             sadly spending millions of                             dollars buying up expensive pills, patches, inhalers,                             supplements and gums in a losing battle to save their own lives. Therefore,                              both  the smoking   and  the                             quit-smoking (pharmaceutical) industries (did                             someone say among the largest government lobbies in                             the U.S.?) are raking in billions and billions!                                                                                                                                           The main reason                             people fail to quit (and why it took almost 40 years of                             smoking for me to learn this) is that from the time we were                             little children we have been lied to and literally                             programmed by the powerful tobacco and                             pharmaceutical industries as well as the media to                             believe that we are heavily addicted and cannot quit. Between having you keep                             smoking, and, keep quitting, they have a vested                             interest in keeping you as a dying, sorry I mean paying,                             customer. Not a laughing matter at all but I                             couldn't resist.                                                                                                                     Believe me, no matter how                     strange or ""conspirial"" the above might seem to you                     right now, this will ALL  make total sense  when you experience just                     how easy it is to quit smoking using  The Quit Smoking                     Right Now Program .                                                                    In other words   . . . the proof is                     in the quitting!

One thing I                             know is that not everybody is motivated by the same                             things. One person may be motivated by the fact they                             might  add years to their life  while another may be                             scared by the grim statistics and horrible death                             that so many smokers ultimately face. Still others may be                             motivated by how much money they will save by                             quitting smoking. So, let's spend a few seconds                             talking about saving those thousands of                             dollars.                                                                                                                                        Smoking                     and Stopping Co$T You!                       Here's the money                     you will spend if you continue smoking (and of                     course the price of smoking never goes down). Incidentally,                     with what I am saving on cigarettes, I can take an all                     expense paid vacation for 2 to an exotic island every year!

Consider                 the 1990 Surgeon                     General's Report findings:                                                                                                                       When                             it comes                                right                             down to it,                               aren't                             you tired of                               being                             a slave                               to                             cigarettes?                                                                               After 1 year off                     cigarettes, the excess risk of heart disease and sudden                     death caused by smoking is  reduced by half . After 15                     years of abstinence, the risk of heart disease is similar to                     that of people who've never smoked.                       In 5 to 15                     years, the risk of stroke for ex-smokers returns to the                     level of those who've  never smoked .                       Male smokers who                     quit between ages 35 to 39 can add up to  15 years  to                     their life. Female quitters in this age group can add up to  12                     years . Men and women who quit at ages 65 to 69 increase                     their life expectancy by up to  3 years .                                                                                                                                         And here are some                   amazing facts   about the health benefits you can receive even 20 minutes after quitting.                   It really doesn't                 matter whose stats you read or believe the bottom line for most                 people is the                 same:                    Quitting smoking will probably extend the length and                 definitely improve the                 quality of your life and those around you!                                                                                                                          I believe                         it must also be said that as with all things in life, there                         are exceptions to the normal health issues associated                         with smoking. My aunt smoked almost her entire adult                         life and lived to be 89 years old. A friend of mine's                         close friend drank several martinis while chain smoking                         every day and lived to be 96. Rare cases such as these                         continue to baffle scientists.                                                                                                                                                                        Our                     90% Success Rate, Our 100% Promise!                   Now that I have                 experienced just how easy it really was for a die-hard smoker                 like me to quit, I can see why  The                     Quit Smoking Right Now Program   can proudly boast a 90%                 success rate. In fact, I wondered why it wasn't higher! But                 again, Rick                 explains this as a simple example of human nature, in that 10%                 of his clients just do not follow the simple steps of his                 program. If they did, he could probably claim a 100% success rate.                       So, for any customer                 who falls into this category and for whatever reason doesn't                 quit smoking in the first pass, we have a fail-safe back-up plan. We will                 send in the reinforcements and come to their rescue.   Our                     promise, and our mission,                 is to have you quit smoking - for Life!                                           What                     would it be worth to you to Take Back Your Life?                       What would the                             freedom of being tobacco-free for the rest of your                             life be worth to you? Interesting question,                     considering the claim we make here, don't you agree?                        In my case, and in all sincerity, I cannot put a                     price on my new found freedom. Neither can my daughters and my mother and my                     siblings and my friends. I feel GREAT physically and I feel                             GREAT spiritually because I quit. This, and the fact                     that it was so easy for me to quit for good was the entire reason                     I decided to stop everything else I was doing to ask Rick Saruna to help me put his program and this                             amazing product together. So, my answer to this                             question is,                     well,  priceless .                       I'm quite sure                     the people whose testimonials you've read who quit smoking                     using  The                     Quit Smoking Right Now Program , or the hundreds who have                     quit with the clinic program, would feel just as I do.     Speaking of                     which, in his clinic                     practice, Rick's retail price for this program is $800.00.                     Sometimes he has a special promotion where the price                     is reduced to $500.00.                     Thing is, you would not have a personal session with Rick with our digital product   but you also won't have to wait weeks                     for an appointment (my 2 day appt. time was partially                     business and not normal practice for his clinic) - you                     receive everything you would during that session either in                     written or audio form within hours. Plus, you can get  personal help                     by email and  ** even by phone if you require it.                       We also researched and found a wide range of prices for                     stop smoking programs.                     Many cost thousands of dollars and included 'medicines' such                     as the patch, pills, inhalers or gums, and/or supplements,                     all of which are very expensive. You read the approximate                     costs of some of the quit-industry pharmaceutical products a few minutes ago.                       We also had to                     consider that unlike the corner drug store who would not                     likely ever refund you hundreds of dollars on empty packages of                     Nicorettes or a Nicotrol inhaler because you claimed they                     didn't work,   we will refund you every penny  you paid                     us if you don't quit. You will                     soon read this in our 100% money-back guarantee.                       Also, unlike                     most programs that would not likely continue to support you in your quest to quit                     smoking for good after you have paid the price and completed                     the course,  we will !                       Ok, just one                     more thing. Rick and I spent                     the latter part of 2003 and the first part of 2004 putting  The                     Quit Smoking Right Now Program  together. Between his                     grueling clinic schedule and my crazy Internet hours, a lot                     of 'midnight oil' was burned in order to be able to present                     this amazing program to you. We also decided to have the                     audio portion of this program recorded in a professional                     recording studio, so no ""teleconference or                     headset-to-PC"" quality                     files here:-) Plus, we added some custom-written and                     produced music just to make you feel more                     ""energized"" from the moment you begin to Quit Smoking.                       Mostly though,                     we decided  The                     Quit Smoking Right Now Program  had to be priced fairly                     and within easy financial reach of every smoker,                     considering what every smoker pays right now for cigarettes                     every day, or, for all the costs associated with all the                     other quit-smoking programs and expensive pharmaceuticals                     and supplements out there.                        So, our  Special                     Introductory Price  to                     have  You Take Your Life Back  by guaranteeing that   You                     Will Quit Smoking Once and for All , is only  $197.00 , or the price of                     your supply of cigarettes at 2 packs a day for a single                     month. That's it!                                                                  I Want To Take Back My Life Right Now!                                                                   The                     Ultimate 'Stress Test'                                     I struggled with                 whether to include the following information in a sales                 presentation because it is based on very personal information                 but I decided that in the end, my desire to help you or a loved                 to quit smoking won out.                    The last part of                 2003 and the beginning of 2004 was very stressful for me. My                 mother was hospitalized for 3 long months with appendicitis, a                 broken foot from falling down when the rupture occurred and                 complications resulting from the toxins being released into her                 80+ year-old body. My youngest daughter was also hospitalized                 having had her normal round of                 seizures, which are always very nasty and physically damaging to                 her. Finally, my elderly aunt, who I had taken care of since                 1993, had fallen and had been alone on the floor for 2 1/2 days                 when I discovered her. Different hospitals all, of course.                   I am a                 ""lifeline"" of sorts to all 3 of my loved ones here and                 although I feel I have fairly broad shoulders, I could not begin                 to explain the level of stress I came to experience dealing with                 the intricacies of, and time associated with, each crucial                 situation. You know, daily visitations, doctor consults,                 specialist appointments, rehab appointments, discharge planner                 appointments etc., and ultimately with my aunt, the long process of                 having to select a nursing home and related services (dozens of                 phonecalls and meetings) etc.                   In January, my                 mother was thankfully released but my daughter was hospitalized                 again and                 then my aunt suffered a massive                 stroke just hours from being                 transported to the nursing home that I and her step daughter                 carefully chose for her, and near the end it became a matter of my                 almost living in the hospital. She passed peacefully on                 Feb. 1, 2004.                    If there ever was a                 time when logic and stress would seemingly dictate that a                 recently-quit smoker would slip up and start smoking again, believe me, it                 would have been anytime during these months! But I can                 honestly tell you that although I had fleeting thoughts of joining                 the few smokers I saw huddled outside the hospital in                 the bitter cold, I never even came close to                 acting upon them. Truth is, based on what I learned in  The Quit                     Smoking Right Now Program , I simply cannot see a                 circumstance under which I would ever go back to smoking                 cigarettes!                    Believe me, before these stressful                 months, I was totally                 convinced of the effectiveness of  The Quit                     Smoking Right Now Program   but while putting the finishing touches                 on this letter I realized just how awesome and truly                 powerful this program really is!                   Now, here's the                 bottom line for you  . . .

Contrary to many claims from hypnotherapists it does require some will-power and motivation. However it is proven that with hypnotherapy you are at least  five to fifteen times more likely to succeed than by willpower alone.                         Imagine a life as a non-smoker...                                                    Better health and a longer life                           More freedom (and more money!)                           More energy and confidence                           No more worries about what you are doing to your body!                           Increased libido!                           Younger looking skin                           More in control of your life (more professional and social opportunities too!)                            You will smell great (at last!)                           Your body clear of poisonous toxins like nicotine                                                                          Tired of being ""controlled"" by smoking? Nicotine: a powerful neuro-stimulant                          When you smoke your heart rate soars and your whole nervous system is stimulated into greater agitation. A cigarette gives you a two minute fix of dopamine (brain chemical that feels good) combined with 48 hours of an agitated nervous system. You keep going back for that good feeling to counteract the agitation.... only to increase the agitation. Cigarettes hold out a promise of relaxation that they NEVER deliver!                                                ""It feels wonderful to be free of cigarettes after years of trying...""                          In these  Stop Smoking Sessions  we use the most powerful techniques available to ensure you get the best chance to quit you will ever receive. We don't take a cookie-cutter approach that relies on one technique. Instead we use a whole range of techniques to create a unique treatment session for you.                                                  These methods are individually proven in research studies to be the most effective ways to stop smoking and are broadly based on Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and Clinical Hypnotherapy. Each technique on it’s own could be 100% effective for you—however as one can never tell exactly which approach will “click” with a client we use several techniques in a powerful combination.                                                  Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)                          Of all psychotherapies CBT has the strongest evidential backing and is now the treatment of choice under the NHS. CBT aims to change thoughts and behaviours to bring about positive changes.                                                Clinical Hypnotherapy                           Clinical hypnotherapy  works by taking you into a state of heightened suggestibility where your critical mind takes a break and we can work directly and deeply with your imagination and subconscious to create new beliefs, patterns and habits. (Read more about hypnotherapy here.)                                                 CBT & Hypnotherapy combined                          Research studies where  CBT and hypnotherapy  are applied together have shown that they are strongly complementary and their effectiveness is raised many times when used in combination.                                                                           Individual and Group Programmes available                                                   Read on for information about Individual sessions.                                                                        What Happens in a Session?                                                   First we have a phone interview to assess your habit and motivation. If I don’t think your motivation is strong enough or if you have a lot of current stress in your life (for example a recent divorce) I will not recommend we proceed at that time as I don’t want you wasting your money and effort. Providing your motivation is good I’ll give you some ways to prepare to stop and we’ll meet a week later.                        The actual session lasts 2 hours – during that time we’ll review your habit and motivations in depth. I’ll then use a whole package of techniques to dismantle your habit—basically we throw the book at it! And remember it only needs one of these techniques to work for you to stop. This session includes working deeply with your subconscious in hypnosis, giving you the skills, belief structure and deep inspiration to stop smoking immediately.                         I’ll train you in the session to ensure that you have the skills you need to remain a non-smoker. I also give you several “last-resort” tools that you can use during challenging moments in the weeks following, including self-hypnosis CD’s and phone support.                                                  Most people require only one session which is a specially extended session lasting approximately two hours - and is tailor-made to your needs. The session is uplifting, very inspiring and deeply relaxing.                                                   ""But I've tried to stop so many times!""                           No problem. In fact there is good evidence to show that the number of failed attempts to  stop smoking  is a good predictor of final success.                                                                                                Smoking Cessation                         Success Rates                         'Hypnosis is the most effective way of giving up smoking, according to the largest ever scientific comparison of ways of breaking the habit.' - New Scientist v136                                                    In 1992  New Scientist Magazine  published the results of an extensive clinical study on the most effective  smoking cessation  methods. A meta-analysis, statistically combining the results of more than 600 studies (over 72,000 individual cases) showed that single session hypnosis increased a smoker's success chance by 1000% from 6% to 60%. Here are the success rates for different smoking cessation methods:                         60% - Single session Hypnosis                          24% - Acupuncture                          10% - Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT)                          6% - Willpower alone                                                    These impressive figures are for hypnosis alone - and include many hypnotherapists using hypnosis alone and often antiquated methods. Using modern clinical hypnotherapy combined with cognitive behavioural therapy these results will improve considerably.                         Interestingly the latest research on NRT (see "" NRT hyped "" on BBC website) shows a success rate of only 7.2%, barely better than willpower alone! Yet NRT is the currently recommended treatment for smoking cessation under the NHS.                          It's never to late too quit!                                                  It's never too late to  quit smoking . According to the American Cancer Society, about half of all smokers who keep smoking will die from a smoking-related disease. Quitting has immediate health benefits. .

Thursday, June 26, 2008         How to Quit Smoking Even if You Love to Smoke        Let's face it, you probably enjoy some aspects of smoking. Some     people truly love to smoke. There's no denying that smoking     provides real benefits such as relaxation or feelings of     security.         So, how do you quit when you love to smoke?         YOU GOTTA WANNA         First and foremost, you have to have the desire to quit. If you     love smoking and don't want or plan to quit, then there's almost     no point in reading further. But if you honestly do want to     quit, then you have the first and most important ingredient for     quitting.         Is it possible to love smoking while simultaneously wanting to     quit? Of course! Think about any destructive behavior you or     other people engage in. For example, you may love to speed when     you drive around town, yet you know it is dangerous and you want     to quit doing it. Alcoholics have a love-hate relationship with     their drink. You smoke and enjoy it, but you know it is bad for     you.         DEVELOP THE DESIRE TO QUIT         ""I love smoking too much to develop the desire to quit,"" you may     be saying. However, there are some simple steps you can take to     create the will to quit.         1. Make a list of the benefits you receive from smoking. Write     down as many benefits as you can think of.         2. Make a list of the bad things that have resulted or may     result from continuing to smoke.         3. Make a list of the reasons YOU want to quit. For example,     your list might include ""live longer"", ""set a good example for     my children"", ""save money"", etc. Everyone needs a purpose or a     reason to do anything before he or she is truly motivated to do     it. Make sure you know why you want to quit.         Read each of your lists at least once per day. These lists will     provide you with concrete motivation for quitting.         4. Make an appointment with your doctor and ask him or her to be     very frank with you about the destructiveness of smoking. Ask to     see pictures of lungs taken out of smokers' bodies. Have your     doctor explain what good things will happen after you quit.     Hearing and seeing these things from your doctor may influence     you more than anything else. After all, this person has devoted     their life to understanding the human body. They know the     truth, and most likely you'll believe what they have to say.         EXAMINE THE ""BENEFITS""         Once you have a definite desire to  quit smoking , it's time to     examine the so-called ""benefits"" of smoking. By now you should     have the ""benefits of smoking"" list that you made in step 1     above.         You must become very objective when you analyze your list. Is     each list item truly a benefit or just a ""fix"". If you smoke to     relax, ask yourself ""how does a non-smoker deal with stress     without smoking?"" If you smoke to relieve boredom are you     benefiting yourself temporarily by smoking, while paying for it     with reduced health and expensive cigarettes?         Look at each item in your list from the perspective of a non-     smoker. What would a non-smoker have to say about your list? How     does a non-smoker deal with the world without smoking? Can you     obtain the same or similar benefits without a cigarette?         Remember that much of the ""positive"" benefit of smoking is     temporary. The long-term effects of smoking are nearly all     negative.         FIND REPLACEMENTS         After examining the benefits you get from smoking, you need to     develop replacements for your cigarettes (and their effects) so     that you can continue to receive the benefits that smoking     provides you, but without the downside.         First, you need to understand that some of the so-called     benefits of smoking are really just a cruel lie. As your body     has grown accustomed to smoking and the accompanying physical     and chemical effects on your body, you have developed a need to     smoke to achieve these ""benefits."" You feel that the only way     you can relax is to smoke, and you do find that smoking calms     your nerves. But how long has it been since you relaxed on your     own, without the aid of a cigarette? Again, how does a non-     smoker relax? Smoking has become your crutch, when your ankle     really isn't broken.         So, on your list of ""benefits of smoking"" next to each benefit,     write down something you can do, other than smoking, that will     replicate the benefit.         For example, if the benefit you wrote down was that smoking     helps you sleep, you might write down that you would exercise     regularly. Exercise can aid your body in so many ways, including     better sleep. If you wrote that smoking helps you to get moving     in the morning, you might write down that you will listen to     your favorite high-energy music while you get dressed.         Be creative! This is the fun part. You get to re-invent your     life!         TURN LOVE TO DISGUST         If you love to smoke, you need to begin to despise it.         Switch to a different brand of cigarettes--one that you don't     like.         Look at yourself in the mirror when you smoke. Looks stupid,     doesn't it? No other animal in the world, even the lowliest,     purposefully inhales smoke. Why do you?         Look at your hands and teeth. They're disgusting, aren't they?     You're not going to get a date looking like that!         And you stink too! Yuck!         The cigarette companies are robbing you of $1,000 per year. Are     you going to let them get away with that? And your car smells     terrible. You won't be able to get as much for it when you sell     it.         You're a social outcast at restaurants. Nobody likes to smell     your stinky smoke.         Get the idea?         NOW GO OUT AND DO IT         You can read this and do nothing or you can follow the steps and     take ACTION! Nothing in your life worth doing happens magically.     You have to create your own magic by taking action. Action.     ACTION.

Other than the anti-smoking medicine  chantix , the quit smoking drug Zyban and a whole array of nicotine replacement therapies, namely, nicotine gum, patches, lozenges et al are also available in the market that help you to trigger off smoking cessation.

[ edit ]   Methods          A 21mg dose  Nicoderm  CQ patch applied to the left arm.       Techniques which can increase smokers' chances of successfully quitting are:     Quitting "" cold turkey "": abrupt cessation of all nicotine use as opposed to tapering or gradual stepped-down nicotine weaning. It is the quitting method used by 80 [ 1 ]  to 90% [ 2 ]  of all long-term successful quitters.   Smoking-cessation support and counseling is often offered over the internet, over the phone  quitlines  (e.g. 1-800-QUIT-NOW), or in person.   Nicotine replacement therapy  when used for less than eight weeks helped with withdrawal symptoms, cravings, and urges (for example, transdermal  nicotine patches ,  gum , lozenges, sprays, and  inhalers ).   The antidepressant  bupropion , marketed under the brand name Zyban, helps with withdrawal symptoms, cravings, and urges. Bupropion is contraindicated in  epilepsy , seizure disorder; anorexia/bulimia (eating disorders), patients use of psychosis drugs (MAO inhibitors) within 14 days, patients undergoing abrupt discontinuation of ethanol or sedatives (including benzodiazepines such as Valium) [ 3 ]   Nicotinic receptor agonist  varenicline  (Chantix) (Champix in the UK)   Recently, an injection given multiple times over the course of several months, which primes the immune system to produce antibodies which attach to nicotine and prevent it from reaching the brain, has shown promise in helping smokers quit. However, this approach is still in the experimental stages.  [1]   Hypnosis  clinical trials studying hypnosis as a method for smoking cessation have been inconclusive. (The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2006, Issue 3.)   Herbal preparations  such as  Kava  and  Chamomile   Acupuncture  clinical trials have shown that acupuncture's effect on smoking cessation is equal to that of sham/placebo acupuncture. (See Cochrane Review)   Attending a self-help group such as  Nicotine Anonymous [2]  and electronic self-help groups such as Stomp It Out [3]   Laser therapy based on  acupuncture  principles but without the needles.   Quit meters: Small computer programs that keep track of quit statistics such as amount of ""quit-time"", cigarettes not smoked, and money saved.   Self-help books .   Spirituality  Spiritual beliefs and practices may help some smokers quit. [4]   Smokeless tobacco :  Snus  is widely used in Sweden, and although it is much healthier than smoking, something which is reflected in the low cancer rates for Swedish men, there are still some concerns about its health impact.  [5]   Herbal and aromatherapy ""natural"" program formulations.   Vaporizer : heats to 410F. or less, compared with 1500F./860C. in the tip of a cigarette when drawn upon; eliminates carbon monoxide and other combustion toxins.   ""FAUX Cigarette"" or similar commercial products which can be used as alternative to smoking as well as cessation.   Electronic cigarette : Shaped like a cigar or cigarette, this device contains a rechargeable battery and a heating element that vaporizes liquid nicotine (and other flavorings) from an insertable cartridge, at lower initial cost than a vaporizer but with the same advantages including significantly reducing tar and carbon monoxide. However in  September 2008 , the  World Health Organization  issued a release proclaiming that it does not consider the electronic cigarette to be a legitimate  smoking cessation  aid, stating that to its knowledge, ""no rigorous, peer-reviewed studies have been conducted showing that the electronic cigarette is a safe and effective  nicotine replacement therapy ."" [ 4 ]       Screened single-toke utensil ( [6] ) [ 5 ] : smoking-reduction utensil substitutes 25-mg. single servings for the heavily advertised trap of each time lighting an entire 700-mg. commercial cigarette.   Smoking herb substitutions (non-tobacco) [7]   Great American Smokeout  is an annual event that invites smokers to quit for one day, hoping they will be able to extend this forever.   Bubble wrap  can be useful to distract and provide an alternate form of stress release, anxiety control and manual stimulation.       [ edit ]   Factors   Research in Western countries has found that approximately 3-5% of quit attempts succeed using willpower alone (Hughes et al, 2004) [ 6 ] . The British Medical Journal and others have reviewed the evidence regarding which methods are most effective for smokers interested in breaking free of the smoking habit, and concluded that     Nicotine dependence is most effectively treated with a combination of drugs and specialist behavioural support [ 7 ]     An even better chance of success can be obtained by combining medication and psychological support (see below) (USDHHS, 2000). Medication or pharmacological quitting-aids that have shown evidence of effectiveness in clinical trials include medical nicotine replacement patches or gum, the tricyclic anti-depressant  nortriptyline , [ 8 ] bupropion  (Zyban, or Quomem in some countries), and the nicotinic partial agonist,  varenicline  (Chantix in the U.S. and Champix elsewhere).   Smoking cessation services, which offer group or individual therapy can help people who want to quit. Some smoking cessation programs employ a combination of  coaching ,  motivational interviewing ,  cognitive behavioral therapy , and pharmacological counseling.   Few smokers are successful with their very first attempt. Many smokers find it difficult to quit, even in the face of serious smoking-related disease in themselves or close family members or friends. A serious commitment to arresting dependency upon nicotine is essential. The typical effort of a person that finally succeeds is the seventh to fifteenth try. Each attempt is a learning experience that moves them that much closer to their goal of eventual permanent freedom from smoking.   Some studies have concluded that those who do successfully quit smoking can gain weight. ""Weight gain is not likely to negate the health benefits of smoking cessation, but its cosmetic effects may interfere with attempts to quit."" (Williamson, Madans et al, 1991). Therefore, drug companies researching smoking-cessation medication often measure the weight of the participants in the study.   Major depression  may challenge smoking cessation success in women. Quitting smoking is especially difficult during certain phases of the  reproductive cycle , phases that have also been associated with greater levels of  dysphoria , and subgroups of women who have a high risk of continuing to smoke also have a high risk of developing depression. Since many women who are depressed may be less likely to seek formal cessation treatment, practitioners have a unique opportunity to persuade their patients to quit. [ 9 ]   A U.S Surgeon General's report includes tables setting forth success rates for various methods, some of which are listed below, ranked by success rate and identified by the Surgeon General's table number. [ 10 ]     Quitting programs combining counseling or support elements with a prescription for Bupropion SR (Zyban/Wellbutrin) found success rates were increased to  30.5 percent , (Surgeon General's Table 25).   Quitting programs involving 91 to 300 minutes of contact time increased six month success rates to  28 percent , regardless of other quitting method included  Surgeon General's Report  Table 13, page 59]   Quitting programs involving 8 or more treatment sessions increased six month success rates to  24.7 percent  (Surgeon General's Table 14, page 60)   High intensity counseling of greater than 10 minutes increased six month success rates to  22 percent  whether added to any other quitting method, nicotine replacement, or cold turkey  Surgeon General's Report  Table 12, page 58]   A physician's advice to quit can increase quitting odds by 30 percent to  ten percent  at six months  Surgeon General's Report  Table 11, page 57]   Seven percent  of those who used over-the-counter nicotine patch and gum products quit for at least six months       [ edit ]   Prognosis   Many of tobacco's health effects can be minimized through smoking cessation. The  British doctors study [ 11 ]  showed that those who stopped smoking before they reached 30 years of age lived almost as long as those who never smoked. It is also possible to reduce the risks by reducing the frequency of smoking and by proper diet and exercise. Some research has indicated that some of the damage caused by smoking tobacco can be moderated with the use of  antioxidants . [ 12 ]   Smokers wanting to quit or to temporarily abstain from smoking can use a variety of nicotine-containing tobacco substitutes, or  nicotine replacement therapy  (NRT) products to temporarily lessen the physical  withdrawal  symptoms, the most popular being  nicotine gum  and  lozenges .  Nicotine patches  are also used for smoking cessation. Medications that do not contain nicotine can also be used, such as  bupropion  (Zyban or Wellbutrin) and  varenicline  (Chantix).   Upon smoking cessation, the body begins to rid itself of naturally foreign substances introduced to the body through smoking. These include substances in the blood such as nicotine and carbon monoxide, and also accumulated particulate matter and tar from the lungs. As a consequence, though the smoker may begin coughing more, cardiovascular efficiency increases.   Many of the effects of smoking cessation can be seen as landmarks, often cited by smoking cessation services, by which a smoker can encourage him or herself to keep going. Some are of a certain nature, such as those of  nicotine  clearing the bloodstream completely in 48 to 72 hours, and  cotinine  (a metabolite of nicotine) clearing the bloodstream within 10 to 14 days. Other effects, such as improved circulation, are more variable in nature, and as a result less definite timescales are often cited.   As with other addictions, apart from the dependence of the body on chemical substances, a smoking addiction is often related to everyday lifestyle events, which can include thinking deeply, eating, drinking tea, coffee or alcohol, or general socializing. As a result, smokers may miss the act of smoking particularly at these times, and this may increase the difficulty inherent in a cessation attempt. As a result of a lower dopamine response from nicotine receptors in the  brain , a degree of  depression  may ensue, along with somatic responses where the smoker feels less able to perform the day to day tasks previously related to smoking without having the usual cigarette to accompany them.   High  stress  often results when heavily addicted individuals or long-time smokers attempt to quit, in part because their everyday lifestyle events have been altered and they may miss the social interaction normally associated with the habit.   Smoking cessation will almost always lead to a longer and healthier life. Stopping in early adulthood can add up to 10 years of healthy life and stopping in one's sixties can still add three years of healthy life (Doll et al, 2004). Stopping smoking is associated with better mental health and spending less of one's life with diseases of old age.   The immediate effects of smoking cessation include:     Within 20 minutes blood pressure returns to its normal level   After 8 hours oxygen levels return to normal   After 24 hours carbon monoxide levels in the lungs return to those of a non-smoker and the mucus begins to clear   After 48 hours nicotine leaves the body and tastebuds are improved   After 72 hours breathing becomes easier   After 2-12 weeks, circulation improves   After 5 years, the risk of heart attack falls to about half that of a smoker   After 10 years, the chance of lung cancer is almost the same as a non-smoker.

Contents       1   History   2   Methods   3   Factors   4   Prognosis   5   Public policy   6   See also   7   Notes   8   References   9   External links               [ edit ]   History             Please help  improve this article or section  by expanding it.  Further information might be found on the  talk page .  (December 2008)       The first public  smoking cessation movement  was initiated by the Nazi Germany government in the 1930s.     [ edit ]   Methods          A 21mg dose  Nicoderm  CQ patch applied to the left arm.       Techniques which can increase smokers' chances of successfully quitting are:     Quitting "" cold turkey "": abrupt cessation of all nicotine use as opposed to tapering or gradual stepped-down nicotine weaning. It is the quitting method used by 80 [ 1 ]  to 90% [ 2 ]  of all long-term successful quitters.   Smoking-cessation support and counseling is often offered over the internet, over the phone  quitlines  (e.g. 1-800-QUIT-NOW), or in person.   Nicotine replacement therapy  when used for less than eight weeks helped with withdrawal symptoms, cravings, and urges (for example, transdermal  nicotine patches ,  gum , lozenges, sprays, and  inhalers ). Nicotine replacement therapy doubles the smoker's chances of quitting successfully.   The antidepressant  bupropion , marketed under the brand name Zyban, helps with withdrawal symptoms, cravings, and urges. Bupropion is contraindicated in  epilepsy , seizure disorder; anorexia/bulimia (eating disorders), patients use of psychosis drugs (MAO inhibitors) within 14 days, patients undergoing abrupt discontinuation of ethanol or sedatives (including benzodiazepines such as Valium) [ 3 ]   Nicotinic receptor agonist  varenicline  (Chantix) (Champix in the UK)   Recently, an injection given multiple times over the course of several months, which primes the immune system to produce antibodies which attach to nicotine and prevent it from reaching the brain, has shown promise in helping smokers quit. However, this approach is still in the experimental stages.  [1]   Hypnosis  clinical trials studying hypnosis as a method for smoking cessation have been inconclusive. (The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2006, Issue 3.)   Herbal preparations  such as  Kava  and  Chamomile   Acupuncture  clinical trials have shown that acupuncture's effect on smoking cessation is equal to that of sham/placebo acupuncture. (See Cochrane Review)   Attending a self-help group such as  Nicotine Anonymous [2]  and electronic self-help groups such as Stomp It Out [3]   Laser therapy based on  acupuncture  principles but without the needles.   Quit meters: Small computer programs that keep track of quit statistics such as amount of ""quit-time"", cigarettes not smoked, and money saved.   Self-help books .   Spirituality  Spiritual beliefs and practices may help some smokers quit. [4]   Smokeless tobacco :  Snus  is widely used in Sweden, and although it is much healthier than smoking, something which is reflected in the low cancer rates for Swedish men, there are still some concerns about its health impact.  [5]   Herbal and aromatherapy ""natural"" program formulations.   Vaporizer : heats to 410F. or less, compared with 1500F./860C. in the tip of a cigarette when drawn upon; eliminates carbon monoxide and other combustion toxins.   ""FAUX Cigarette"" or similar commercial products which can be used as alternative to smoking as well as cessation.   Electronic cigarette : Shaped like a cigar or cigarette, this device contains a rechargeable battery and a heating element that vaporizes liquid nicotine (and other flavorings) from an insertable cartridge, at lower initial cost than a vaporizer but with the same advantages including significantly reducing tar and carbon monoxide.   Screened single-toke utensil ( [6] ) [ 4 ] : smoking-reduction utensil substitutes 25-mg. single servings for the heavily advertised trap of each time lighting an entire 700-mg. commercial cigarette.   Smoking herb substitutions (non-tobacco) [7]   Great American Smokeout  is an annual event that invites smokers to quit for one day, hoping they will be able to extend this forever.       [ edit ]   Factors   Research in Western countries has found that approximately 3-5% of quit attempts succeed using willpower alone (Hughes et al, 2004) [ 5 ] . The British Medical Journal and others have reviewed the evidence regarding which methods are most effective for smokers interested in breaking free of the smoking habit, and concluded that     Nicotine dependence is most effectively treated with a combination of drugs and specialist behavioural support [ 6 ]     An even better chance of success can be obtained by combining medication and psychological support (see below) (USDHHS, 2000). Medication or pharmacological quitting-aids that have shown evidence of effectiveness in clinical trials include medical nicotine replacement patches or gum, the tricyclic anti-depressant  nortriptyline , [ 7 ] bupropion  (Zyban, or Quomem in some countries), and the nicotinic partial agonist,  varenicline  (Chantix in the U.S. and Champix elsewhere).   Smoking cessation services, which offer group or individual therapy can help people who want to quit. Some smoking cessation programs employ a combination of  coaching ,  motivational interviewing ,  cognitive behavioral therapy , and pharmacological counseling.   Few smokers are successful with their very first attempt. Many smokers find it difficult to quit, even in the face of serious smoking-related disease in themselves or close family members or friends. A serious commitment to arresting dependency upon nicotine is essential. The typical effort of a person that finally succeeds is the seventh to fifteenth try. Each attempt is a learning experience that moves them that much closer to their goal of eventual permanent freedom from smoking.   Some studies have concluded that those who do successfully quit smoking can gain weight. ""Weight gain is not likely to negate the health benefits of smoking cessation, but its cosmetic effects may interfere with attempts to quit."" (Williamson, Madans et al, 1991). Therefore, drug companies researching smoking-cessation medication often measure the weight of the participants in the study.   Major depression  may challenge smoking cessation success in women. Quitting smoking is especially difficult during certain phases of the  reproductive cycle , phases that have also been associated with greater levels of  dysphoria , and subgroups of women who have a high risk of continuing to smoke also have a high risk of developing depression. Since many women who are depressed may be less likely to seek formal cessation treatment, practitioners have a unique opportunity to persuade their patients to quit. [ 8 ]   A U.S Surgeon General's report includes tables setting forth success rates for various methods, some of which are listed below, ranked by success rate and identified by the Surgeon General's table number. [ 9 ]     Quitting programs combining counseling or support elements with a prescription for Bupropion SR (Zyban/Wellbutrin) found success rates were increased to  30.5 percent , (Surgeon General's Table 25).   Quitting programs involving 91 to 300 minutes of contact time increased six month success rates to  28 percent , regardless of other quitting method included  Surgeon General's Report  Table 13, page 59]   Quitting programs involving 8 or more treatment sessions increased six month success rates to  24.7 percent  (Surgeon General's Table 14, page 60)   High intensity counseling of greater than 10 minutes increased six month success rates to  22 percent  whether added to any other quitting method, nicotine replacement, or cold turkey  Surgeon General's Report  Table 12, page 58]   A physician's advice to quit can increase quitting odds by 30 percent to  ten percent  at six months  Surgeon General's Report  Table 11, page 57]   Seven percent  of those who used over-the-counter nicotine patch and gum products quit for at least six months       [ edit ]   Prognosis   Many of tobacco's health effects can be minimized through smoking cessation. The  British doctors study [ 10 ]  showed that those who stopped smoking before they reached 30 years of age lived almost as long as those who never smoked. It is also possible to reduce the risks by reducing the frequency of smoking and by proper diet and exercise. Some research has indicated that some of the damage caused by smoking tobacco can be moderated with the use of  antioxidants . [ 11 ]   Smokers wanting to quit or to temporarily abstain from smoking can use a variety of nicotine-containing tobacco substitutes, or  nicotine replacement therapy  (NRT) products to temporarily lessen the physical  withdrawal  symptoms, the most popular being  nicotine gum  and  lozenges .  Nicotine patches  are also used for smoking cessation. Medications that do not contain nicotine can also be used, such as  bupropion  (Zyban or Wellbutrin) and  varenicline  (Chantix).   Upon smoking cessation, the body begins to rid itself of naturally foreign substances introduced to the body through smoking.

(December 2008)              A 'No Smoking' sign       Smoking cessation  is the effort to stop  smoking   tobacco  products.  Nicotine  is an  addictive  substance, especially when consumed through the inhalation of tobacco smoke because of the rapid absorption through the lungs. Tobacco use is one of the major causes of death worldwide, according to the  World Health Organization [ 1 ] , causing 5.4 million deaths per year world-wide.

Further information might be found on the  talk page .  (December 2008)       The first public  smoking cessation movement  was initiated by the Nazi Germany government in the 1930s.     [ edit ]   Description   Research in Western countries has found that approximately 3-5% of quit attempts succeed using willpower alone (Hughes et al, 2004) [ 2 ] . The British Medical Journal and others have reviewed the evidence regarding which methods are most effective for smokers interested in breaking free of the smoking habit, and concluded that     Nicotine dependence is most effectively treated with a combination of drugs and specialist behavioural support . . . [ 3 ]     As detailed in the Statistics section below, multi-session psychological support from a trained counselor, either individually or in groups has been shown in clinical trials to provide the greatest benefit.   An even better chance of success can be obtained by combining medication and psychological support (see below) (USDHHS, 2000). [ citation needed ]  Medication or pharmacological quitting-aids that have shown evidence of effectiveness in clinical trials include medical nicotine replacement patches or gum, the tricyclic anti-depressant  nortriptyline [ 4 ] , bupropion  (Zyban, or Quomem in some countries), and the nicotinic partial agonist,  varenicline  (Chantix in the U.S. and Champix elsewhere).   There are many people and organizations touting what are claimed to be effective methods of helping smokers to stop. Such claims of success are rarely backed up by independent comparative clinical trials or correctly calculated success rates. A separate thorough review of the evidence for each of several methods and aids for stopping smoking is available via the Cochrane Library website,  Cochrane Library. [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Hazardous elements of Cigarette smoke   Tobacco smoke contains over 4,000 chemicals, many of which have a harmful effect on the body. But the main components of tobacco smoke are nicotine, tar and carbon monoxide.     Nicotine  is an element in cigarettes that causes addiction. [ 6 ]  Nicotine has only moderate impact on health, and its negative impact is negligible when compared to the other carcinogens present in cigarettes.       Tar  is a mixture of over 1,000 chemicals. It includes a variety of irritants and at least 60 compounds known to cause cancer. The smoke from cigarettes leaves tar deposits in the lungs and respiratory system which are absorbed through the rest of the body.       Carbon monoxide  is a poisonous gas present in cigarette smoke. It reduces the amount of oxygen the blood can carry to the body tissues and cells, including the heart. Pregnant women should be especially mindful of the effects of carbon monoxide on the body.     Smoking causes one in three of all cancer related deaths, including 90% of lung cancer deaths, 20% of all heart disease deaths and 90% of all deaths from bronchitis and emphysema. More than half of all smokers will die of illnesses related to smoking. While most people associate smoking with lung cancer, few people realize that  cardiovascular  illnesses make up almost half of all smoking related deaths, due in part to the heavy strain placed on the heart by the oxygen depletion property of carbon monoxide.     [ edit ]   What to expect when you quit   Quitting smoking is notoriously difficult. Approximately half of all attempts to quit smoking actually succeed, and most people who do successfully quit do so only after several attempts.   Common short-term effects of smoking cessation are increased irritability, depression, anxiety, restlessness, insomnia, difficulty concentrating, increased appetite,  rhinorrhea , cough, and increased susceptibility to upper respiratory tract infections. Reportedly these symptoms generally last for up to four weeks. Increased appetite for some, though, can continue for more than three months. You may also feel a loss of energy and become tired. Along with the increase in appetite, weight gain is also likely.   These side effects, however, are minor compared to the health benefits of smoking cessation.     [ edit ]   Information for smokers trying to quit   Smoking cessation services, which offer group or individual therapy can help people who want to quit. Some smoking cessation programs employ a combination of  coaching ,  motivational interviewing ,  cognitive behavioral therapy , and pharmacological counseling.   Few smokers are successful with their very first attempt. Many smokers find it difficult to quit, even in the face of serious smoking-related disease in themselves or close family members or friends. A serious commitment to arresting dependency upon nicotine is essential. The typical effort of a person that finally succeeds is the seventh to fifteenth try. Each attempt is a learning experience that moves them that much closer to their goal of eventual permanent freedom from smoking.   Some studies have concluded that those who do successfully quit smoking can gain weight. ""Weight gain is not likely to negate the health benefits of smoking cessation, but its cosmetic effects may interfere with attempts to quit."" (Williamson, Madans et al, 1991). Therefore, drug companies researching smoking-cessation medication often measure the weight of the participants in the study.   Major depression  may challenge smoking cessation success in women. Quitting smoking is especially difficult during certain phases of the  reproductive cycle , phases that have also been associated with greater levels of  dysphoria , and subgroups of women who have a high risk of continuing to smoke also have a high risk of developing depression. Since many women who are depressed may be less likely to seek formal cessation treatment, practitioners have a unique opportunity to persuade their patients to quit. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Methods of quitting smoking          A 21mg dose  Nicoderm  CQ patch applied to the left arm.       Techniques which can increase smokers' chances of successfully quitting are:     Quitting "" cold turkey "": abrupt cessation of all nicotine use as opposed to tapering or gradual stepped-down nicotine weaning. It is the quitting method used by 80 [ 8 ]  to 90% [ 9 ]  of all long-term successful quitters.   Smoking-cessation support and counseling is often offered over the internet, over the phone  quitlines  (e.g. 1-800-QUIT-NOW), or in person.   Nicotine replacement therapy  when used for less than eight weeks helped with withdrawal symptoms, cravings, and urges (for example, transdermal  nicotine patches ,  gum , lozenges, sprays, and  inhalers ). Nicotine replacement therapy doubles the smoker's chances of quitting successfully.   The antidepressant  bupropion , marketed under the brand name Zyban, helps with withdrawal symptoms, cravings, and urges. Bupropion is contraindicated in  epilepsy , seizure disorder; anorexia/bulimia (eating disorders), patients use of psychosis drugs (MAO inhibitors) within 14 days, patients undergoing abrupt discontinuation of ethanol or sedatives (including benzodiazepines such as Valium) [ 10 ]   Nicotinic receptor agonist  varenicline  (Chantix) (Champix in the UK)   Recently, an injection given multiple times over the course of several months, which primes the immune system to produce antibodies which attach to nicotine and prevent it from reaching the brain, has shown promise in helping smokers quit. However, this approach is still in the experimental stages.  [1]       Hypnosis  clinical trials studying hypnosis as a method for smoking cessation have been inconclusive. (The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2006, Issue 3.)   Herbal preparations  such as  Kava  and  Chamomile   Acupuncture  clinical trials have shown that acupuncture's effect on smoking cessation is equal to that of sham/placebo acupuncture. (See Cochrane Review)   Attending a self-help group such as  Nicotine Anonymous [2]  and electronic self-help groups such as Stomp It Out [3]   Laser therapy based on  acupuncture  principles but without the needles.   Quit meters: Small computer programs that keep track of quit statistics such as amount of ""quit-time"", cigarettes not smoked, and money saved.   Self-help books .   Spirituality  Spiritual beliefs and practices may help some smokers quit. [4]   Smokeless tobacco :  Snus  is widely used in Sweden, and although it is much healthier than smoking, something which is reflected in the low cancer rates for Swedish men, there are still some concerns about its health impact.  [5]   Herbal and aromatherapy ""natural"" program formulations.   Vaporizer : heats to 410F. or less, compared with 1500F./860C. in the tip of a cigarette when drawn upon; eliminates carbon monoxide and other combustion toxins.   ""FAUX Cigarette"" or similar commercial products which can be used as alternative to smoking as well as cessation.   Electronic cigarette : Shaped like a cigar or cigarette, this device contains a rechargeable battery and a heating element that vaporizes liquid nicotine (and other flavorings) from an insertable cartridge, at lower initial cost than a vaporizer but with the same advantages including significantly reducing tar and carbon monoxide.   Screened single-toke utensil ( [6] ) [ 11 ] : smoking-reduction utensil substitutes 25-mg. single servings for the heavily advertised trap of each time lighting an entire 700-mg. commercial cigarette.   Smoking herb substitutions (non-tobacco) [7]   Great American Smokeout  is an annual event that invites smokers to quit for one day, hoping they will be able to extend this forever.       [ edit ]   Physiological & Psychological Effects   Upon smoking cessation, the body begins to rid itself of naturally foreign substances introduced to the body through smoking. These include substances in the blood such as nicotine and carbon monoxide, and also accumulated particulate matter and tar from the lungs. As a consequence, though the smoker may begin coughing more, cardiovascular efficiency increases.   Many of the effects of smoking cessation can be seen as landmarks, often cited by smoking cessation services, by which a smoker can encourage him or herself to keep going. Some are of a certain nature, such as those of  nicotine  clearing the bloodstream completely in 48 to 72 hours, and  cotinine  (a metabolite of nicotine) clearing the bloodstream within 10 to 14 days. Other effects, such as improved circulation, are more variable in nature, and as a result less definite timescales are often cited.   As with other addictions, apart from the dependence of the body on chemical substances, a smoking addiction is often related to everyday lifestyle events, which can include thinking deeply, eating, drinking tea, coffee or alcohol, or general socializing. As a result, smokers may miss the act of smoking particularly at these times, and this may increase the difficulty inherent in a cessation attempt. As a result of a lower dopamine response from nicotine receptors in the  brain , a degree of  depression  may ensue, along with somatic responses where the smoker feels less able to perform the day to day tasks previously related to smoking without having the usual cigarette to accompany them.   High  stress  often results when heavily addicted individuals or long-time smokers attempt to quit, in part because their everyday lifestyle events have been altered and they may miss the social interaction normally associated with the habit.   Smoking cessation will almost always lead to a longer and healthier life. Stopping in early adulthood can add up to 10 years of healthy life and stopping in one's sixties can still add three years of healthy life (Doll et al, 2004). Stopping smoking is associated with better mental health and spending less of one's life with diseases of old age.   The immediate effects of smoking cessation include:     Within 20 minutes blood pressure returns to its normal level   After 8 hours oxygen levels return to normal   After 24 hours carbon monoxide levels in the lungs return to those of a non-smoker and the mucus begins to clear   After 48 hours nicotine leaves the body and tastebuds are improved   After 72 hours breathing becomes easier   After 2-12 weeks, circulation improves   After 5 years, the risk of heart attack falls to about half that of a smoker   After 10 years, the chance of lung cancer is almost the same as a non-smoker.       [ edit ]   Information for healthcare professionals   Several studies have found that smoking cessation advice is not always given in primary care in patients aged 65 and older, [ 12 ] [ 13 ]  despite the significant health benefits which can ensue in the older population. [ 14 ]   One way to assist smokers who want to quit is through a telephone  quitline  which is easily available to all. Professionally run quitlines may help less dependent smokers, but those people who are more heavily dependent on nicotine should seek local smoking cessation services, where they exist, or assistance from a knowledgeable health professional, where they do not. Some evidence suggests that better results are achieved when counseling support and medication are used simultaneously. [ citation needed ]  Quitting with a group of other people who want to quit is also a method of getting support, available through many organizations.   Health professionals  may follow the ""five As"" with every smoking patient they come in contact with: [ 15 ]     Ask about smoking   Advise quitting   Assess current willingness to quit   Assist in the quit attempt   Arrange timely follow-up       [ edit ]   Statistics   A U.S Surgeon General's report includes tables setting forth success rates for various methods, some of which are listed below, ranked by success rate and identified by the Surgeon General's table number. [ 16 ]     Quitting programs combining counseling or support elements with a prescription for Bupropion SR (Zyban/Wellbutrin) found success rates were increased to  30.5 percent , (Surgeon General's Table 25).       Quitting programs involving 91 to 300 minutes of contact time increased six month success rates to  28 percent , regardless of other quitting method included  Surgeon General's Report  Table 13, page 59]       Quitting programs involving 8 or more treatment sessions increased six month success rates to  24.7 percent  (Surgeon General's Table 14, page 60)       High intensity counseling of greater than 10 minutes increased six month success rates to  22 percent  whether added to any other quitting method, nicotine replacement, or cold turkey  Surgeon General's Report  Table 12, page 58]       A physician's advice to quit can increase quitting odds by 30 percent to  ten percent  at six months  Surgeon General's Report  Table 11, page 57]   Seven percent  of those who used over-the-counter nicotine patch and gum products quit for at least six months       [ edit ]   See also     Allen Carr   Anti-tobacco movement in Nazi Germany   Electronic cigarette   Health promotion   Nicotine Anonymous   National Tobacco Cessation Collaborative   Nicotine replacement therapy   NicVAX   Tobacco and health   Tobacco cessation clinic       [ edit ]   Notes       ^   World Health Organization, Tobacco Free Initiative   ^  Only about half of all attempts to quit succeed, and most people who do succeed do so only after several attempts.

It is the quitting method used by 80 [ 1 ]  to 90% [ 2 ]  of all long-term successful quitters.   Smoking-cessation support and counseling is often offered over the internet, over the phone  quitlines  (e.g. 1-800-QUIT-NOW), or in person.   Nicotine replacement therapy  when used for less than eight weeks helped with withdrawal symptoms, cravings, and urges (for example, transdermal  nicotine patches ,  gum , lozenges, sprays, and  inhalers ).   The antidepressant  bupropion , marketed under the brand name Zyban, helps with withdrawal symptoms, cravings, and urges.

Bubble wrap  can be useful to distract and provide an alternate form of stress release, anxiety control and manual stimulation.       [ edit ]   Factors   Research in Western countries has found that approximately 3-5% of quit attempts succeed using willpower alone (Hughes et al, 2004) [ 6 ] . The British Medical Journal and others have reviewed the evidence regarding which methods are most effective for smokers interested in breaking free of the smoking habit, and concluded that     Nicotine dependence is most effectively treated with a combination of drugs and specialist behavioural support [ 7 ]     An even better chance of success can be obtained by combining medication and psychological support (see below) (USDHHS, 2000). Medication or pharmacological quitting-aids that have shown evidence of effectiveness in clinical trials include medical nicotine replacement patches or gum, the tricyclic anti-depressant  nortriptyline , [ 8 ] bupropion  (Zyban, or Quomem in some countries), and the nicotinic partial agonist,  varenicline  (Chantix in the U.S. and Champix elsewhere).   Smoking cessation services, which offer group or individual therapy can help people who want to quit. Some smoking cessation programs employ a combination of  coaching ,  motivational interviewing ,  cognitive behavioral therapy , and pharmacological counseling.   Few smokers are successful with their very first attempt. Many smokers find it difficult to quit, even in the face of serious smoking-related disease in themselves or close family members or friends. A serious commitment to arresting dependency upon nicotine is essential. The typical effort of a person that finally succeeds is the seventh to fifteenth try. Each attempt is a learning experience that moves them that much closer to their goal of eventual permanent freedom from smoking.   Some studies have concluded that those who do successfully quit smoking can gain weight. ""Weight gain is not likely to negate the health benefits of smoking cessation, but its cosmetic effects may interfere with attempts to quit."" (Williamson, Madans et al, 1991). Therefore, drug companies researching smoking-cessation medication often measure the weight of the participants in the study.   Major depression  may challenge smoking cessation success in women. Quitting smoking is especially difficult during certain phases of the  reproductive cycle , phases that have also been associated with greater levels of  dysphoria , and subgroups of women who have a high risk of continuing to smoke also have a high risk of developing depression. Since many women who are depressed may be less likely to seek formal cessation treatment, practitioners have a unique opportunity to persuade their patients to quit. [ 9 ]   A U.S Surgeon General's report includes tables setting forth success rates for various methods, some of which are listed below, ranked by success rate and identified by the Surgeon General's table number. [ 10 ]     Quitting programs combining counseling or support elements with a prescription for Bupropion SR (Zyban/Wellbutrin) found success rates were increased to  30.5 percent , (Surgeon General's Table 25).   Quitting programs involving 91 to 300 minutes of contact time increased six month success rates to  28 percent , regardless of other quitting method included  Surgeon General's Report  Table 13, page 59]   Quitting programs involving 8 or more treatment sessions increased six month success rates to  24.7 percent  (Surgeon General's Table 14, page 60)   High intensity counseling of greater than 10 minutes increased six month success rates to  22 percent  whether added to any other quitting method, nicotine replacement, or cold turkey  Surgeon General's Report  Table 12, page 58]   A physician's advice to quit can increase quitting odds by 30 percent to  ten percent  at six months  Surgeon General's Report  Table 11, page 57]   Seven percent  of those who used over-the-counter nicotine patch and gum products quit for at least six months       [ edit ]   Prognosis   Many of tobacco's health effects can be minimized through smoking cessation. The  British doctors study [ 11 ]  showed that those who stopped smoking before they reached 30 years of age lived almost as long as those who never smoked. It is also possible to reduce the risks by reducing the frequency of smoking and by proper diet and exercise. Some research has indicated that some of the damage caused by smoking tobacco can be moderated with the use of  antioxidants . [ 12 ]   Smokers wanting to quit or to temporarily abstain from smoking can use a variety of nicotine-containing tobacco substitutes, or  nicotine replacement therapy  (NRT) products to temporarily lessen the physical  withdrawal  symptoms, the most popular being  nicotine gum  and  lozenges .  Nicotine patches  are also used for smoking cessation. Medications that do not contain nicotine can also be used, such as  bupropion  (Zyban or Wellbutrin) and  varenicline  (Chantix).   Upon smoking cessation, the body begins to rid itself of naturally foreign substances introduced to the body through smoking. These include substances in the blood such as nicotine and carbon monoxide, and also accumulated particulate matter and tar from the lungs. As a consequence, though the smoker may begin coughing more, cardiovascular efficiency increases.   Many of the effects of smoking cessation can be seen as landmarks, often cited by smoking cessation services, by which a smoker can encourage him or herself to keep going. Some are of a certain nature, such as those of  nicotine  clearing the bloodstream completely in 48 to 72 hours, and  cotinine  (a metabolite of nicotine) clearing the bloodstream within 10 to 14 days. Other effects, such as improved circulation, are more variable in nature, and as a result less definite timescales are often cited.   As with other addictions, apart from the dependence of the body on chemical substances, a smoking addiction is often related to everyday lifestyle events, which can include thinking deeply, eating, drinking tea, coffee or alcohol, or general socializing. As a result, smokers may miss the act of smoking particularly at these times, and this may increase the difficulty inherent in a cessation attempt. As a result of a lower dopamine response from nicotine receptors in the  brain , a degree of  depression  may ensue, along with somatic responses where the smoker feels less able to perform the day to day tasks previously related to smoking without having the usual cigarette to accompany them.   High  stress  often results when heavily addicted individuals or long-time smokers attempt to quit, in part because their everyday lifestyle events have been altered and they may miss the social interaction normally associated with the habit.   Smoking cessation will almost always lead to a longer and healthier life. Stopping in early adulthood can add up to 10 years of healthy life and stopping in one's sixties can still add three years of healthy life (Doll et al, 2004). Stopping smoking is associated with better mental health and spending less of one's life with diseases of old age.   The immediate effects of smoking cessation include:     Within 20 minutes blood pressure returns to its normal level   After 8 hours oxygen levels return to normal   After 24 hours carbon monoxide levels in the lungs return to those of a non-smoker and the mucus begins to clear   After 48 hours nicotine leaves the body and tastebuds are improved   After 72 hours breathing becomes easier   After 2-12 weeks, circulation improves   After 5 years, the risk of heart attack falls to about half that of a smoker   After 10 years, the chance of lung cancer is almost the same as a non-smoker.       [ edit ]   Public policy   There are many people and organizations touting what are claimed to be effective methods of helping smokers to stop. Such claims of success are rarely backed up by independent comparative clinical trials or correctly calculated success rates. A separate thorough review of the evidence for each of several methods and aids for stopping smoking is available via the Cochrane Library website,  Cochrane Library . [ 13 ]   Several studies have found that smoking cessation advice is not always given in primary care in patients aged 65 and older, [ 14 ] [ 15 ]  despite the significant health benefits which can ensue in the older population.

[ 10 ]     Quitting programs combining counseling or support elements with a prescription for Bupropion SR (Zyban/Wellbutrin) found success rates were increased to  30.5 percent , (Surgeon General's Table 25).   Quitting programs involving 91 to 300 minutes of contact time increased six month success rates to  28 percent , regardless of other quitting method included  Surgeon General's Report  Table 13, page 59]   Quitting programs involving 8 or more treatment sessions increased six month success rates to  24.7 percent  (Surgeon General's Table 14, page 60)   High intensity counseling of greater than 10 minutes increased six month success rates to  22 percent  whether added to any other quitting method, nicotine replacement, or cold turkey  Surgeon General's Report  Table 12, page 58]   A physician's advice to quit can increase quitting odds by 30 percent to  ten percent  at six months  Surgeon General's Report  Table 11, page 57]   Seven percent  of those who used over-the-counter nicotine patch and gum products quit for at least six months       [ edit ]   Prognosis   Many of tobacco's health effects can be minimized through smoking cessation. The  British doctors study [ 11 ]  showed that those who stopped smoking before they reached 30 years of age lived almost as long as those who never smoked. It is also possible to reduce the risks by reducing the frequency of smoking and by proper diet and exercise. Some research has indicated that some of the damage caused by smoking tobacco can be moderated with the use of  antioxidants . [ 12 ]   Smokers wanting to quit or to temporarily abstain from smoking can use a variety of nicotine-containing tobacco substitutes, or  nicotine replacement therapy  (NRT) products to temporarily lessen the physical  withdrawal  symptoms, the most popular being  nicotine gum  and  lozenges .  Nicotine patches  are also used for smoking cessation. Medications that do not contain nicotine can also be used, such as  bupropion  (Zyban or Wellbutrin) and  varenicline  (Chantix).   Upon smoking cessation, the body begins to rid itself of naturally foreign substances introduced to the body through smoking. These include substances in the blood such as nicotine and carbon monoxide, and also accumulated particulate matter and tar from the lungs. As a consequence, though the smoker may begin coughing more, cardiovascular efficiency increases.   Many of the effects of smoking cessation can be seen as landmarks, often cited by smoking cessation services, by which a smoker can encourage him or herself to keep going. Some are of a certain nature, such as those of  nicotine  clearing the bloodstream completely in 48 to 72 hours, and  cotinine  (a metabolite of nicotine) clearing the bloodstream within 10 to 14 days. Other effects, such as improved circulation, are more variable in nature, and as a result less definite timescales are often cited.   As with other addictions, apart from the dependence of the body on chemical substances, a smoking addiction is often related to everyday lifestyle events, which can include thinking deeply, eating, drinking tea, coffee or alcohol, or general socializing. As a result, smokers may miss the act of smoking particularly at these times, and this may increase the difficulty inherent in a cessation attempt. As a result of a lower dopamine response from nicotine receptors in the  brain , a degree of  depression  may ensue, along with somatic responses where the smoker feels less able to perform the day to day tasks previously related to smoking without having the usual cigarette to accompany them.   High  stress  often results when heavily addicted individuals or long-time smokers attempt to quit, in part because their everyday lifestyle events have been altered and they may miss the social interaction normally associated with the habit.   Smoking cessation will almost always lead to a longer and healthier life. Stopping in early adulthood can add up to 10 years of healthy life and stopping in one's sixties can still add three years of healthy life (Doll et al, 2004). Stopping smoking is associated with better mental health and spending less of one's life with diseases of old age.   The immediate effects of smoking cessation include:     Within 20 minutes blood pressure returns to its normal level   After 8 hours oxygen levels return to normal   After 24 hours carbon monoxide levels in the lungs return to those of a non-smoker and the mucus begins to clear   After 48 hours nicotine leaves the body and tastebuds are improved   After 72 hours breathing becomes easier   After 2-12 weeks, circulation improves   After 5 years, the risk of heart attack falls to about half that of a smoker   After 10 years, the chance of lung cancer is almost the same as a non-smoker.       [ edit ]   Public policy   There are many people and organizations touting what are claimed to be effective methods of helping smokers to stop. Such claims of success are rarely backed up by independent comparative clinical trials or correctly calculated success rates. A separate thorough review of the evidence for each of several methods and aids for stopping smoking is available via the Cochrane Library website,  Cochrane Library . [ 13 ]   Several studies have found that smoking cessation advice is not always given in primary care in patients aged 65 and older, [ 14 ] [ 15 ]  despite the significant health benefits which can ensue in the older population.

Contents       1   History   2   Methods   3   Factors   4   Prognosis   5   Public policy   6   See also   7   Notes   8   References   9   External links               [ edit ]   History             Please help  improve this article or section  by expanding it.  Further information might be found on the  talk page .  (December 2008)       The first public  smoking cessation movement  was initiated by the Nazi Germany government in the 1930s.     [ edit ]   Methods          A 21mg dose  Nicoderm  CQ patch applied to the left arm.       Techniques which can increase smokers' chances of successfully quitting are:     Quitting "" cold turkey "": abrupt cessation of all nicotine use as opposed to tapering or gradual stepped-down nicotine weaning. It is the quitting method used by 80 [ 1 ]  to 90% [ 2 ]  of all long-term successful quitters.   Smoking-cessation support and counseling is often offered over the internet, over the phone  quitlines  (e.g. 1-800-QUIT-NOW), or in person.   Nicotine replacement therapy  when used for less than eight weeks helped with withdrawal symptoms, cravings, and urges (for example, transdermal  nicotine patches ,  gum , lozenges, sprays, and  inhalers ).   The antidepressant  bupropion , marketed under the brand name Zyban, helps with withdrawal symptoms, cravings, and urges. Bupropion is contraindicated in  epilepsy , seizure disorder; anorexia/bulimia (eating disorders), patients use of psychosis drugs (MAO inhibitors) within 14 days, patients undergoing abrupt discontinuation of ethanol or sedatives (including benzodiazepines such as Valium) [ 3 ]   Nicotinic receptor agonist  varenicline  (Chantix) (Champix in the UK)   Recently, an injection given multiple times over the course of several months, which primes the immune system to produce antibodies which attach to nicotine and prevent it from reaching the brain, has shown promise in helping smokers quit. However, this approach is still in the experimental stages.  [1]   Hypnosis  clinical trials studying hypnosis as a method for smoking cessation have been inconclusive. (The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2006, Issue 3.)   Herbal preparations  such as  Kava  and  Chamomile   Acupuncture  clinical trials have shown that acupuncture's effect on smoking cessation is equal to that of sham/placebo acupuncture. (See Cochrane Review)   Attending a self-help group such as  Nicotine Anonymous [2]  and electronic self-help groups such as Stomp It Out [3]   Interactive web-based programs like  DaretoQuit [4]  specializes teaching you how to quit with lessons and strategies tailored to you and your habits   Laser therapy based on  acupuncture  principles but without the needles.   Quit meters: Small computer programs that keep track of quit statistics such as amount of ""quit-time"", cigarettes not smoked, and money saved.   Self-help books .   Spirituality  Spiritual beliefs and practices may help some smokers quit. [5]   Smokeless tobacco :  Snus  is widely used in Sweden, and although it is much healthier than smoking, something which is reflected in the low cancer rates for Swedish men, there are still some concerns about its health impact.  [6]   Herbal and aromatherapy ""natural"" program formulations.   Vaporizer : heats to 410F. or less, compared with 1500F./860C. in the tip of a cigarette when drawn upon; eliminates carbon monoxide and other combustion toxins.   ""FAUX Cigarette"" or similar commercial products which can be used as alternative to smoking as well as cessation.   Electronic cigarette : Shaped like a cigar or cigarette, this device contains a rechargeable battery and a heating element that vaporizes liquid nicotine (and other flavorings) from an insertable cartridge, at lower initial cost than a vaporizer but with the same advantages including significantly reducing tar and carbon monoxide. However in  September 2008 , the  World Health Organization  issued a release proclaiming that it does not consider the electronic cigarette to be a legitimate  smoking cessation  aid, stating that to its knowledge, ""no rigorous, peer-reviewed studies have been conducted showing that the electronic cigarette is a safe and effective  nicotine replacement therapy ."" [ 4 ]       Screened single-toke utensil ( [7] ) [ 5 ] : smoking-reduction utensil substitutes 25-mg. single servings for the heavily advertised trap of each time lighting an entire 700-mg. commercial cigarette.   Smoking herb substitutions (non-tobacco) [8]   Great American Smokeout  is an annual event that invites smokers to quit for one day, hoping they will be able to extend this forever.   Bubble wrap  can be useful to distract and provide an alternate form of stress release, anxiety control and manual stimulation.       [ edit ]   Factors   Research in Western countries has found that approximately 3-5% of quit attempts succeed using willpower alone (Hughes et al, 2004) [ 6 ] . The British Medical Journal and others have reviewed the evidence regarding which methods are most effective for smokers interested in breaking free of the smoking habit, and concluded that     Nicotine dependence is most effectively treated with a combination of drugs and specialist behavioural support [ 7 ]     An even better chance of success can be obtained by combining medication and psychological support (see below) (USDHHS, 2000). Medication or pharmacological quitting-aids that have shown evidence of effectiveness in clinical trials include medical nicotine replacement patches or gum, the tricyclic anti-depressant  nortriptyline , [ 8 ] bupropion  (Zyban, or Quomem in some countries), and the nicotinic partial agonist,  varenicline  (Chantix in the U.S. and Champix elsewhere).   Smoking cessation services, which offer group or individual therapy can help people who want to quit. Some smoking cessation programs employ a combination of  coaching ,  motivational interviewing ,  cognitive behavioral therapy , and pharmacological counseling.   Few smokers are successful with their very first attempt. Many smokers find it difficult to quit, even in the face of serious smoking-related disease in themselves or close family members or friends. A serious commitment to arresting dependency upon nicotine is essential. The typical effort of a person that finally succeeds is the seventh to fifteenth try. Each attempt is a learning experience that moves them that much closer to their goal of eventual permanent freedom from smoking.   Some studies have concluded that those who do successfully quit smoking can gain weight. ""Weight gain is not likely to negate the health benefits of smoking cessation, but its cosmetic effects may interfere with attempts to quit."" (Williamson, Madans et al, 1991). Therefore, drug companies researching smoking-cessation medication often measure the weight of the participants in the study.   Major depression  may challenge smoking cessation success in women. Quitting smoking is especially difficult during certain phases of the  reproductive cycle , phases that have also been associated with greater levels of  dysphoria , and subgroups of women who have a high risk of continuing to smoke also have a high risk of developing depression. Since many women who are depressed may be less likely to seek formal cessation treatment, practitioners have a unique opportunity to persuade their patients to quit. [ 9 ]   A U.S Surgeon General's report includes tables setting forth success rates for various methods, some of which are listed below, ranked by success rate and identified by the Surgeon General's table number. [ 10 ]     Quitting programs combining counseling or support elements with a prescription for Bupropion SR (Zyban/Wellbutrin) found success rates were increased to  30.5 percent , (Surgeon General's Table 25).   Quitting programs involving 91 to 300 minutes of contact time increased six month success rates to  28 percent , regardless of other quitting method included  Surgeon General's Report  Table 13, page 59]   Quitting programs involving 8 or more treatment sessions increased six month success rates to  24.7 percent  (Surgeon General's Table 14, page 60)   High intensity counseling of greater than 10 minutes increased six month success rates to  22 percent  whether added to any other quitting method, nicotine replacement, or cold turkey  Surgeon General's Report  Table 12, page 58]   A physician's advice to quit can increase quitting odds by 30 percent to  ten percent  at six months  Surgeon General's Report  Table 11, page 57]   Seven percent  of those who used over-the-counter nicotine patch and gum products quit for at least six months       [ edit ]   Prognosis   Many of tobacco's health effects can be minimized through smoking cessation.

For other uses, see  OCD (disambiguation) .       Obsessive-compulsive disorder   Classification and external resources       ICD - 10   F 42.       Obsessive-compulsive disorder  ( OCD ) is a  mental disorder  most commonly characterized by  intrusive , repetitive thoughts resulting in  compulsive behaviors  and mental acts that the person feels driven to perform, according to rules that must be applied rigidly, aimed at reducing  anxiety  by preventing some dreaded event or by resolving a more nebulous sense of tension. However, the likelihood that a dreaded event will occur, or the causal relationship between the performance of compulsions and the reduction of this likelihood, tends to be imagined or exaggerated.   OCD is the fourth most common mental disorder and is nearly as common as  asthma  and  diabetes mellitus . [ 1 ]  In the  United States , one in 50 adults has OCD. [ 2 ]  In severe cases, it affects a person's ability to function in everyday activities. The disorder often has a serious impact on the sufferer's (and their family's)  quality of life . Also, the psychological self-awareness of the  irrationality  of the disorder can be painful. For people with severe OCD, it may take several hours a day to carry out the compulsive acts.   The phrase ""obsessive-compulsive"" has become part of the English lexicon, and is often used in an informal or caricatured manner to describe someone who is meticulous,  perfectionistic , absorbed in a cause, or otherwise fixated on something or someone. [ 3 ]  Although these signs are often present in OCD, a person who exhibits them does not necessarily have OCD, and may instead have  obsessive-compulsive  personality  disorder  (OCPD) or some other condition.

The Quick Reference to the diagnostic criteria from DSM-IV-TR (2000) [ 4 ]  states six characteristics of obsessions and compulsions:     Obsessions       Recurrent and persistent thoughts,  impulses , or images that are experienced as intrusive and that cause marked anxiety or distress.   The thoughts, impulses, or images are not simply excessive worries about real-life problems.   The person attempts to ignore or suppress such thoughts, impulses, or images, or to neutralize them with some other thought or action.   The person recognizes that the obsessional thoughts, impulses, or images are a product of his or her own mind, and are not based in reality.       Compulsions       Repetitive behaviors or mental acts that the person feels driven to perform in response to an obsession, or according to rules that must be applied rigidly.   The behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing distress or preventing some dreaded event or situation; however, these behaviors or mental acts are not actually connected to the issue, or they are excessive.     In addition to these criteria, at some point during the course of the disorder, the individual must realize that his/her obsessions or compulsions are unreasonable or excessive. Moreover, the obsessions or compulsions must be time-consuming (taking up more than one hour per day), cause distress, or cause impairment in social, occupational, or school functioning. [ 4 ]  OCD often causes feelings similar to those of  depression .     [ edit ]   Symptoms and prevalence   OCD manifests in a variety of forms. Studies have placed the prevalence between one and three percent, although the prevalence of clinically recognized OCD is much lower, suggesting that many individuals with the disorder may not be diagnosed. [ 5 ]  The fact that many individuals do not seek treatment may be due in part to  stigma  associated with OCD. Another reason for not seeking treatment is that many sufferers of OCD do not realize that they have the condition.   The typical OCD sufferer performs tasks (or  compulsions ) to seek relief from obsession-related anxiety. To others, these tasks may appear odd and unnecessary. But for the sufferer, such tasks can feel critically important, and must be performed in particular ways to ward off dire consequences and to stop the  stress  from building up. Examples of these tasks are repeatedly checking that one's parked car has been locked before leaving it, turning lights on and off a set number of times before exiting a room, repeatedly washing hands at regular intervals throughout the day, touching objects a certain number of times before leaving a room, or walking in a certain routine way. Physical symptoms may include those brought on from anxieties and unwanted thoughts, as well as  tics  or  Parkinson's disease -like symptoms: rigidity, tremor, jerking arm movements, or involuntary movements of the limbs.   Formal diagnosis may be performed by a  psychologist , a  psychiatrist  or  psychoanalyst . OCD sufferers are aware that their thoughts and behavior are not rational, [ 6 ]  but they feel bound to comply with them to fend off feelings of panic or dread. Although everyone may experience unpleasant thoughts at one time or another, these are short-lived and fade away in time. [ 7 ]  For people with OCD, the thoughts are intrusive and persistent, and can cause them great anxiety and distress. [ 8 ]   Intrusive thoughts  are unwelcome, involuntary thoughts, images or unpleasant ideas that may become  obsessions , are upsetting or distressing, and can be difficult to be free of and manage. [ 9 ]  As with other forms of OCD, the awareness of the irrationality of these thoughts can be frustrating as the individual wishes to stop them but cannot. Intrusive thoughts, urges, and images are of inappropriate things at inappropriate times, usually falling into three categories: inappropriate aggressive thoughts, inappropriate sexual thoughts, and blasphemous religious thoughts. [ 10 ]  Most people experience these thoughts; when they are associated with OCD or  depression , they may become paralyzing,  anxiety -provoking, and persistent. Many people experience the type of unpleasant or unwanted thoughts that people with more troubling intrusive thoughts have, but most people are able to dismiss these thoughts. [ 9 ]  When intrusive thoughts co-occur with OCD, patients are less capable of ignoring the unpleasant thoughts and may pay undue attention to them, causing the thoughts to become more frequent and distressing. [ 9 ]   The common underlying theme to the diverse intrusive thoughts is summarised by Bruce  et al  with the example, ""What if I were to snap, lose control of myself, and do something totally uncharacteristic of me--perhaps even without my knowing it--that results in harm to myself or someone else?"" [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   OCD without Overt compulsions   A major subtype of OCD is OCD without overt compulsions. [ 12 ]  OCD without overt compulsions is often referred to as ""pure-O"" by laymen and sufferers of this disorder. The term is a bit of a misnomer, however, since OCD without overt compulsions is no more ""pure"" than any other form of OCD. Nonetheless, OCD without overt compulsions represents a major subtype of OCD with some of the estimates as high 50-60%. [ 13 ]  Rather than engaging in observable rituals and compulsions, the person with OCD without overt compulsions engages in all manner of mental neutralizing behaviours (i.e. ""covert"" compulsions).   Intrusive thoughts may involve violent obsessions about hurting others or oneself. [ 14 ]  They can include such thoughts as harming an innocent child, jumping from a bridge, mountain or the top of a tall building, urges to jump in front of a train or automobile, and urges to push another in front of a train or automobile. [ 10 ]  A survey of healthy college students found that virtually all of them had intrusive thoughts from time to time, including imagining or wishing harm upon a family member or friend, impulses to attack or kill a small child, or animal, or shout something rude or violent. [ 15 ]   The possibility that most patients suffering from intrusive thoughts will ever act on those thoughts is low; patients who are experiencing intense guilt, anxiety, shame, and anger over bad thoughts are different from those who actually act on bad thoughts. The history of violent crime is dominated by those who feel no guilt or remorse; the very fact that someone is tormented by intrusive thoughts, and has never acted on them before, is an excellent predictor that they won't act upon the thoughts. According to Baer, a patient should be concerned that intrusive thoughts are dangerous if the person doesn't feel upset by the thoughts, rather finds them pleasurable; has ever acted on violent or sexual thoughts or urges; hears voices or sees things that others don't see; or feels uncontrollable irresistible anger. [ 16 ]   Sexual obsessions may involve intrusive thoughts or images of ""kissing, hugging a lot, touching, fondling, oral sex, anal sex, intercourse, and rape"" with ""strangers, acquaintances, parents, children, family members, friends, coworkers, animals and religious figures"", involving ""heterosexual or homosexual content"" with persons of any age. [ 17 ]  Like other intrusive, unpleasant thoughts or images, most people have some inappropriate sexual thoughts at times, but people with OCD may attach significance to the unwanted sexual thoughts, generating anxiety and distress. The doubt that accompanies OCD leads to uncertainty regarding whether one might act on the bad thoughts, resulting in self-criticism or loathing. [ 17 ]     [ edit ]   OCD with Overt Compulsions   Other major subtypes of OCD frequently revolve around washing or checking; some sufferers may fear the presence of human body secretions such as saliva, blood, semen, sweat, tears, vomit, or mucus, or excretions such as urine or feces. Some OCD sufferers even fear that the soap they are using is contaminated. [ 18 ]  These anxiety-driven fears often result in various compulsive cleaning behaviours, and may cause a person to experience significant distress, which may make it difficult for a person with OCD to tolerate a workplace, venture into public locations, or conduct normal social relationships.   Symptoms related to performing tasks may include repeated hand washing [ 19 ]  or clearing of the throat; specific counting systems or counting of steps; doing repetitive actionsmore generally, this can involve an obsession with numbers or types of numbers (e.g., odd numbers). For example, when somebody suffering from OCD leaves the house, they might tap the door knob 9 times and if they don't they will go into distress, panic and even at certain times, they will pass out. These obsessive behaviors can cause individuals to feel psychological distress, because they are very concerned about having ""made mistakes"" in the number of steps that they have taken, or the number of stairs on a staircase. For some people with OCD, these obsessive counting and re-counting tasks, along with the attendant anxiety and fear, can take hours of each day, which can make it hard for the person to fulfill their work, family, or social roles. In some cases, these behaviors can also cause adverse physical symptoms: people who obsessively wash their hands with  antibacterial soap  and hot water (to remove germs) can make their skin red and raw with  dermatitis . [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Related conditions   OCD is often confused with the separate condition  obsessive-compulsive personality disorder . The two are not the same condition, however. OCD is  ego  dystonic , meaning that the disorder is incompatible with the sufferer's self-concept.  [ 20 ] [ 21 ]  Because disorders that are ego dystonic go against an individual's perception of his/herself, they tend to cause much distress. OCPD, on the other hand, is  ego syntonic marked by the individual's acceptance that the characteristics displayed as a result of this disorder are compatible with his/her self-image. Ego syntonic disorders understandably cause no distress. Persons suffering from OCD are often aware that their behavior is not rational and are unhappy about their obsessions but nevertheless feel compelled by them. Persons with OCPD are not aware of anything abnormal about themselves; they will readily explain why their actions are rational, and it is usually impossible to convince them otherwise. Persons with OCD are ridden with  anxiety ; persons who suffer from OCPD, by contrast, tend to derive pleasure from their obsessions or compulsions. [ 22 ]  This is a significant difference between these disorders.   Equally frequently, these rationalizations do not apply to the overall behavior, but to each instance individually; for example, a person compulsively checking their front door may argue that the time taken and stress caused by one more check of the front door is considerably less than the time and stress associated with being robbed, and thus the check is the better option. In practice, after that check, the individual is  still  not sure, and it is  still  better in terms of time and stress to do one more check, and this reasoning can continue as long as necessary.   Some OCD sufferers exhibit what is known as  overvalued ideas . In such cases, the person with OCD will truly be uncertain whether the fears that cause them to perform their compulsions are irrational or not. After some discussion, it is possible to convince the individual that their fears may be unfounded. It may be more difficult to do  ERP therapy  on such patients, because they may be, at least initially, unwilling to cooperate. For this reason OCD has often been likened to a disease of pathological doubt, in which the sufferer, while not usually  delusional , is often unable to realize fully what sorts of dreaded events are reasonably possible and which are not. There are severe cases when the sufferer has an unshakeable belief within the context of OCD which is difficult to differentiate from psychosis. [ 23 ]   OCD is different from behaviors such as  gambling  addiction and  overeating . People with these disorders typically experience at least some pleasure from their activity; OCD sufferers do not actively want to perform their compulsive tasks, and experience no pleasure from doing so. OCD is placed in the anxiety class of  mental illness , but like many  chronic stress disorders  it can lead to  clinical depression  over time. The constant stress of the condition can cause sufferers to develop a deadening of spirit, a numbing frustration, or sense of hopelessness. OCD's effects on day-to-day lifeparticularly its substantial consumption of timecan produce difficulties with work, finances and relationships. There is no known cure for OCD as of yet, but there are a number of successful treatment options available.     [ edit ]   Related/Spectrum disorders   People with OCD may be diagnosed with other conditions, such as  generalized anxiety disorder ,  anorexia nervosa ,  social anxiety disorder ,  bulimia nervosa ,  Tourette syndrome ,  Asperger syndrome ,  compulsive skin picking ,  body dysmorphic disorder ,  trichotillomania , and (as already mentioned)  obsessive-compulsive personality disorder . There is some research demonstrating a link between  drug addiction  and OCD as well. Many who suffer from OCD also suffer from  panic attacks . There is a higher risk of drug addiction among those with any anxiety disorder (possibly as a way of  coping  with the heightened levels of  anxiety ), but drug addiction among OCD patients may serve as a type of  compulsive behavior  and not just as a coping mechanism.  Depression  is also extremely prevalent among sufferers of OCD. One explanation for the high depression rate among OCD populations was posited by Mineka, Watson, and Clark (1998), who explained that people with OCD (or any other  anxiety disorder ) may feel depressed because of an ""out of control"" type of feeling. [ 24 ]   Some cases are thought to be caused at least in part by childhood  streptococcal  infections and are termed  PANDAS  (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infections). The streptococcal  antibodies  become involved in an  autoimmune  process. Though this idea is not set in stone, if it does prove to be true, there is cause to believe that OCD can to some very small extent be ""caught"" via exposure to strep throat (just as one may catch a cold). However, if OCD is caused by bacteria, this provides hope that  antibiotics  may eventually be used to treat or prevent it. [ 25 ]     [ edit ]   Causes     [ edit ]   Psychological   Scientists studying obsessive-compulsive disorder generally agree that both psychological and biological factors play a role in causing the disorder, although they differ in their degree of emphasis upon either type of factor.   From the 14th to the 16th century in Europe, it was believed that people who experienced blasphemous, sexual, or other obsessive thoughts were  possessed  by the  Devil . [ 26 ]  Based on this reasoning, treatment involved banishing the ""evil"" from the ""possessed"" person through  exorcism . [ 27 ]  In the early 1910s,  Sigmund Freud  attributed obsessive-compulsive behavior to unconscious conflicts which manifested as symptoms. [ 27 ]  Freud describes the clinical history of a typical case of ""touching phobia"" as starting in early childhood, when the person has a strong desire to touch an item. In response, the person develops an ""external prohibition"" against this type of touching. However, this ""prohibition does not succeed in abolishing"" the desire to touch; all it can do is repress the desire and ""force it into the unconscious"". [ 28 ]   The cognitive-behavioral model suggests that compulsive behaviour is carried out to remove anxiety-provoking intrusive thoughts. Unfortunately this only brings about temporary relief as the thought re-emerges. Each time the behaviour occurs it is negatively reinforced (see  Reinforcement ) by the relief from anxiety, thereby explaining why the dysfunctional activity increases and generalises (extends to other, related stimuli) over a period of time. For example, after touching a door-knob a person might have the thought that they may develop a disease as a result of contamination. They then experience anxiety, which is relieved when they wash their hands. This might be followed by the thought ""but did I wash them properly?"" causing an increase in anxiety once more, the hand-washing once again rewarded by the removal of anxiety (albeit briefly) and the cycle being repeated when thoughts of contamination re-occur. The distressing thoughts might then spread to fear of contamination from e.g. a chair (someone might have touched the chair after touching the door handle).     [ edit ]   Biological   There are many different theories about the cause of obsessive-compulsive disorder. The majority of researchers believe that there is some type of abnormality with the  neurotransmitter   serotonin , among other possible psychological or biological abnormalities; however, it is possible that this activity is the brain's  response  to OCD, and not its cause.             This article  may contain  original research  or  unverified claims . Please  improve the article  by adding  references . See the  talk page  for details.  (January 2009)       Serotonin is thought to have a role in regulating anxiety, though it is also thought to be involved in such processes as  sleep  and  memory  function. In order to send chemical messages, serotonin must bind to the  receptor  sites located on the neighboring nerve cell. It is hypothesized that OCD sufferers may have blocked or damaged receptor sites that prevent serotonin from functioning to its full potential. This suggestion is supported by the fact that many OCD patients benefit from the use of  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  (SSRIs)a class of  antidepressant  medications that allow for more serotonin to be readily available to other nerve cells. [ 29 ]  For more about this class of drugs, see the  section about potential treatments  for OCD.   The  Stanford University School of Medicine  OCD webpage states, ""Although the causes of the disorder still elude us, the recent identification of children with OCD caused by an autoimmune response to  Group A streptococcal infection  promises to bring increased understanding of the disorder's pathogenesis."" [ 30 ]   Recent research has revealed a possible  genetic mutation  that could help to cause OCD. Researchers funded by the  National Institutes of Health  have found a  mutation  in the human serotonin transporter gene,  hSERT , in unrelated families with OCD. Moreover, in his study of identical twins, Rasmussen (1994) produced data that supported the idea that there is a ""heritable factor for neurotic anxiety"". [ 31 ]  In addition, he noted that environmental factors also play a role in how these anxiety symptoms are expressed. However, various studies on this topic are still being conducted and the presence of a genetic link is not yet definitely established.   Another possible genetic cause of OCD was discovered in August 2007 by scientists at  Duke University Medical Center  in North Carolina. They genetically engineered mice that lacked a  gene  called  SAPAP3 . This  protein  is highly expressed in the  striatum , an area of the  brain  linked to planning and the initiation of appropriate actions. The mice spent three times as much time grooming themselves as ordinary mice, to the point that their fur fell off. [ 32 ]   Using tools like  positron emission tomography  (PET scans), it has been shown that those with OCD tend to have brain activity that differs from those who do not have this disorder. [ 33 ]  A popular explanation for OCD is that offered in the book  Brain Lock  by Jeffrey Schwartz, which suggests that OCD is caused by the part of the brain that is responsible for translating complex intentions (e.g., ""I will pick up this cup"") into fundamental actions (e.g., ""move arm forward, rotate hand 15 degrees, etc."") failing to correctly communicate the chemical message that an action has been completed. This is perceived as a feeling of doubt and incompleteness, which then leads the individual to attempt to consciously deconstruct their own prior behaviora process which induces anxiety in most people, even those without OCD [ citation needed ] .   It has been theorized that a miscommunication between the  orbitofrontal cortex , the  caudate nucleus , and the  thalamus  may be a factor in the explanation of OCD. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is the first part of the brain to notice whether or not something is wrong. [ vague ]  When the OFC notices that something is wrong, it sends an initial ""worry signal"" to the thalamus. When the thalamus receives this signal, it in turn sends signals back to the OFC to interpret the worrying event. The caudate nucleus lies between the OFC and the thalamus and prevents the initial worry signal from being sent back to the thalamus after it has already been received. However, it is suggested that in those with OCD, the caudate nucleus does not function properly, and therefore does not prevent this initial signal from recurring. This causes the thalamus to become hyperactive and creates a virtually never-ending loop of worry signals being sent back and forth between the OFC and the thalamus. The OFC responds by increasing anxiety and engaging in  compulsive behaviors  in an attempt to relieve this apprehension. [ 29 ]  This overactivity of the OFC is shown to be attenuated in patients who have successfully responded to  SSRI  medication. The increased stimulation of the  serotonin  receptors  5-HT2A  and  5-HT2C  in the OFC is believed to cause this inhibition.  [ 34 ]   Some research has discovered an association between a type of size abnormality in different  brain structures  and the predisposition to develop OCD. Through the use of  magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI), researchers at  Cambridge's Brain Mapping Unit  were able to discover distinctive patterns in the brain structure of individuals with OCD and their close family members.  [ 35 ]  This is the first instance in which it has been demonstrated that those with a familial risk of developing OCD have anatomical differences when compared with ordinary individuals. The discovery of these structural differences in the area of the brain associated with stopping  motor response  may ultimately aid researchers who seek to determine which genes contribute to the development of OCD.   In some patients, the consumption of  caffeine  may make OCD symptoms worse.  [ 36 ]     [ edit ]   Demographics and other statistics   In a 1980 study of 20,000 adults from  New Haven ,  Baltimore ,  St. Louis ,  Durham , and  Los Angeles , the lifetime prevalence rate of OCD for both sexes was recorded at 2.5 percent. Education also appears to be a factor. The lifetime prevalence of OCD is lower for those who have graduated high school than for those who have not (1.9 percent versus 3.4 percent). However, in the case of college education, lifetime prevalence is higher for those who graduate with a degree (3.1 percent) than it is for those who have only some college background (2.4 percent). As far as age is concerned, the onset of OCD usually ranges from the late teenage years until the mid-20s in both sexes, but the age of onset tends to be slightly younger in males than in females. [ 37 ]   It has been alleged that sufferers are generally of above-average  intelligence , as the very nature of the disorder necessitates complicated thinking patterns [ 38 ] .     [ edit ]   Treatment   According to the Expert Consensus Guidelines for the Treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder,  behavioral therapy  (BT),  cognitive therapy  (CT), and  medications  are first-line treatments for OCD.  Psychodynamic psychotherapy  may help in managing some aspects of the disorder, but there are no controlled studies that demonstrate effectiveness of  psychoanalysis  or  dynamic psychotherapy  in OCD. [ 39 ]     [ edit ]   Behavioral therapy   The specific technique used in BT/CBT is called  exposure and ritual prevention  (also known as "" exposure and response prevention "") or ERP; this involves gradually learning to tolerate the anxiety associated with not performing the ritual behavior. At first, for example, someone might touch something only very mildly ""contaminated"" (such as a tissue that has been touched by another tissue that has been touched by the end of a toothpick that has touched a book that came from a ""contaminated"" location, such as a school.) That is the ""exposure"". The ""ritual prevention"" is not washing. Another example might be leaving the house and checking the lock only once (exposure) without going back and checking again (ritual prevention). The person fairly quickly  habituates  to the anxiety-producing situation and discovers that their anxiety level has dropped considerably; they can then progress to touching something more ""contaminated"" or not checking the lock at allagain, without performing the ritual behavior of washing or checking.   Exposure ritual/response prevention has been demonstrated to be the most effective treatment for OCD. It has generally been accepted that  psychotherapy , in combination with  psychotropic medication , is more effective than either option alone. However, more recent studies have shown no difference in outcomes for those treated with the combination of medicine and CBT versus CBT alone. [ 40 ]   Recently it has been reported simultaneous administration of D-Cycloserin (an antibiotic) substantially improves effectiveness of Exposure and Response prevention. [ 41 ]     [ edit ]   Medication   Medications as treatment include  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  (SSRIs) such as  paroxetine (Seroxat, Paxil, Xetanor, ParoMerck, Rexetin) ,  sertraline (Zoloft, Stimuloton) ,  fluoxetine (Prozac, Bioxetin) ,  escitalopram  (Lexapro), and  fluvoxamine (Luvox)  as well as the  tricyclic antidepressants , in particular  clomipramine (Anafranil) . SSRIs prevent excess  serotonin  from being pumped back into the original  neuron  that released it. Instead, serotonin can then bind to the  receptor  sites of nearby neurons and send chemical messages or signals that can help regulate the excessive  anxiety  and obsessive thoughts. In some treatment-resistant cases, a combination of  clomipramine  and an SSRI has shown to be effective even when neither drug on its own has been efficacious.   Benzodiazepines  are also used in treatment. It's not uncommon to administer this class of drugs during the ""latency period"" for SSRIs or as synergistic adjunct long-term. Although widely prescribed, benzodiazepines have not been demonstrated as an effective treatment for OCD and may be habit-forming in those with a history of substance abuse. [ 42 ]   Serotonergic   antidepressants  typically take longer to show benefit in OCD than with most other disorders which they are used to treat, as it is common for 23 months to elapse before any tangible improvement is noticed. In addition to this, the treatment usually requires high doses.  Fluoxetine , for example, is usually prescribed in doses of 20 mg per day for clinical depression, whereas with OCD the dose will often range from 20 mg to 80 mg or higher, if necessary. In most cases  antidepressant therapy  alone will only provide a partial reduction in symptoms, even in cases that are not deemed treatment-resistant. Much current research is devoted to the therapeutic potential of the agents that effect the release of the neurotransmitter  glutamate  or the binding to its receptors. These include  riluzole ,  memantine ,  gabapentin (Neurontin)  and  lamotrigine (Lamictal) .   Low doses of the newer  atypical antipsychotics   olanzapine (Zyprexa) ,  quetiapine (Seroquel) ,  ziprasidone  and  risperidone (Risperdal)  have also been found to be useful as adjuncts in the treatment of OCD. The use of  antipsychotics  in OCD must be undertaken carefully, however, since, although there is very strong evidence that at low doses they are beneficial (most likely due to their  dopamine receptor   antagonism ), at high doses these same antipsychotics have proven to cause dramatic obsessive-compulsive symptoms even in those patients who do not normally have OCD. This can be due to the antagonism of  5-HT2A receptors  becoming very prominent at these doses and outweighing the benefits of  dopamine  antagonism. However antidepressant mirtazapine which is a 5-HT2A antagonist has shown to be of benefit to OCD patients [ 43 ] . Another point that must be noted with antipsychotic treatment is that SSRIs inhibit the chief  enzyme  that is responsible for  metabolising  antipsychotics CYP2D6 so the dose will be effectively higher than expected when these are combined with SSRIs. Also, it must be noted that antipsychotic treatment should be considered as augmentation treatment when SSRI treatment does not bring positive results.     [ edit ]   Alternative drug treatments   The naturally occurring sugar  inositol  has been suggested as a treatment for OCD [ 44 ] , as it appears to modulate the actions of serotonin and reverse  desensitisation  of  neurotransmitter  receptors.  St John's Wort  has been claimed to be of benefit due to its (non-selective) serotonin re-uptake inhibiting qualities [ citations needed ] , although a double-blind study using a flexible-dose schedule (600-1800 mg/day) found no difference between St John's Wort and a placebo [ 45 ] .   Nutrition deficiencies  may also contribute to OCD and other  mental disorders .  Vitamin  and mineral supplements may aid in such disorders and provide  nutrients  necessary for proper mental functioning [ 46 ] .   Opioids  may significantly reduce OCD symptoms, though their use is not sanctioned for treatment due to  physical dependence  and long term drug tolerance [ citations needed ] . Tramadol is an atypical opioid that appears to provide the anti-OCD effects of an  opiate  and inhibit the  re-uptake  of serotonin (in addition to  norepinephrine ) [ 47 ] .   Tryptamine   alkaloid   psilocybin  has been attempted as treatment [ 48 ] . There are reports that other  hallucinogens  such as  LSD  and  peyote  have produced similar effects [ citations needed ] . It has been hypothesised that this effect may be due to stimulation of  5-HT2A receptors  and, less significantly,  5-HT2C receptors ; this causes an inhibitory effect on the  orbitofrontal cortex , an area of the brain in which  hyperactivity  has been strongly associated with OCD [ 49 ] .   Regular  nicotine  treatment may ameliorate symptoms of OCD, although the  pharmacodynamical  mechanism by which this is achieved is not yet known, and more detailed studies are needed to fully confirm this  hypothesis [ 50 ] .     [ edit ]   Psycho-surgery   For some, neither medication, support groups nor psychological treatments are helpful in alleviating obsessive-compulsive symptoms. These patients may choose to undergo  psychosurgery  as a last resort. In this procedure, a surgical  lesion  is made in an area of the brain (the  cingulate bundle ). In one study, 30% of participants benefited significantly from this procedure. [ 8 ]   Deep-brain stimulation  and  vagus nerve stimulation  are possible surgical options which do not require the destruction of  brain tissue , although their efficacy has not been conclusively demonstrated.   In the US, psychosurgery for OCD is a treatment of last resort and will not be performed until the patient has failed several attempts at medication (at the full dosage) with augmentation, and many months of intensive  cognitive-behavioral therapy  with exposure and ritual/response prevention. [ 51 ]  Likewise, in the UK, psychosurgery cannot be performed unless a course of treatment from a suitably qualified cognitive-behavioural therapist has been carried out.     [ edit ]   Neuropsychiatry   Main article:  Neuropsychiatry   OCD primarily involves the  brain regions  of the  striatum , the  orbitofrontal cortex  and the  cingulate cortex . OCD involves several different  receptors , mostly  H 2 ,  M 4 ,  NK 1 ,  NMDA , and non-NMDA  glutamate receptors . [ citation needed ]  The receptors  5-HT 1D ,  5-HT 2C , and the   opioid receptor  exert a secondary effect. The H 2 , M 4 , NK 1 , and  non-NMDA glutamate  receptors are active in the striatum, whereas the  NMDA receptors  are active in the cingulate cortex.   The activity of certain receptors is positively correlated to the severity of OCD, whereas the activity of certain other receptors is negatively correlated to the severity of OCD. Correlations where activity is positively correlated to severity include the histamine receptor ( H 2 ); the Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor( M 4 ); the Tachykinin receptor ( NK 1 ); and non-NMDA  glutamate receptors . Correlations where activity is negatively correlated to severity include the NMDA receptor ( NMDA ); the Mu opioid receptor (  opioid ); and two types of 5-HT receptors ( 5-HT 1D  and  5-HT 2C ) The central dysfunction of OCD may involve the receptors nk1, non-NMDA  glutamate  receptors, and NMDA, whereas the other receptors could simply exert secondary modulatory effects.   Pharmaceuticals that act directly on those core mechanisms are  aprepitant  (nk1 antagonist),  riluzole  (glutamate release inhibitor), and  tautomycin  (NMDA receptor sensitizer). Also, the anti-Alzheimer's drug  memantine  is being studied by the  OC Foundation  in its efficacy in reducing OCD symptoms due to it being an  NMDA antagonist . One case study published in  The American Journal of Psychiatry  suggests that ""memantine may be an option for treatment-resistant OCD, but controlled studies are needed to substantiate this observation."" [ 52 ]  The drugs that are popularly used to fight OCD lack full efficacy because they do not act upon what are believed to be the core mechanisms. Many trials are currently underway to investigate the efficacy of a variety of agents that affect these 'core' neurotransmitters, particularly glutamatergic agents. [2]     [ edit ]   Notable cases     British poet, essayist, and lexicographer  Samuel Johnson  is an example of a historical figure with a  retrospective diagnosis  of OCD. He had elaborate rituals for crossing the thresholds of doorways, repeatedly walked up and down staircases counting the steps, and had compulsions regarding repetitive prayer which were most likely a form of religious scrupulosity. [ 53 ] [ 54 ] [ 55 ]       American aviator and filmmaker  Howard Hughes  is known to have suffered from OCD and it is believed that his mother may have also been a sufferer. Friends of Hughes have mentioned his obsession with minor flaws in clothing and he is reported to have had a great fear of germs, common among OCD patients. [ 56 ]  He did also suffer from Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) due to an aviation accident in which he was severely injured. This resulted in him becoming reclusive later in life.       English footballer  David Beckham  has been outspoken regarding his struggle with OCD. He has told media that he has to count all his clothes, and that magazines have to lie in a straight line. No more than three soda cans are allowed in his refrigerator, and if there are any more at home they have to be placed in a cupboard. He has explained that the reason he gets more tattoos is that he feels addicted to the pain of the needle. In hotels, any books that are on a shelf must be placed in the drawer. He has expressed a desire to get help for his problems.

For other uses, see  OCD (disambiguation) .       Obsessive-compulsive disorder   Classification and external resources       ICD - 10   F 42.       Obsessive-compulsive disorder  ( OCD ) is a  mental disorder  most commonly characterized by  intrusive , repetitive thoughts resulting in  compulsive behaviors  and mental acts that the person feels driven to perform, according to rules that must be applied rigidly, aimed at reducing  anxiety  by preventing some dreaded event or by resolving a more nebulous sense of tension. However, the likelihood that a dreaded event will occur, or the causal relationship between the performance of compulsions and the reduction of this likelihood, tends to be imagined or exaggerated.   OCD is the fourth most common mental disorder and is nearly as common as  asthma  and  diabetes mellitus . [ 1 ]  In the  United States , one in 50 adults has OCD. [ 2 ]  In severe cases, it affects a person's ability to function in everyday activities. The disorder often has a serious impact on the sufferer's (and their family's)  quality of life . Also, the psychological self-awareness of the  irrationality  of the disorder can be painful. For people with severe OCD, it may take several hours a day to carry out the compulsive acts.   The phrase ""obsessive-compulsive"" has become part of the English lexicon, and is often used in an informal or caricatured manner to describe someone who is meticulous,  perfectionistic , absorbed in a cause, or otherwise fixated on something or someone. [ 3 ]  Although these signs are often present in OCD, a person who exhibits them does not necessarily have OCD, and may instead have  obsessive-compulsive  personality  disorder  (OCPD) or some other condition.

The Quick Reference to the diagnostic criteria from DSM-IV-TR (2000) [ 4 ]  states six characteristics of obsessions and compulsions:     Obsessions       Recurrent and persistent thoughts,  impulses , or images that are experienced as intrusive and that cause marked anxiety or distress.   The thoughts, impulses, or images are not simply excessive worries about real-life problems.   The person attempts to ignore or suppress such thoughts, impulses, or images, or to neutralize them with some other thought or action.   The person recognizes that the obsessional thoughts, impulses, or images are a product of his or her own mind, and are not based in reality.       Compulsions       Repetitive behaviors or mental acts that the person feels driven to perform in response to an obsession, or according to rules that must be applied rigidly.   The behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing distress or preventing some dreaded event or situation; however, these behaviors or mental acts are not actually connected to the issue, or they are excessive.     In addition to these criteria, at some point during the course of the disorder, the individual must realize that his/her obsessions or compulsions are unreasonable or excessive. Moreover, the obsessions or compulsions must be time-consuming (taking up more than one hour per day), cause distress, or cause impairment in social, occupational, or school functioning. [ 4 ]  OCD often causes feelings similar to those of  depression .     [ edit ]   Symptoms and prevalence   OCD manifests in a variety of forms. Studies have placed the prevalence between one and three percent, although the prevalence of clinically recognized OCD is much lower, suggesting that many individuals with the disorder may not be diagnosed. [ 5 ]  The fact that many individuals do not seek treatment may be due in part to  stigma  associated with OCD. Another reason for not seeking treatment is that many sufferers of OCD do not realize that they have the condition.   The typical OCD sufferer performs tasks (or  compulsions ) to seek relief from obsession-related anxiety. To others, these tasks may appear odd and unnecessary. But for the sufferer, such tasks can feel critically important, and must be performed in particular ways to ward off dire consequences and to stop the  stress  from building up. Examples of these tasks are repeatedly checking that one's parked car has been locked before leaving it, turning lights on and off a set number of times before exiting a room, repeatedly washing hands at regular intervals throughout the day, touching objects a certain number of times before leaving a room, or walking in a certain routine way. Physical symptoms may include those brought on from anxieties and unwanted thoughts, as well as  tics  or  Parkinson's disease -like symptoms: rigidity, tremor, jerking arm movements, or involuntary movements of the limbs.   Formal diagnosis may be performed by a  psychologist , a  psychiatrist  or  psychoanalyst . OCD sufferers are aware that their thoughts and behavior are not rational, [ 6 ]  but they feel bound to comply with them to fend off feelings of panic or dread. Although everyone may experience unpleasant thoughts at one time or another, these are short-lived and fade away in time. [ 7 ]  For people with OCD, the thoughts are intrusive and persistent, and can cause them great anxiety and distress. [ 8 ]   Intrusive thoughts  are unwelcome, involuntary thoughts, images or unpleasant ideas that may become  obsessions , are upsetting or distressing, and can be difficult to be free of and manage. [ 9 ]  As with other forms of OCD, the awareness of the irrationality of these thoughts can be frustrating as the individual wishes to stop them but cannot. Intrusive thoughts, urges, and images are of inappropriate things at inappropriate times, usually falling into three categories: inappropriate aggressive thoughts, inappropriate sexual thoughts, and blasphemous religious thoughts. [ 10 ]  Most people experience these thoughts; when they are associated with OCD or  depression , they may become paralyzing,  anxiety -provoking, and persistent. Many people experience the type of unpleasant or unwanted thoughts that people with more troubling intrusive thoughts have, but most people are able to dismiss these thoughts. [ 9 ]  When intrusive thoughts co-occur with OCD, patients are less capable of ignoring the unpleasant thoughts and may pay undue attention to them, causing the thoughts to become more frequent and distressing. [ 9 ]   The common underlying theme to the diverse intrusive thoughts is summarised by Bruce  et al  with the example, ""What if I were to snap, lose control of myself, and do something totally uncharacteristic of me--perhaps even without my knowing it--that results in harm to myself or someone else?"" [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   OCD without Overt compulsions   A major subtype of OCD is OCD without overt compulsions. [ 12 ]  OCD without overt compulsions is often referred to as ""pure-O"" by laymen and sufferers of this disorder. The term is a bit of a misnomer, however, since OCD without overt compulsions is no more ""pure"" than any other form of OCD. Nonetheless, OCD without overt compulsions represents a major subtype of OCD with some of the estimates as high 50-60%. [ 13 ]  Rather than engaging in observable rituals and compulsions, the person with OCD without overt compulsions engages in all manner of mental neutralizing behaviours (i.e. ""covert"" compulsions).   Intrusive thoughts may involve violent obsessions about hurting others or oneself. [ 14 ]  They can include such thoughts as harming an innocent child, jumping from a bridge, mountain or the top of a tall building, urges to jump in front of a train or automobile, and urges to push another in front of a train or automobile. [ 10 ]  A survey of healthy college students found that virtually all of them had intrusive thoughts from time to time, including imagining or wishing harm upon a family member or friend, impulses to attack or kill a small child, or animal, or shout something rude or violent. [ 15 ]   The possibility that most patients suffering from intrusive thoughts will ever act on those thoughts is low; patients who are experiencing intense guilt, anxiety, shame, and anger over bad thoughts are different from those who actually act on bad thoughts. The history of violent crime is dominated by those who feel no guilt or remorse; the very fact that someone is tormented by intrusive thoughts, and has never acted on them before, is an excellent predictor that they won't act upon the thoughts. According to Baer, a patient should be concerned that intrusive thoughts are dangerous if the person doesn't feel upset by the thoughts, rather finds them pleasurable; has ever acted on violent or sexual thoughts or urges; hears voices or sees things that others don't see; or feels uncontrollable irresistible anger. [ 16 ]   Sexual obsessions may involve intrusive thoughts or images of ""kissing, hugging a lot, touching, fondling, oral sex, anal sex, intercourse, and rape"" with ""strangers, acquaintances, parents, children, family members, friends, coworkers, animals and religious figures"", involving ""heterosexual or homosexual content"" with persons of any age. [ 17 ]  Like other intrusive, unpleasant thoughts or images, most people have some inappropriate sexual thoughts at times, but people with OCD may attach significance to the unwanted sexual thoughts, generating anxiety and distress. The doubt that accompanies OCD leads to uncertainty regarding whether one might act on the bad thoughts, resulting in self-criticism or loathing. [ 17 ]     [ edit ]   OCD with Overt Compulsions   Other major subtypes of OCD frequently revolve around washing or checking; some sufferers may fear the presence of human body secretions such as saliva, blood, semen, sweat, tears, vomit, or mucus, or excretions such as urine or feces. Some OCD sufferers even fear that the soap they are using is contaminated. [ 18 ]  These anxiety-driven fears often result in various compulsive cleaning behaviours, and may cause a person to experience significant distress, which may make it difficult for a person with OCD to tolerate a workplace, venture into public locations, or conduct normal social relationships.   Symptoms related to performing tasks may include repeated hand washing [ 19 ]  or clearing of the throat; specific counting systems or counting of steps; doing repetitive actionsmore generally, this can involve an obsession with numbers or types of numbers (e.g., odd numbers). For example, when somebody suffering from OCD leaves the house, they might tap the door knob 9 times and if they don't they will go into distress, panic and even at certain times, they will pass out. These obsessive behaviors can cause individuals to feel psychological distress, because they are very concerned about having ""made mistakes"" in the number of steps that they have taken, or the number of stairs on a staircase. For some people with OCD, these obsessive counting and re-counting tasks, along with the attendant anxiety and fear, can take hours of each day, which can make it hard for the person to fulfill their work, family, or social roles. In some cases, these behaviors can also cause adverse physical symptoms: people who obsessively wash their hands with  antibacterial soap  and hot water (to remove germs) can make their skin red and raw with  dermatitis . [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Related conditions   OCD is often confused with the separate condition  obsessive-compulsive personality disorder . The two are not the same condition, however. OCD is  ego  dystonic , meaning that the disorder is incompatible with the sufferer's self-concept.  [ 20 ] [ 21 ]  Because disorders that are ego dystonic go against an individual's perception of his/herself, they tend to cause much distress. OCPD, on the other hand, is  ego syntonic marked by the individual's acceptance that the characteristics displayed as a result of this disorder are compatible with his/her self-image. Ego syntonic disorders understandably cause no distress. Persons suffering from OCD are often aware that their behavior is not rational and are unhappy about their obsessions but nevertheless feel compelled by them. Persons with OCPD are not aware of anything abnormal about themselves; they will readily explain why their actions are rational, and it is usually impossible to convince them otherwise. Persons with OCD are ridden with  anxiety ; persons who suffer from OCPD, by contrast, tend to derive pleasure from their obsessions or compulsions. [ 22 ]  This is a significant difference between these disorders.   Equally frequently, these rationalizations do not apply to the overall behavior, but to each instance individually; for example, a person compulsively checking their front door may argue that the time taken and stress caused by one more check of the front door is considerably less than the time and stress associated with being robbed, and thus the check is the better option. In practice, after that check, the individual is  still  not sure, and it is  still  better in terms of time and stress to do one more check, and this reasoning can continue as long as necessary.   Some OCD sufferers exhibit what is known as  overvalued ideas . In such cases, the person with OCD will truly be uncertain whether the fears that cause them to perform their compulsions are irrational or not. After some discussion, it is possible to convince the individual that their fears may be unfounded. It may be more difficult to do  ERP therapy  on such patients, because they may be, at least initially, unwilling to cooperate. For this reason OCD has often been likened to a disease of pathological doubt, in which the sufferer, while not usually  delusional , is often unable to realize fully what sorts of dreaded events are reasonably possible and which are not. There are severe cases when the sufferer has an unshakeable belief within the context of OCD which is difficult to differentiate from psychosis. [ 23 ]   OCD is different from behaviors such as  gambling  addiction and  overeating . People with these disorders typically experience at least some pleasure from their activity; OCD sufferers do not actively want to perform their compulsive tasks, and experience no pleasure from doing so. OCD is placed in the anxiety class of  mental illness , but like many  chronic stress disorders  it can lead to  clinical depression  over time. The constant stress of the condition can cause sufferers to develop a deadening of spirit, a numbing frustration, or sense of hopelessness. OCD's effects on day-to-day lifeparticularly its substantial consumption of timecan produce difficulties with work, finances and relationships. There is no known cure for OCD as of yet, but there are a number of successful treatment options available.     [ edit ]   Related/Spectrum disorders   People with OCD may be diagnosed with other conditions, such as  generalized anxiety disorder ,  anorexia nervosa ,  social anxiety disorder ,  bulimia nervosa ,  Tourette syndrome ,  Asperger syndrome ,  compulsive skin picking ,  body dysmorphic disorder ,  trichotillomania , and (as already mentioned)  obsessive-compulsive personality disorder . There is some research demonstrating a link between  drug addiction  and OCD as well. Many who suffer from OCD also suffer from  panic attacks . There is a higher risk of drug addiction among those with any anxiety disorder (possibly as a way of  coping  with the heightened levels of  anxiety ), but drug addiction among OCD patients may serve as a type of  compulsive behavior  and not just as a coping mechanism.  Depression  is also extremely prevalent among sufferers of OCD. One explanation for the high depression rate among OCD populations was posited by Mineka, Watson, and Clark (1998), who explained that people with OCD (or any other  anxiety disorder ) may feel depressed because of an ""out of control"" type of feeling. [ 24 ]   Some cases are thought to be caused at least in part by childhood  streptococcal  infections and are termed  PANDAS  (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infections). The streptococcal  antibodies  become involved in an  autoimmune  process. Though this idea is not set in stone, if it does prove to be true, there is cause to believe that OCD can to some very small extent be ""caught"" via exposure to strep throat (just as one may catch a cold). However, if OCD is caused by bacteria, this provides hope that  antibiotics  may eventually be used to treat or prevent it. [ 25 ]     [ edit ]   Causes     [ edit ]   Psychological   Scientists studying obsessive-compulsive disorder generally agree that both psychological and biological factors play a role in causing the disorder, although they differ in their degree of emphasis upon either type of factor.   From the 14th to the 16th century in Europe, it was believed that people who experienced blasphemous, sexual, or other obsessive thoughts were  possessed  by the  Devil . [ 26 ]  Based on this reasoning, treatment involved banishing the ""evil"" from the ""possessed"" person through  exorcism . [ 27 ]  In the early 1910s,  Sigmund Freud  attributed obsessive-compulsive behavior to unconscious conflicts which manifested as symptoms. [ 27 ]  Freud describes the clinical history of a typical case of ""touching phobia"" as starting in early childhood, when the person has a strong desire to touch an item. In response, the person develops an ""external prohibition"" against this type of touching. However, this ""prohibition does not succeed in abolishing"" the desire to touch; all it can do is repress the desire and ""force it into the unconscious"". [ 28 ]   The cognitive-behavioral model suggests that compulsive behaviour is carried out to remove anxiety-provoking intrusive thoughts. Unfortunately this only brings about temporary relief as the thought re-emerges. Each time the behaviour occurs it is negatively reinforced (see  Reinforcement ) by the relief from anxiety, thereby explaining why the dysfunctional activity increases and generalises (extends to other, related stimuli) over a period of time. For example, after touching a door-knob a person might have the thought that they may develop a disease as a result of contamination. They then experience anxiety, which is relieved when they wash their hands. This might be followed by the thought ""but did I wash them properly?"" causing an increase in anxiety once more, the hand-washing once again rewarded by the removal of anxiety (albeit briefly) and the cycle being repeated when thoughts of contamination re-occur. The distressing thoughts might then spread to fear of contamination from e.g. a chair (someone might have touched the chair after touching the door handle).     [ edit ]   Biological   There are many different theories about the cause of obsessive-compulsive disorder. The majority of researchers believe that there is some type of abnormality with the  neurotransmitter   serotonin , among other possible psychological or biological abnormalities; however, it is possible that this activity is the brain's  response  to OCD, and not its cause.             This article  may contain  original research  or  unverified claims . Please  improve the article  by adding  references . See the  talk page  for details.  (January 2009)       Serotonin is thought to have a role in regulating anxiety, though it is also thought to be involved in such processes as  sleep  and  memory  function. In order to send chemical messages, serotonin must bind to the  receptor  sites located on the neighboring nerve cell. It is hypothesized that OCD sufferers may have blocked or damaged receptor sites that prevent serotonin from functioning to its full potential. This suggestion is supported by the fact that many OCD patients benefit from the use of  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  (SSRIs)a class of  antidepressant  medications that allow for more serotonin to be readily available to other nerve cells. [ 29 ]  For more about this class of drugs, see the  section about potential treatments  for OCD.   The  Stanford University School of Medicine  OCD webpage states, ""Although the causes of the disorder still elude us, the recent identification of children with OCD caused by an autoimmune response to  Group A streptococcal infection  promises to bring increased understanding of the disorder's pathogenesis."" [ 30 ]   Recent research has revealed a possible  genetic mutation  that could help to cause OCD. Researchers funded by the  National Institutes of Health  have found a  mutation  in the human serotonin transporter gene,  hSERT , in unrelated families with OCD. Moreover, in his study of identical twins, Rasmussen (1994) produced data that supported the idea that there is a ""heritable factor for neurotic anxiety"". [ 31 ]  In addition, he noted that environmental factors also play a role in how these anxiety symptoms are expressed. However, various studies on this topic are still being conducted and the presence of a genetic link is not yet definitely established.   Another possible genetic cause of OCD was discovered in August 2007 by scientists at  Duke University Medical Center  in North Carolina. They genetically engineered mice that lacked a  gene  called  SAPAP3 . This  protein  is highly expressed in the  striatum , an area of the  brain  linked to planning and the initiation of appropriate actions. The mice spent three times as much time grooming themselves as ordinary mice, to the point that their fur fell off. [ 32 ]   Using tools like  positron emission tomography  (PET scans), it has been shown that those with OCD tend to have brain activity that differs from those who do not have this disorder. [ 33 ]  A popular explanation for OCD is that offered in the book  Brain Lock  by Jeffrey Schwartz, which suggests that OCD is caused by the part of the brain that is responsible for translating complex intentions (e.g., ""I will pick up this cup"") into fundamental actions (e.g., ""move arm forward, rotate hand 15 degrees, etc."") failing to correctly communicate the chemical message that an action has been completed. This is perceived as a feeling of doubt and incompleteness, which then leads the individual to attempt to consciously deconstruct their own prior behaviora process which induces anxiety in most people, even those without OCD [ citation needed ] .   It has been theorized that a miscommunication between the  orbitofrontal cortex , the  caudate nucleus , and the  thalamus  may be a factor in the explanation of OCD. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is the first part of the brain to notice whether or not something is wrong. [ vague ]  When the OFC notices that something is wrong, it sends an initial ""worry signal"" to the thalamus. When the thalamus receives this signal, it in turn sends signals back to the OFC to interpret the worrying event. The caudate nucleus lies between the OFC and the thalamus and prevents the initial worry signal from being sent back to the thalamus after it has already been received. However, it is suggested that in those with OCD, the caudate nucleus does not function properly, and therefore does not prevent this initial signal from recurring. This causes the thalamus to become hyperactive and creates a virtually never-ending loop of worry signals being sent back and forth between the OFC and the thalamus. The OFC responds by increasing anxiety and engaging in  compulsive behaviors  in an attempt to relieve this apprehension. [ 29 ]  This overactivity of the OFC is shown to be attenuated in patients who have successfully responded to  SSRI  medication. The increased stimulation of the  serotonin  receptors  5-HT2A  and  5-HT2C  in the OFC is believed to cause this inhibition.  [ 34 ]   Some research has discovered an association between a type of size abnormality in different  brain structures  and the predisposition to develop OCD. Through the use of  magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI), researchers at  Cambridge's Brain Mapping Unit  were able to discover distinctive patterns in the brain structure of individuals with OCD and their close family members.  [ 35 ]  This is the first instance in which it has been demonstrated that those with a familial risk of developing OCD have anatomical differences when compared with ordinary individuals. The discovery of these structural differences in the area of the brain associated with stopping  motor response  may ultimately aid researchers who seek to determine which genes contribute to the development of OCD.   In some patients, the consumption of  caffeine  may make OCD symptoms worse.  [ 36 ]     [ edit ]   Demographics and other statistics   In a 1980 study of 20,000 adults from  New Haven ,  Baltimore ,  St. Louis ,  Durham , and  Los Angeles , the lifetime prevalence rate of OCD for both sexes was recorded at 2.5 percent. Education also appears to be a factor. The lifetime prevalence of OCD is lower for those who have graduated high school than for those who have not (1.9 percent versus 3.4 percent). However, in the case of college education, lifetime prevalence is higher for those who graduate with a degree (3.1 percent) than it is for those who have only some college background (2.4 percent). As far as age is concerned, the onset of OCD usually ranges from the late teenage years until the mid-20s in both sexes, but the age of onset tends to be slightly younger in males than in females. [ 37 ]   It has been alleged that sufferers are generally of above-average  intelligence , as the very nature of the disorder necessitates complicated thinking patterns [ 38 ] .     [ edit ]   Treatment   According to the Expert Consensus Guidelines for the Treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder,  behavioral therapy  (BT),  cognitive therapy  (CT), and  medications  are first-line treatments for OCD.  Psychodynamic psychotherapy  may help in managing some aspects of the disorder, but there are no controlled studies that demonstrate effectiveness of  psychoanalysis  or  dynamic psychotherapy  in OCD. [ 39 ]     [ edit ]   Behavioral therapy   The specific technique used in BT/CBT is called  exposure and ritual prevention  (also known as "" exposure and response prevention "") or ERP; this involves gradually learning to tolerate the anxiety associated with not performing the ritual behavior. At first, for example, someone might touch something only very mildly ""contaminated"" (such as a tissue that has been touched by another tissue that has been touched by the end of a toothpick that has touched a book that came from a ""contaminated"" location, such as a school.) That is the ""exposure"". The ""ritual prevention"" is not washing. Another example might be leaving the house and checking the lock only once (exposure) without going back and checking again (ritual prevention). The person fairly quickly  habituates  to the anxiety-producing situation and discovers that their anxiety level has dropped considerably; they can then progress to touching something more ""contaminated"" or not checking the lock at allagain, without performing the ritual behavior of washing or checking.   Exposure ritual/response prevention has been demonstrated to be the most effective treatment for OCD. It has generally been accepted that  psychotherapy , in combination with  psychotropic medication , is more effective than either option alone. However, more recent studies have shown no difference in outcomes for those treated with the combination of medicine and CBT versus CBT alone. [ 40 ]   Recently it has been reported simultaneous administration of D-Cycloserin (an antibiotic) substantially improves effectiveness of Exposure and Response prevention. [ 41 ]     [ edit ]   Medication   Medications as treatment include  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  (SSRIs) such as  paroxetine (Seroxat, Paxil, Xetanor, ParoMerck, Rexetin) ,  sertraline (Zoloft, Stimuloton) ,  fluoxetine (Prozac, Bioxetin) ,  escitalopram  (Lexapro), and  fluvoxamine (Luvox)  as well as the  tricyclic antidepressants , in particular  clomipramine (Anafranil) . SSRIs prevent excess  serotonin  from being pumped back into the original  neuron  that released it. Instead, serotonin can then bind to the  receptor  sites of nearby neurons and send chemical messages or signals that can help regulate the excessive  anxiety  and obsessive thoughts. In some treatment-resistant cases, a combination of  clomipramine  and an SSRI has shown to be effective even when neither drug on its own has been efficacious.   Benzodiazepines  are also used in treatment. It's not uncommon to administer this class of drugs during the ""latency period"" for SSRIs or as synergistic adjunct long-term. Although widely prescribed, benzodiazepines have not been demonstrated as an effective treatment for OCD and may be habit-forming in those with a history of substance abuse. [ 42 ]   Serotonergic   antidepressants  typically take longer to show benefit in OCD than with most other disorders which they are used to treat, as it is common for 23 months to elapse before any tangible improvement is noticed. In addition to this, the treatment usually requires high doses.  Fluoxetine , for example, is usually prescribed in doses of 20 mg per day for clinical depression, whereas with OCD the dose will often range from 20 mg to 80 mg or higher, if necessary. In most cases  antidepressant therapy  alone will only provide a partial reduction in symptoms, even in cases that are not deemed treatment-resistant. Much current research is devoted to the therapeutic potential of the agents that effect the release of the neurotransmitter  glutamate  or the binding to its receptors. These include  riluzole ,  memantine ,  gabapentin (Neurontin)  and  lamotrigine (Lamictal) .   Low doses of the newer  atypical antipsychotics   olanzapine (Zyprexa) ,  quetiapine (Seroquel) ,  ziprasidone  and  risperidone (Risperdal)  have also been found to be useful as adjuncts in the treatment of OCD. The use of  antipsychotics  in OCD must be undertaken carefully, however, since, although there is very strong evidence that at low doses they are beneficial (most likely due to their  dopamine receptor   antagonism ), at high doses these same antipsychotics have proven to cause dramatic obsessive-compulsive symptoms even in those patients who do not normally have OCD. This can be due to the antagonism of  5-HT2A receptors  becoming very prominent at these doses and outweighing the benefits of  dopamine  antagonism. However antidepressant mirtazapine which is a 5-HT2A antagonist has shown to be of benefit to OCD patients [ 43 ] . Another point that must be noted with antipsychotic treatment is that SSRIs inhibit the chief  enzyme  that is responsible for  metabolising  antipsychotics CYP2D6 so the dose will be effectively higher than expected when these are combined with SSRIs. Also, it must be noted that antipsychotic treatment should be considered as augmentation treatment when SSRI treatment does not bring positive results.     [ edit ]   Alternative drug treatments   The naturally occurring sugar  inositol  has been suggested as a treatment for OCD [ 44 ] , as it appears to modulate the actions of serotonin and reverse  desensitisation  of  neurotransmitter  receptors.  St John's Wort  has been claimed to be of benefit due to its (non-selective) serotonin re-uptake inhibiting qualities [ citations needed ] , although a double-blind study using a flexible-dose schedule (600-1800 mg/day) found no difference between St John's Wort and a placebo [ 45 ] .   Nutrition deficiencies  may also contribute to OCD and other  mental disorders .  Vitamin  and mineral supplements may aid in such disorders and provide  nutrients  necessary for proper mental functioning [ 46 ] .   Opioids  may significantly reduce OCD symptoms, though their use is not sanctioned for treatment due to  physical dependence  and long term drug tolerance [ citations needed ] . Tramadol is an atypical opioid that appears to provide the anti-OCD effects of an  opiate  and inhibit the  re-uptake  of serotonin (in addition to  norepinephrine ) [ 47 ] .   Tryptamine   alkaloid   psilocybin  has been attempted as treatment [ 48 ] . There are reports that other  hallucinogens  such as  LSD  and  peyote  have produced similar effects [ citations needed ] . It has been hypothesised that this effect may be due to stimulation of  5-HT2A receptors  and, less significantly,  5-HT2C receptors ; this causes an inhibitory effect on the  orbitofrontal cortex , an area of the brain in which  hyperactivity  has been strongly associated with OCD [ 49 ] .   Regular  nicotine  treatment may ameliorate symptoms of OCD, although the  pharmacodynamical  mechanism by which this is achieved is not yet known, and more detailed studies are needed to fully confirm this  hypothesis [ 50 ] .     [ edit ]   Psycho-surgery   For some, neither medication, support groups nor psychological treatments are helpful in alleviating obsessive-compulsive symptoms. These patients may choose to undergo  psychosurgery  as a last resort. In this procedure, a surgical  lesion  is made in an area of the brain (the  cingulate bundle ). In one study, 30% of participants benefited significantly from this procedure. [ 8 ]   Deep-brain stimulation  and  vagus nerve stimulation  are possible surgical options which do not require the destruction of  brain tissue , although their efficacy has not been conclusively demonstrated.   In the US, psychosurgery for OCD is a treatment of last resort and will not be performed until the patient has failed several attempts at medication (at the full dosage) with augmentation, and many months of intensive  cognitive-behavioral therapy  with exposure and ritual/response prevention. [ 51 ]  Likewise, in the UK, psychosurgery cannot be performed unless a course of treatment from a suitably qualified cognitive-behavioural therapist has been carried out.     [ edit ]   Neuropsychiatry   Main article:  Neuropsychiatry   OCD primarily involves the  brain regions  of the  striatum , the  orbitofrontal cortex  and the  cingulate cortex . OCD involves several different  receptors , mostly  H 2 ,  M 4 ,  NK 1 ,  NMDA , and non-NMDA  glutamate receptors . [ citation needed ]  The receptors  5-HT 1D ,  5-HT 2C , and the   opioid receptor  exert a secondary effect. The H 2 , M 4 , NK 1 , and  non-NMDA glutamate  receptors are active in the striatum, whereas the  NMDA receptors  are active in the cingulate cortex.   The activity of certain receptors is positively correlated to the severity of OCD, whereas the activity of certain other receptors is negatively correlated to the severity of OCD. Correlations where activity is positively correlated to severity include the histamine receptor ( H 2 ); the Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor( M 4 ); the Tachykinin receptor ( NK 1 ); and non-NMDA  glutamate receptors . Correlations where activity is negatively correlated to severity include the NMDA receptor ( NMDA ); the Mu opioid receptor (  opioid ); and two types of 5-HT receptors ( 5-HT 1D  and  5-HT 2C ) The central dysfunction of OCD may involve the receptors nk1, non-NMDA  glutamate  receptors, and NMDA, whereas the other receptors could simply exert secondary modulatory effects.   Pharmaceuticals that act directly on those core mechanisms are  aprepitant  (nk1 antagonist),  riluzole  (glutamate release inhibitor), and  tautomycin  (NMDA receptor sensitizer). Also, the anti-Alzheimer's drug  memantine  is being studied by the  OC Foundation  in its efficacy in reducing OCD symptoms due to it being an  NMDA antagonist . One case study published in  The American Journal of Psychiatry  suggests that ""memantine may be an option for treatment-resistant OCD, but controlled studies are needed to substantiate this observation."" [ 52 ]  The drugs that are popularly used to fight OCD lack full efficacy because they do not act upon what are believed to be the core mechanisms. Many trials are currently underway to investigate the efficacy of a variety of agents that affect these 'core' neurotransmitters, particularly glutamatergic agents. [2]     [ edit ]   Notable cases     British poet, essayist, and lexicographer  Samuel Johnson  is an example of a historical figure with a  retrospective diagnosis  of OCD. He had elaborate rituals for crossing the thresholds of doorways, repeatedly walked up and down staircases counting the steps, and had compulsions regarding repetitive prayer which were most likely a form of religious scrupulosity. [ 53 ] [ 54 ] [ 55 ]       American aviator and filmmaker  Howard Hughes  is known to have suffered from OCD and it is believed that his mother may have also been a sufferer. Friends of Hughes have mentioned his obsession with minor flaws in clothing and he is reported to have had a great fear of germs, common among OCD patients. [ 56 ]  He did also suffer from Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) due to an aviation accident in which he was severely injured. This resulted in him becoming reclusive later in life.       English footballer  David Beckham  has been outspoken regarding his struggle with OCD. He has told media that he has to count all his clothes, and that magazines have to lie in a straight line. No more than three soda cans are allowed in his refrigerator, and if there are any more at home they have to be placed in a cupboard. He has explained that the reason he gets more tattoos is that he feels addicted to the pain of the needle. In hotels, any books that are on a shelf must be placed in the drawer. He has expressed a desire to get help for his problems.

For other uses, see  OCD (disambiguation) .       Obsessive-compulsive disorder   Classification and external resources       ICD - 10   F 42.       Obsessive-compulsive disorder  ( OCD ) is a  mental disorder  most commonly characterized by  intrusive , repetitive thoughts resulting in  compulsive behaviors  and mental acts that the person feels driven to perform, according to rules that must be applied rigidly, aimed at reducing  anxiety  by preventing some dreaded event or by resolving a more nebulous sense of tension. However, the likelihood that a dreaded event will occur, or the causal relationship between the performance of compulsions and the reduction of this likelihood, tends to be imagined or exaggerated.   OCD is the fourth most common mental disorder and is nearly as common as  asthma  and  diabetes mellitus . [ 1 ]  In the  United States , one in 50 adults has OCD. [ 2 ]  In severe cases, it affects a person's ability to function in everyday activities. The disorder often has a serious impact on the sufferer's (and their family's)  quality of life . Also, the psychological self-awareness of the  irrationality  of the disorder can be painful. For people with severe OCD, it may take several hours a day to carry out the compulsive acts.   The phrase ""obsessive-compulsive"" has become part of the English lexicon, and is often used in an informal or caricatured manner to describe someone who is meticulous,  perfectionistic , absorbed in a cause, or otherwise fixated on something or someone. [ 3 ]  Although these signs are often present in OCD, a person who exhibits them does not necessarily have OCD, and may instead have  obsessive-compulsive  personality  disorder  (OCPD) or some other condition.

The Quick Reference to the diagnostic criteria from DSM-IV-TR (2000) [ 4 ]  states six characteristics of obsessions and compulsions:     Obsessions       Recurrent and persistent thoughts,  impulses , or images that are experienced as intrusive and that cause marked anxiety or distress.   The thoughts, impulses, or images are not simply excessive worries about real-life problems.   The person attempts to ignore or suppress such thoughts, impulses, or images, or to neutralize them with some other thought or action.   The person recognizes that the obsessional thoughts, impulses, or images are a product of his or her own mind, and are not based in reality.       Compulsions       Repetitive behaviors or mental acts that the person feels driven to perform in response to an obsession, or according to rules that must be applied rigidly.   The behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing distress or preventing some dreaded event or situation; however, these behaviors or mental acts are not actually connected to the issue, or they are excessive.     In addition to these criteria, at some point during the course of the disorder, the individual must realize that his/her obsessions or compulsions are unreasonable or excessive. Moreover, the obsessions or compulsions must be time-consuming (taking up more than one hour per day), cause distress, or cause impairment in social, occupational, or school functioning. [ 4 ]  OCD often causes feelings similar to those of  depression .     [ edit ]   Symptoms and prevalence   OCD manifests in a variety of forms. Studies have placed the prevalence between one and three percent, although the prevalence of clinically recognized OCD is much lower, suggesting that many individuals with the disorder may not be diagnosed. [ 5 ]  The fact that many individuals do not seek treatment may be due in part to  stigma  associated with OCD. Another reason for not seeking treatment is that many sufferers of OCD do not realize that they have the condition.   The typical OCD sufferer performs tasks (or  compulsions ) to seek relief from obsession-related anxiety. To others, these tasks may appear odd and unnecessary. But for the sufferer, such tasks can feel critically important, and must be performed in particular ways to ward off dire consequences and to stop the  stress  from building up. Examples of these tasks are repeatedly checking that one's parked car has been locked before leaving it, turning lights on and off a set number of times before exiting a room, repeatedly washing hands at regular intervals throughout the day, touching objects a certain number of times before leaving a room, or walking in a certain routine way. Physical symptoms may include those brought on from anxieties and unwanted thoughts, as well as  tics  or  Parkinson's disease -like symptoms: rigidity, tremor, jerking arm movements, or involuntary movements of the limbs.   Formal diagnosis may be performed by a  psychologist , a  psychiatrist  or  psychoanalyst . OCD sufferers are aware that their thoughts and behavior are not rational, [ 6 ]  but they feel bound to comply with them to fend off feelings of panic or dread. Although everyone may experience unpleasant thoughts at one time or another, these are short-lived and fade away in time. [ 7 ]  For people with OCD, the thoughts are intrusive and persistent, and can cause them great anxiety and distress. [ 8 ]   Intrusive thoughts  are unwelcome, involuntary thoughts, images or unpleasant ideas that may become  obsessions , are upsetting or distressing, and can be difficult to be free of and manage. [ 9 ]  As with other forms of OCD, the awareness of the irrationality of these thoughts can be frustrating as the individual wishes to stop them but cannot. Intrusive thoughts, urges, and images are of inappropriate things at inappropriate times, usually falling into three categories: inappropriate aggressive thoughts, inappropriate sexual thoughts, and blasphemous religious thoughts. [ 10 ]  Most people experience these thoughts; when they are associated with OCD or  depression , they may become paralyzing,  anxiety -provoking, and persistent. Many people experience the type of unpleasant or unwanted thoughts that people with more troubling intrusive thoughts have, but most people are able to dismiss these thoughts. [ 9 ]  When intrusive thoughts co-occur with OCD, patients are less capable of ignoring the unpleasant thoughts and may pay undue attention to them, causing the thoughts to become more frequent and distressing. [ 9 ]   The common underlying theme to the diverse intrusive thoughts is summarised by Bruce  et al  with the example, ""What if I were to snap, lose control of myself, and do something totally uncharacteristic of me--perhaps even without my knowing it--that results in harm to myself or someone else?"" [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   OCD without Overt compulsions   A major subtype of OCD is OCD without overt compulsions. [ 12 ]  OCD without overt compulsions is often referred to as ""pure-O"" by laymen and sufferers of this disorder. The term is a bit of a misnomer, however, since OCD without overt compulsions is no more ""pure"" than any other form of OCD. Nonetheless, OCD without overt compulsions represents a major subtype of OCD with some of the estimates as high 50-60%. [ 13 ]  Rather than engaging in observable rituals and compulsions, the person with OCD without overt compulsions engages in all manner of mental neutralizing behaviours (i.e. ""covert"" compulsions).   Intrusive thoughts may involve violent obsessions about hurting others or oneself. [ 14 ]  They can include such thoughts as harming an innocent child, jumping from a bridge, mountain or the top of a tall building, urges to jump in front of a train or automobile, and urges to push another in front of a train or automobile. [ 10 ]  A survey of healthy college students found that virtually all of them had intrusive thoughts from time to time, including imagining or wishing harm upon a family member or friend, impulses to attack or kill a small child, or animal, or shout something rude or violent. [ 15 ]   The possibility that most patients suffering from intrusive thoughts will ever act on those thoughts is low; patients who are experiencing intense guilt, anxiety, shame, and anger over bad thoughts are different from those who actually act on bad thoughts. The history of violent crime is dominated by those who feel no guilt or remorse; the very fact that someone is tormented by intrusive thoughts, and has never acted on them before, is an excellent predictor that they won't act upon the thoughts. According to Baer, a patient should be concerned that intrusive thoughts are dangerous if the person doesn't feel upset by the thoughts, rather finds them pleasurable; has ever acted on violent or sexual thoughts or urges; hears voices or sees things that others don't see; or feels uncontrollable irresistible anger. [ 16 ]   Sexual obsessions may involve intrusive thoughts or images of ""kissing, hugging a lot, touching, fondling, oral sex, anal sex, intercourse, and rape"" with ""strangers, acquaintances, parents, children, family members, friends, coworkers, animals and religious figures"", involving ""heterosexual or homosexual content"" with persons of any age. [ 17 ]  Like other intrusive, unpleasant thoughts or images, most people have some inappropriate sexual thoughts at times, but people with OCD may attach significance to the unwanted sexual thoughts, generating anxiety and distress. The doubt that accompanies OCD leads to uncertainty regarding whether one might act on the bad thoughts, resulting in self-criticism or loathing. [ 17 ]     [ edit ]   OCD with Overt Compulsions   Other major subtypes of OCD frequently revolve around washing or checking; some sufferers may fear the presence of human body secretions such as saliva, blood, semen, sweat, tears, vomit, or mucus, or excretions such as urine or feces. Some OCD sufferers even fear that the soap they are using is contaminated. [ 18 ]  These anxiety-driven fears often result in various compulsive cleaning behaviours, and may cause a person to experience significant distress, which may make it difficult for a person with OCD to tolerate a workplace, venture into public locations, or conduct normal social relationships.   Symptoms related to performing tasks may include repeated hand washing [ 19 ]  or clearing of the throat; specific counting systems or counting of steps; doing repetitive actionsmore generally, this can involve an obsession with numbers or types of numbers (e.g., odd numbers). For example, when somebody suffering from OCD leaves the house, they might tap the door knob 9 times and if they don't they will go into distress, panic and even at certain times, they will pass out. These obsessive behaviors can cause individuals to feel psychological distress, because they are very concerned about having ""made mistakes"" in the number of steps that they have taken, or the number of stairs on a staircase. For some people with OCD, these obsessive counting and re-counting tasks, along with the attendant anxiety and fear, can take hours of each day, which can make it hard for the person to fulfill their work, family, or social roles. In some cases, these behaviors can also cause adverse physical symptoms: people who obsessively wash their hands with  antibacterial soap  and hot water (to remove germs) can make their skin red and raw with  dermatitis . [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Related conditions   OCD is often confused with the separate condition  obsessive-compulsive personality disorder . The two are not the same condition, however. OCD is  ego  dystonic , meaning that the disorder is incompatible with the sufferer's self-concept.  [ 20 ] [ 21 ]  Because disorders that are ego dystonic go against an individual's perception of his/herself, they tend to cause much distress. OCPD, on the other hand, is  ego syntonic marked by the individual's acceptance that the characteristics displayed as a result of this disorder are compatible with his/her self-image. Ego syntonic disorders understandably cause no distress. Persons suffering from OCD are often aware that their behavior is not rational and are unhappy about their obsessions but nevertheless feel compelled by them. Persons with OCPD are not aware of anything abnormal about themselves; they will readily explain why their actions are rational, and it is usually impossible to convince them otherwise. Persons with OCD are ridden with  anxiety ; persons who suffer from OCPD, by contrast, tend to derive pleasure from their obsessions or compulsions. [ 22 ]  This is a significant difference between these disorders.   Equally frequently, these rationalizations do not apply to the overall behavior, but to each instance individually; for example, a person compulsively checking their front door may argue that the time taken and stress caused by one more check of the front door is considerably less than the time and stress associated with being robbed, and thus the check is the better option. In practice, after that check, the individual is  still  not sure, and it is  still  better in terms of time and stress to do one more check, and this reasoning can continue as long as necessary.   Some OCD sufferers exhibit what is known as  overvalued ideas . In such cases, the person with OCD will truly be uncertain whether the fears that cause them to perform their compulsions are irrational or not. After some discussion, it is possible to convince the individual that their fears may be unfounded. It may be more difficult to do  ERP therapy  on such patients, because they may be, at least initially, unwilling to cooperate. For this reason OCD has often been likened to a disease of pathological doubt, in which the sufferer, while not usually  delusional , is often unable to realize fully what sorts of dreaded events are reasonably possible and which are not. There are severe cases when the sufferer has an unshakeable belief within the context of OCD which is difficult to differentiate from psychosis. [ 23 ]   OCD is different from behaviors such as  gambling  addiction and  overeating . People with these disorders typically experience at least some pleasure from their activity; OCD sufferers do not actively want to perform their compulsive tasks, and experience no pleasure from doing so. OCD is placed in the anxiety class of  mental illness , but like many  chronic stress disorders  it can lead to  clinical depression  over time. The constant stress of the condition can cause sufferers to develop a deadening of spirit, a numbing frustration, or sense of hopelessness. OCD's effects on day-to-day lifeparticularly its substantial consumption of timecan produce difficulties with work, finances and relationships. There is no known cure for OCD as of yet, but there are a number of successful treatment options available.     [ edit ]   Related/Spectrum disorders   People with OCD may be diagnosed with other conditions, such as  generalized anxiety disorder ,  anorexia nervosa ,  social anxiety disorder ,  bulimia nervosa ,  Tourette syndrome ,  Asperger syndrome ,  compulsive skin picking ,  body dysmorphic disorder ,  trichotillomania , and (as already mentioned)  obsessive-compulsive personality disorder . There is some research demonstrating a link between  drug addiction  and OCD as well. Many who suffer from OCD also suffer from  panic attacks . There is a higher risk of drug addiction among those with any anxiety disorder (possibly as a way of  coping  with the heightened levels of  anxiety ), but drug addiction among OCD patients may serve as a type of  compulsive behavior  and not just as a coping mechanism.  Depression  is also extremely prevalent among sufferers of OCD. One explanation for the high depression rate among OCD populations was posited by Mineka, Watson, and Clark (1998), who explained that people with OCD (or any other  anxiety disorder ) may feel depressed because of an ""out of control"" type of feeling. [ 24 ]   Some cases are thought to be caused at least in part by childhood  streptococcal  infections and are termed  PANDAS  (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infections). The streptococcal  antibodies  become involved in an  autoimmune  process. Though this idea is not set in stone, if it does prove to be true, there is cause to believe that OCD can to some very small extent be ""caught"" via exposure to strep throat (just as one may catch a cold). However, if OCD is caused by bacteria, this provides hope that  antibiotics  may eventually be used to treat or prevent it. [ 25 ]     [ edit ]   Causes     [ edit ]   Psychological   Scientists studying obsessive-compulsive disorder generally agree that both psychological and biological factors play a role in causing the disorder, although they differ in their degree of emphasis upon either type of factor.   From the 14th to the 16th century in Europe, it was believed that people who experienced blasphemous, sexual, or other obsessive thoughts were  possessed  by the  Devil . [ 26 ]  Based on this reasoning, treatment involved banishing the ""evil"" from the ""possessed"" person through  exorcism . [ 27 ]  In the early 1910s,  Sigmund Freud  attributed obsessive-compulsive behavior to unconscious conflicts which manifested as symptoms. [ 27 ]  Freud describes the clinical history of a typical case of ""touching phobia"" as starting in early childhood, when the person has a strong desire to touch an item. In response, the person develops an ""external prohibition"" against this type of touching. However, this ""prohibition does not succeed in abolishing"" the desire to touch; all it can do is repress the desire and ""force it into the unconscious"". [ 28 ]   The cognitive-behavioral model suggests that compulsive behaviour is carried out to remove anxiety-provoking intrusive thoughts. Unfortunately this only brings about temporary relief as the thought re-emerges. Each time the behaviour occurs it is negatively reinforced (see  Reinforcement ) by the relief from anxiety, thereby explaining why the dysfunctional activity increases and generalises (extends to other, related stimuli) over a period of time. For example, after touching a door-knob a person might have the thought that they may develop a disease as a result of contamination. They then experience anxiety, which is relieved when they wash their hands. This might be followed by the thought ""but did I wash them properly?"" causing an increase in anxiety once more, the hand-washing once again rewarded by the removal of anxiety (albeit briefly) and the cycle being repeated when thoughts of contamination re-occur. The distressing thoughts might then spread to fear of contamination from e.g. a chair (someone might have touched the chair after touching the door handle).     [ edit ]   Biological   There are many different theories about the cause of obsessive-compulsive disorder. The majority of researchers believe that there is some type of abnormality with the  neurotransmitter   serotonin , among other possible psychological or biological abnormalities; however, it is possible that this activity is the brain's  response  to OCD, and not its cause.             This article  may contain  original research  or  unverified claims . Please  improve the article  by adding  references . See the  talk page  for details.  (January 2009)       Serotonin is thought to have a role in regulating anxiety, though it is also thought to be involved in such processes as  sleep  and  memory  function. In order to send chemical messages, serotonin must bind to the  receptor  sites located on the neighboring nerve cell. It is hypothesized that OCD sufferers may have blocked or damaged receptor sites that prevent serotonin from functioning to its full potential. This suggestion is supported by the fact that many OCD patients benefit from the use of  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  (SSRIs)a class of  antidepressant  medications that allow for more serotonin to be readily available to other nerve cells. [ 29 ]  For more about this class of drugs, see the  section about potential treatments  for OCD.   The  Stanford University School of Medicine  OCD webpage states, ""Although the causes of the disorder still elude us, the recent identification of children with OCD caused by an autoimmune response to  Group A streptococcal infection  promises to bring increased understanding of the disorder's pathogenesis."" [ 30 ]   Recent research has revealed a possible  genetic mutation  that could help to cause OCD. Researchers funded by the  National Institutes of Health  have found a  mutation  in the human serotonin transporter gene,  hSERT , in unrelated families with OCD. Moreover, in his study of identical twins, Rasmussen (1994) produced data that supported the idea that there is a ""heritable factor for neurotic anxiety"". [ 31 ]  In addition, he noted that environmental factors also play a role in how these anxiety symptoms are expressed. However, various studies on this topic are still being conducted and the presence of a genetic link is not yet definitely established.   Another possible genetic cause of OCD was discovered in August 2007 by scientists at  Duke University Medical Center  in North Carolina. They genetically engineered mice that lacked a  gene  called  SAPAP3 . This  protein  is highly expressed in the  striatum , an area of the  brain  linked to planning and the initiation of appropriate actions. The mice spent three times as much time grooming themselves as ordinary mice, to the point that their fur fell off. [ 32 ]   Using tools like  positron emission tomography  (PET scans), it has been shown that those with OCD tend to have brain activity that differs from those who do not have this disorder. [ 33 ]  A popular explanation for OCD is that offered in the book  Brain Lock  by Jeffrey Schwartz, which suggests that OCD is caused by the part of the brain that is responsible for translating complex intentions (e.g., ""I will pick up this cup"") into fundamental actions (e.g., ""move arm forward, rotate hand 15 degrees, etc."") failing to correctly communicate the chemical message that an action has been completed. This is perceived as a feeling of doubt and incompleteness, which then leads the individual to attempt to consciously deconstruct their own prior behaviora process which induces anxiety in most people, even those without OCD [ citation needed ] .   It has been theorized that a miscommunication between the  orbitofrontal cortex , the  caudate nucleus , and the  thalamus  may be a factor in the explanation of OCD. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is the first part of the brain to notice whether or not something is wrong. [ vague ]  When the OFC notices that something is wrong, it sends an initial ""worry signal"" to the thalamus. When the thalamus receives this signal, it in turn sends signals back to the OFC to interpret the worrying event. The caudate nucleus lies between the OFC and the thalamus and prevents the initial worry signal from being sent back to the thalamus after it has already been received. However, it is suggested that in those with OCD, the caudate nucleus does not function properly, and therefore does not prevent this initial signal from recurring. This causes the thalamus to become hyperactive and creates a virtually never-ending loop of worry signals being sent back and forth between the OFC and the thalamus. The OFC responds by increasing anxiety and engaging in  compulsive behaviors  in an attempt to relieve this apprehension. [ 29 ]  This overactivity of the OFC is shown to be attenuated in patients who have successfully responded to  SSRI  medication. The increased stimulation of the  serotonin  receptors  5-HT2A  and  5-HT2C  in the OFC is believed to cause this inhibition.  [ 34 ]   Some research has discovered an association between a type of size abnormality in different  brain structures  and the predisposition to develop OCD. Through the use of  magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI), researchers at  Cambridge's Brain Mapping Unit  were able to discover distinctive patterns in the brain structure of individuals with OCD and their close family members.  [ 35 ]  This is the first instance in which it has been demonstrated that those with a familial risk of developing OCD have anatomical differences when compared with ordinary individuals. The discovery of these structural differences in the area of the brain associated with stopping  motor response  may ultimately aid researchers who seek to determine which genes contribute to the development of OCD.   In some patients, the consumption of  caffeine  may make OCD symptoms worse.  [ 36 ]     [ edit ]   Demographics and other statistics   In a 1980 study of 20,000 adults from  New Haven ,  Baltimore ,  St. Louis ,  Durham , and  Los Angeles , the lifetime prevalence rate of OCD for both sexes was recorded at 2.5 percent. Education also appears to be a factor. The lifetime prevalence of OCD is lower for those who have graduated high school than for those who have not (1.9 percent versus 3.4 percent). However, in the case of college education, lifetime prevalence is higher for those who graduate with a degree (3.1 percent) than it is for those who have only some college background (2.4 percent). As far as age is concerned, the onset of OCD usually ranges from the late teenage years until the mid-20s in both sexes, but the age of onset tends to be slightly younger in males than in females. [ 37 ]   It has been alleged that sufferers are generally of above-average  intelligence , as the very nature of the disorder necessitates complicated thinking patterns [ 38 ] .     [ edit ]   Treatment   According to the Expert Consensus Guidelines for the Treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder,  behavioral therapy  (BT),  cognitive therapy  (CT), and  medications  are first-line treatments for OCD.  Psychodynamic psychotherapy  may help in managing some aspects of the disorder, but there are no controlled studies that demonstrate effectiveness of  psychoanalysis  or  dynamic psychotherapy  in OCD. [ 39 ]     [ edit ]   Behavioral therapy   The specific technique used in BT/CBT is called  exposure and ritual prevention  (also known as "" exposure and response prevention "") or ERP; this involves gradually learning to tolerate the anxiety associated with not performing the ritual behavior. At first, for example, someone might touch something only very mildly ""contaminated"" (such as a tissue that has been touched by another tissue that has been touched by the end of a toothpick that has touched a book that came from a ""contaminated"" location, such as a school.) That is the ""exposure"". The ""ritual prevention"" is not washing. Another example might be leaving the house and checking the lock only once (exposure) without going back and checking again (ritual prevention). The person fairly quickly  habituates  to the anxiety-producing situation and discovers that their anxiety level has dropped considerably; they can then progress to touching something more ""contaminated"" or not checking the lock at allagain, without performing the ritual behavior of washing or checking.   Exposure ritual/response prevention has been demonstrated to be the most effective treatment for OCD. It has generally been accepted that  psychotherapy , in combination with  psychotropic medication , is more effective than either option alone. However, more recent studies have shown no difference in outcomes for those treated with the combination of medicine and CBT versus CBT alone. [ 40 ]   Recently it has been reported simultaneous administration of D-Cycloserin (an antibiotic) substantially improves effectiveness of Exposure and Response prevention. [ 41 ]     [ edit ]   Medication   Medications as treatment include  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  (SSRIs) such as  paroxetine (Seroxat, Paxil, Xetanor, ParoMerck, Rexetin) ,  sertraline (Zoloft, Stimuloton) ,  fluoxetine (Prozac, Bioxetin) ,  escitalopram  (Lexapro), and  fluvoxamine (Luvox)  as well as the  tricyclic antidepressants , in particular  clomipramine (Anafranil) . SSRIs prevent excess  serotonin  from being pumped back into the original  neuron  that released it. Instead, serotonin can then bind to the  receptor  sites of nearby neurons and send chemical messages or signals that can help regulate the excessive  anxiety  and obsessive thoughts. In some treatment-resistant cases, a combination of  clomipramine  and an SSRI has shown to be effective even when neither drug on its own has been efficacious.   Benzodiazepines  are also used in treatment. It's not uncommon to administer this class of drugs during the ""latency period"" for SSRIs or as synergistic adjunct long-term. Although widely prescribed, benzodiazepines have not been demonstrated as an effective treatment for OCD and may be habit-forming in those with a history of substance abuse. [ 42 ]   Serotonergic   antidepressants  typically take longer to show benefit in OCD than with most other disorders which they are used to treat, as it is common for 23 months to elapse before any tangible improvement is noticed. In addition to this, the treatment usually requires high doses.  Fluoxetine , for example, is usually prescribed in doses of 20 mg per day for clinical depression, whereas with OCD the dose will often range from 20 mg to 80 mg or higher, if necessary. In most cases  antidepressant therapy  alone will only provide a partial reduction in symptoms, even in cases that are not deemed treatment-resistant. Much current research is devoted to the therapeutic potential of the agents that effect the release of the neurotransmitter  glutamate  or the binding to its receptors. These include  riluzole ,  memantine ,  gabapentin (Neurontin)  and  lamotrigine (Lamictal) .   Low doses of the newer  atypical antipsychotics   olanzapine (Zyprexa) ,  quetiapine (Seroquel) ,  ziprasidone  and  risperidone (Risperdal)  have also been found to be useful as adjuncts in the treatment of OCD. The use of  antipsychotics  in OCD must be undertaken carefully, however, since, although there is very strong evidence that at low doses they are beneficial (most likely due to their  dopamine receptor   antagonism ), at high doses these same antipsychotics have proven to cause dramatic obsessive-compulsive symptoms even in those patients who do not normally have OCD. This can be due to the antagonism of  5-HT2A receptors  becoming very prominent at these doses and outweighing the benefits of  dopamine  antagonism. However antidepressant mirtazapine which is a 5-HT2A antagonist has shown to be of benefit to OCD patients [ 43 ] . Another point that must be noted with antipsychotic treatment is that SSRIs inhibit the chief  enzyme  that is responsible for  metabolising  antipsychotics CYP2D6 so the dose will be effectively higher than expected when these are combined with SSRIs. Also, it must be noted that antipsychotic treatment should be considered as augmentation treatment when SSRI treatment does not bring positive results.     [ edit ]   Alternative drug treatments   The naturally occurring sugar  inositol  has been suggested as a treatment for OCD [ 44 ] , as it appears to modulate the actions of serotonin and reverse  desensitisation  of  neurotransmitter  receptors.  St John's Wort  has been claimed to be of benefit due to its (non-selective) serotonin re-uptake inhibiting qualities [ citations needed ] , although a double-blind study using a flexible-dose schedule (600-1800 mg/day) found no difference between St John's Wort and a placebo [ 45 ] .   Nutrition deficiencies  may also contribute to OCD and other  mental disorders .  Vitamin  and mineral supplements may aid in such disorders and provide  nutrients  necessary for proper mental functioning [ 46 ] .   Opioids  may significantly reduce OCD symptoms, though their use is not sanctioned for treatment due to  physical dependence  and long term drug tolerance [ citations needed ] . Tramadol is an atypical opioid that appears to provide the anti-OCD effects of an  opiate  and inhibit the  re-uptake  of serotonin (in addition to  norepinephrine ) [ 47 ] .   Tryptamine   alkaloid   psilocybin  has been attempted as treatment [ 48 ] . There are reports that other  hallucinogens  such as  LSD  and  peyote  have produced similar effects [ citations needed ] . It has been hypothesised that this effect may be due to stimulation of  5-HT2A receptors  and, less significantly,  5-HT2C receptors ; this causes an inhibitory effect on the  orbitofrontal cortex , an area of the brain in which  hyperactivity  has been strongly associated with OCD [ 49 ] .   Regular  nicotine  treatment may ameliorate symptoms of OCD, although the  pharmacodynamical  mechanism by which this is achieved is not yet known, and more detailed studies are needed to fully confirm this  hypothesis [ 50 ] .     [ edit ]   Psycho-surgery   For some, neither medication, support groups nor psychological treatments are helpful in alleviating obsessive-compulsive symptoms. These patients may choose to undergo  psychosurgery  as a last resort. In this procedure, a surgical  lesion  is made in an area of the brain (the  cingulate bundle ). In one study, 30% of participants benefited significantly from this procedure. [ 8 ]   Deep-brain stimulation  and  vagus nerve stimulation  are possible surgical options which do not require the destruction of  brain tissue , although their efficacy has not been conclusively demonstrated.   In the US, psychosurgery for OCD is a treatment of last resort and will not be performed until the patient has failed several attempts at medication (at the full dosage) with augmentation, and many months of intensive  cognitive-behavioral therapy  with exposure and ritual/response prevention. [ 51 ]  Likewise, in the UK, psychosurgery cannot be performed unless a course of treatment from a suitably qualified cognitive-behavioural therapist has been carried out.     [ edit ]   Neuropsychiatry   Main article:  Neuropsychiatry   OCD primarily involves the  brain regions  of the  striatum , the  orbitofrontal cortex  and the  cingulate cortex . OCD involves several different  receptors , mostly  H 2 ,  M 4 ,  NK 1 ,  NMDA , and non-NMDA  glutamate receptors . [ citation needed ]  The receptors  5-HT 1D ,  5-HT 2C , and the   opioid receptor  exert a secondary effect. The H 2 , M 4 , NK 1 , and  non-NMDA glutamate  receptors are active in the striatum, whereas the  NMDA receptors  are active in the cingulate cortex.   The activity of certain receptors is positively correlated to the severity of OCD, whereas the activity of certain other receptors is negatively correlated to the severity of OCD. Correlations where activity is positively correlated to severity include the histamine receptor ( H 2 ); the Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor( M 4 ); the Tachykinin receptor ( NK 1 ); and non-NMDA  glutamate receptors . Correlations where activity is negatively correlated to severity include the NMDA receptor ( NMDA ); the Mu opioid receptor (  opioid ); and two types of 5-HT receptors ( 5-HT 1D  and  5-HT 2C ) The central dysfunction of OCD may involve the receptors nk1, non-NMDA  glutamate  receptors, and NMDA, whereas the other receptors could simply exert secondary modulatory effects.   Pharmaceuticals that act directly on those core mechanisms are  aprepitant  (nk1 antagonist),  riluzole  (glutamate release inhibitor), and  tautomycin  (NMDA receptor sensitizer). Also, the anti-Alzheimer's drug  memantine  is being studied by the  OC Foundation  in its efficacy in reducing OCD symptoms due to it being an  NMDA antagonist . One case study published in  The American Journal of Psychiatry  suggests that ""memantine may be an option for treatment-resistant OCD, but controlled studies are needed to substantiate this observation."" [ 52 ]  The drugs that are popularly used to fight OCD lack full efficacy because they do not act upon what are believed to be the core mechanisms. Many trials are currently underway to investigate the efficacy of a variety of agents that affect these 'core' neurotransmitters, particularly glutamatergic agents. [2]     [ edit ]   Notable cases     British poet, essayist, and lexicographer  Samuel Johnson  is an example of a historical figure with a  retrospective diagnosis  of OCD. He had elaborate rituals for crossing the thresholds of doorways, repeatedly walked up and down staircases counting the steps, and had compulsions regarding repetitive prayer which were most likely a form of religious scrupulosity. [ 53 ] [ 54 ] [ 55 ]       American aviator and filmmaker  Howard Hughes  is known to have suffered from OCD and it is believed that his mother may have also been a sufferer. Friends of Hughes have mentioned his obsession with minor flaws in clothing and he is reported to have had a great fear of germs, common among OCD patients. [ 56 ]  He did also suffer from Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) due to an aviation accident in which he was severely injured. This resulted in him becoming reclusive later in life.       English footballer  David Beckham  has been outspoken regarding his struggle with OCD. He has told media that he has to count all his clothes, and that magazines have to lie in a straight line. No more than three soda cans are allowed in his refrigerator, and if there are any more at home they have to be placed in a cupboard. He has explained that the reason he gets more tattoos is that he feels addicted to the pain of the needle. In hotels, any books that are on a shelf must be placed in the drawer. He has expressed a desire to get help for his problems.

For other uses, see  OCD (disambiguation) .       Obsessive-compulsive disorder   Classification and external resources       ICD - 10   F 42.       Obsessive-compulsive disorder  ( OCD ) is a  mental disorder  most commonly characterized by intrusive, repetitive thoughts resulting in  compulsive behaviors  and mental acts that the person feels driven to perform, according to rules that must be applied rigidly, aimed at preventing some imagined dreaded event; however, these behaviors or mental acts are not connected to the imagined dreaded event.   According to the current epidemiological data, OCD is the fourth most common mental disorder and OCD is considered nearly as common as  asthma  and  diabetes mellitus . [ 1 ]  In the  United States , 1 in 50 adults have OCD. [ 2 ]  In severe cases, it affects a person's ability to function in everyday activities. The disorder often has a serious impact on the sufferer's (and his/her family's)  quality of life . Also, the psychological self-awareness of the  irrationality  of the disorder can be painful. For people with severe OCD, it may take several hours a day to carry out the compulsive acts.   Experts [ who? ]  believe OCD may be related to levels of a normal chemical in the  brain  called  serotonin . When the proper flow of serotonin is blocked, the brain's ""alarm system"" overreacts. Danger messages are mistakenly triggered. Instead of the brain filtering out these unnecessary thoughts, the brain dwells on themand the person repeatedly experiences unrealistic fears and doubts.   The phrase ""obsessive-compulsive"" has become part of the English lexicon, and is often used in an informal or caricatured manner to describe someone who is meticulous,  perfectionistic , absorbed in a cause, or otherwise fixated on something or someone. [ 3 ]  Although these signs are often present in OCD, a person who exhibits them does not necessarily have OCD, and may instead have  obsessive-compulsive  personality  disorder  (OCPD) or some other condition.

The Quick Reference to the diagnostic criteria from DSM-IV-TR (2000) [ 4 ]  states six characteristics of obsessions and compulsions:     Obsessions       Recurrent and persistent thoughts,  impulses , or images that are experienced as intrusive and that cause marked anxiety or distress.   The thoughts, impulses, or images are not simply excessive worries about real-life problems.   The person attempts to ignore or suppress such thoughts, impulses, or images, or to neutralize them with some other thought or action.   The person recognizes that the obsessional thoughts, impulses, or images are a product of his or her own mind, and are not based in reality.       Compulsions       Repetitive behaviors or mental acts that the person feels driven to perform in response to an obsession, or according to rules that must be applied rigidly.   The behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing distress or preventing some dreaded event or situation; however, these behaviors or mental acts are not actually connected to the issue, or they are excessive.     In addition to these criteria, at some point during the course of the disorder, the individual must realize that his/her obsessions or compulsions are unreasonable or excessive. Moreover, the obsessions or compulsions must be time-consuming (taking up more than one hour per day), cause distress, or cause impairment in social, occupational, or school functioning. [ 4 ]  OCD often causes feelings similar to those of  depression .     [ edit ]   Symptoms and prevalence   OCD manifests in a variety of forms. Studies have placed the prevalence between one and three percent, although the prevalence of clinically recognized OCD is much lower, suggesting that many individuals with the disorder may not be diagnosed. [ 5 ]  The fact that many individuals do not seek treatment may be due in part to  stigma  associated with OCD. Another reason for not seeking treatment is that many sufferers of OCD do not realize that they have the condition.   The typical OCD sufferer performs tasks (or  compulsions ) to seek relief from obsession-related anxiety. To others, these tasks may appear odd and unnecessary. But for the sufferer, such tasks can feel critically important, and must be performed in particular ways to ward off dire consequences and to stop the  stress  from building up. Examples of these tasks are repeatedly checking that one's parked car has been locked before leaving it, turning lights on and off a set number of times before exiting a room, repeatedly washing hands at regular intervals throughout the day, touching objects a certain number of times before leaving a room, or walking in a certain routine way. Physical symptoms may include those brought on from anxieties and unwanted thoughts, as well as  tics  or  Parkinson's disease -like symptoms: rigidity, tremor, jerking arm movements, or involuntary movements of the limbs.   Formal diagnosis may be performed by a  psychologist , a  psychiatrist  or  psychoanalyst . OCD sufferers are aware that their thoughts and behavior are not rational, [ 6 ]  but they feel bound to comply with them to fend off feelings of panic or dread. Although everyone may experience unpleasant thoughts at one time or another, these are short-lived and fade away in time. [ 7 ]  For people with OCD, the thoughts are intrusive and persistent, and can cause them great anxiety and distress. [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Contamination   A major subtype of the fear category is the fear of contamination like  mysophobia ; some sufferers may fear the presence of human body secretions such as saliva, blood, sweat, tears, vomit, or mucus, or excretions such as urine, semen or feces. Some OCD sufferers even fear that the soap they are using is contaminated. [ 9 ]  These anxiety-driven fears may cause a person to experience significant distress, which may make it difficult for a person with OCD to tolerate a workplace, venture into public locations, or conduct normal social relationships.     [ edit ]   Performing tasks   Symptoms related to performing tasks may include repeated hand washing or clearing of the throat; specific counting systems or counting of steps; doing repetitive actionsmore generally, this can involve an obsession with numbers or types of numbers (e.g., odd numbers). For example, when somebody suffering from OCD leaves the house, they might tap the door knob 9 times and if they don't they will go into distress, panic and even at certain times, they will pass out. These obsessive behaviors can cause individuals to feel psychological distress, because they are very concerned about having ""made mistakes"" in the number of steps that they have taken, or the number of stairs on a staircase. For some people with OCD, these obsessive counting and re-counting tasks, along with the attendant anxiety and fear, can take hours of each day, which can make it hard for the person to fulfill their work, family, or social roles. In some cases, these behaviors can also cause adverse physical symptoms: people who obsessively wash their hands with  antibacterial soap  and hot water (to remove germs) can make their skin red and raw with  dermatitis . [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Intrusive thoughts and fears   Intrusive thoughts  are unwelcome, involuntary thoughts, images or unpleasant ideas that may become  obsessions , are upsetting or distressing, and can be difficult to be free of and manage. [ 10 ]  As with other forms of OCD, the awareness of the irrationality of these thoughts can be frustrating as the individual wishes to stop them but cannot. Intrusive thoughts, urges, and images are of inappropriate things at inappropriate times, usually falling into three categories: inappropriate aggressive thoughts, inappropriate sexual thoughts, and blasphemous religious thoughts. [ 11 ]  Most people experience these thoughts; when they are associated with OCD or  depression , they may become paralyzing,  anxiety -provoking, and persistent. Many people experience the type of unpleasant or unwanted thoughts that people with more troubling intrusive thoughts have, but most people are able to dismiss these thoughts. [ 10 ]  When intrusive thoughts co-occur with OCD, patients are less capable of ignoring the unpleasant thoughts and may pay undue attention to them, causing the thoughts to become more frequent and distressing. [ 10 ]   The common underlying theme to the diverse intrusive thoughts is summarised by Bruce  et al  with the example, ""What if I were to snap, lose control of myself, and do something totally uncharacteristic of me--perhaps even without my knowing it--that results in harm to myself or someone else?"" [ 12 ]       [ edit ]   Violent or aggressive thoughts   Intrusive thoughts may involve violent obsessions about hurting others or oneself. [ 13 ]  They can include such thoughts as harming an innocent child, jumping from a bridge, mountain or the top of a tall building, urges to jump in front of a train or automobile, and urges to push another in front of a train or automobile. [ 11 ]  A survey of healthy college students found that virtually all of them had intrusive thoughts from time to time, including imagining or wishing harm upon a family member or friend, impulses to attack or kill a small child, or animal, or shout something rude or violent. [ 14 ]   The possibility that most patients suffering from intrusive thoughts will ever act on those thoughts is low; patients who are experiencing intense guilt, anxiety, shame, and anger over bad thoughts are different from those who actually act on bad thoughts. The history of violent crime is dominated by those who feel no guilt or remorse; the very fact that someone is tormented by intrusive thoughts, and has never acted on them before, is an excellent predictor that they won't act upon the thoughts. According to Baer, a patient should be concerned that intrusive thoughts are dangerous if the person doesn't feel upset by the thoughts, rather finds them pleasurable; has ever acted on violent or sexual thoughts or urges; hears voices or sees things that others don't see; or feels uncontrollable irresistible anger. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Inappropriate sexual thoughts   Sexual obsessions involve intrusive thoughts or images of ""kissing, hugging a lot, touching, fondling, oral sex, anal sex, intercourse, and rape"" with ""strangers, acquaintances, parents, children, family members, friends, coworkers, animals and religious figures"", involving ""heterosexual or homosexual content"" with persons of any age. [ 16 ]  Like other intrusive, unpleasant thoughts or images, most people have some inappropriate sexual thoughts at times, but people with OCD may attach significance to the unwanted sexual thoughts, generating anxiety and distress. The doubt that accompanies OCD leads to uncertainty regarding whether one might act on the bad thoughts, resulting in self-criticism or loathing. [ 16 ]   One of the more common sexual intrusive thoughts occurs when an obsessive person doubts his or her  sexual identity , a symptom of OCD called homosexuality anxiety or HOCD. [ 17 ]  As in the case of most sexual obsessions, sufferers may feel shame and live in isolation, finding it hard to discuss their fears, doubts, and concerns about their sexual identity. [ 18 ]  A person experiencing sexual intrusive thoughts may feel shame, ""embarrassment, guilt, distress, torment, fear that you may act on the thought or perceived impulse and, doubt about whether you have already acted in such a way."" Depression may be a result of the self-loathing that can occur, depending on how much the OCD interferes with daily functioning or causes distress. [ 16 ]  The possibility that most patients suffering from intrusive thoughts to sexually assault people will ever act on those thoughts is low; patients who are experiencing intense guilt, anxiety, shame, and upset over bad thoughts are different from those who actually act on bad thoughts.     [ edit ]   Related conditions   OCD is often confused with the separate condition  obsessive-compulsive personality disorder . The two are not the same condition, however. OCD is  ego  dystonic , meaning that the disorder is incompatible with the sufferer's self-concept. Because disorders that are ego dystonic go against an individual's perception of his/herself, they tend to cause much distress. OCPD, on the other hand, is  ego syntonic marked by the individual's acceptance that the characteristics displayed as a result of this disorder are compatible with his/her self-image. Ego syntonic disorders understandably cause no distress. Persons suffering from OCD are often aware that their behavior is not rational and are unhappy about their obsessions but nevertheless feel compelled by them. Persons with OCPD are not aware of anything abnormal about themselves; they will readily explain why their actions are rational, and it is usually impossible to convince them otherwise. Persons with OCD are ridden with  anxiety ; persons who suffer from OCPD, by contrast, tend to derive pleasure from their obsessions or compulsions. [ 19 ]  This is a significant difference between these disorders.   Equally frequently, these rationalizations do not apply to the overall behavior, but to each instance individually; for example, a person compulsively checking their front door may argue that the time taken and stress caused by one more check of the front door is considerably less than the time and stress associated with being robbed, and thus the check is the better option. In practice, after that check, the individual is  still  not sure, and it is  still  better in terms of time and stress to do one more check, and this reasoning can continue as long as necessary.   Some OCD sufferers exhibit what is known as  overvalued ideas . In such cases, the person with OCD will truly be uncertain whether the fears that cause them to perform their compulsions are irrational or not. After some discussion, it is possible to convince the individual that their fears may be unfounded. It may be more difficult to do  ERP therapy  on such patients, because they may be, at least initially, unwilling to cooperate. For this reason OCD has often been likened to a disease of pathological doubt, in which the sufferer, while not usually  delusional , is often unable to realize fully what sorts of dreaded events are reasonably possible and which are not. There are severe cases when the sufferer has an unshakeable belief within the context of OCD which is difficult to differentiate from psychosis. [ 20 ]   OCD is different from behaviors such as  gambling  addiction and  overeating . People with these disorders typically experience at least some pleasure from their activity; OCD sufferers do not actively want to perform their compulsive tasks, and experience no pleasure from doing so. OCD is placed in the anxiety class of  mental illness , but like many  chronic stress disorders  it can lead to  clinical depression  over time. The constant stress of the condition can cause sufferers to develop a deadening of spirit, a numbing frustration, or sense of hopelessness. OCD's effects on day-to-day lifeparticularly its substantial consumption of timecan produce difficulties with work, finances and relationships. There is no known cure for OCD as of yet, but there are a number of successful treatment options available.     [ edit ]   Related/Spectrum disorders   People with OCD may be diagnosed with other conditions, such as  generalized anxiety disorder ,  anorexia nervosa ,  social anxiety disorder ,  bulimia nervosa ,  Tourette syndrome ,  Asperger syndrome ,  compulsive skin picking ,  body dysmorphic disorder ,  trichotillomania , and (as already mentioned)  obsessive-compulsive personality disorder . There is some research demonstrating a link between  drug addiction  and OCD as well. Many who suffer from OCD also suffer from  panic attacks . There is a higher risk of drug addiction among those with any anxiety disorder (possibly as a way of  coping  with the heightened levels of  anxiety ), but drug addiction among OCD patients may serve as a type of  compulsive behavior  and not just as a coping mechanism.  Depression  is also extremely prevalent among sufferers of OCD. One explanation for the high depression rate among OCD populations was posited by Mineka, Watson, and Clark (1998), who explained that people with OCD (or any other  anxiety disorder ) may feel depressed because of an ""out of control"" type of feeling. [ 21 ]   Some cases are thought to be caused at least in part by childhood  streptococcal  infections and are termed  PANDAS  (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infections). The streptococcal  antibodies  become involved in an  autoimmune  process. Though this idea is not set in stone, if it does prove to be true, there is cause to believe that OCD can to some very small extent be ""caught"" via exposure to strep throat (just as one may catch a cold). However, if OCD is caused by bacteria, this provides hope that  antibiotics  may eventually be used to treat or prevent it. [ 22 ]     [ edit ]   Causes     [ edit ]   Psychological   Scientists studying obsessive-compulsive disorder generally agree that both psychological and biological factors play a role in causing the disorder, although they differ in their degree of emphasis upon either type of factor.   From the 14th to the 16th century in Europe, it was believed that people who experienced blasphemous, sexual, or other obsessive thoughts were  possessed  by the  Devil . Based on this reasoning, treatment involved banishing the ""evil"" from the ""possessed"" person through  exorcism . [ 23 ]  In the early 1910s,  Sigmund Freud  attributed obsessive-compulsive behavior to unconscious conflicts which manifested as symptoms. [ 23 ]  Freud describes the clinical history of a typical case of ""touching phobia"" as starting in early childhood, when the person has a strong desire to touch an item. In response, the person develops an ""external prohibition"" against this type of touching. However, this ""prohibition does not succeed in abolishing"" the desire to touch; all it can do is repress the desire and ""force it into the unconscious"". [ 24 ]   The cognitive-behavioral model suggests that compulsive behaviour is carried out to remove anxiety-provoking intrusive thoughts. Unfortunately this only brings about temporary relief as the thought re-emerges. Each time the behaviour occurs it is negatively reinforced (see  Reinforcement ) by the relief from anxiety, thereby explaining why the dysfunctional activity increases and generalises (extends to other, related stimuli) over a period of time. For example, after touching a door-knob a person might have the thought that they may develop a disease as a result of contamination. They then experience anxiety, which is relieved when they wash their hands. This might be followed by the thought ""but did I wash them properly?"" causing an increase in anxiety once more, the hand-washing once again rewarded by the removal of anxiety (albeit briefly) and the cycle being repeated when thoughts of contamination re-occur. The distressing thoughts might then spread to fear of contamination from e.g. a chair (someone might have touched the chair after touching the door handle).     [ edit ]   Biological   There are many different theories about the cause of obsessive-compulsive disorder. The majority of researchers believe that there is some type of abnormality with the  neurotransmitter   serotonin , among other possible psychological or biological abnormalities; however, it is possible that this activity is the brain's  response  to OCD, and not its cause.             This article  may contain  original research  or  unverified claims . Please  improve the article  by adding  references . See the  talk page  for details.  (January 2009)       Serotonin is thought to have a role in regulating anxiety, though it is also thought to be involved in such processes as  sleep  and  memory  function. In order to send chemical messages, serotonin must bind to the  receptor  sites located on the neighboring nerve cell. It is hypothesized that OCD sufferers may have blocked or damaged receptor sites that prevent serotonin from functioning to its full potential. This suggestion is supported by the fact that many OCD patients benefit from the use of  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  (SSRIs)a class of  antidepressant  medications that allow for more serotonin to be readily available to other nerve cells. [ 25 ]  For more about this class of drugs, see the  section about potential treatments  for OCD.   The  Stanford University School of Medicine  OCD webpage states, ""Although the causes of the disorder still elude us, the recent identification of children with OCD caused by an autoimmune response to  Group A streptococcal infection  promises to bring increased understanding of the disorder's pathogenesis."" [ 26 ]   Recent research has revealed a possible  genetic mutation  that could help to cause OCD. Researchers funded by the  National Institutes of Health  have found a  mutation  in the human serotonin transporter gene,  hSERT , in unrelated families with OCD. Moreover, in his study of identical twins, Rasmussen (1994) produced data that supported the idea that there is a ""heritable factor for neurotic anxiety"". [ 27 ]  In addition, he noted that environmental factors also play a role in how these anxiety symptoms are expressed. However, various studies on this topic are still being conducted and the presence of a genetic link is not yet definitely established.   Another possible genetic cause of OCD was discovered in August 2007 by scientists at  Duke University Medical Center  in North Carolina. They genetically engineered mice that lacked a  gene  called  SAPAP3 . This  protein  is highly expressed in the  striatum , an area of the  brain  linked to planning and the initiation of appropriate actions. The mice spent three times as much time grooming themselves as ordinary mice, to the point that their fur fell off. [ 28 ]   Using tools like  positron emission tomography  (PET scans), it has been shown that those with OCD tend to have brain activity that differs from those who do not have this disorder. [ 29 ]  A popular explanation for OCD is that offered in the book  Brain Lock  by Jeffrey Schwartz, which suggests that OCD is caused by the part of the brain that is responsible for translating complex intentions (e.g., ""I will pick up this cup"") into fundamental actions (e.g., ""move arm forward, rotate hand 15 degrees, etc."") failing to correctly communicate the chemical message that an action has been completed. This is perceived as a feeling of doubt and incompleteness, which then leads the individual to attempt to consciously deconstruct their own prior behaviora process which induces anxiety in most people, even those without OCD [ citation needed ] .   It has been theorized that a miscommunication between the  orbitofrontal cortex , the  caudate nucleus , and the  thalamus  may be a factor in the explanation of OCD. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is the first part of the brain to notice whether or not something is wrong. [ vague ]  When the OFC notices that something is wrong, it sends an initial ""worry signal"" to the thalamus. When the thalamus receives this signal, it in turn sends signals back to the OFC to interpret the worrying event. The caudate nucleus lies between the OFC and the thalamus and prevents the initial worry signal from being sent back to the thalamus after it has already been received. However, it is suggested that in those with OCD, the caudate nucleus does not function properly, and therefore does not prevent this initial signal from recurring. This causes the thalamus to become hyperactive and creates a virtually never-ending loop of worry signals being sent back and forth between the OFC and the thalamus. The OFC responds by increasing anxiety and engaging in  compulsive behaviors  in an attempt to relieve this apprehension. [ 25 ]  This overactivity of the OFC is shown to be attenuated in patients who have successfully responded to  SSRI  medication. The increased stimulation of the  serotonin  receptors  5-HT2A  and  5-HT2C  in the OFC is believed to cause this inhibition.  [ 30 ]   Some research has discovered an association between a type of size abnormality in different  brain structures  and the predisposition to develop OCD. Through the use of  magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI), researchers at  Cambridge's Brain Mapping Unit  were able to discover distinctive patterns in the brain structure of individuals with OCD and their close family members.  [ 31 ]  This is the first instance in which it has been demonstrated that those with a familial risk of developing OCD have anatomical differences when compared with ordinary individuals. The discovery of these structural differences in the area of the brain associated with stopping  motor response  may ultimately aid researchers who seek to determine which genes contribute to the development of OCD.   In some patients, the consumption of  caffeine  may make OCD symptoms worse.  [ 32 ]     [ edit ]   Demographics and other statistics   In a 1980 study of 20,000 adults from  New Haven ,  Baltimore ,  St. Louis ,  Durham , and  Los Angeles , the lifetime prevalence rate of OCD for both sexes was recorded at 2.5 percent. Education also appears to be a factor. The lifetime prevalence of OCD is lower for those who have graduated high school than for those who have not (1.9 percent versus 3.4 percent). However, in the case of college education, lifetime prevalence is higher for those who graduate with a degree (3.1 percent) than it is for those who have only some college background (2.4 percent). As far as age is concerned, the onset of OCD usually ranges from the late teenage years until the mid-20s in both sexes, but the age of onset tends to be slightly younger in males than in females. [ 33 ]   It has been alleged that sufferers are generally of above-average  intelligence , as the very nature of the disorder necessitates complicated thinking patterns [ 34 ] .     [ edit ]   Treatment   According to the Expert Consensus Guidelines for the Treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder,  behavioral therapy  (BT),  cognitive therapy  (CT), and  medications  are first-line treatments for OCD.  Psychodynamic psychotherapy  may help in managing some aspects of the disorder, but there are no controlled studies that demonstrate effectiveness of  psychoanalysis  or  dynamic psychotherapy  in OCD. [ 35 ]     [ edit ]   Behavioral therapy   The specific technique used in BT/CBT is called  exposure and ritual prevention  (also known as "" exposure and response prevention "") or ERP; this involves gradually learning to tolerate the anxiety associated with not performing the ritual behavior. At first, for example, someone might touch something only very mildly ""contaminated"" (such as a tissue that has been touched by another tissue that has been touched by the end of a toothpick that has touched a book that came from a ""contaminated"" location, such as a school.) That is the ""exposure"". The ""ritual prevention"" is not washing. Another example might be leaving the house and checking the lock only once (exposure) without going back and checking again (ritual prevention). The person fairly quickly  habituates  to the anxiety-producing situation and discovers that their anxiety level has dropped considerably; they can then progress to touching something more ""contaminated"" or not checking the lock at allagain, without performing the ritual behavior of washing or checking.   Exposure ritual/response prevention has been demonstrated to be the most effective treatment for OCD. It has generally been accepted that  psychotherapy , in combination with  psychotropic medication , is more effective than either option alone. However, more recent studies have shown no difference in outcomes for those treated with the combination of medicine and CBT versus CBT alone. [ 36 ]   Recently it has been reported simultaneous administration of D-Cycloserin (an antibiotic) substantially improves effectiveness of Exposure and Response prevention. [ 37 ]     [ edit ]   Medication   Medications as treatment include  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  (SSRIs) such as  paroxetine (Seroxat, Paxil, Xetanor, ParoMerck, Rexetin) ,  sertraline (Zoloft, Stimuloton) ,  fluoxetine (Prozac, Bioxetin) ,  escitalopram  (Lexapro), and  fluvoxamine (Luvox)  as well as the  tricyclic antidepressants , in particular  clomipramine (Anafranil) . SSRIs prevent excess  serotonin  from being pumped back into the original  neuron  that released it. Instead, serotonin can then bind to the  receptor  sites of nearby neurons and send chemical messages or signals that can help regulate the excessive  anxiety  and obsessive thoughts. In some treatment-resistant cases, a combination of  clomipramine  and an SSRI has shown to be effective even when neither drug on its own has been efficacious.   Benzodiazepines  are also used in treatment. It's not uncommon to administer this class of drugs during the ""latency period"" for SSRIs or as synergistic adjunct long-term. Although widely prescribed, benzodiazepines have not been demonstrated as an effective treatment for OCD and can be addictive. [ 38 ]   Serotonergic   antidepressants  typically take longer to show benefit in OCD than with most other disorders which they are used to treat, as it is common for 23 months to elapse before any tangible improvement is noticed. In addition to this, the treatment usually requires high doses.  Fluoxetine , for example, is usually prescribed in doses of 20 mg per day for clinical depression, whereas with OCD the dose will often range from 20 mg to 80 mg or higher, if necessary. In most cases  antidepressant therapy  alone will only provide a partial reduction in symptoms, even in cases that are not deemed treatment-resistant. Much current research is devoted to the therapeutic potential of the agents that effect the release of the neurotransmitter  glutamate  or the binding to its receptors. These include  riluzole ,  memantine ,  gabapentin (Neurontin)  and  lamotrigine (Lamictal) .   Low doses of the newer  atypical antipsychotics   olanzapine (Zyprexa) ,  quetiapine (Seroquel) ,  ziprasidone  and  risperidone (Risperdal)  have also been found to be useful as adjuncts in the treatment of OCD. The use of  antipsychotics  in OCD must be undertaken carefully, however, since, although there is very strong evidence that at low doses they are beneficial (most likely due to their  dopamine receptor   antagonism ), at high doses these same antipsychotics have proven to cause dramatic obsessive-compulsive symptoms even in those patients who do not normally have OCD. This is most likely due to the antagonism of  5-HT2A receptors  becoming very prominent at these doses and outweighing the benefits of  dopamine  antagonism. Another point that must be noted with antipsychotic treatment is that SSRIs inhibit the chief  enzyme  that is responsible for  metabolising  antipsychotics CYP2D6 so the dose will be effectively higher than expected when these are combined with SSRIs. Also, it must be noted that antipsychotic treatment should be considered as augmentation treatment when SSRI treatment does not bring positive results.     [ edit ]   Alternative drug treatments   The naturally occurring sugar  inositol  may be an effective treatment for OCD. Inositol appears to modulate the actions of serotonin and has been found to reverse  desensitisation  of the  neurotransmitter 's receptors. [ 39 ]   St John's Wort  has been claimed to be of benefit due to its (non-selective) serotonin re-uptake inhibiting qualities, and studies have emerged that have shown positive results. However, a double-blind study, using a flexible-dose schedule (600-1800 mg/day), found no difference between St John's Wort and the placebo. [ 40 ]  Studies have also been done that show  nutrition deficiencies  may also contribute to OCD and other  mental disorders . Certain  vitamin  and  mineral supplements  may aid in such disorders and provide the  nutrients  necessary for proper mental functioning.  [ 41 ]   Recent research has found increasing evidence that  opioids  may significantly reduce OCD symptoms, though the use of them is not sanctioned for treatment and considered an ""off-label"" use, factors being  physical dependence  and long term drug tolerance. Anecdotal reports suggest that some OCD sufferers have successfully self-medicated with opioids such as  tramadol  (Ultram) and  hydrocodone  (Vicodin, Lortab), though the off-label use of such  painkillers  is not widely accepted, research on this has been limited. Tramadol is an atypical opioid that may be a viable option as it has a low potential for  abuse  and  addiction , mild side effects, and shows signs of rapid efficacy in OCD. Tramadol not only provides the anti-OCD effects of an  opiate , but also inhibits the  re-uptake  of serotonin (in addition to  norepinephrine ). This may provide additional benefits, but should not be taken in combination with  antidepressant  medication unless under careful medical supervision due to potential  serotonin syndrome . [ 42 ]   Recent studies at the  University of Arizona  using the  tryptamine   alkaloid   psilocybin  have shown promising results. [ 43 ]  There are reports that other  hallucinogens  such as  LSD  and  peyote  have produced similar benefits. It has been hypothesised that this effect may be due to stimulation of  5-HT2A receptors  and, less importantly,  5-HT2C receptors . This causes, among many other effects, an  inhibitory effect  on the  orbitofrontal cortex , an area of the brain in which  hyperactivity  has been strongly associated with OCD. [ 44 ]   Emerging evidence suggests that regular  nicotine  treatment may be helpful in improving symptoms of OCD, although the  pharmacodynamical  mechanism by which this improvement is achieved is not yet known, and more detailed studies are needed to fully confirm this  hypothesis . Anecdotal reports suggest OCD can worsen when cigarettes are smoked as a way of obtaining nicotine. [ 45 ]     [ edit ]   Psycho-surgery   For some, neither medication, support groups nor psychological treatments are helpful in alleviating obsessive-compulsive symptoms. These patients may choose to undergo  psychosurgery  as a last resort. In this procedure, a surgical  lesion  is made in an area of the brain (the  cingulate bundle ). In one study, 30% of participants benefited significantly from this procedure. [ 8 ]   Deep-brain stimulation  and  vagus nerve stimulation  are possible surgical options which do not require the destruction of  brain tissue , although their efficacy has not been conclusively demonstrated.   In the US, psychosurgery for OCD is a treatment of last resort and will not be performed until the patient has failed several attempts at medication (at the full dosage) with augmentation, and many months of intensive  cognitive-behavioral therapy  with exposure and ritual/response prevention. [ 46 ]  Likewise, in the UK, psychosurgery cannot be performed unless a course of treatment from a suitably qualified cognitive-behavioural therapist has been carried out.     [ edit ]   Transcranial magnetic stimulation   Though in its early stages of research,  Transcranial magnetic stimulation  (TMS) has shown promising results. The magnetic pulses are focused on the brain's  supplementary motor area  (SMA), which plays a role in filtering out extraneous internal stimuli, such as ruminations, obsessions, and tics. The TMS treatment is an attempt to normalize the SMA's activity, so that it properly filters out thoughts and behaviors associated with OCD.  [ 47 ] [ 48 ]     [ edit ]   Neuropsychiatry       Main article:  Neuropsychiatry       OCD primarily involves the  brain regions  of the  striatum , the  orbitofrontal cortex  and the  cingulate cortex . OCD involves several different  receptors , mostly  H 2 ,  M 4 ,  NK 1 ,  NMDA , and non-NMDA  glutamate receptors . [ citation needed ]  The receptors  5-HT 1D ,  5-HT 2C , and the   opioid receptor  exert a secondary effect. The H 2 , M 4 , NK 1 , and  non-NMDA glutamate  receptors are active in the striatum, whereas the  NMDA receptors  are active in the cingulate cortex.   The activity of certain receptors is positively correlated to the severity of OCD, whereas the activity of certain other receptors is negatively correlated to the severity of OCD. Correlations where activity is positively correlated to severity include the histamine receptor ( H 2 ); the Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor( M 4 ); the Tachykinin receptor ( NK 1 ); and non-NMDA  glutamate receptors . Correlations where activity is negatively correlated to severity include the NMDA receptor ( NMDA ); the Mu opioid receptor (  opioid ); and two types of 5-HT receptors ( 5-HT 1D  and  5-HT 2C ) The central dysfunction of OCD may involve the receptors nk1, non-NMDA  glutamate  receptors, and NMDA, whereas the other receptors could simply exert secondary modulatory effects.   Pharmaceuticals that act directly on those core mechanisms are  aprepitant  (nk1 antagonist),  riluzole  (glutamate release inhibitor), and  tautomycin  (NMDA receptor sensitizer). Also, the anti-Alzheimer's drug  memantine  is being studied by the  OC Foundation  in its efficacy in reducing OCD symptoms due to it being an  NMDA antagonist . One case study published in  The American Journal of Psychiatry  suggests that ""memantine may be an option for treatment-resistant OCD, but controlled studies are needed to substantiate this observation."" [ 49 ]  The drugs that are popularly used to fight OCD lack full efficacy because they do not act upon what are believed to be the core mechanisms. Many trials are currently underway to investigate the efficacy of a variety of agents that affect these 'core' neurotransmitters, particularly glutamatergic agents. [2]     [ edit ]   Notable cases     British poet, essayist, and lexicographer  Samuel Johnson  is an example of a historical figure with a  retrospective diagnosis  of OCD. He had elaborate rituals for crossing the thresholds of doorways, repeatedly walked up and down staircases counting the steps, and had compulsions regarding repetitive prayer which were most likely a form of religious scrupulosity.  [ 50 ] [ 51 ] [ 52 ]       American aviator and filmmaker  Howard Hughes  is known to have suffered from OCD and it is believed that his mother may have also been a sufferer. Friends of Hughes have mentioned his obsession with minor flaws in clothing and he is reported to have had a great fear of germs, common among OCD patients.  [ 53 ]  He did also suffer from Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) due to an aviation accident in which he was severely injured. This resulted in him becoming reclusive later in life.       English footballer  David Beckham  has been outspoken regarding his struggle with OCD. He has told media that he has to count all his clothes, and that magazines have to lie in a straight line. No more than three soda cans are allowed in his refrigerator, and if there are any more at home they have to be placed in a cupboard. He has explained that the reason he gets more tattoos is that he feels addicted to the pain of the needle. In hotels, any books that are on a shelf must be placed in the drawer. He has expressed a desire to get help for his problems.

Sexual obsessions can become extremely debilitating, making the sufferer ashamed of the symptoms and reluctant to seek help. Preoccupation with sexual matters, however, does not only occur as a symptom of OCD and may be enjoyable in other contexts (i.e. sexual fantasy). This article focuses on unwanted sexual obsessions.           Contents       1   Obsessive-compulsive disorder     1.1   Sexual focus   1.2   Self-Doubt   1.3   Avoidance   1.4   Sexual Fantasy       2   Treatment     2.1   Medication       3   Related Links   4   References               [ edit ]   Obsessive-compulsive disorder   Obsessive-compulsive disorder  involves obsessions -- unwanted thoughts or images that are upsettling or interfere with an individual's life, followed by compulsions -- actions that temporarily relieve the anxiety caused by the obsessions (APA 2000). Obsessions are involuntary, repetitive, and unwelcome. Attempts to suppress or neutralise obsessions do not work and in fact make the obsessions more severe. OCD is considered an  anxiety disorder .   Typical obsessive themes center on contamination, illness, worries about disaster, and orderliness. However, people with OCD also obsess about violence, religious questions, and/or sexual experiences. Up to a quarter of people with OCD may experience sexual obsessions (Grant et al, 2006). Repetitive sexual thoughts are seen in many disorders in addition to OCD. For example, sexual thoughts are common to people with paraphilias,  post-traumatic stress disorder , sexual dysfunction,  sexual addiction  and as part of the normal fantasy life of the general population. The recurrent sexual thoughts and feelings in these situations are sometimes referred to as sexual obsessions. However their content, form, and meaning vary depending on the disorder (Gordon 2002).     [ edit ]   Sexual focus   Since sex carries so much emotional, moral, and religious importance, it easily becomes a magnet for obsessions in people predisposed to OCD. Common themes include  homosexuality , unfaithfulness, deviant behaviors,  pedophilia ,  AIDS , intrusive thoughts concerning the unfaithfulness or suitability of ones partner, and profane thoughts combining religion and sex. People with sexual obsessions may have legitimate concerns about their attractiveness, potency, or partner, which can serve as an unconscious catalyst for the obsessions.   Sexual obsessions take many forms. For example, a father might obsess about sexually abusing his daughter. He might wonder if these thoughts mean that he is a pedophile and worry that he could act them out, despite the fact that he has never sexually abused anyone and feels disgusted by the idea. A woman who has happily dated men all of her life might suddenly start to worry that her lukewarm feelings toward her boyfriend means that she is a lesbian. She might then start to look at every woman wondering if, in fact, she is attracted to someone of the same sex. Another example is a man who worries that he may accidentally impregnate a woman by shaking her hand because he was not careful enough in washing his hands after touching his genitals (Williams 2007). A patient may also experience fears that their obsession has already been carried out.   In the midst of the thoughts, the sexual obsessions may seem real. Occasionally individuals with OCD believe that their obsession is true, and in such a case they would be said to have ""poor insight."" But the vast majority of people with OCD recognize at some point that their fears are extreme and unrealistic. The problem is that even though they know the obsession is false, it feels real. These individuals can't understand why they are unable to dismiss the obsession from the mind. The obsession may temporarily go away in the face of a logical argument or reassurance from others, but may spike when caught off guard by a sexual trigger (Gordon 2002).   Sexual obsessions can be particularly troubling to the individual with OCD, as something important and cherished becomes twisted into its nightmarish opposite, and one will always fixate on the worst-case-scenario. People with sexual obsessions are particularly likely to have co-occurring aggressive and religious obsessions,  clinical depression , and higher rates of  impulse control disorders  (Grant et al, 2006).     [ edit ]   Self-Doubt   Obsessions are often viewed by the patient as a series of ""What if""s. They may wonder, ""What if I am really a homosexual?"" ""What if I really want to seduce my student?"" ""What if I got AIDS from visiting a prostitute while sleepwalking?"" The chance of an obsession coming true is remote but often the concern can never be completely disproved (i.e. ""What if I really was aroused by that picture of a child?"") Arguing with a person with OCD is usually futile. Objective feedback contradicting the obsession is dismissed because it lacks one-hundred percent certainty. For someone with OCD, no possibility is ever remote enough to permanently banish the fear. Attempts to prove the unprovable leads to circles of doubt, reassurance seeking, and checking compulsions (Gordon 2002).   Sexual obsessions can occur with or without compulsions. A compulsion can be a behavioral act or a mental ritual. Examples of mental rituals include silent prayers, repeating special phrases (i.e. ""I truly love my wife,"") and mental arguments with oneself about the validity of the obsession. Compulsions are performed as an attempt to counteract the obsession. Compulsions temporarily reduce anxiety, but ultimately they make the OCD more severe. This type of checking can be extremely destructive to the person with sexual obsessions as they use the very existence of the compulsive behavior as a sign that they are in fact sexually deviant.   Another form of OCD that can take hold of a person is a fear that they do not love their partner sufficiently (ROCD). As with sexual obsessions, and quite often in response to them, a person may feel the need to end a perfectly good relationship based on their inability to feel how they want to. Instead of finding good in their partner, they are constantly focused on their shortcomings. They often overexaggerate these ""flaws"" and use them to prove the relationship is fundamentally bad. Even when they know they love someone, they constantly check and reassure themselves that it is the right feeling. When they attempt to end the relationship, a surge of anxiety takes hold of them because, although free from the obsessive thoughts, they may realize that they prematurely ended a good relationship. The fact that they are unable to concentrate on anything but their partner's flaws causes the sufferer great anxiety, and often leads to a strained relationship.     [ edit ]   Avoidance   In the same way that those who have OCD fears of contamination avoid anything that will 'contaminate' them (i.e., doorknobs, puddles, shaking hands), those who are suffering from such sexual obsessions may feel an overpowering need to avoid all contact with anything that can cause them to have anxiety, or 'spike'. Such avoidance may be: Not looking at (for instance) another member of the same sex in the face, avoiding locker rooms, showers, and beaches, etc. It can also mean avoiding sexual situations with members of the opposite sex, for fear of what a particular circumstance (not being aroused enough, intrusive thoughts, etc.) might mean. A sufferer may also avoid hugging children, including their own, a compulsion which may cause severe damage to the well-being of the child. It may cause social problems as the sufferer avoids being with gay, or straight, friends, or people with children. The social isolation feeds the anxiety, and therefore the OCD.     [ edit ]   Sexual Fantasy   It cannot be overemphasized that the sexual obsessions in OCD are the opposite of the usual sexual daydream or fantasy. Normal sexual fantasies are enjoyable and generally harmless. They may consist of wishes or memories of past sexual experiences. However, the sexual ideation in OCD is unpleasant and distressing. The individual with OCD does not want the thought to become real. The idea of acting out the obsession fills the OCD victim with dread (Gordon 2002). The sexual ideation in such situations is termed "" ego-dystonic "" or ego-alien, meaning that the behavior and/or attitudes are seen by the individual as inconsistent with his or her fundamental beliefs and personality.   Sexual obsessions in OCD rarely produce  sexual arousal  because anxiety and arousal cannot occupy the same space [ citation needed ] . As a result, OCD usually decreases sex drive. However, the sufferer's constant focus on not becoming aroused or checking that they do not become aroused may lead to 'groinal response'. Many OCD sufferers take this groinal response as actual arousal, when in reality it is not. OCD sexual obsessions often result in guilt, shame, and may interfere with social functioning or work.     [ edit ]   Treatment   People with sexual obsessions can devote an excessive amount of time and energy attempting to understand the obsessions. They usually decide they are having these problems because they are defective in some way, and they are often too ashamed to seek help. Because sexual obsessions are not as well-described in the research literature, many therapists may fail to properly diagnose OCD in a client with primary sexual obsessions. Mental health professionals unfamiliar with OCD may even attribute the symptoms to an unconscious wish, sexual identity crisis, or hidden paraphilia. Such a misdiagnosis only panics an already distressed individual. Conceptualizing a problem such as homosexuality fears as a struggle with ""coming out of the closet"" can cause the patient to become even more upset and confused (Gordon 2002). Fortunately, sexual obsessions respond to the same type of effective treatments available for other forms of OCD --  cognitive-behavioral therapy  and  serotonergic  antidepressant medications (SSRIs). People with sexual obsessions may, however, need a longer and more aggressive course of treatment (Granta et al, 2006).     [ edit ]   Medication   Many people with sexual obsessions are alarmed that they seem to lose their sex drive. People with OCD may see this as evidence that they no longer have normal sexual attractions and are in fact deviant in some way. Some may wonder if medication is the answer to the problem. Medication is a double-edged sword. Drugs specifically for  erectile dysfunction  (i.e. Viagra, Cialis) are not the answer for people with untreated OCD. The sexual organs are working properly, but it is the anxiety disorder that interferes with normal libido.   Medications specifically for OCD (typically  SSRI  medications) will help alleviate the anxiety but will also cause some sexual dysfunction in about a third of patients (Bystritsky 2004). For many the relief from the anxiety is enough to overcome the sexual problems caused by the medication. For others, the medication itself makes sex truly impossible. This may be a temporary problem, but if it persists a competent psychiatrist can often adjust the medications to overcome this side-effect.

clueweb09-enwp01-62-14548	"                     Obsessive-compulsive disorder          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Obsessive-compulsive )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search          ""OCD"" redirects here. For other uses, see  OCD (disambiguation) .       Obsessive-compulsive disorder   Classification and external resources       ICD - 10   F 42.       Obsessive-compulsive disorder  ( OCD ) is a  mental disorder  most commonly characterized by intrusive, repetitive thoughts resulting in  compulsive behaviors  and mental acts that the person feels driven to perform, according to rules that must be applied rigidly, aimed at preventing some imagined dreaded event; however, these behaviors or mental acts are not connected to the imagined dreaded event.   According to the current epidemiological data, OCD is the fourth most common mental disorder and OCD is considered nearly as common as  asthma  and  diabetes mellitus . [ 1 ]  In the  United States , 1 in 50 adults have OCD. [ 2 ]  In severe cases, it affects a person's ability to function in everyday activities. The disorder often has a serious impact on the sufferer's (and his/her family's)  quality of life . Also, the psychological self-awareness of the  irrationality  of the disorder can be painful. For people with severe OCD, it may take several hours a day to carry out the compulsive acts.   Experts [ who? ]  believe OCD may be related to levels of a normal chemical in the  brain  called  serotonin . When the proper flow of serotonin is blocked, the brain's ""alarm system"" overreacts. Danger messages are mistakenly triggered. Instead of the brain filtering out these unnecessary thoughts, the brain dwells on themand the person repeatedly experiences unrealistic fears and doubts.   The phrase ""obsessive-compulsive"" has become part of the English lexicon, and is often used in an informal or caricatured manner to describe someone who is meticulous,  perfectionistic , absorbed in a cause, or otherwise fixated on something or someone. [ 3 ]  Although these signs are often present in OCD, a person who exhibits them does not necessarily have OCD, and may instead have  obsessive-compulsive  personality  disorder  (OCPD) or some other condition.

The Quick Reference to the diagnostic criteria from DSM-IV-TR (2000) [ 4 ]  states six characteristics of obsessions and compulsions:     Obsessions       Recurrent and persistent thoughts,  impulses , or images that are experienced as intrusive and that cause marked anxiety or distress.   The thoughts, impulses, or images are not simply excessive worries about real-life problems.   The person attempts to ignore or suppress such thoughts, impulses, or images, or to neutralize them with some other thought or action.   The person recognizes that the obsessional thoughts, impulses, or images are a product of his or her own mind, and are not based in reality.       Compulsions       Repetitive behaviors or mental acts that the person feels driven to perform in response to an obsession, or according to rules that must be applied rigidly.   The behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing distress or preventing some dreaded event or situation; however, these behaviors or mental acts are not actually connected to the issue, or they are excessive.     In addition to these criteria, at some point during the course of the disorder, the individual must realize that his/her obsessions or compulsions are unreasonable or excessive. Moreover, the obsessions or compulsions must be time-consuming (taking up more than one hour per day), cause distress, or cause impairment in social, occupational, or school functioning. [ 4 ]  OCD often causes feelings similar to those of  depression .     [ edit ]   Symptoms and prevalence   OCD manifests in a variety of forms. Studies have placed the prevalence between one and three percent, although the prevalence of clinically recognized OCD is much lower, suggesting that many individuals with the disorder may not be diagnosed. [ 5 ]  The fact that many individuals do not seek treatment may be due in part to  stigma  associated with OCD. Another reason for not seeking treatment is that many sufferers of OCD do not realize that they have the condition.   The typical OCD sufferer performs tasks (or  compulsions ) to seek relief from obsession-related anxiety. To others, these tasks may appear odd and unnecessary. But for the sufferer, such tasks can feel critically important, and must be performed in particular ways to ward off dire consequences and to stop the  stress  from building up. Examples of these tasks are repeatedly checking that one's parked car has been locked before leaving it, turning lights on and off a set number of times before exiting a room, repeatedly washing hands at regular intervals throughout the day, touching objects a certain number of times before leaving a room, or walking in a certain routine way. Physical symptoms may include those brought on from anxieties and unwanted thoughts, as well as  tics  or  Parkinson's disease -like symptoms: rigidity, tremor, jerking arm movements, or involuntary movements of the limbs.   Formal diagnosis may be performed by a  psychologist , a  psychiatrist  or  psychoanalyst . OCD sufferers are aware that their thoughts and behavior are not rational, [ 6 ]  but they feel bound to comply with them to fend off feelings of panic or dread. Although everyone may experience unpleasant thoughts at one time or another, these are short-lived and fade away in time. [ 7 ]  For people with OCD, the thoughts are intrusive and persistent, and can cause them great anxiety and distress. [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Contamination   A major subtype of the fear category is the fear of contamination like  mysophobia ; some sufferers may fear the presence of human body secretions such as saliva, blood, sweat, tears, vomit, or mucus, or excretions such as urine, semen or feces. Some OCD sufferers even fear that the soap they are using is contaminated. [ 9 ]  These anxiety-driven fears may cause a person to experience significant distress, which may make it difficult for a person with OCD to tolerate a workplace, venture into public locations, or conduct normal social relationships.     [ edit ]   Performing tasks   Symptoms related to performing tasks may include repeated hand washing or clearing of the throat; specific counting systems or counting of steps; doing repetitive actionsmore generally, this can involve an obsession with numbers or types of numbers (e.g., odd numbers). For example, when somebody suffering from OCD leaves the house, they might tap the door knob 9 times and if they don't they will go into distress, panic and even at certain times, they will pass out. These obsessive behaviors can cause individuals to feel psychological distress, because they are very concerned about having ""made mistakes"" in the number of steps that they have taken, or the number of stairs on a staircase. For some people with OCD, these obsessive counting and re-counting tasks, along with the attendant anxiety and fear, can take hours of each day, which can make it hard for the person to fulfill their work, family, or social roles. In some cases, these behaviors can also cause adverse physical symptoms: people who obsessively wash their hands with  antibacterial soap  and hot water (to remove germs) can make their skin red and raw with  dermatitis . [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Intrusive thoughts and fears   Intrusive thoughts  are unwelcome, involuntary thoughts, images or unpleasant ideas that may become  obsessions , are upsetting or distressing, and can be difficult to be free of and manage. [ 10 ]  As with other forms of OCD, the awareness of the irrationality of these thoughts can be frustrating as the individual wishes to stop them but cannot. Intrusive thoughts, urges, and images are of inappropriate things at inappropriate times, usually falling into three categories: inappropriate aggressive thoughts, inappropriate sexual thoughts, and blasphemous religious thoughts. [ 11 ]  Most people experience these thoughts; when they are associated with OCD or  depression , they may become paralyzing,  anxiety -provoking, and persistent. Many people experience the type of unpleasant or unwanted thoughts that people with more troubling intrusive thoughts have, but most people are able to dismiss these thoughts. [ 10 ]  When intrusive thoughts co-occur with OCD, patients are less capable of ignoring the unpleasant thoughts and may pay undue attention to them, causing the thoughts to become more frequent and distressing. [ 10 ]   The common underlying theme to the diverse intrusive thoughts is summarised by Bruce  et al  with the example, ""What if I were to snap, lose control of myself, and do something totally uncharacteristic of me--perhaps even without my knowing it--that results in harm to myself or someone else?"" [ 12 ]       [ edit ]   Violent or aggressive thoughts   Intrusive thoughts may involve violent obsessions about hurting others or oneself. [ 13 ]  They can include such thoughts as harming an innocent child, jumping from a bridge, mountain or the top of a tall building, urges to jump in front of a train or automobile, and urges to push another in front of a train or automobile. [ 11 ]  A survey of healthy college students found that virtually all of them had intrusive thoughts from time to time, including imagining or wishing harm upon a family member or friend, impulses to attack or kill a small child, or animal, or shout something rude or violent. [ 14 ]   The possibility that most patients suffering from intrusive thoughts will ever act on those thoughts is low; patients who are experiencing intense guilt, anxiety, shame, and anger over bad thoughts are different from those who actually act on bad thoughts. The history of violent crime is dominated by those who feel no guilt or remorse; the very fact that someone is tormented by intrusive thoughts, and has never acted on them before, is an excellent predictor that they won't act upon the thoughts. According to Baer, a patient should be concerned that intrusive thoughts are dangerous if the person doesn't feel upset by the thoughts, rather finds them pleasurable; has ever acted on violent or sexual thoughts or urges; hears voices or sees things that others don't see; or feels uncontrollable irresistible anger. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Inappropriate sexual thoughts   Sexual obsessions involve intrusive thoughts or images of ""kissing, hugging a lot, touching, fondling, oral sex, anal sex, intercourse, and rape"" with ""strangers, acquaintances, parents, children, family members, friends, coworkers, animals and religious figures"", involving ""heterosexual or homosexual content"" with persons of any age. [ 16 ]  Like other intrusive, unpleasant thoughts or images, most people have some inappropriate sexual thoughts at times, but people with OCD may attach significance to the unwanted sexual thoughts, generating anxiety and distress. The doubt that accompanies OCD leads to uncertainty regarding whether one might act on the bad thoughts, resulting in self-criticism or loathing. [ 16 ]   One of the more common sexual intrusive thoughts occurs when an obsessive person doubts his or her  sexual identity , a symptom of OCD called homosexuality anxiety or HOCD. [ 17 ]  As in the case of most sexual obsessions, sufferers may feel shame and live in isolation, finding it hard to discuss their fears, doubts, and concerns about their sexual identity. [ 18 ]  A person experiencing sexual intrusive thoughts may feel shame, ""embarrassment, guilt, distress, torment, fear that you may act on the thought or perceived impulse and, doubt about whether you have already acted in such a way."" Depression may be a result of the self-loathing that can occur, depending on how much the OCD interferes with daily functioning or causes distress. [ 16 ]  The possibility that most patients suffering from intrusive thoughts to sexually assault people will ever act on those thoughts is low; patients who are experiencing intense guilt, anxiety, shame, and upset over bad thoughts are different from those who actually act on bad thoughts.     [ edit ]   Related conditions   OCD is often confused with the separate condition  obsessive-compulsive personality disorder . The two are not the same condition, however. OCD is  ego  dystonic , meaning that the disorder is incompatible with the sufferer's self-concept. Because disorders that are ego dystonic go against an individual's perception of his/herself, they tend to cause much distress. OCPD, on the other hand, is  ego syntonic marked by the individual's acceptance that the characteristics displayed as a result of this disorder are compatible with his/her self-image. Ego syntonic disorders understandably cause no distress. Persons suffering from OCD are often aware that their behavior is not rational and are unhappy about their obsessions but nevertheless feel compelled by them. Persons with OCPD are not aware of anything abnormal about themselves; they will readily explain why their actions are rational, and it is usually impossible to convince them otherwise. Persons with OCD are ridden with  anxiety ; persons who suffer from OCPD, by contrast, tend to derive pleasure from their obsessions or compulsions. [ 19 ]  This is a significant difference between these disorders.   Equally frequently, these rationalizations do not apply to the overall behavior, but to each instance individually; for example, a person compulsively checking their front door may argue that the time taken and stress caused by one more check of the front door is considerably less than the time and stress associated with being robbed, and thus the check is the better option. In practice, after that check, the individual is  still  not sure, and it is  still  better in terms of time and stress to do one more check, and this reasoning can continue as long as necessary.   Some OCD sufferers exhibit what is known as  overvalued ideas . In such cases, the person with OCD will truly be uncertain whether the fears that cause them to perform their compulsions are irrational or not. After some discussion, it is possible to convince the individual that their fears may be unfounded. It may be more difficult to do  ERP therapy  on such patients, because they may be, at least initially, unwilling to cooperate. For this reason OCD has often been likened to a disease of pathological doubt, in which the sufferer, while not usually  delusional , is often unable to realize fully what sorts of dreaded events are reasonably possible and which are not. There are severe cases when the sufferer has an unshakeable belief within the context of OCD which is difficult to differentiate from psychosis. [ 20 ]   OCD is different from behaviors such as  gambling  addiction and  overeating . People with these disorders typically experience at least some pleasure from their activity; OCD sufferers do not actively want to perform their compulsive tasks, and experience no pleasure from doing so. OCD is placed in the anxiety class of  mental illness , but like many  chronic stress disorders  it can lead to  clinical depression  over time. The constant stress of the condition can cause sufferers to develop a deadening of spirit, a numbing frustration, or sense of hopelessness. OCD's effects on day-to-day lifeparticularly its substantial consumption of timecan produce difficulties with work, finances and relationships. There is no known cure for OCD as of yet, but there are a number of successful treatment options available.     [ edit ]   Related/Spectrum disorders   People with OCD may be diagnosed with other conditions, such as  generalized anxiety disorder ,  anorexia nervosa ,  social anxiety disorder ,  bulimia nervosa ,  Tourette syndrome ,  Asperger syndrome ,  compulsive skin picking ,  body dysmorphic disorder ,  trichotillomania , and (as already mentioned)  obsessive-compulsive personality disorder . There is some research demonstrating a link between  drug addiction  and OCD as well. Many who suffer from OCD also suffer from  panic attacks . There is a higher risk of drug addiction among those with any anxiety disorder (possibly as a way of  coping  with the heightened levels of  anxiety ), but drug addiction among OCD patients may serve as a type of  compulsive behavior  and not just as a coping mechanism.  Depression  is also extremely prevalent among sufferers of OCD. One explanation for the high depression rate among OCD populations was posited by Mineka, Watson, and Clark (1998), who explained that people with OCD (or any other  anxiety disorder ) may feel depressed because of an ""out of control"" type of feeling. [ 21 ]   Some cases are thought to be caused at least in part by childhood  streptococcal  infections and are termed  PANDAS  (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infections). The streptococcal  antibodies  become involved in an  autoimmune  process. Though this idea is not set in stone, if it does prove to be true, there is cause to believe that OCD can to some very small extent be ""caught"" via exposure to strep throat (just as one may catch a cold). However, if OCD is caused by bacteria, this provides hope that  antibiotics  may eventually be used to treat or prevent it. [ 22 ]     [ edit ]   Causes     [ edit ]   Psychological   Scientists studying obsessive-compulsive disorder generally agree that both psychological and biological factors play a role in causing the disorder, although they differ in their degree of emphasis upon either type of factor.   From the 14th to the 16th century in Europe, it was believed that people who experienced blasphemous, sexual, or other obsessive thoughts were  possessed  by the  Devil . Based on this reasoning, treatment involved banishing the ""evil"" from the ""possessed"" person through  exorcism . [ 23 ]  In the early 1910s,  Sigmund Freud  attributed obsessive-compulsive behavior to unconscious conflicts which manifested as symptoms. [ 23 ]  Freud describes the clinical history of a typical case of ""touching phobia"" as starting in early childhood, when the person has a strong desire to touch an item. In response, the person develops an ""external prohibition"" against this type of touching. However, this ""prohibition does not succeed in abolishing"" the desire to touch; all it can do is repress the desire and ""force it into the unconscious"". [ 24 ]   The cognitive-behavioral model suggests that compulsive behaviour is carried out to remove anxiety-provoking intrusive thoughts. Unfortunately this only brings about temporary relief as the thought re-emerges. Each time the behaviour occurs it is negatively reinforced (see  Reinforcement ) by the relief from anxiety, thereby explaining why the dysfunctional activity increases and generalises (extends to other, related stimuli) over a period of time. For example, after touching a door-knob a person might have the thought that they may develop a disease as a result of contamination. They then experience anxiety, which is relieved when they wash their hands. This might be followed by the thought ""but did I wash them properly?"" causing an increase in anxiety once more, the hand-washing once again rewarded by the removal of anxiety (albeit briefly) and the cycle being repeated when thoughts of contamination re-occur. The distressing thoughts might then spread to fear of contamination from e.g. a chair (someone might have touched the chair after touching the door handle).     [ edit ]   Biological   There are many different theories about the cause of obsessive-compulsive disorder. The majority of researchers believe that there is some type of abnormality with the  neurotransmitter   serotonin , among other possible psychological or biological abnormalities; however, it is possible that this activity is the brain's  response  to OCD, and not its cause.             This article  may contain  original research  or  unverified claims . Please  improve the article  by adding  references . See the  talk page  for details.  (January 2009)       Serotonin is thought to have a role in regulating anxiety, though it is also thought to be involved in such processes as  sleep  and  memory  function. In order to send chemical messages, serotonin must bind to the  receptor  sites located on the neighboring nerve cell. It is hypothesized that OCD sufferers may have blocked or damaged receptor sites that prevent serotonin from functioning to its full potential. This suggestion is supported by the fact that many OCD patients benefit from the use of  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  (SSRIs)a class of  antidepressant  medications that allow for more serotonin to be readily available to other nerve cells. [ 25 ]  For more about this class of drugs, see the  section about potential treatments  for OCD.   The  Stanford University School of Medicine  OCD webpage states, ""Although the causes of the disorder still elude us, the recent identification of children with OCD caused by an autoimmune response to  Group A streptococcal infection  promises to bring increased understanding of the disorder's pathogenesis."" [ 26 ]   Recent research has revealed a possible  genetic mutation  that could help to cause OCD. Researchers funded by the  National Institutes of Health  have found a  mutation  in the human serotonin transporter gene,  hSERT , in unrelated families with OCD. Moreover, in his study of identical twins, Rasmussen (1994) produced data that supported the idea that there is a ""heritable factor for neurotic anxiety"". [ 27 ]  In addition, he noted that environmental factors also play a role in how these anxiety symptoms are expressed. However, various studies on this topic are still being conducted and the presence of a genetic link is not yet definitely established.   Another possible genetic cause of OCD was discovered in August 2007 by scientists at  Duke University Medical Center  in North Carolina. They genetically engineered mice that lacked a  gene  called  SAPAP3 . This  protein  is highly expressed in the  striatum , an area of the  brain  linked to planning and the initiation of appropriate actions. The mice spent three times as much time grooming themselves as ordinary mice, to the point that their fur fell off. [ 28 ]   Using tools like  positron emission tomography  (PET scans), it has been shown that those with OCD tend to have brain activity that differs from those who do not have this disorder. [ 29 ]  A popular explanation for OCD is that offered in the book  Brain Lock  by Jeffrey Schwartz, which suggests that OCD is caused by the part of the brain that is responsible for translating complex intentions (e.g., ""I will pick up this cup"") into fundamental actions (e.g., ""move arm forward, rotate hand 15 degrees, etc."") failing to correctly communicate the chemical message that an action has been completed. This is perceived as a feeling of doubt and incompleteness, which then leads the individual to attempt to consciously deconstruct their own prior behaviora process which induces anxiety in most people, even those without OCD [ citation needed ] .   It has been theorized that a miscommunication between the  orbitofrontal cortex , the  caudate nucleus , and the  thalamus  may be a factor in the explanation of OCD. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is the first part of the brain to notice whether or not something is wrong. [ vague ]  When the OFC notices that something is wrong, it sends an initial ""worry signal"" to the thalamus. When the thalamus receives this signal, it in turn sends signals back to the OFC to interpret the worrying event. The caudate nucleus lies between the OFC and the thalamus and prevents the initial worry signal from being sent back to the thalamus after it has already been received. However, it is suggested that in those with OCD, the caudate nucleus does not function properly, and therefore does not prevent this initial signal from recurring. This causes the thalamus to become hyperactive and creates a virtually never-ending loop of worry signals being sent back and forth between the OFC and the thalamus. The OFC responds by increasing anxiety and engaging in  compulsive behaviors  in an attempt to relieve this apprehension. [ 25 ]  This overactivity of the OFC is shown to be attenuated in patients who have successfully responded to  SSRI  medication. The increased stimulation of the  serotonin  receptors  5-HT2A  and  5-HT2C  in the OFC is believed to cause this inhibition.  [ 30 ]   Some research has discovered an association between a type of size abnormality in different  brain structures  and the predisposition to develop OCD. Through the use of  magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI), researchers at  Cambridge's Brain Mapping Unit  were able to discover distinctive patterns in the brain structure of individuals with OCD and their close family members.  [ 31 ]  This is the first instance in which it has been demonstrated that those with a familial risk of developing OCD have anatomical differences when compared with ordinary individuals. The discovery of these structural differences in the area of the brain associated with stopping  motor response  may ultimately aid researchers who seek to determine which genes contribute to the development of OCD.   In some patients, the consumption of  caffeine  may make OCD symptoms worse.  [ 32 ]     [ edit ]   Demographics and other statistics   In a 1980 study of 20,000 adults from  New Haven ,  Baltimore ,  St. Louis ,  Durham , and  Los Angeles , the lifetime prevalence rate of OCD for both sexes was recorded at 2.5 percent. Education also appears to be a factor. The lifetime prevalence of OCD is lower for those who have graduated high school than for those who have not (1.9 percent versus 3.4 percent). However, in the case of college education, lifetime prevalence is higher for those who graduate with a degree (3.1 percent) than it is for those who have only some college background (2.4 percent). As far as age is concerned, the onset of OCD usually ranges from the late teenage years until the mid-20s in both sexes, but the age of onset tends to be slightly younger in males than in females. [ 33 ]   It has been alleged that sufferers are generally of above-average  intelligence , as the very nature of the disorder necessitates complicated thinking patterns [ 34 ] .     [ edit ]   Treatment   According to the Expert Consensus Guidelines for the Treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder,  behavioral therapy  (BT),  cognitive therapy  (CT), and  medications  are first-line treatments for OCD.  Psychodynamic psychotherapy  may help in managing some aspects of the disorder, but there are no controlled studies that demonstrate effectiveness of  psychoanalysis  or  dynamic psychotherapy  in OCD. [ 35 ]     [ edit ]   Behavioral therapy   The specific technique used in BT/CBT is called  exposure and ritual prevention  (also known as "" exposure and response prevention "") or ERP; this involves gradually learning to tolerate the anxiety associated with not performing the ritual behavior. At first, for example, someone might touch something only very mildly ""contaminated"" (such as a tissue that has been touched by another tissue that has been touched by the end of a toothpick that has touched a book that came from a ""contaminated"" location, such as a school.) That is the ""exposure"". The ""ritual prevention"" is not washing. Another example might be leaving the house and checking the lock only once (exposure) without going back and checking again (ritual prevention). The person fairly quickly  habituates  to the anxiety-producing situation and discovers that their anxiety level has dropped considerably; they can then progress to touching something more ""contaminated"" or not checking the lock at allagain, without performing the ritual behavior of washing or checking.   Exposure ritual/response prevention has been demonstrated to be the most effective treatment for OCD. It has generally been accepted that  psychotherapy , in combination with  psychotropic medication , is more effective than either option alone. However, more recent studies have shown no difference in outcomes for those treated with the combination of medicine and CBT versus CBT alone. [ 36 ]   Recently it has been reported simultaneous administration of D-Cycloserin (an antibiotic) substantially improves effectiveness of Exposure and Response prevention. [ 37 ]     [ edit ]   Medication   Medications as treatment include  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  (SSRIs) such as  paroxetine (Seroxat, Paxil, Xetanor, ParoMerck, Rexetin) ,  sertraline (Zoloft, Stimuloton) ,  fluoxetine (Prozac, Bioxetin) ,  escitalopram  (Lexapro), and  fluvoxamine (Luvox)  as well as the  tricyclic antidepressants , in particular  clomipramine (Anafranil) . SSRIs prevent excess  serotonin  from being pumped back into the original  neuron  that released it. Instead, serotonin can then bind to the  receptor  sites of nearby neurons and send chemical messages or signals that can help regulate the excessive  anxiety  and obsessive thoughts. In some treatment-resistant cases, a combination of  clomipramine  and an SSRI has shown to be effective even when neither drug on its own has been efficacious.   Benzodiazepines  are also used in treatment. It's not uncommon to administer this class of drugs during the ""latency period"" for SSRIs or as synergistic adjunct long-term. Although widely prescribed, benzodiazepines have not been demonstrated as an effective treatment for OCD and can be addictive. [ 38 ]   Serotonergic   antidepressants  typically take longer to show benefit in OCD than with most other disorders which they are used to treat, as it is common for 23 months to elapse before any tangible improvement is noticed. In addition to this, the treatment usually requires high doses.  Fluoxetine , for example, is usually prescribed in doses of 20 mg per day for clinical depression, whereas with OCD the dose will often range from 20 mg to 80 mg or higher, if necessary. In most cases  antidepressant therapy  alone will only provide a partial reduction in symptoms, even in cases that are not deemed treatment-resistant. Much current research is devoted to the therapeutic potential of the agents that effect the release of the neurotransmitter  glutamate  or the binding to its receptors. These include  riluzole ,  memantine ,  gabapentin (Neurontin)  and  lamotrigine (Lamictal) .   Low doses of the newer  atypical antipsychotics   olanzapine (Zyprexa) ,  quetiapine (Seroquel) ,  ziprasidone  and  risperidone (Risperdal)  have also been found to be useful as adjuncts in the treatment of OCD. The use of  antipsychotics  in OCD must be undertaken carefully, however, since, although there is very strong evidence that at low doses they are beneficial (most likely due to their  dopamine receptor   antagonism ), at high doses these same antipsychotics have proven to cause dramatic obsessive-compulsive symptoms even in those patients who do not normally have OCD. This is most likely due to the antagonism of  5-HT2A receptors  becoming very prominent at these doses and outweighing the benefits of  dopamine  antagonism. Another point that must be noted with antipsychotic treatment is that SSRIs inhibit the chief  enzyme  that is responsible for  metabolising  antipsychotics CYP2D6 so the dose will be effectively higher than expected when these are combined with SSRIs. Also, it must be noted that antipsychotic treatment should be considered as augmentation treatment when SSRI treatment does not bring positive results.     [ edit ]   Alternative drug treatments   The naturally occurring sugar  inositol  may be an effective treatment for OCD. Inositol appears to modulate the actions of serotonin and has been found to reverse  desensitisation  of the  neurotransmitter 's receptors. [ 39 ]   St John's Wort  has been claimed to be of benefit due to its (non-selective) serotonin re-uptake inhibiting qualities, and studies have emerged that have shown positive results. However, a double-blind study, using a flexible-dose schedule (600-1800 mg/day), found no difference between St John's Wort and the placebo. [ 40 ]  Studies have also been done that show  nutrition deficiencies  may also contribute to OCD and other  mental disorders . Certain  vitamin  and  mineral supplements  may aid in such disorders and provide the  nutrients  necessary for proper mental functioning.  [ 41 ]   Recent research has found increasing evidence that  opioids  may significantly reduce OCD symptoms, though the use of them is not sanctioned for treatment and considered an ""off-label"" use, factors being  physical dependence  and long term drug tolerance. Anecdotal reports suggest that some OCD sufferers have successfully self-medicated with opioids such as  tramadol  (Ultram) and  hydrocodone  (Vicodin, Lortab), though the off-label use of such  painkillers  is not widely accepted, research on this has been limited. Tramadol is an atypical opioid that may be a viable option as it has a low potential for  abuse  and  addiction , mild side effects, and shows signs of rapid efficacy in OCD. Tramadol not only provides the anti-OCD effects of an  opiate , but also inhibits the  re-uptake  of serotonin (in addition to  norepinephrine ). This may provide additional benefits, but should not be taken in combination with  antidepressant  medication unless under careful medical supervision due to potential  serotonin syndrome . [ 42 ]   Recent studies at the  University of Arizona  using the  tryptamine   alkaloid   psilocybin  have shown promising results. [ 43 ]  There are reports that other  hallucinogens  such as  LSD  and  peyote  have produced similar benefits. It has been hypothesised that this effect may be due to stimulation of  5-HT2A receptors  and, less importantly,  5-HT2C receptors . This causes, among many other effects, an  inhibitory effect  on the  orbitofrontal cortex , an area of the brain in which  hyperactivity  has been strongly associated with OCD. [ 44 ]   Emerging evidence suggests that regular  nicotine  treatment may be helpful in improving symptoms of OCD, although the  pharmacodynamical  mechanism by which this improvement is achieved is not yet known, and more detailed studies are needed to fully confirm this  hypothesis . Anecdotal reports suggest OCD can worsen when cigarettes are smoked as a way of obtaining nicotine. [ 45 ]     [ edit ]   Psycho-surgery   For some, neither medication, support groups nor psychological treatments are helpful in alleviating obsessive-compulsive symptoms. These patients may choose to undergo  psychosurgery  as a last resort. In this procedure, a surgical  lesion  is made in an area of the brain (the  cingulate bundle ). In one study, 30% of participants benefited significantly from this procedure. [ 8 ]   Deep-brain stimulation  and  vagus nerve stimulation  are possible surgical options which do not require the destruction of  brain tissue , although their efficacy has not been conclusively demonstrated.   In the US, psychosurgery for OCD is a treatment of last resort and will not be performed until the patient has failed several attempts at medication (at the full dosage) with augmentation, and many months of intensive  cognitive-behavioral therapy  with exposure and ritual/response prevention. [ 46 ]  Likewise, in the UK, psychosurgery cannot be performed unless a course of treatment from a suitably qualified cognitive-behavioural therapist has been carried out.     [ edit ]   Transcranial magnetic stimulation   Though in its early stages of research,  Transcranial magnetic stimulation  (TMS) has shown promising results. The magnetic pulses are focused on the brain's  supplementary motor area  (SMA), which plays a role in filtering out extraneous internal stimuli, such as ruminations, obsessions, and tics. The TMS treatment is an attempt to normalize the SMA's activity, so that it properly filters out thoughts and behaviors associated with OCD.  [ 47 ] [ 48 ]     [ edit ]   Neuropsychiatry       Main article:  Neuropsychiatry       OCD primarily involves the  brain regions  of the  striatum , the  orbitofrontal cortex  and the  cingulate cortex . OCD involves several different  receptors , mostly  H 2 ,  M 4 ,  NK 1 ,  NMDA , and non-NMDA  glutamate receptors . [ citation needed ]  The receptors  5-HT 1D ,  5-HT 2C , and the   opioid receptor  exert a secondary effect. The H 2 , M 4 , NK 1 , and  non-NMDA glutamate  receptors are active in the striatum, whereas the  NMDA receptors  are active in the cingulate cortex.   The activity of certain receptors is positively correlated to the severity of OCD, whereas the activity of certain other receptors is negatively correlated to the severity of OCD. Correlations where activity is positively correlated to severity include the histamine receptor ( H 2 ); the Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor( M 4 ); the Tachykinin receptor ( NK 1 ); and non-NMDA  glutamate receptors . Correlations where activity is negatively correlated to severity include the NMDA receptor ( NMDA ); the Mu opioid receptor (  opioid ); and two types of 5-HT receptors ( 5-HT 1D  and  5-HT 2C ) The central dysfunction of OCD may involve the receptors nk1, non-NMDA  glutamate  receptors, and NMDA, whereas the other receptors could simply exert secondary modulatory effects.   Pharmaceuticals that act directly on those core mechanisms are  aprepitant  (nk1 antagonist),  riluzole  (glutamate release inhibitor), and  tautomycin  (NMDA receptor sensitizer). Also, the anti-Alzheimer's drug  memantine  is being studied by the  OC Foundation  in its efficacy in reducing OCD symptoms due to it being an  NMDA antagonist . One case study published in  The American Journal of Psychiatry  suggests that ""memantine may be an option for treatment-resistant OCD, but controlled studies are needed to substantiate this observation."" [ 49 ]  The drugs that are popularly used to fight OCD lack full efficacy because they do not act upon what are believed to be the core mechanisms. Many trials are currently underway to investigate the efficacy of a variety of agents that affect these 'core' neurotransmitters, particularly glutamatergic agents. [2]     [ edit ]   Notable cases     British poet, essayist, and lexicographer  Samuel Johnson  is an example of a historical figure with a  retrospective diagnosis  of OCD. He had elaborate rituals for crossing the thresholds of doorways, repeatedly walked up and down staircases counting the steps, and had compulsions regarding repetitive prayer which were most likely a form of religious scrupulosity.  [ 50 ] [ 51 ] [ 52 ]       American aviator and filmmaker  Howard Hughes  is known to have suffered from OCD and it is believed that his mother may have also been a sufferer. Friends of Hughes have mentioned his obsession with minor flaws in clothing and he is reported to have had a great fear of germs, common among OCD patients.  [ 53 ]  He did also suffer from Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) due to an aviation accident in which he was severely injured. This resulted in him becoming reclusive later in life.       English footballer  David Beckham  has been outspoken regarding his struggle with OCD. He has told media that he has to count all his clothes, and that magazines have to lie in a straight line. No more than three soda cans are allowed in his refrigerator, and if there are any more at home they have to be placed in a cupboard. He has explained that the reason he gets more tattoos is that he feels addicted to the pain of the needle. In hotels, any books that are on a shelf must be placed in the drawer. He has expressed a desire to get help for his problems.

For other uses, see  OCD (disambiguation) .       Obsessive-compulsive disorder   Classification and external resources       ICD - 10   F 42.       Obsessive-compulsive disorder  ( OCD ) is a  mental disorder  most commonly characterized by  intrusive , repetitive thoughts resulting in  compulsive behaviors  and mental acts that the person feels driven to perform, according to rules that must be applied rigidly, aimed at reducing  anxiety  by preventing some dreaded event or by resolving a more nebulous sense of tension. However, the likelihood that a dreaded event will occur, or the causal relationship between the performance of compulsions and the reduction of this likelihood, tends to be imagined or exaggerated.   OCD is the fourth most common mental disorder and is nearly as common as  asthma  and  diabetes mellitus . [ 1 ]  In the  United States , one in 50 adults has OCD. [ 2 ]  In severe cases, it affects a person's ability to function in everyday activities. The disorder often has a serious impact on the sufferer's (and their family's)  quality of life . Also, the psychological self-awareness of the  irrationality  of the disorder can be painful. For people with severe OCD, it may take several hours a day to carry out the compulsive acts.   The phrase ""obsessive-compulsive"" has become part of the English lexicon, and is often used in an informal or caricatured manner to describe someone who is meticulous,  perfectionistic , absorbed in a cause, or otherwise fixated on something or someone. [ 3 ]  Although these signs are often present in OCD, a person who exhibits them does not necessarily have OCD, and may instead have  obsessive-compulsive  personality  disorder  (OCPD) or some other condition.

The Quick Reference to the diagnostic criteria from DSM-IV-TR (2000) [ 4 ]  states six characteristics of obsessions and compulsions:     Obsessions       Recurrent and persistent thoughts,  impulses , or images that are experienced as intrusive and that cause marked anxiety or distress.   The thoughts, impulses, or images are not simply excessive worries about real-life problems.   The person attempts to ignore or suppress such thoughts, impulses, or images, or to neutralize them with some other thought or action.   The person recognizes that the obsessional thoughts, impulses, or images are a product of his or her own mind, and are not based in reality.       Compulsions       Repetitive behaviors or mental acts that the person feels driven to perform in response to an obsession, or according to rules that must be applied rigidly.   The behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing distress or preventing some dreaded event or situation; however, these behaviors or mental acts are not actually connected to the issue, or they are excessive.     In addition to these criteria, at some point during the course of the disorder, the individual must realize that his/her obsessions or compulsions are unreasonable or excessive. Moreover, the obsessions or compulsions must be time-consuming (taking up more than one hour per day), cause distress, or cause impairment in social, occupational, or school functioning. [ 4 ]  OCD often causes feelings similar to those of  depression .     [ edit ]   Symptoms and prevalence   OCD manifests in a variety of forms. Studies have placed the prevalence between one and three percent, although the prevalence of clinically recognized OCD is much lower, suggesting that many individuals with the disorder may not be diagnosed. [ 5 ]  The fact that many individuals do not seek treatment may be due in part to  stigma  associated with OCD. Another reason for not seeking treatment is that many sufferers of OCD do not realize that they have the condition.   The typical OCD sufferer performs tasks (or  compulsions ) to seek relief from obsession-related anxiety. To others, these tasks may appear odd and unnecessary. But for the sufferer, such tasks can feel critically important, and must be performed in particular ways to ward off dire consequences and to stop the  stress  from building up. Examples of these tasks are repeatedly checking that one's parked car has been locked before leaving it, turning lights on and off a set number of times before exiting a room, repeatedly washing hands at regular intervals throughout the day, touching objects a certain number of times before leaving a room, or walking in a certain routine way. Physical symptoms may include those brought on from anxieties and unwanted thoughts, as well as  tics  or  Parkinson's disease -like symptoms: rigidity, tremor, jerking arm movements, or involuntary movements of the limbs.   Formal diagnosis may be performed by a  psychologist , a  psychiatrist  or  psychoanalyst . OCD sufferers are aware that their thoughts and behavior are not rational, [ 6 ]  but they feel bound to comply with them to fend off feelings of panic or dread. Although everyone may experience unpleasant thoughts at one time or another, these are short-lived and fade away in time. [ 7 ]  For people with OCD, the thoughts are intrusive and persistent, and can cause them great anxiety and distress. [ 8 ]   Intrusive thoughts  are unwelcome, involuntary thoughts, images or unpleasant ideas that may become  obsessions , are upsetting or distressing, and can be difficult to be free of and manage. [ 9 ]  As with other forms of OCD, the awareness of the irrationality of these thoughts can be frustrating as the individual wishes to stop them but cannot. Intrusive thoughts, urges, and images are of inappropriate things at inappropriate times, usually falling into three categories: inappropriate aggressive thoughts, inappropriate sexual thoughts, and blasphemous religious thoughts. [ 10 ]  Most people experience these thoughts; when they are associated with OCD or  depression , they may become paralyzing,  anxiety -provoking, and persistent. Many people experience the type of unpleasant or unwanted thoughts that people with more troubling intrusive thoughts have, but most people are able to dismiss these thoughts. [ 9 ]  When intrusive thoughts co-occur with OCD, patients are less capable of ignoring the unpleasant thoughts and may pay undue attention to them, causing the thoughts to become more frequent and distressing. [ 9 ]   The common underlying theme to the diverse intrusive thoughts is summarised by Bruce  et al  with the example, ""What if I were to snap, lose control of myself, and do something totally uncharacteristic of me--perhaps even without my knowing it--that results in harm to myself or someone else?"" [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   OCD without Overt compulsions   A major subtype of OCD is OCD without overt compulsions. [ 12 ]  OCD without overt compulsions is often referred to as ""pure-O"" by laymen and sufferers of this disorder. The term is a bit of a misnomer, however, since OCD without overt compulsions is no more ""pure"" than any other form of OCD. Nonetheless, OCD without overt compulsions represents a major subtype of OCD with some of the estimates as high 50-60%. [ 13 ]  Rather than engaging in observable rituals and compulsions, the person with OCD without overt compulsions engages in all manner of mental neutralizing behaviours (i.e. ""covert"" compulsions).   Intrusive thoughts may involve violent obsessions about hurting others or oneself. [ 14 ]  They can include such thoughts as harming an innocent child, jumping from a bridge, mountain or the top of a tall building, urges to jump in front of a train or automobile, and urges to push another in front of a train or automobile. [ 10 ]  A survey of healthy college students found that virtually all of them had intrusive thoughts from time to time, including imagining or wishing harm upon a family member or friend, impulses to attack or kill a small child, or animal, or shout something rude or violent. [ 15 ]   The possibility that most patients suffering from intrusive thoughts will ever act on those thoughts is low; patients who are experiencing intense guilt, anxiety, shame, and anger over bad thoughts are different from those who actually act on bad thoughts. The history of violent crime is dominated by those who feel no guilt or remorse; the very fact that someone is tormented by intrusive thoughts, and has never acted on them before, is an excellent predictor that they won't act upon the thoughts. According to Baer, a patient should be concerned that intrusive thoughts are dangerous if the person doesn't feel upset by the thoughts, rather finds them pleasurable; has ever acted on violent or sexual thoughts or urges; hears voices or sees things that others don't see; or feels uncontrollable irresistible anger. [ 16 ]   Sexual obsessions may involve intrusive thoughts or images of ""kissing, hugging a lot, touching, fondling, oral sex, anal sex, intercourse, and rape"" with ""strangers, acquaintances, parents, children, family members, friends, coworkers, animals and religious figures"", involving ""heterosexual or homosexual content"" with persons of any age. [ 17 ]  Like other intrusive, unpleasant thoughts or images, most people have some inappropriate sexual thoughts at times, but people with OCD may attach significance to the unwanted sexual thoughts, generating anxiety and distress. The doubt that accompanies OCD leads to uncertainty regarding whether one might act on the bad thoughts, resulting in self-criticism or loathing. [ 17 ]     [ edit ]   OCD with Overt Compulsions   Other major subtypes of OCD frequently revolve around washing or checking; some sufferers may fear the presence of human body secretions such as saliva, blood, semen, sweat, tears, vomit, or mucus, or excretions such as urine or feces. Some OCD sufferers even fear that the soap they are using is contaminated. [ 18 ]  These anxiety-driven fears often result in various compulsive cleaning behaviours, and may cause a person to experience significant distress, which may make it difficult for a person with OCD to tolerate a workplace, venture into public locations, or conduct normal social relationships.   Symptoms related to performing tasks may include repeated hand washing [ 19 ]  or clearing of the throat; specific counting systems or counting of steps; doing repetitive actionsmore generally, this can involve an obsession with numbers or types of numbers (e.g., odd numbers). For example, when somebody suffering from OCD leaves the house, they might tap the door knob 9 times and if they don't they will go into distress, panic and even at certain times, they will pass out. These obsessive behaviors can cause individuals to feel psychological distress, because they are very concerned about having ""made mistakes"" in the number of steps that they have taken, or the number of stairs on a staircase. For some people with OCD, these obsessive counting and re-counting tasks, along with the attendant anxiety and fear, can take hours of each day, which can make it hard for the person to fulfill their work, family, or social roles. In some cases, these behaviors can also cause adverse physical symptoms: people who obsessively wash their hands with  antibacterial soap  and hot water (to remove germs) can make their skin red and raw with  dermatitis . [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Related conditions   OCD is often confused with the separate condition  obsessive-compulsive personality disorder . The two are not the same condition, however. OCD is  ego  dystonic , meaning that the disorder is incompatible with the sufferer's self-concept.  [ 20 ] [ 21 ]  Because disorders that are ego dystonic go against an individual's perception of his/herself, they tend to cause much distress. OCPD, on the other hand, is  ego syntonic marked by the individual's acceptance that the characteristics displayed as a result of this disorder are compatible with his/her self-image. Ego syntonic disorders understandably cause no distress. Persons suffering from OCD are often aware that their behavior is not rational and are unhappy about their obsessions but nevertheless feel compelled by them. Persons with OCPD are not aware of anything abnormal about themselves; they will readily explain why their actions are rational, and it is usually impossible to convince them otherwise. Persons with OCD are ridden with  anxiety ; persons who suffer from OCPD, by contrast, tend to derive pleasure from their obsessions or compulsions. [ 22 ]  This is a significant difference between these disorders.   Equally frequently, these rationalizations do not apply to the overall behavior, but to each instance individually; for example, a person compulsively checking their front door may argue that the time taken and stress caused by one more check of the front door is considerably less than the time and stress associated with being robbed, and thus the check is the better option. In practice, after that check, the individual is  still  not sure, and it is  still  better in terms of time and stress to do one more check, and this reasoning can continue as long as necessary.   Some OCD sufferers exhibit what is known as  overvalued ideas . In such cases, the person with OCD will truly be uncertain whether the fears that cause them to perform their compulsions are irrational or not. After some discussion, it is possible to convince the individual that their fears may be unfounded. It may be more difficult to do  ERP therapy  on such patients, because they may be, at least initially, unwilling to cooperate. For this reason OCD has often been likened to a disease of pathological doubt, in which the sufferer, while not usually  delusional , is often unable to realize fully what sorts of dreaded events are reasonably possible and which are not. There are severe cases when the sufferer has an unshakeable belief within the context of OCD which is difficult to differentiate from psychosis. [ 23 ]   OCD is different from behaviors such as  gambling  addiction and  overeating . People with these disorders typically experience at least some pleasure from their activity; OCD sufferers do not actively want to perform their compulsive tasks, and experience no pleasure from doing so. OCD is placed in the anxiety class of  mental illness , but like many  chronic stress disorders  it can lead to  clinical depression  over time. The constant stress of the condition can cause sufferers to develop a deadening of spirit, a numbing frustration, or sense of hopelessness. OCD's effects on day-to-day lifeparticularly its substantial consumption of timecan produce difficulties with work, finances and relationships. There is no known cure for OCD as of yet, but there are a number of successful treatment options available.     [ edit ]   Related/Spectrum disorders   People with OCD may be diagnosed with other conditions, such as  generalized anxiety disorder ,  anorexia nervosa ,  social anxiety disorder ,  bulimia nervosa ,  Tourette syndrome ,  Asperger syndrome ,  compulsive skin picking ,  body dysmorphic disorder ,  trichotillomania , and (as already mentioned)  obsessive-compulsive personality disorder . There is some research demonstrating a link between  drug addiction  and OCD as well. Many who suffer from OCD also suffer from  panic attacks . There is a higher risk of drug addiction among those with any anxiety disorder (possibly as a way of  coping  with the heightened levels of  anxiety ), but drug addiction among OCD patients may serve as a type of  compulsive behavior  and not just as a coping mechanism.  Depression  is also extremely prevalent among sufferers of OCD. One explanation for the high depression rate among OCD populations was posited by Mineka, Watson, and Clark (1998), who explained that people with OCD (or any other  anxiety disorder ) may feel depressed because of an ""out of control"" type of feeling. [ 24 ]   Some cases are thought to be caused at least in part by childhood  streptococcal  infections and are termed  PANDAS  (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infections). The streptococcal  antibodies  become involved in an  autoimmune  process. Though this idea is not set in stone, if it does prove to be true, there is cause to believe that OCD can to some very small extent be ""caught"" via exposure to strep throat (just as one may catch a cold). However, if OCD is caused by bacteria, this provides hope that  antibiotics  may eventually be used to treat or prevent it. [ 25 ]     [ edit ]   Causes     [ edit ]   Psychological   Scientists studying obsessive-compulsive disorder generally agree that both psychological and biological factors play a role in causing the disorder, although they differ in their degree of emphasis upon either type of factor.   From the 14th to the 16th century in Europe, it was believed that people who experienced blasphemous, sexual, or other obsessive thoughts were  possessed  by the  Devil . [ 26 ]  Based on this reasoning, treatment involved banishing the ""evil"" from the ""possessed"" person through  exorcism . [ 27 ]  In the early 1910s,  Sigmund Freud  attributed obsessive-compulsive behavior to unconscious conflicts which manifested as symptoms. [ 27 ]  Freud describes the clinical history of a typical case of ""touching phobia"" as starting in early childhood, when the person has a strong desire to touch an item. In response, the person develops an ""external prohibition"" against this type of touching. However, this ""prohibition does not succeed in abolishing"" the desire to touch; all it can do is repress the desire and ""force it into the unconscious"". [ 28 ]   The cognitive-behavioral model suggests that compulsive behaviour is carried out to remove anxiety-provoking intrusive thoughts. Unfortunately this only brings about temporary relief as the thought re-emerges. Each time the behaviour occurs it is negatively reinforced (see  Reinforcement ) by the relief from anxiety, thereby explaining why the dysfunctional activity increases and generalises (extends to other, related stimuli) over a period of time. For example, after touching a door-knob a person might have the thought that they may develop a disease as a result of contamination. They then experience anxiety, which is relieved when they wash their hands. This might be followed by the thought ""but did I wash them properly?"" causing an increase in anxiety once more, the hand-washing once again rewarded by the removal of anxiety (albeit briefly) and the cycle being repeated when thoughts of contamination re-occur. The distressing thoughts might then spread to fear of contamination from e.g. a chair (someone might have touched the chair after touching the door handle).     [ edit ]   Biological   There are many different theories about the cause of obsessive-compulsive disorder. The majority of researchers believe that there is some type of abnormality with the  neurotransmitter   serotonin , among other possible psychological or biological abnormalities; however, it is possible that this activity is the brain's  response  to OCD, and not its cause.             This article  may contain  original research  or  unverified claims . Please  improve the article  by adding  references . See the  talk page  for details.  (January 2009)       Serotonin is thought to have a role in regulating anxiety, though it is also thought to be involved in such processes as  sleep  and  memory  function. In order to send chemical messages, serotonin must bind to the  receptor  sites located on the neighboring nerve cell. It is hypothesized that OCD sufferers may have blocked or damaged receptor sites that prevent serotonin from functioning to its full potential. This suggestion is supported by the fact that many OCD patients benefit from the use of  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  (SSRIs)a class of  antidepressant  medications that allow for more serotonin to be readily available to other nerve cells. [ 29 ]  For more about this class of drugs, see the  section about potential treatments  for OCD.   The  Stanford University School of Medicine  OCD webpage states, ""Although the causes of the disorder still elude us, the recent identification of children with OCD caused by an autoimmune response to  Group A streptococcal infection  promises to bring increased understanding of the disorder's pathogenesis."" [ 30 ]   Recent research has revealed a possible  genetic mutation  that could help to cause OCD. Researchers funded by the  National Institutes of Health  have found a  mutation  in the human serotonin transporter gene,  hSERT , in unrelated families with OCD. Moreover, in his study of identical twins, Rasmussen (1994) produced data that supported the idea that there is a ""heritable factor for neurotic anxiety"". [ 31 ]  In addition, he noted that environmental factors also play a role in how these anxiety symptoms are expressed. However, various studies on this topic are still being conducted and the presence of a genetic link is not yet definitely established.   Another possible genetic cause of OCD was discovered in August 2007 by scientists at  Duke University Medical Center  in North Carolina. They genetically engineered mice that lacked a  gene  called  SAPAP3 . This  protein  is highly expressed in the  striatum , an area of the  brain  linked to planning and the initiation of appropriate actions. The mice spent three times as much time grooming themselves as ordinary mice, to the point that their fur fell off. [ 32 ]   Using tools like  positron emission tomography  (PET scans), it has been shown that those with OCD tend to have brain activity that differs from those who do not have this disorder. [ 33 ]  A popular explanation for OCD is that offered in the book  Brain Lock  by Jeffrey Schwartz, which suggests that OCD is caused by the part of the brain that is responsible for translating complex intentions (e.g., ""I will pick up this cup"") into fundamental actions (e.g., ""move arm forward, rotate hand 15 degrees, etc."") failing to correctly communicate the chemical message that an action has been completed. This is perceived as a feeling of doubt and incompleteness, which then leads the individual to attempt to consciously deconstruct their own prior behaviora process which induces anxiety in most people, even those without OCD [ citation needed ] .   It has been theorized that a miscommunication between the  orbitofrontal cortex , the  caudate nucleus , and the  thalamus  may be a factor in the explanation of OCD. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is the first part of the brain to notice whether or not something is wrong. [ vague ]  When the OFC notices that something is wrong, it sends an initial ""worry signal"" to the thalamus. When the thalamus receives this signal, it in turn sends signals back to the OFC to interpret the worrying event. The caudate nucleus lies between the OFC and the thalamus and prevents the initial worry signal from being sent back to the thalamus after it has already been received. However, it is suggested that in those with OCD, the caudate nucleus does not function properly, and therefore does not prevent this initial signal from recurring. This causes the thalamus to become hyperactive and creates a virtually never-ending loop of worry signals being sent back and forth between the OFC and the thalamus. The OFC responds by increasing anxiety and engaging in  compulsive behaviors  in an attempt to relieve this apprehension. [ 29 ]  This overactivity of the OFC is shown to be attenuated in patients who have successfully responded to  SSRI  medication. The increased stimulation of the  serotonin  receptors  5-HT2A  and  5-HT2C  in the OFC is believed to cause this inhibition.  [ 34 ]   Some research has discovered an association between a type of size abnormality in different  brain structures  and the predisposition to develop OCD. Through the use of  magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI), researchers at  Cambridge's Brain Mapping Unit  were able to discover distinctive patterns in the brain structure of individuals with OCD and their close family members.  [ 35 ]  This is the first instance in which it has been demonstrated that those with a familial risk of developing OCD have anatomical differences when compared with ordinary individuals. The discovery of these structural differences in the area of the brain associated with stopping  motor response  may ultimately aid researchers who seek to determine which genes contribute to the development of OCD.   In some patients, the consumption of  caffeine  may make OCD symptoms worse.  [ 36 ]     [ edit ]   Demographics and other statistics   In a 1980 study of 20,000 adults from  New Haven ,  Baltimore ,  St. Louis ,  Durham , and  Los Angeles , the lifetime prevalence rate of OCD for both sexes was recorded at 2.5 percent. Education also appears to be a factor. The lifetime prevalence of OCD is lower for those who have graduated high school than for those who have not (1.9 percent versus 3.4 percent). However, in the case of college education, lifetime prevalence is higher for those who graduate with a degree (3.1 percent) than it is for those who have only some college background (2.4 percent). As far as age is concerned, the onset of OCD usually ranges from the late teenage years until the mid-20s in both sexes, but the age of onset tends to be slightly younger in males than in females. [ 37 ]   It has been alleged that sufferers are generally of above-average  intelligence , as the very nature of the disorder necessitates complicated thinking patterns [ 38 ] .     [ edit ]   Treatment   According to the Expert Consensus Guidelines for the Treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder,  behavioral therapy  (BT),  cognitive therapy  (CT), and  medications  are first-line treatments for OCD.  Psychodynamic psychotherapy  may help in managing some aspects of the disorder, but there are no controlled studies that demonstrate effectiveness of  psychoanalysis  or  dynamic psychotherapy  in OCD. [ 39 ]     [ edit ]   Behavioral therapy   The specific technique used in BT/CBT is called  exposure and ritual prevention  (also known as "" exposure and response prevention "") or ERP; this involves gradually learning to tolerate the anxiety associated with not performing the ritual behavior. At first, for example, someone might touch something only very mildly ""contaminated"" (such as a tissue that has been touched by another tissue that has been touched by the end of a toothpick that has touched a book that came from a ""contaminated"" location, such as a school.) That is the ""exposure"". The ""ritual prevention"" is not washing. Another example might be leaving the house and checking the lock only once (exposure) without going back and checking again (ritual prevention). The person fairly quickly  habituates  to the anxiety-producing situation and discovers that their anxiety level has dropped considerably; they can then progress to touching something more ""contaminated"" or not checking the lock at allagain, without performing the ritual behavior of washing or checking.   Exposure ritual/response prevention has been demonstrated to be the most effective treatment for OCD. It has generally been accepted that  psychotherapy , in combination with  psychotropic medication , is more effective than either option alone. However, more recent studies have shown no difference in outcomes for those treated with the combination of medicine and CBT versus CBT alone. [ 40 ]   Recently it has been reported simultaneous administration of D-Cycloserin (an antibiotic) substantially improves effectiveness of Exposure and Response prevention. [ 41 ]     [ edit ]   Medication   Medications as treatment include  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  (SSRIs) such as  paroxetine (Seroxat, Paxil, Xetanor, ParoMerck, Rexetin) ,  sertraline (Zoloft, Stimuloton) ,  fluoxetine (Prozac, Bioxetin) ,  escitalopram  (Lexapro), and  fluvoxamine (Luvox)  as well as the  tricyclic antidepressants , in particular  clomipramine (Anafranil) . SSRIs prevent excess  serotonin  from being pumped back into the original  neuron  that released it. Instead, serotonin can then bind to the  receptor  sites of nearby neurons and send chemical messages or signals that can help regulate the excessive  anxiety  and obsessive thoughts. In some treatment-resistant cases, a combination of  clomipramine  and an SSRI has shown to be effective even when neither drug on its own has been efficacious.   Benzodiazepines  are also used in treatment. It's not uncommon to administer this class of drugs during the ""latency period"" for SSRIs or as synergistic adjunct long-term. Although widely prescribed, benzodiazepines have not been demonstrated as an effective treatment for OCD and may be habit-forming in those with a history of substance abuse. [ 42 ]   Serotonergic   antidepressants  typically take longer to show benefit in OCD than with most other disorders which they are used to treat, as it is common for 23 months to elapse before any tangible improvement is noticed. In addition to this, the treatment usually requires high doses.  Fluoxetine , for example, is usually prescribed in doses of 20 mg per day for clinical depression, whereas with OCD the dose will often range from 20 mg to 80 mg or higher, if necessary. In most cases  antidepressant therapy  alone will only provide a partial reduction in symptoms, even in cases that are not deemed treatment-resistant. Much current research is devoted to the therapeutic potential of the agents that effect the release of the neurotransmitter  glutamate  or the binding to its receptors. These include  riluzole ,  memantine ,  gabapentin (Neurontin)  and  lamotrigine (Lamictal) .   Low doses of the newer  atypical antipsychotics   olanzapine (Zyprexa) ,  quetiapine (Seroquel) ,  ziprasidone  and  risperidone (Risperdal)  have also been found to be useful as adjuncts in the treatment of OCD. The use of  antipsychotics  in OCD must be undertaken carefully, however, since, although there is very strong evidence that at low doses they are beneficial (most likely due to their  dopamine receptor   antagonism ), at high doses these same antipsychotics have proven to cause dramatic obsessive-compulsive symptoms even in those patients who do not normally have OCD. This can be due to the antagonism of  5-HT2A receptors  becoming very prominent at these doses and outweighing the benefits of  dopamine  antagonism. However antidepressant mirtazapine which is a 5-HT2A antagonist has shown to be of benefit to OCD patients [ 43 ] . Another point that must be noted with antipsychotic treatment is that SSRIs inhibit the chief  enzyme  that is responsible for  metabolising  antipsychotics CYP2D6 so the dose will be effectively higher than expected when these are combined with SSRIs. Also, it must be noted that antipsychotic treatment should be considered as augmentation treatment when SSRI treatment does not bring positive results.     [ edit ]   Alternative drug treatments   The naturally occurring sugar  inositol  has been suggested as a treatment for OCD [ 44 ] , as it appears to modulate the actions of serotonin and reverse  desensitisation  of  neurotransmitter  receptors.  St John's Wort  has been claimed to be of benefit due to its (non-selective) serotonin re-uptake inhibiting qualities [ citations needed ] , although a double-blind study using a flexible-dose schedule (600-1800 mg/day) found no difference between St John's Wort and a placebo [ 45 ] .   Nutrition deficiencies  may also contribute to OCD and other  mental disorders .  Vitamin  and mineral supplements may aid in such disorders and provide  nutrients  necessary for proper mental functioning [ 46 ] .   Opioids  may significantly reduce OCD symptoms, though their use is not sanctioned for treatment due to  physical dependence  and long term drug tolerance [ citations needed ] . Tramadol is an atypical opioid that appears to provide the anti-OCD effects of an  opiate  and inhibit the  re-uptake  of serotonin (in addition to  norepinephrine ) [ 47 ] .   Tryptamine   alkaloid   psilocybin  has been attempted as treatment [ 48 ] . There are reports that other  hallucinogens  such as  LSD  and  peyote  have produced similar effects [ citations needed ] . It has been hypothesised that this effect may be due to stimulation of  5-HT2A receptors  and, less significantly,  5-HT2C receptors ; this causes an inhibitory effect on the  orbitofrontal cortex , an area of the brain in which  hyperactivity  has been strongly associated with OCD [ 49 ] .   Regular  nicotine  treatment may ameliorate symptoms of OCD, although the  pharmacodynamical  mechanism by which this is achieved is not yet known, and more detailed studies are needed to fully confirm this  hypothesis [ 50 ] .     [ edit ]   Psycho-surgery   For some, neither medication, support groups nor psychological treatments are helpful in alleviating obsessive-compulsive symptoms. These patients may choose to undergo  psychosurgery  as a last resort. In this procedure, a surgical  lesion  is made in an area of the brain (the  cingulate bundle ). In one study, 30% of participants benefited significantly from this procedure. [ 8 ]   Deep-brain stimulation  and  vagus nerve stimulation  are possible surgical options which do not require the destruction of  brain tissue , although their efficacy has not been conclusively demonstrated.   In the US, psychosurgery for OCD is a treatment of last resort and will not be performed until the patient has failed several attempts at medication (at the full dosage) with augmentation, and many months of intensive  cognitive-behavioral therapy  with exposure and ritual/response prevention. [ 51 ]  Likewise, in the UK, psychosurgery cannot be performed unless a course of treatment from a suitably qualified cognitive-behavioural therapist has been carried out.     [ edit ]   Neuropsychiatry   Main article:  Neuropsychiatry   OCD primarily involves the  brain regions  of the  striatum , the  orbitofrontal cortex  and the  cingulate cortex . OCD involves several different  receptors , mostly  H 2 ,  M 4 ,  NK 1 ,  NMDA , and non-NMDA  glutamate receptors . [ citation needed ]  The receptors  5-HT 1D ,  5-HT 2C , and the   opioid receptor  exert a secondary effect. The H 2 , M 4 , NK 1 , and  non-NMDA glutamate  receptors are active in the striatum, whereas the  NMDA receptors  are active in the cingulate cortex.   The activity of certain receptors is positively correlated to the severity of OCD, whereas the activity of certain other receptors is negatively correlated to the severity of OCD. Correlations where activity is positively correlated to severity include the histamine receptor ( H 2 ); the Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor( M 4 ); the Tachykinin receptor ( NK 1 ); and non-NMDA  glutamate receptors . Correlations where activity is negatively correlated to severity include the NMDA receptor ( NMDA ); the Mu opioid receptor (  opioid ); and two types of 5-HT receptors ( 5-HT 1D  and  5-HT 2C ) The central dysfunction of OCD may involve the receptors nk1, non-NMDA  glutamate  receptors, and NMDA, whereas the other receptors could simply exert secondary modulatory effects.   Pharmaceuticals that act directly on those core mechanisms are  aprepitant  (nk1 antagonist),  riluzole  (glutamate release inhibitor), and  tautomycin  (NMDA receptor sensitizer). Also, the anti-Alzheimer's drug  memantine  is being studied by the  OC Foundation  in its efficacy in reducing OCD symptoms due to it being an  NMDA antagonist . One case study published in  The American Journal of Psychiatry  suggests that ""memantine may be an option for treatment-resistant OCD, but controlled studies are needed to substantiate this observation."" [ 52 ]  The drugs that are popularly used to fight OCD lack full efficacy because they do not act upon what are believed to be the core mechanisms. Many trials are currently underway to investigate the efficacy of a variety of agents that affect these 'core' neurotransmitters, particularly glutamatergic agents. [2]     [ edit ]   Notable cases     British poet, essayist, and lexicographer  Samuel Johnson  is an example of a historical figure with a  retrospective diagnosis  of OCD. He had elaborate rituals for crossing the thresholds of doorways, repeatedly walked up and down staircases counting the steps, and had compulsions regarding repetitive prayer which were most likely a form of religious scrupulosity. [ 53 ] [ 54 ] [ 55 ]       American aviator and filmmaker  Howard Hughes  is known to have suffered from OCD and it is believed that his mother may have also been a sufferer. Friends of Hughes have mentioned his obsession with minor flaws in clothing and he is reported to have had a great fear of germs, common among OCD patients. [ 56 ]  He did also suffer from Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) due to an aviation accident in which he was severely injured. This resulted in him becoming reclusive later in life.       English footballer  David Beckham  has been outspoken regarding his struggle with OCD. He has told media that he has to count all his clothes, and that magazines have to lie in a straight line. No more than three soda cans are allowed in his refrigerator, and if there are any more at home they have to be placed in a cupboard. He has explained that the reason he gets more tattoos is that he feels addicted to the pain of the needle. In hotels, any books that are on a shelf must be placed in the drawer. He has expressed a desire to get help for his problems.

For other uses, see  OCD (disambiguation) .       Obsessive-compulsive disorder   Classification and external resources       ICD - 10   F 42.       Obsessive-compulsive disorder  ( OCD ) is a  mental disorder  most commonly characterized by  intrusive , repetitive thoughts resulting in  compulsive behaviors  and mental acts that the person feels driven to perform, according to rules that must be applied rigidly, aimed at reducing  anxiety  by preventing some dreaded event or by resolving a more nebulous sense of tension. However, the likelihood that a dreaded event will occur, or the causal relationship between the performance of compulsions and the reduction of this likelihood, tends to be imagined or exaggerated.   OCD is the fourth most common mental disorder and is nearly as common as  asthma  and  diabetes mellitus . [ 1 ]  In the  United States , one in 50 adults has OCD. [ 2 ]  In severe cases, it affects a person's ability to function in everyday activities. The disorder often has a serious impact on the sufferer's (and their family's)  quality of life . Also, the psychological self-awareness of the  irrationality  of the disorder can be painful. For people with severe OCD, it may take several hours a day to carry out the compulsive acts.   The phrase ""obsessive-compulsive"" has become part of the English lexicon, and is often used in an informal or caricatured manner to describe someone who is meticulous,  perfectionistic , absorbed in a cause, or otherwise fixated on something or someone. [ 3 ]  Although these signs are often present in OCD, a person who exhibits them does not necessarily have OCD, and may instead have  obsessive-compulsive  personality  disorder  (OCPD) or some other condition.

The Quick Reference to the diagnostic criteria from DSM-IV-TR (2000) [ 4 ]  states six characteristics of obsessions and compulsions:     Obsessions       Recurrent and persistent thoughts,  impulses , or images that are experienced as intrusive and that cause marked anxiety or distress.   The thoughts, impulses, or images are not simply excessive worries about real-life problems.   The person attempts to ignore or suppress such thoughts, impulses, or images, or to neutralize them with some other thought or action.   The person recognizes that the obsessional thoughts, impulses, or images are a product of his or her own mind, and are not based in reality.       Compulsions       Repetitive behaviors or mental acts that the person feels driven to perform in response to an obsession, or according to rules that must be applied rigidly.   The behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing distress or preventing some dreaded event or situation; however, these behaviors or mental acts are not actually connected to the issue, or they are excessive.     In addition to these criteria, at some point during the course of the disorder, the individual must realize that his/her obsessions or compulsions are unreasonable or excessive. Moreover, the obsessions or compulsions must be time-consuming (taking up more than one hour per day), cause distress, or cause impairment in social, occupational, or school functioning. [ 4 ]  OCD often causes feelings similar to those of  depression .     [ edit ]   Symptoms and prevalence   OCD manifests in a variety of forms. Studies have placed the prevalence between one and three percent, although the prevalence of clinically recognized OCD is much lower, suggesting that many individuals with the disorder may not be diagnosed. [ 5 ]  The fact that many individuals do not seek treatment may be due in part to  stigma  associated with OCD. Another reason for not seeking treatment is that many sufferers of OCD do not realize that they have the condition.   The typical OCD sufferer performs tasks (or  compulsions ) to seek relief from obsession-related anxiety. To others, these tasks may appear odd and unnecessary. But for the sufferer, such tasks can feel critically important, and must be performed in particular ways to ward off dire consequences and to stop the  stress  from building up. Examples of these tasks are repeatedly checking that one's parked car has been locked before leaving it, turning lights on and off a set number of times before exiting a room, repeatedly washing hands at regular intervals throughout the day, touching objects a certain number of times before leaving a room, or walking in a certain routine way. Physical symptoms may include those brought on from anxieties and unwanted thoughts, as well as  tics  or  Parkinson's disease -like symptoms: rigidity, tremor, jerking arm movements, or involuntary movements of the limbs.   Formal diagnosis may be performed by a  psychologist , a  psychiatrist  or  psychoanalyst . OCD sufferers are aware that their thoughts and behavior are not rational, [ 6 ]  but they feel bound to comply with them to fend off feelings of panic or dread. Although everyone may experience unpleasant thoughts at one time or another, these are short-lived and fade away in time. [ 7 ]  For people with OCD, the thoughts are intrusive and persistent, and can cause them great anxiety and distress. [ 8 ]   Intrusive thoughts  are unwelcome, involuntary thoughts, images or unpleasant ideas that may become  obsessions , are upsetting or distressing, and can be difficult to be free of and manage. [ 9 ]  As with other forms of OCD, the awareness of the irrationality of these thoughts can be frustrating as the individual wishes to stop them but cannot. Intrusive thoughts, urges, and images are of inappropriate things at inappropriate times, usually falling into three categories: inappropriate aggressive thoughts, inappropriate sexual thoughts, and blasphemous religious thoughts. [ 10 ]  Most people experience these thoughts; when they are associated with OCD or  depression , they may become paralyzing,  anxiety -provoking, and persistent. Many people experience the type of unpleasant or unwanted thoughts that people with more troubling intrusive thoughts have, but most people are able to dismiss these thoughts. [ 9 ]  When intrusive thoughts co-occur with OCD, patients are less capable of ignoring the unpleasant thoughts and may pay undue attention to them, causing the thoughts to become more frequent and distressing. [ 9 ]   The common underlying theme to the diverse intrusive thoughts is summarised by Bruce  et al  with the example, ""What if I were to snap, lose control of myself, and do something totally uncharacteristic of me--perhaps even without my knowing it--that results in harm to myself or someone else?"" [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   OCD without Overt compulsions   A major subtype of OCD is OCD without overt compulsions. [ 12 ]  OCD without overt compulsions is often referred to as ""pure-O"" by laymen and sufferers of this disorder. The term is a bit of a misnomer, however, since OCD without overt compulsions is no more ""pure"" than any other form of OCD. Nonetheless, OCD without overt compulsions represents a major subtype of OCD with some of the estimates as high 50-60%. [ 13 ]  Rather than engaging in observable rituals and compulsions, the person with OCD without overt compulsions engages in all manner of mental neutralizing behaviours (i.e. ""covert"" compulsions).   Intrusive thoughts may involve violent obsessions about hurting others or oneself. [ 14 ]  They can include such thoughts as harming an innocent child, jumping from a bridge, mountain or the top of a tall building, urges to jump in front of a train or automobile, and urges to push another in front of a train or automobile. [ 10 ]  A survey of healthy college students found that virtually all of them had intrusive thoughts from time to time, including imagining or wishing harm upon a family member or friend, impulses to attack or kill a small child, or animal, or shout something rude or violent. [ 15 ]   The possibility that most patients suffering from intrusive thoughts will ever act on those thoughts is low; patients who are experiencing intense guilt, anxiety, shame, and anger over bad thoughts are different from those who actually act on bad thoughts. The history of violent crime is dominated by those who feel no guilt or remorse; the very fact that someone is tormented by intrusive thoughts, and has never acted on them before, is an excellent predictor that they won't act upon the thoughts. According to Baer, a patient should be concerned that intrusive thoughts are dangerous if the person doesn't feel upset by the thoughts, rather finds them pleasurable; has ever acted on violent or sexual thoughts or urges; hears voices or sees things that others don't see; or feels uncontrollable irresistible anger. [ 16 ]   Sexual obsessions may involve intrusive thoughts or images of ""kissing, hugging a lot, touching, fondling, oral sex, anal sex, intercourse, and rape"" with ""strangers, acquaintances, parents, children, family members, friends, coworkers, animals and religious figures"", involving ""heterosexual or homosexual content"" with persons of any age. [ 17 ]  Like other intrusive, unpleasant thoughts or images, most people have some inappropriate sexual thoughts at times, but people with OCD may attach significance to the unwanted sexual thoughts, generating anxiety and distress. The doubt that accompanies OCD leads to uncertainty regarding whether one might act on the bad thoughts, resulting in self-criticism or loathing. [ 17 ]     [ edit ]   OCD with Overt Compulsions   Other major subtypes of OCD frequently revolve around washing or checking; some sufferers may fear the presence of human body secretions such as saliva, blood, semen, sweat, tears, vomit, or mucus, or excretions such as urine or feces. Some OCD sufferers even fear that the soap they are using is contaminated. [ 18 ]  These anxiety-driven fears often result in various compulsive cleaning behaviours, and may cause a person to experience significant distress, which may make it difficult for a person with OCD to tolerate a workplace, venture into public locations, or conduct normal social relationships.   Symptoms related to performing tasks may include repeated hand washing [ 19 ]  or clearing of the throat; specific counting systems or counting of steps; doing repetitive actionsmore generally, this can involve an obsession with numbers or types of numbers (e.g., odd numbers). For example, when somebody suffering from OCD leaves the house, they might tap the door knob 9 times and if they don't they will go into distress, panic and even at certain times, they will pass out. These obsessive behaviors can cause individuals to feel psychological distress, because they are very concerned about having ""made mistakes"" in the number of steps that they have taken, or the number of stairs on a staircase. For some people with OCD, these obsessive counting and re-counting tasks, along with the attendant anxiety and fear, can take hours of each day, which can make it hard for the person to fulfill their work, family, or social roles. In some cases, these behaviors can also cause adverse physical symptoms: people who obsessively wash their hands with  antibacterial soap  and hot water (to remove germs) can make their skin red and raw with  dermatitis . [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Related conditions   OCD is often confused with the separate condition  obsessive-compulsive personality disorder . The two are not the same condition, however. OCD is  ego  dystonic , meaning that the disorder is incompatible with the sufferer's self-concept.  [ 20 ] [ 21 ]  Because disorders that are ego dystonic go against an individual's perception of his/herself, they tend to cause much distress. OCPD, on the other hand, is  ego syntonic marked by the individual's acceptance that the characteristics displayed as a result of this disorder are compatible with his/her self-image. Ego syntonic disorders understandably cause no distress. Persons suffering from OCD are often aware that their behavior is not rational and are unhappy about their obsessions but nevertheless feel compelled by them. Persons with OCPD are not aware of anything abnormal about themselves; they will readily explain why their actions are rational, and it is usually impossible to convince them otherwise. Persons with OCD are ridden with  anxiety ; persons who suffer from OCPD, by contrast, tend to derive pleasure from their obsessions or compulsions. [ 22 ]  This is a significant difference between these disorders.   Equally frequently, these rationalizations do not apply to the overall behavior, but to each instance individually; for example, a person compulsively checking their front door may argue that the time taken and stress caused by one more check of the front door is considerably less than the time and stress associated with being robbed, and thus the check is the better option. In practice, after that check, the individual is  still  not sure, and it is  still  better in terms of time and stress to do one more check, and this reasoning can continue as long as necessary.   Some OCD sufferers exhibit what is known as  overvalued ideas . In such cases, the person with OCD will truly be uncertain whether the fears that cause them to perform their compulsions are irrational or not. After some discussion, it is possible to convince the individual that their fears may be unfounded. It may be more difficult to do  ERP therapy  on such patients, because they may be, at least initially, unwilling to cooperate. For this reason OCD has often been likened to a disease of pathological doubt, in which the sufferer, while not usually  delusional , is often unable to realize fully what sorts of dreaded events are reasonably possible and which are not. There are severe cases when the sufferer has an unshakeable belief within the context of OCD which is difficult to differentiate from psychosis. [ 23 ]   OCD is different from behaviors such as  gambling  addiction and  overeating . People with these disorders typically experience at least some pleasure from their activity; OCD sufferers do not actively want to perform their compulsive tasks, and experience no pleasure from doing so. OCD is placed in the anxiety class of  mental illness , but like many  chronic stress disorders  it can lead to  clinical depression  over time. The constant stress of the condition can cause sufferers to develop a deadening of spirit, a numbing frustration, or sense of hopelessness. OCD's effects on day-to-day lifeparticularly its substantial consumption of timecan produce difficulties with work, finances and relationships. There is no known cure for OCD as of yet, but there are a number of successful treatment options available.     [ edit ]   Related/Spectrum disorders   People with OCD may be diagnosed with other conditions, such as  generalized anxiety disorder ,  anorexia nervosa ,  social anxiety disorder ,  bulimia nervosa ,  Tourette syndrome ,  Asperger syndrome ,  compulsive skin picking ,  body dysmorphic disorder ,  trichotillomania , and (as already mentioned)  obsessive-compulsive personality disorder . There is some research demonstrating a link between  drug addiction  and OCD as well. Many who suffer from OCD also suffer from  panic attacks . There is a higher risk of drug addiction among those with any anxiety disorder (possibly as a way of  coping  with the heightened levels of  anxiety ), but drug addiction among OCD patients may serve as a type of  compulsive behavior  and not just as a coping mechanism.  Depression  is also extremely prevalent among sufferers of OCD. One explanation for the high depression rate among OCD populations was posited by Mineka, Watson, and Clark (1998), who explained that people with OCD (or any other  anxiety disorder ) may feel depressed because of an ""out of control"" type of feeling. [ 24 ]   Some cases are thought to be caused at least in part by childhood  streptococcal  infections and are termed  PANDAS  (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infections). The streptococcal  antibodies  become involved in an  autoimmune  process. Though this idea is not set in stone, if it does prove to be true, there is cause to believe that OCD can to some very small extent be ""caught"" via exposure to strep throat (just as one may catch a cold). However, if OCD is caused by bacteria, this provides hope that  antibiotics  may eventually be used to treat or prevent it. [ 25 ]     [ edit ]   Causes     [ edit ]   Psychological   Scientists studying obsessive-compulsive disorder generally agree that both psychological and biological factors play a role in causing the disorder, although they differ in their degree of emphasis upon either type of factor.   From the 14th to the 16th century in Europe, it was believed that people who experienced blasphemous, sexual, or other obsessive thoughts were  possessed  by the  Devil . [ 26 ]  Based on this reasoning, treatment involved banishing the ""evil"" from the ""possessed"" person through  exorcism . [ 27 ]  In the early 1910s,  Sigmund Freud  attributed obsessive-compulsive behavior to unconscious conflicts which manifested as symptoms. [ 27 ]  Freud describes the clinical history of a typical case of ""touching phobia"" as starting in early childhood, when the person has a strong desire to touch an item. In response, the person develops an ""external prohibition"" against this type of touching. However, this ""prohibition does not succeed in abolishing"" the desire to touch; all it can do is repress the desire and ""force it into the unconscious"". [ 28 ]   The cognitive-behavioral model suggests that compulsive behaviour is carried out to remove anxiety-provoking intrusive thoughts. Unfortunately this only brings about temporary relief as the thought re-emerges. Each time the behaviour occurs it is negatively reinforced (see  Reinforcement ) by the relief from anxiety, thereby explaining why the dysfunctional activity increases and generalises (extends to other, related stimuli) over a period of time. For example, after touching a door-knob a person might have the thought that they may develop a disease as a result of contamination. They then experience anxiety, which is relieved when they wash their hands. This might be followed by the thought ""but did I wash them properly?"" causing an increase in anxiety once more, the hand-washing once again rewarded by the removal of anxiety (albeit briefly) and the cycle being repeated when thoughts of contamination re-occur. The distressing thoughts might then spread to fear of contamination from e.g. a chair (someone might have touched the chair after touching the door handle).     [ edit ]   Biological   There are many different theories about the cause of obsessive-compulsive disorder. The majority of researchers believe that there is some type of abnormality with the  neurotransmitter   serotonin , among other possible psychological or biological abnormalities; however, it is possible that this activity is the brain's  response  to OCD, and not its cause.             This article  may contain  original research  or  unverified claims . Please  improve the article  by adding  references . See the  talk page  for details.  (January 2009)       Serotonin is thought to have a role in regulating anxiety, though it is also thought to be involved in such processes as  sleep  and  memory  function. In order to send chemical messages, serotonin must bind to the  receptor  sites located on the neighboring nerve cell. It is hypothesized that OCD sufferers may have blocked or damaged receptor sites that prevent serotonin from functioning to its full potential. This suggestion is supported by the fact that many OCD patients benefit from the use of  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  (SSRIs)a class of  antidepressant  medications that allow for more serotonin to be readily available to other nerve cells. [ 29 ]  For more about this class of drugs, see the  section about potential treatments  for OCD.   The  Stanford University School of Medicine  OCD webpage states, ""Although the causes of the disorder still elude us, the recent identification of children with OCD caused by an autoimmune response to  Group A streptococcal infection  promises to bring increased understanding of the disorder's pathogenesis."" [ 30 ]   Recent research has revealed a possible  genetic mutation  that could help to cause OCD. Researchers funded by the  National Institutes of Health  have found a  mutation  in the human serotonin transporter gene,  hSERT , in unrelated families with OCD. Moreover, in his study of identical twins, Rasmussen (1994) produced data that supported the idea that there is a ""heritable factor for neurotic anxiety"". [ 31 ]  In addition, he noted that environmental factors also play a role in how these anxiety symptoms are expressed. However, various studies on this topic are still being conducted and the presence of a genetic link is not yet definitely established.   Another possible genetic cause of OCD was discovered in August 2007 by scientists at  Duke University Medical Center  in North Carolina. They genetically engineered mice that lacked a  gene  called  SAPAP3 . This  protein  is highly expressed in the  striatum , an area of the  brain  linked to planning and the initiation of appropriate actions. The mice spent three times as much time grooming themselves as ordinary mice, to the point that their fur fell off. [ 32 ]   Using tools like  positron emission tomography  (PET scans), it has been shown that those with OCD tend to have brain activity that differs from those who do not have this disorder. [ 33 ]  A popular explanation for OCD is that offered in the book  Brain Lock  by Jeffrey Schwartz, which suggests that OCD is caused by the part of the brain that is responsible for translating complex intentions (e.g., ""I will pick up this cup"") into fundamental actions (e.g., ""move arm forward, rotate hand 15 degrees, etc."") failing to correctly communicate the chemical message that an action has been completed. This is perceived as a feeling of doubt and incompleteness, which then leads the individual to attempt to consciously deconstruct their own prior behaviora process which induces anxiety in most people, even those without OCD [ citation needed ] .   It has been theorized that a miscommunication between the  orbitofrontal cortex , the  caudate nucleus , and the  thalamus  may be a factor in the explanation of OCD. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is the first part of the brain to notice whether or not something is wrong. [ vague ]  When the OFC notices that something is wrong, it sends an initial ""worry signal"" to the thalamus. When the thalamus receives this signal, it in turn sends signals back to the OFC to interpret the worrying event. The caudate nucleus lies between the OFC and the thalamus and prevents the initial worry signal from being sent back to the thalamus after it has already been received. However, it is suggested that in those with OCD, the caudate nucleus does not function properly, and therefore does not prevent this initial signal from recurring. This causes the thalamus to become hyperactive and creates a virtually never-ending loop of worry signals being sent back and forth between the OFC and the thalamus. The OFC responds by increasing anxiety and engaging in  compulsive behaviors  in an attempt to relieve this apprehension. [ 29 ]  This overactivity of the OFC is shown to be attenuated in patients who have successfully responded to  SSRI  medication. The increased stimulation of the  serotonin  receptors  5-HT2A  and  5-HT2C  in the OFC is believed to cause this inhibition.  [ 34 ]   Some research has discovered an association between a type of size abnormality in different  brain structures  and the predisposition to develop OCD. Through the use of  magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI), researchers at  Cambridge's Brain Mapping Unit  were able to discover distinctive patterns in the brain structure of individuals with OCD and their close family members.  [ 35 ]  This is the first instance in which it has been demonstrated that those with a familial risk of developing OCD have anatomical differences when compared with ordinary individuals. The discovery of these structural differences in the area of the brain associated with stopping  motor response  may ultimately aid researchers who seek to determine which genes contribute to the development of OCD.   In some patients, the consumption of  caffeine  may make OCD symptoms worse.  [ 36 ]     [ edit ]   Demographics and other statistics   In a 1980 study of 20,000 adults from  New Haven ,  Baltimore ,  St. Louis ,  Durham , and  Los Angeles , the lifetime prevalence rate of OCD for both sexes was recorded at 2.5 percent. Education also appears to be a factor. The lifetime prevalence of OCD is lower for those who have graduated high school than for those who have not (1.9 percent versus 3.4 percent). However, in the case of college education, lifetime prevalence is higher for those who graduate with a degree (3.1 percent) than it is for those who have only some college background (2.4 percent). As far as age is concerned, the onset of OCD usually ranges from the late teenage years until the mid-20s in both sexes, but the age of onset tends to be slightly younger in males than in females. [ 37 ]   It has been alleged that sufferers are generally of above-average  intelligence , as the very nature of the disorder necessitates complicated thinking patterns [ 38 ] .     [ edit ]   Treatment   According to the Expert Consensus Guidelines for the Treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder,  behavioral therapy  (BT),  cognitive therapy  (CT), and  medications  are first-line treatments for OCD.  Psychodynamic psychotherapy  may help in managing some aspects of the disorder, but there are no controlled studies that demonstrate effectiveness of  psychoanalysis  or  dynamic psychotherapy  in OCD. [ 39 ]     [ edit ]   Behavioral therapy   The specific technique used in BT/CBT is called  exposure and ritual prevention  (also known as "" exposure and response prevention "") or ERP; this involves gradually learning to tolerate the anxiety associated with not performing the ritual behavior. At first, for example, someone might touch something only very mildly ""contaminated"" (such as a tissue that has been touched by another tissue that has been touched by the end of a toothpick that has touched a book that came from a ""contaminated"" location, such as a school.) That is the ""exposure"". The ""ritual prevention"" is not washing. Another example might be leaving the house and checking the lock only once (exposure) without going back and checking again (ritual prevention). The person fairly quickly  habituates  to the anxiety-producing situation and discovers that their anxiety level has dropped considerably; they can then progress to touching something more ""contaminated"" or not checking the lock at allagain, without performing the ritual behavior of washing or checking.   Exposure ritual/response prevention has been demonstrated to be the most effective treatment for OCD. It has generally been accepted that  psychotherapy , in combination with  psychotropic medication , is more effective than either option alone. However, more recent studies have shown no difference in outcomes for those treated with the combination of medicine and CBT versus CBT alone. [ 40 ]   Recently it has been reported simultaneous administration of D-Cycloserin (an antibiotic) substantially improves effectiveness of Exposure and Response prevention. [ 41 ]     [ edit ]   Medication   Medications as treatment include  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  (SSRIs) such as  paroxetine (Seroxat, Paxil, Xetanor, ParoMerck, Rexetin) ,  sertraline (Zoloft, Stimuloton) ,  fluoxetine (Prozac, Bioxetin) ,  escitalopram  (Lexapro), and  fluvoxamine (Luvox)  as well as the  tricyclic antidepressants , in particular  clomipramine (Anafranil) . SSRIs prevent excess  serotonin  from being pumped back into the original  neuron  that released it. Instead, serotonin can then bind to the  receptor  sites of nearby neurons and send chemical messages or signals that can help regulate the excessive  anxiety  and obsessive thoughts. In some treatment-resistant cases, a combination of  clomipramine  and an SSRI has shown to be effective even when neither drug on its own has been efficacious.   Benzodiazepines  are also used in treatment. It's not uncommon to administer this class of drugs during the ""latency period"" for SSRIs or as synergistic adjunct long-term. Although widely prescribed, benzodiazepines have not been demonstrated as an effective treatment for OCD and may be habit-forming in those with a history of substance abuse. [ 42 ]   Serotonergic   antidepressants  typically take longer to show benefit in OCD than with most other disorders which they are used to treat, as it is common for 23 months to elapse before any tangible improvement is noticed. In addition to this, the treatment usually requires high doses.  Fluoxetine , for example, is usually prescribed in doses of 20 mg per day for clinical depression, whereas with OCD the dose will often range from 20 mg to 80 mg or higher, if necessary. In most cases  antidepressant therapy  alone will only provide a partial reduction in symptoms, even in cases that are not deemed treatment-resistant. Much current research is devoted to the therapeutic potential of the agents that effect the release of the neurotransmitter  glutamate  or the binding to its receptors. These include  riluzole ,  memantine ,  gabapentin (Neurontin)  and  lamotrigine (Lamictal) .   Low doses of the newer  atypical antipsychotics   olanzapine (Zyprexa) ,  quetiapine (Seroquel) ,  ziprasidone  and  risperidone (Risperdal)  have also been found to be useful as adjuncts in the treatment of OCD. The use of  antipsychotics  in OCD must be undertaken carefully, however, since, although there is very strong evidence that at low doses they are beneficial (most likely due to their  dopamine receptor   antagonism ), at high doses these same antipsychotics have proven to cause dramatic obsessive-compulsive symptoms even in those patients who do not normally have OCD. This can be due to the antagonism of  5-HT2A receptors  becoming very prominent at these doses and outweighing the benefits of  dopamine  antagonism. However antidepressant mirtazapine which is a 5-HT2A antagonist has shown to be of benefit to OCD patients [ 43 ] . Another point that must be noted with antipsychotic treatment is that SSRIs inhibit the chief  enzyme  that is responsible for  metabolising  antipsychotics CYP2D6 so the dose will be effectively higher than expected when these are combined with SSRIs. Also, it must be noted that antipsychotic treatment should be considered as augmentation treatment when SSRI treatment does not bring positive results.     [ edit ]   Alternative drug treatments   The naturally occurring sugar  inositol  has been suggested as a treatment for OCD [ 44 ] , as it appears to modulate the actions of serotonin and reverse  desensitisation  of  neurotransmitter  receptors.  St John's Wort  has been claimed to be of benefit due to its (non-selective) serotonin re-uptake inhibiting qualities [ citations needed ] , although a double-blind study using a flexible-dose schedule (600-1800 mg/day) found no difference between St John's Wort and a placebo [ 45 ] .   Nutrition deficiencies  may also contribute to OCD and other  mental disorders .  Vitamin  and mineral supplements may aid in such disorders and provide  nutrients  necessary for proper mental functioning [ 46 ] .   Opioids  may significantly reduce OCD symptoms, though their use is not sanctioned for treatment due to  physical dependence  and long term drug tolerance [ citations needed ] . Tramadol is an atypical opioid that appears to provide the anti-OCD effects of an  opiate  and inhibit the  re-uptake  of serotonin (in addition to  norepinephrine ) [ 47 ] .   Tryptamine   alkaloid   psilocybin  has been attempted as treatment [ 48 ] . There are reports that other  hallucinogens  such as  LSD  and  peyote  have produced similar effects [ citations needed ] . It has been hypothesised that this effect may be due to stimulation of  5-HT2A receptors  and, less significantly,  5-HT2C receptors ; this causes an inhibitory effect on the  orbitofrontal cortex , an area of the brain in which  hyperactivity  has been strongly associated with OCD [ 49 ] .   Regular  nicotine  treatment may ameliorate symptoms of OCD, although the  pharmacodynamical  mechanism by which this is achieved is not yet known, and more detailed studies are needed to fully confirm this  hypothesis [ 50 ] .     [ edit ]   Psycho-surgery   For some, neither medication, support groups nor psychological treatments are helpful in alleviating obsessive-compulsive symptoms. These patients may choose to undergo  psychosurgery  as a last resort. In this procedure, a surgical  lesion  is made in an area of the brain (the  cingulate bundle ). In one study, 30% of participants benefited significantly from this procedure. [ 8 ]   Deep-brain stimulation  and  vagus nerve stimulation  are possible surgical options which do not require the destruction of  brain tissue , although their efficacy has not been conclusively demonstrated.   In the US, psychosurgery for OCD is a treatment of last resort and will not be performed until the patient has failed several attempts at medication (at the full dosage) with augmentation, and many months of intensive  cognitive-behavioral therapy  with exposure and ritual/response prevention. [ 51 ]  Likewise, in the UK, psychosurgery cannot be performed unless a course of treatment from a suitably qualified cognitive-behavioural therapist has been carried out.     [ edit ]   Neuropsychiatry   Main article:  Neuropsychiatry   OCD primarily involves the  brain regions  of the  striatum , the  orbitofrontal cortex  and the  cingulate cortex . OCD involves several different  receptors , mostly  H 2 ,  M 4 ,  NK 1 ,  NMDA , and non-NMDA  glutamate receptors . [ citation needed ]  The receptors  5-HT 1D ,  5-HT 2C , and the   opioid receptor  exert a secondary effect. The H 2 , M 4 , NK 1 , and  non-NMDA glutamate  receptors are active in the striatum, whereas the  NMDA receptors  are active in the cingulate cortex.   The activity of certain receptors is positively correlated to the severity of OCD, whereas the activity of certain other receptors is negatively correlated to the severity of OCD. Correlations where activity is positively correlated to severity include the histamine receptor ( H 2 ); the Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor( M 4 ); the Tachykinin receptor ( NK 1 ); and non-NMDA  glutamate receptors . Correlations where activity is negatively correlated to severity include the NMDA receptor ( NMDA ); the Mu opioid receptor (  opioid ); and two types of 5-HT receptors ( 5-HT 1D  and  5-HT 2C ) The central dysfunction of OCD may involve the receptors nk1, non-NMDA  glutamate  receptors, and NMDA, whereas the other receptors could simply exert secondary modulatory effects.   Pharmaceuticals that act directly on those core mechanisms are  aprepitant  (nk1 antagonist),  riluzole  (glutamate release inhibitor), and  tautomycin  (NMDA receptor sensitizer). Also, the anti-Alzheimer's drug  memantine  is being studied by the  OC Foundation  in its efficacy in reducing OCD symptoms due to it being an  NMDA antagonist . One case study published in  The American Journal of Psychiatry  suggests that ""memantine may be an option for treatment-resistant OCD, but controlled studies are needed to substantiate this observation."" [ 52 ]  The drugs that are popularly used to fight OCD lack full efficacy because they do not act upon what are believed to be the core mechanisms. Many trials are currently underway to investigate the efficacy of a variety of agents that affect these 'core' neurotransmitters, particularly glutamatergic agents. [2]     [ edit ]   Notable cases     British poet, essayist, and lexicographer  Samuel Johnson  is an example of a historical figure with a  retrospective diagnosis  of OCD. He had elaborate rituals for crossing the thresholds of doorways, repeatedly walked up and down staircases counting the steps, and had compulsions regarding repetitive prayer which were most likely a form of religious scrupulosity. [ 53 ] [ 54 ] [ 55 ]       American aviator and filmmaker  Howard Hughes  is known to have suffered from OCD and it is believed that his mother may have also been a sufferer. Friends of Hughes have mentioned his obsession with minor flaws in clothing and he is reported to have had a great fear of germs, common among OCD patients. [ 56 ]  He did also suffer from Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) due to an aviation accident in which he was severely injured. This resulted in him becoming reclusive later in life.       English footballer  David Beckham  has been outspoken regarding his struggle with OCD. He has told media that he has to count all his clothes, and that magazines have to lie in a straight line. No more than three soda cans are allowed in his refrigerator, and if there are any more at home they have to be placed in a cupboard. He has explained that the reason he gets more tattoos is that he feels addicted to the pain of the needle. In hotels, any books that are on a shelf must be placed in the drawer. He has expressed a desire to get help for his problems.

For other uses, see  OCD (disambiguation) .       Obsessive-compulsive disorder   Classification and external resources       ICD - 10   F 42.       Obsessive-compulsive disorder  ( OCD ) is a  mental disorder  most commonly characterized by  intrusive , repetitive thoughts resulting in  compulsive behaviors  and mental acts that the person feels driven to perform, according to rules that must be applied rigidly, aimed at reducing  anxiety  by preventing some dreaded event or by resolving a more nebulous sense of tension. However, the likelihood that a dreaded event will occur, or the causal relationship between the performance of compulsions and the reduction of this likelihood, tends to be imagined or exaggerated.   OCD is the fourth most common mental disorder and is nearly as common as  asthma  and  diabetes mellitus . [ 1 ]  In the  United States , one in 50 adults has OCD. [ 2 ]  In severe cases, it affects a person's ability to function in everyday activities. The disorder often has a serious impact on the sufferer's (and their family's)  quality of life . Also, the psychological self-awareness of the  irrationality  of the disorder can be painful. For people with severe OCD, it may take several hours a day to carry out the compulsive acts.   The phrase ""obsessive-compulsive"" has become part of the English lexicon, and is often used in an informal or caricatured manner to describe someone who is meticulous,  perfectionistic , absorbed in a cause, or otherwise fixated on something or someone. [ 3 ]  Although these signs are often present in OCD, a person who exhibits them does not necessarily have OCD, and may instead have  obsessive-compulsive  personality  disorder  (OCPD) or some other condition.

The Quick Reference to the diagnostic criteria from DSM-IV-TR (2000) [ 4 ]  states six characteristics of obsessions and compulsions:     Obsessions       Recurrent and persistent thoughts,  impulses , or images that are experienced as intrusive and that cause marked anxiety or distress.   The thoughts, impulses, or images are not simply excessive worries about real-life problems.   The person attempts to ignore or suppress such thoughts, impulses, or images, or to neutralize them with some other thought or action.   The person recognizes that the obsessional thoughts, impulses, or images are a product of his or her own mind, and are not based in reality.       Compulsions       Repetitive behaviors or mental acts that the person feels driven to perform in response to an obsession, or according to rules that must be applied rigidly.   The behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing distress or preventing some dreaded event or situation; however, these behaviors or mental acts are not actually connected to the issue, or they are excessive.     In addition to these criteria, at some point during the course of the disorder, the individual must realize that his/her obsessions or compulsions are unreasonable or excessive. Moreover, the obsessions or compulsions must be time-consuming (taking up more than one hour per day), cause distress, or cause impairment in social, occupational, or school functioning. [ 4 ]  OCD often causes feelings similar to those of  depression .     [ edit ]   Symptoms and prevalence   OCD manifests in a variety of forms. Studies have placed the prevalence between one and three percent, although the prevalence of clinically recognized OCD is much lower, suggesting that many individuals with the disorder may not be diagnosed. [ 5 ]  The fact that many individuals do not seek treatment may be due in part to  stigma  associated with OCD. Another reason for not seeking treatment is that many sufferers of OCD do not realize that they have the condition.   The typical OCD sufferer performs tasks (or  compulsions ) to seek relief from obsession-related anxiety. To others, these tasks may appear odd and unnecessary. But for the sufferer, such tasks can feel critically important, and must be performed in particular ways to ward off dire consequences and to stop the  stress  from building up. Examples of these tasks are repeatedly checking that one's parked car has been locked before leaving it, turning lights on and off a set number of times before exiting a room, repeatedly washing hands at regular intervals throughout the day, touching objects a certain number of times before leaving a room, or walking in a certain routine way. Physical symptoms may include those brought on from anxieties and unwanted thoughts, as well as  tics  or  Parkinson's disease -like symptoms: rigidity, tremor, jerking arm movements, or involuntary movements of the limbs.   Formal diagnosis may be performed by a  psychologist , a  psychiatrist  or  psychoanalyst . OCD sufferers are aware that their thoughts and behavior are not rational, [ 6 ]  but they feel bound to comply with them to fend off feelings of panic or dread. Although everyone may experience unpleasant thoughts at one time or another, these are short-lived and fade away in time. [ 7 ]  For people with OCD, the thoughts are intrusive and persistent, and can cause them great anxiety and distress. [ 8 ]   Intrusive thoughts  are unwelcome, involuntary thoughts, images or unpleasant ideas that may become  obsessions , are upsetting or distressing, and can be difficult to be free of and manage. [ 9 ]  As with other forms of OCD, the awareness of the irrationality of these thoughts can be frustrating as the individual wishes to stop them but cannot. Intrusive thoughts, urges, and images are of inappropriate things at inappropriate times, usually falling into three categories: inappropriate aggressive thoughts, inappropriate sexual thoughts, and blasphemous religious thoughts. [ 10 ]  Most people experience these thoughts; when they are associated with OCD or  depression , they may become paralyzing,  anxiety -provoking, and persistent. Many people experience the type of unpleasant or unwanted thoughts that people with more troubling intrusive thoughts have, but most people are able to dismiss these thoughts. [ 9 ]  When intrusive thoughts co-occur with OCD, patients are less capable of ignoring the unpleasant thoughts and may pay undue attention to them, causing the thoughts to become more frequent and distressing. [ 9 ]   The common underlying theme to the diverse intrusive thoughts is summarised by Bruce  et al  with the example, ""What if I were to snap, lose control of myself, and do something totally uncharacteristic of me--perhaps even without my knowing it--that results in harm to myself or someone else?"" [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   OCD without Overt compulsions   A major subtype of OCD is OCD without overt compulsions. [ 12 ]  OCD without overt compulsions is often referred to as ""pure-O"" by laymen and sufferers of this disorder. The term is a bit of a misnomer, however, since OCD without overt compulsions is no more ""pure"" than any other form of OCD. Nonetheless, OCD without overt compulsions represents a major subtype of OCD with some of the estimates as high 50-60%. [ 13 ]  Rather than engaging in observable rituals and compulsions, the person with OCD without overt compulsions engages in all manner of mental neutralizing behaviours (i.e. ""covert"" compulsions).   Intrusive thoughts may involve violent obsessions about hurting others or oneself. [ 14 ]  They can include such thoughts as harming an innocent child, jumping from a bridge, mountain or the top of a tall building, urges to jump in front of a train or automobile, and urges to push another in front of a train or automobile. [ 10 ]  A survey of healthy college students found that virtually all of them had intrusive thoughts from time to time, including imagining or wishing harm upon a family member or friend, impulses to attack or kill a small child, or animal, or shout something rude or violent. [ 15 ]   The possibility that most patients suffering from intrusive thoughts will ever act on those thoughts is low; patients who are experiencing intense guilt, anxiety, shame, and anger over bad thoughts are different from those who actually act on bad thoughts. The history of violent crime is dominated by those who feel no guilt or remorse; the very fact that someone is tormented by intrusive thoughts, and has never acted on them before, is an excellent predictor that they won't act upon the thoughts. According to Baer, a patient should be concerned that intrusive thoughts are dangerous if the person doesn't feel upset by the thoughts, rather finds them pleasurable; has ever acted on violent or sexual thoughts or urges; hears voices or sees things that others don't see; or feels uncontrollable irresistible anger. [ 16 ]   Sexual obsessions may involve intrusive thoughts or images of ""kissing, hugging a lot, touching, fondling, oral sex, anal sex, intercourse, and rape"" with ""strangers, acquaintances, parents, children, family members, friends, coworkers, animals and religious figures"", involving ""heterosexual or homosexual content"" with persons of any age. [ 17 ]  Like other intrusive, unpleasant thoughts or images, most people have some inappropriate sexual thoughts at times, but people with OCD may attach significance to the unwanted sexual thoughts, generating anxiety and distress. The doubt that accompanies OCD leads to uncertainty regarding whether one might act on the bad thoughts, resulting in self-criticism or loathing. [ 17 ]     [ edit ]   OCD with Overt Compulsions   Other major subtypes of OCD frequently revolve around washing or checking; some sufferers may fear the presence of human body secretions such as saliva, blood, semen, sweat, tears, vomit, or mucus, or excretions such as urine or feces. Some OCD sufferers even fear that the soap they are using is contaminated. [ 18 ]  These anxiety-driven fears often result in various compulsive cleaning behaviours, and may cause a person to experience significant distress, which may make it difficult for a person with OCD to tolerate a workplace, venture into public locations, or conduct normal social relationships.   Symptoms related to performing tasks may include repeated hand washing [ 19 ]  or clearing of the throat; specific counting systems or counting of steps; doing repetitive actionsmore generally, this can involve an obsession with numbers or types of numbers (e.g., odd numbers). For example, when somebody suffering from OCD leaves the house, they might tap the door knob 9 times and if they don't they will go into distress, panic and even at certain times, they will pass out. These obsessive behaviors can cause individuals to feel psychological distress, because they are very concerned about having ""made mistakes"" in the number of steps that they have taken, or the number of stairs on a staircase. For some people with OCD, these obsessive counting and re-counting tasks, along with the attendant anxiety and fear, can take hours of each day, which can make it hard for the person to fulfill their work, family, or social roles. In some cases, these behaviors can also cause adverse physical symptoms: people who obsessively wash their hands with  antibacterial soap  and hot water (to remove germs) can make their skin red and raw with  dermatitis . [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Related conditions   OCD is often confused with the separate condition  obsessive-compulsive personality disorder . The two are not the same condition, however. OCD is  ego  dystonic , meaning that the disorder is incompatible with the sufferer's self-concept.  [ 20 ] [ 21 ]  Because disorders that are ego dystonic go against an individual's perception of his/herself, they tend to cause much distress. OCPD, on the other hand, is  ego syntonic marked by the individual's acceptance that the characteristics displayed as a result of this disorder are compatible with his/her self-image. Ego syntonic disorders understandably cause no distress. Persons suffering from OCD are often aware that their behavior is not rational and are unhappy about their obsessions but nevertheless feel compelled by them. Persons with OCPD are not aware of anything abnormal about themselves; they will readily explain why their actions are rational, and it is usually impossible to convince them otherwise. Persons with OCD are ridden with  anxiety ; persons who suffer from OCPD, by contrast, tend to derive pleasure from their obsessions or compulsions. [ 22 ]  This is a significant difference between these disorders.   Equally frequently, these rationalizations do not apply to the overall behavior, but to each instance individually; for example, a person compulsively checking their front door may argue that the time taken and stress caused by one more check of the front door is considerably less than the time and stress associated with being robbed, and thus the check is the better option. In practice, after that check, the individual is  still  not sure, and it is  still  better in terms of time and stress to do one more check, and this reasoning can continue as long as necessary.   Some OCD sufferers exhibit what is known as  overvalued ideas . In such cases, the person with OCD will truly be uncertain whether the fears that cause them to perform their compulsions are irrational or not. After some discussion, it is possible to convince the individual that their fears may be unfounded. It may be more difficult to do  ERP therapy  on such patients, because they may be, at least initially, unwilling to cooperate. For this reason OCD has often been likened to a disease of pathological doubt, in which the sufferer, while not usually  delusional , is often unable to realize fully what sorts of dreaded events are reasonably possible and which are not. There are severe cases when the sufferer has an unshakeable belief within the context of OCD which is difficult to differentiate from psychosis. [ 23 ]   OCD is different from behaviors such as  gambling  addiction and  overeating . People with these disorders typically experience at least some pleasure from their activity; OCD sufferers do not actively want to perform their compulsive tasks, and experience no pleasure from doing so. OCD is placed in the anxiety class of  mental illness , but like many  chronic stress disorders  it can lead to  clinical depression  over time. The constant stress of the condition can cause sufferers to develop a deadening of spirit, a numbing frustration, or sense of hopelessness. OCD's effects on day-to-day lifeparticularly its substantial consumption of timecan produce difficulties with work, finances and relationships. There is no known cure for OCD as of yet, but there are a number of successful treatment options available.     [ edit ]   Related/Spectrum disorders   People with OCD may be diagnosed with other conditions, such as  generalized anxiety disorder ,  anorexia nervosa ,  social anxiety disorder ,  bulimia nervosa ,  Tourette syndrome ,  Asperger syndrome ,  compulsive skin picking ,  body dysmorphic disorder ,  trichotillomania , and (as already mentioned)  obsessive-compulsive personality disorder . There is some research demonstrating a link between  drug addiction  and OCD as well. Many who suffer from OCD also suffer from  panic attacks . There is a higher risk of drug addiction among those with any anxiety disorder (possibly as a way of  coping  with the heightened levels of  anxiety ), but drug addiction among OCD patients may serve as a type of  compulsive behavior  and not just as a coping mechanism.  Depression  is also extremely prevalent among sufferers of OCD. One explanation for the high depression rate among OCD populations was posited by Mineka, Watson, and Clark (1998), who explained that people with OCD (or any other  anxiety disorder ) may feel depressed because of an ""out of control"" type of feeling. [ 24 ]   Some cases are thought to be caused at least in part by childhood  streptococcal  infections and are termed  PANDAS  (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infections). The streptococcal  antibodies  become involved in an  autoimmune  process. Though this idea is not set in stone, if it does prove to be true, there is cause to believe that OCD can to some very small extent be ""caught"" via exposure to strep throat (just as one may catch a cold). However, if OCD is caused by bacteria, this provides hope that  antibiotics  may eventually be used to treat or prevent it. [ 25 ]     [ edit ]   Causes     [ edit ]   Psychological   Scientists studying obsessive-compulsive disorder generally agree that both psychological and biological factors play a role in causing the disorder, although they differ in their degree of emphasis upon either type of factor.   From the 14th to the 16th century in Europe, it was believed that people who experienced blasphemous, sexual, or other obsessive thoughts were  possessed  by the  Devil . [ 26 ]  Based on this reasoning, treatment involved banishing the ""evil"" from the ""possessed"" person through  exorcism . [ 27 ]  In the early 1910s,  Sigmund Freud  attributed obsessive-compulsive behavior to unconscious conflicts which manifested as symptoms. [ 27 ]  Freud describes the clinical history of a typical case of ""touching phobia"" as starting in early childhood, when the person has a strong desire to touch an item. In response, the person develops an ""external prohibition"" against this type of touching. However, this ""prohibition does not succeed in abolishing"" the desire to touch; all it can do is repress the desire and ""force it into the unconscious"". [ 28 ]   The cognitive-behavioral model suggests that compulsive behaviour is carried out to remove anxiety-provoking intrusive thoughts. Unfortunately this only brings about temporary relief as the thought re-emerges. Each time the behaviour occurs it is negatively reinforced (see  Reinforcement ) by the relief from anxiety, thereby explaining why the dysfunctional activity increases and generalises (extends to other, related stimuli) over a period of time. For example, after touching a door-knob a person might have the thought that they may develop a disease as a result of contamination. They then experience anxiety, which is relieved when they wash their hands. This might be followed by the thought ""but did I wash them properly?"" causing an increase in anxiety once more, the hand-washing once again rewarded by the removal of anxiety (albeit briefly) and the cycle being repeated when thoughts of contamination re-occur. The distressing thoughts might then spread to fear of contamination from e.g. a chair (someone might have touched the chair after touching the door handle).     [ edit ]   Biological   There are many different theories about the cause of obsessive-compulsive disorder. The majority of researchers believe that there is some type of abnormality with the  neurotransmitter   serotonin , among other possible psychological or biological abnormalities; however, it is possible that this activity is the brain's  response  to OCD, and not its cause.             This article  may contain  original research  or  unverified claims . Please  improve the article  by adding  references . See the  talk page  for details.  (January 2009)       Serotonin is thought to have a role in regulating anxiety, though it is also thought to be involved in such processes as  sleep  and  memory  function. In order to send chemical messages, serotonin must bind to the  receptor  sites located on the neighboring nerve cell. It is hypothesized that OCD sufferers may have blocked or damaged receptor sites that prevent serotonin from functioning to its full potential. This suggestion is supported by the fact that many OCD patients benefit from the use of  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  (SSRIs)a class of  antidepressant  medications that allow for more serotonin to be readily available to other nerve cells. [ 29 ]  For more about this class of drugs, see the  section about potential treatments  for OCD.   The  Stanford University School of Medicine  OCD webpage states, ""Although the causes of the disorder still elude us, the recent identification of children with OCD caused by an autoimmune response to  Group A streptococcal infection  promises to bring increased understanding of the disorder's pathogenesis."" [ 30 ]   Recent research has revealed a possible  genetic mutation  that could help to cause OCD. Researchers funded by the  National Institutes of Health  have found a  mutation  in the human serotonin transporter gene,  hSERT , in unrelated families with OCD. Moreover, in his study of identical twins, Rasmussen (1994) produced data that supported the idea that there is a ""heritable factor for neurotic anxiety"". [ 31 ]  In addition, he noted that environmental factors also play a role in how these anxiety symptoms are expressed. However, various studies on this topic are still being conducted and the presence of a genetic link is not yet definitely established.   Another possible genetic cause of OCD was discovered in August 2007 by scientists at  Duke University Medical Center  in North Carolina. They genetically engineered mice that lacked a  gene  called  SAPAP3 . This  protein  is highly expressed in the  striatum , an area of the  brain  linked to planning and the initiation of appropriate actions. The mice spent three times as much time grooming themselves as ordinary mice, to the point that their fur fell off. [ 32 ]   Using tools like  positron emission tomography  (PET scans), it has been shown that those with OCD tend to have brain activity that differs from those who do not have this disorder. [ 33 ]  A popular explanation for OCD is that offered in the book  Brain Lock  by Jeffrey Schwartz, which suggests that OCD is caused by the part of the brain that is responsible for translating complex intentions (e.g., ""I will pick up this cup"") into fundamental actions (e.g., ""move arm forward, rotate hand 15 degrees, etc."") failing to correctly communicate the chemical message that an action has been completed. This is perceived as a feeling of doubt and incompleteness, which then leads the individual to attempt to consciously deconstruct their own prior behaviora process which induces anxiety in most people, even those without OCD [ citation needed ] .   It has been theorized that a miscommunication between the  orbitofrontal cortex , the  caudate nucleus , and the  thalamus  may be a factor in the explanation of OCD. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is the first part of the brain to notice whether or not something is wrong. [ vague ]  When the OFC notices that something is wrong, it sends an initial ""worry signal"" to the thalamus. When the thalamus receives this signal, it in turn sends signals back to the OFC to interpret the worrying event. The caudate nucleus lies between the OFC and the thalamus and prevents the initial worry signal from being sent back to the thalamus after it has already been received. However, it is suggested that in those with OCD, the caudate nucleus does not function properly, and therefore does not prevent this initial signal from recurring. This causes the thalamus to become hyperactive and creates a virtually never-ending loop of worry signals being sent back and forth between the OFC and the thalamus. The OFC responds by increasing anxiety and engaging in  compulsive behaviors  in an attempt to relieve this apprehension. [ 29 ]  This overactivity of the OFC is shown to be attenuated in patients who have successfully responded to  SSRI  medication. The increased stimulation of the  serotonin  receptors  5-HT2A  and  5-HT2C  in the OFC is believed to cause this inhibition.  [ 34 ]   Some research has discovered an association between a type of size abnormality in different  brain structures  and the predisposition to develop OCD. Through the use of  magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI), researchers at  Cambridge's Brain Mapping Unit  were able to discover distinctive patterns in the brain structure of individuals with OCD and their close family members.  [ 35 ]  This is the first instance in which it has been demonstrated that those with a familial risk of developing OCD have anatomical differences when compared with ordinary individuals. The discovery of these structural differences in the area of the brain associated with stopping  motor response  may ultimately aid researchers who seek to determine which genes contribute to the development of OCD.   In some patients, the consumption of  caffeine  may make OCD symptoms worse.  [ 36 ]     [ edit ]   Demographics and other statistics   In a 1980 study of 20,000 adults from  New Haven ,  Baltimore ,  St. Louis ,  Durham , and  Los Angeles , the lifetime prevalence rate of OCD for both sexes was recorded at 2.5 percent. Education also appears to be a factor. The lifetime prevalence of OCD is lower for those who have graduated high school than for those who have not (1.9 percent versus 3.4 percent). However, in the case of college education, lifetime prevalence is higher for those who graduate with a degree (3.1 percent) than it is for those who have only some college background (2.4 percent). As far as age is concerned, the onset of OCD usually ranges from the late teenage years until the mid-20s in both sexes, but the age of onset tends to be slightly younger in males than in females. [ 37 ]   It has been alleged that sufferers are generally of above-average  intelligence , as the very nature of the disorder necessitates complicated thinking patterns [ 38 ] .     [ edit ]   Treatment   According to the Expert Consensus Guidelines for the Treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder,  behavioral therapy  (BT),  cognitive therapy  (CT), and  medications  are first-line treatments for OCD.  Psychodynamic psychotherapy  may help in managing some aspects of the disorder, but there are no controlled studies that demonstrate effectiveness of  psychoanalysis  or  dynamic psychotherapy  in OCD. [ 39 ]     [ edit ]   Behavioral therapy   The specific technique used in BT/CBT is called  exposure and ritual prevention  (also known as "" exposure and response prevention "") or ERP; this involves gradually learning to tolerate the anxiety associated with not performing the ritual behavior. At first, for example, someone might touch something only very mildly ""contaminated"" (such as a tissue that has been touched by another tissue that has been touched by the end of a toothpick that has touched a book that came from a ""contaminated"" location, such as a school.) That is the ""exposure"". The ""ritual prevention"" is not washing. Another example might be leaving the house and checking the lock only once (exposure) without going back and checking again (ritual prevention). The person fairly quickly  habituates  to the anxiety-producing situation and discovers that their anxiety level has dropped considerably; they can then progress to touching something more ""contaminated"" or not checking the lock at allagain, without performing the ritual behavior of washing or checking.   Exposure ritual/response prevention has been demonstrated to be the most effective treatment for OCD. It has generally been accepted that  psychotherapy , in combination with  psychotropic medication , is more effective than either option alone. However, more recent studies have shown no difference in outcomes for those treated with the combination of medicine and CBT versus CBT alone. [ 40 ]   Recently it has been reported simultaneous administration of D-Cycloserin (an antibiotic) substantially improves effectiveness of Exposure and Response prevention. [ 41 ]     [ edit ]   Medication   Medications as treatment include  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  (SSRIs) such as  paroxetine (Seroxat, Paxil, Xetanor, ParoMerck, Rexetin) ,  sertraline (Zoloft, Stimuloton) ,  fluoxetine (Prozac, Bioxetin) ,  escitalopram  (Lexapro), and  fluvoxamine (Luvox)  as well as the  tricyclic antidepressants , in particular  clomipramine (Anafranil) . SSRIs prevent excess  serotonin  from being pumped back into the original  neuron  that released it. Instead, serotonin can then bind to the  receptor  sites of nearby neurons and send chemical messages or signals that can help regulate the excessive  anxiety  and obsessive thoughts. In some treatment-resistant cases, a combination of  clomipramine  and an SSRI has shown to be effective even when neither drug on its own has been efficacious.   Benzodiazepines  are also used in treatment. It's not uncommon to administer this class of drugs during the ""latency period"" for SSRIs or as synergistic adjunct long-term. Although widely prescribed, benzodiazepines have not been demonstrated as an effective treatment for OCD and may be habit-forming in those with a history of substance abuse. [ 42 ]   Serotonergic   antidepressants  typically take longer to show benefit in OCD than with most other disorders which they are used to treat, as it is common for 23 months to elapse before any tangible improvement is noticed. In addition to this, the treatment usually requires high doses.  Fluoxetine , for example, is usually prescribed in doses of 20 mg per day for clinical depression, whereas with OCD the dose will often range from 20 mg to 80 mg or higher, if necessary. In most cases  antidepressant therapy  alone will only provide a partial reduction in symptoms, even in cases that are not deemed treatment-resistant. Much current research is devoted to the therapeutic potential of the agents that effect the release of the neurotransmitter  glutamate  or the binding to its receptors. These include  riluzole ,  memantine ,  gabapentin (Neurontin)  and  lamotrigine (Lamictal) .   Low doses of the newer  atypical antipsychotics   olanzapine (Zyprexa) ,  quetiapine (Seroquel) ,  ziprasidone  and  risperidone (Risperdal)  have also been found to be useful as adjuncts in the treatment of OCD. The use of  antipsychotics  in OCD must be undertaken carefully, however, since, although there is very strong evidence that at low doses they are beneficial (most likely due to their  dopamine receptor   antagonism ), at high doses these same antipsychotics have proven to cause dramatic obsessive-compulsive symptoms even in those patients who do not normally have OCD. This can be due to the antagonism of  5-HT2A receptors  becoming very prominent at these doses and outweighing the benefits of  dopamine  antagonism. However antidepressant mirtazapine which is a 5-HT2A antagonist has shown to be of benefit to OCD patients [ 43 ] . Another point that must be noted with antipsychotic treatment is that SSRIs inhibit the chief  enzyme  that is responsible for  metabolising  antipsychotics CYP2D6 so the dose will be effectively higher than expected when these are combined with SSRIs. Also, it must be noted that antipsychotic treatment should be considered as augmentation treatment when SSRI treatment does not bring positive results.     [ edit ]   Alternative drug treatments   The naturally occurring sugar  inositol  has been suggested as a treatment for OCD [ 44 ] , as it appears to modulate the actions of serotonin and reverse  desensitisation  of  neurotransmitter  receptors.  St John's Wort  has been claimed to be of benefit due to its (non-selective) serotonin re-uptake inhibiting qualities [ citations needed ] , although a double-blind study using a flexible-dose schedule (600-1800 mg/day) found no difference between St John's Wort and a placebo [ 45 ] .   Nutrition deficiencies  may also contribute to OCD and other  mental disorders .  Vitamin  and mineral supplements may aid in such disorders and provide  nutrients  necessary for proper mental functioning [ 46 ] .   Opioids  may significantly reduce OCD symptoms, though their use is not sanctioned for treatment due to  physical dependence  and long term drug tolerance [ citations needed ] . Tramadol is an atypical opioid that appears to provide the anti-OCD effects of an  opiate  and inhibit the  re-uptake  of serotonin (in addition to  norepinephrine ) [ 47 ] .   Tryptamine   alkaloid   psilocybin  has been attempted as treatment [ 48 ] . There are reports that other  hallucinogens  such as  LSD  and  peyote  have produced similar effects [ citations needed ] . It has been hypothesised that this effect may be due to stimulation of  5-HT2A receptors  and, less significantly,  5-HT2C receptors ; this causes an inhibitory effect on the  orbitofrontal cortex , an area of the brain in which  hyperactivity  has been strongly associated with OCD [ 49 ] .   Regular  nicotine  treatment may ameliorate symptoms of OCD, although the  pharmacodynamical  mechanism by which this is achieved is not yet known, and more detailed studies are needed to fully confirm this  hypothesis [ 50 ] .     [ edit ]   Psycho-surgery   For some, neither medication, support groups nor psychological treatments are helpful in alleviating obsessive-compulsive symptoms. These patients may choose to undergo  psychosurgery  as a last resort. In this procedure, a surgical  lesion  is made in an area of the brain (the  cingulate bundle ). In one study, 30% of participants benefited significantly from this procedure. [ 8 ]   Deep-brain stimulation  and  vagus nerve stimulation  are possible surgical options which do not require the destruction of  brain tissue , although their efficacy has not been conclusively demonstrated.   In the US, psychosurgery for OCD is a treatment of last resort and will not be performed until the patient has failed several attempts at medication (at the full dosage) with augmentation, and many months of intensive  cognitive-behavioral therapy  with exposure and ritual/response prevention. [ 51 ]  Likewise, in the UK, psychosurgery cannot be performed unless a course of treatment from a suitably qualified cognitive-behavioural therapist has been carried out.     [ edit ]   Neuropsychiatry   Main article:  Neuropsychiatry   OCD primarily involves the  brain regions  of the  striatum , the  orbitofrontal cortex  and the  cingulate cortex . OCD involves several different  receptors , mostly  H 2 ,  M 4 ,  NK 1 ,  NMDA , and non-NMDA  glutamate receptors . [ citation needed ]  The receptors  5-HT 1D ,  5-HT 2C , and the   opioid receptor  exert a secondary effect. The H 2 , M 4 , NK 1 , and  non-NMDA glutamate  receptors are active in the striatum, whereas the  NMDA receptors  are active in the cingulate cortex.   The activity of certain receptors is positively correlated to the severity of OCD, whereas the activity of certain other receptors is negatively correlated to the severity of OCD. Correlations where activity is positively correlated to severity include the histamine receptor ( H 2 ); the Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor( M 4 ); the Tachykinin receptor ( NK 1 ); and non-NMDA  glutamate receptors . Correlations where activity is negatively correlated to severity include the NMDA receptor ( NMDA ); the Mu opioid receptor (  opioid ); and two types of 5-HT receptors ( 5-HT 1D  and  5-HT 2C ) The central dysfunction of OCD may involve the receptors nk1, non-NMDA  glutamate  receptors, and NMDA, whereas the other receptors could simply exert secondary modulatory effects.   Pharmaceuticals that act directly on those core mechanisms are  aprepitant  (nk1 antagonist),  riluzole  (glutamate release inhibitor), and  tautomycin  (NMDA receptor sensitizer). Also, the anti-Alzheimer's drug  memantine  is being studied by the  OC Foundation  in its efficacy in reducing OCD symptoms due to it being an  NMDA antagonist . One case study published in  The American Journal of Psychiatry  suggests that ""memantine may be an option for treatment-resistant OCD, but controlled studies are needed to substantiate this observation."" [ 52 ]  The drugs that are popularly used to fight OCD lack full efficacy because they do not act upon what are believed to be the core mechanisms. Many trials are currently underway to investigate the efficacy of a variety of agents that affect these 'core' neurotransmitters, particularly glutamatergic agents. [2]     [ edit ]   Notable cases     British poet, essayist, and lexicographer  Samuel Johnson  is an example of a historical figure with a  retrospective diagnosis  of OCD. He had elaborate rituals for crossing the thresholds of doorways, repeatedly walked up and down staircases counting the steps, and had compulsions regarding repetitive prayer which were most likely a form of religious scrupulosity. [ 53 ] [ 54 ] [ 55 ]       American aviator and filmmaker  Howard Hughes  is known to have suffered from OCD and it is believed that his mother may have also been a sufferer. Friends of Hughes have mentioned his obsession with minor flaws in clothing and he is reported to have had a great fear of germs, common among OCD patients. [ 56 ]  He did also suffer from Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) due to an aviation accident in which he was severely injured. This resulted in him becoming reclusive later in life.       English footballer  David Beckham  has been outspoken regarding his struggle with OCD. He has told media that he has to count all his clothes, and that magazines have to lie in a straight line. No more than three soda cans are allowed in his refrigerator, and if there are any more at home they have to be placed in a cupboard. He has explained that the reason he gets more tattoos is that he feels addicted to the pain of the needle. In hotels, any books that are on a shelf must be placed in the drawer. He has expressed a desire to get help for his problems.

For other uses, see  OCD (disambiguation) .       Obsessive-compulsive disorder   Classification and external resources       ICD - 10   F 42.       Obsessive-compulsive disorder  ( OCD ) is a  mental disorder  most commonly characterized by  intrusive , repetitive thoughts resulting in  compulsive behaviors  and mental acts that the person feels driven to perform, according to rules that must be applied rigidly, aimed at reducing  anxiety  by preventing some dreaded event or by resolving a more nebulous sense of tension. However, the likelihood that a dreaded event will occur, or the causal relationship between the performance of compulsions and the reduction of this likelihood, tends to be imagined or exaggerated.   OCD is the fourth most common mental disorder and is nearly as common as  asthma  and  diabetes mellitus . [ 1 ]  In the  United States , one in 50 adults has OCD. [ 2 ]  In severe cases, it affects a person's ability to function in everyday activities. The disorder often has a serious impact on the sufferer's (and their family's)  quality of life . Also, the psychological self-awareness of the  irrationality  of the disorder can be painful. For people with severe OCD, it may take several hours a day to carry out the compulsive acts.   The phrase ""obsessive-compulsive"" has become part of the English lexicon, and is often used in an informal or caricatured manner to describe someone who is meticulous,  perfectionistic , absorbed in a cause, or otherwise fixated on something or someone. [ 3 ]  Although these signs are often present in OCD, a person who exhibits them does not necessarily have OCD, and may instead have  obsessive-compulsive  personality  disorder  (OCPD) or some other condition.

The Quick Reference to the diagnostic criteria from DSM-IV-TR (2000) [ 4 ]  states six characteristics of obsessions and compulsions:     Obsessions       Recurrent and persistent thoughts,  impulses , or images that are experienced as intrusive and that cause marked anxiety or distress.   The thoughts, impulses, or images are not simply excessive worries about real-life problems.   The person attempts to ignore or suppress such thoughts, impulses, or images, or to neutralize them with some other thought or action.   The person recognizes that the obsessional thoughts, impulses, or images are a product of his or her own mind, and are not based in reality.       Compulsions       Repetitive behaviors or mental acts that the person feels driven to perform in response to an obsession, or according to rules that must be applied rigidly.   The behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing distress or preventing some dreaded event or situation; however, these behaviors or mental acts are not actually connected to the issue, or they are excessive.     In addition to these criteria, at some point during the course of the disorder, the individual must realize that his/her obsessions or compulsions are unreasonable or excessive. Moreover, the obsessions or compulsions must be time-consuming (taking up more than one hour per day), cause distress, or cause impairment in social, occupational, or school functioning. [ 4 ]  OCD often causes feelings similar to those of  depression .     [ edit ]   Symptoms and prevalence   OCD manifests in a variety of forms. Studies have placed the prevalence between one and three percent, although the prevalence of clinically recognized OCD is much lower, suggesting that many individuals with the disorder may not be diagnosed. [ 5 ]  The fact that many individuals do not seek treatment may be due in part to  stigma  associated with OCD. Another reason for not seeking treatment is that many sufferers of OCD do not realize that they have the condition.   The typical OCD sufferer performs tasks (or  compulsions ) to seek relief from obsession-related anxiety. To others, these tasks may appear odd and unnecessary. But for the sufferer, such tasks can feel critically important, and must be performed in particular ways to ward off dire consequences and to stop the  stress  from building up. Examples of these tasks are repeatedly checking that one's parked car has been locked before leaving it, turning lights on and off a set number of times before exiting a room, repeatedly washing hands at regular intervals throughout the day, touching objects a certain number of times before leaving a room, or walking in a certain routine way. Physical symptoms may include those brought on from anxieties and unwanted thoughts, as well as  tics  or  Parkinson's disease -like symptoms: rigidity, tremor, jerking arm movements, or involuntary movements of the limbs.   Formal diagnosis may be performed by a  psychologist , a  psychiatrist  or  psychoanalyst . OCD sufferers are aware that their thoughts and behavior are not rational, [ 6 ]  but they feel bound to comply with them to fend off feelings of panic or dread. Although everyone may experience unpleasant thoughts at one time or another, these are short-lived and fade away in time. [ 7 ]  For people with OCD, the thoughts are intrusive and persistent, and can cause them great anxiety and distress. [ 8 ]   Intrusive thoughts  are unwelcome, involuntary thoughts, images or unpleasant ideas that may become  obsessions , are upsetting or distressing, and can be difficult to be free of and manage. [ 9 ]  As with other forms of OCD, the awareness of the irrationality of these thoughts can be frustrating as the individual wishes to stop them but cannot. Intrusive thoughts, urges, and images are of inappropriate things at inappropriate times, usually falling into three categories: inappropriate aggressive thoughts, inappropriate sexual thoughts, and blasphemous religious thoughts. [ 10 ]  Most people experience these thoughts; when they are associated with OCD or  depression , they may become paralyzing,  anxiety -provoking, and persistent. Many people experience the type of unpleasant or unwanted thoughts that people with more troubling intrusive thoughts have, but most people are able to dismiss these thoughts. [ 9 ]  When intrusive thoughts co-occur with OCD, patients are less capable of ignoring the unpleasant thoughts and may pay undue attention to them, causing the thoughts to become more frequent and distressing. [ 9 ]   The common underlying theme to the diverse intrusive thoughts is summarised by Bruce  et al  with the example, ""What if I were to snap, lose control of myself, and do something totally uncharacteristic of me--perhaps even without my knowing it--that results in harm to myself or someone else?"" [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   OCD without Overt compulsions   A major subtype of OCD is OCD without overt compulsions. [ 12 ]  OCD without overt compulsions is often referred to as ""pure-O"" by laymen and sufferers of this disorder. The term is a bit of a misnomer, however, since OCD without overt compulsions is no more ""pure"" than any other form of OCD. Nonetheless, OCD without overt compulsions represents a major subtype of OCD with some of the estimates as high 50-60%. [ 13 ]  Rather than engaging in observable rituals and compulsions, the person with OCD without overt compulsions engages in all manner of mental neutralizing behaviours (i.e. ""covert"" compulsions).   Intrusive thoughts may involve violent obsessions about hurting others or oneself. [ 14 ]  They can include such thoughts as harming an innocent child, jumping from a bridge, mountain or the top of a tall building, urges to jump in front of a train or automobile, and urges to push another in front of a train or automobile. [ 10 ]  A survey of healthy college students found that virtually all of them had intrusive thoughts from time to time, including imagining or wishing harm upon a family member or friend, impulses to attack or kill a small child, or animal, or shout something rude or violent. [ 15 ]   The possibility that most patients suffering from intrusive thoughts will ever act on those thoughts is low; patients who are experiencing intense guilt, anxiety, shame, and anger over bad thoughts are different from those who actually act on bad thoughts. The history of violent crime is dominated by those who feel no guilt or remorse; the very fact that someone is tormented by intrusive thoughts, and has never acted on them before, is an excellent predictor that they won't act upon the thoughts. According to Baer, a patient should be concerned that intrusive thoughts are dangerous if the person doesn't feel upset by the thoughts, rather finds them pleasurable; has ever acted on violent or sexual thoughts or urges; hears voices or sees things that others don't see; or feels uncontrollable irresistible anger. [ 16 ]   Sexual obsessions may involve intrusive thoughts or images of ""kissing, hugging a lot, touching, fondling, oral sex, anal sex, intercourse, and rape"" with ""strangers, acquaintances, parents, children, family members, friends, coworkers, animals and religious figures"", involving ""heterosexual or homosexual content"" with persons of any age. [ 17 ]  Like other intrusive, unpleasant thoughts or images, most people have some inappropriate sexual thoughts at times, but people with OCD may attach significance to the unwanted sexual thoughts, generating anxiety and distress. The doubt that accompanies OCD leads to uncertainty regarding whether one might act on the bad thoughts, resulting in self-criticism or loathing. [ 17 ]     [ edit ]   OCD with Overt Compulsions   Other major subtypes of OCD frequently revolve around washing or checking; some sufferers may fear the presence of human body secretions such as saliva, blood, semen, sweat, tears, vomit, or mucus, or excretions such as urine or feces. Some OCD sufferers even fear that the soap they are using is contaminated. [ 18 ]  These anxiety-driven fears often result in various compulsive cleaning behaviours, and may cause a person to experience significant distress, which may make it difficult for a person with OCD to tolerate a workplace, venture into public locations, or conduct normal social relationships.   Symptoms related to performing tasks may include repeated hand washing [ 19 ]  or clearing of the throat; specific counting systems or counting of steps; doing repetitive actionsmore generally, this can involve an obsession with numbers or types of numbers (e.g., odd numbers). For example, when somebody suffering from OCD leaves the house, they might tap the door knob 9 times and if they don't they will go into distress, panic and even at certain times, they will pass out. These obsessive behaviors can cause individuals to feel psychological distress, because they are very concerned about having ""made mistakes"" in the number of steps that they have taken, or the number of stairs on a staircase. For some people with OCD, these obsessive counting and re-counting tasks, along with the attendant anxiety and fear, can take hours of each day, which can make it hard for the person to fulfill their work, family, or social roles. In some cases, these behaviors can also cause adverse physical symptoms: people who obsessively wash their hands with  antibacterial soap  and hot water (to remove germs) can make their skin red and raw with  dermatitis . [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Related conditions   OCD is often confused with the separate condition  obsessive-compulsive personality disorder . The two are not the same condition, however. OCD is  ego  dystonic , meaning that the disorder is incompatible with the sufferer's self-concept.  [ 20 ] [ 21 ]  Because disorders that are ego dystonic go against an individual's perception of his/herself, they tend to cause much distress. OCPD, on the other hand, is  ego syntonic marked by the individual's acceptance that the characteristics displayed as a result of this disorder are compatible with his/her self-image. Ego syntonic disorders understandably cause no distress. Persons suffering from OCD are often aware that their behavior is not rational and are unhappy about their obsessions but nevertheless feel compelled by them. Persons with OCPD are not aware of anything abnormal about themselves; they will readily explain why their actions are rational, and it is usually impossible to convince them otherwise. Persons with OCD are ridden with  anxiety ; persons who suffer from OCPD, by contrast, tend to derive pleasure from their obsessions or compulsions. [ 22 ]  This is a significant difference between these disorders.   Equally frequently, these rationalizations do not apply to the overall behavior, but to each instance individually; for example, a person compulsively checking their front door may argue that the time taken and stress caused by one more check of the front door is considerably less than the time and stress associated with being robbed, and thus the check is the better option. In practice, after that check, the individual is  still  not sure, and it is  still  better in terms of time and stress to do one more check, and this reasoning can continue as long as necessary.   Some OCD sufferers exhibit what is known as  overvalued ideas . In such cases, the person with OCD will truly be uncertain whether the fears that cause them to perform their compulsions are irrational or not. After some discussion, it is possible to convince the individual that their fears may be unfounded. It may be more difficult to do  ERP therapy  on such patients, because they may be, at least initially, unwilling to cooperate. For this reason OCD has often been likened to a disease of pathological doubt, in which the sufferer, while not usually  delusional , is often unable to realize fully what sorts of dreaded events are reasonably possible and which are not. There are severe cases when the sufferer has an unshakeable belief within the context of OCD which is difficult to differentiate from psychosis. [ 23 ]   OCD is different from behaviors such as  gambling  addiction and  overeating . People with these disorders typically experience at least some pleasure from their activity; OCD sufferers do not actively want to perform their compulsive tasks, and experience no pleasure from doing so. OCD is placed in the anxiety class of  mental illness , but like many  chronic stress disorders  it can lead to  clinical depression  over time. The constant stress of the condition can cause sufferers to develop a deadening of spirit, a numbing frustration, or sense of hopelessness. OCD's effects on day-to-day lifeparticularly its substantial consumption of timecan produce difficulties with work, finances and relationships. There is no known cure for OCD as of yet, but there are a number of successful treatment options available.     [ edit ]   Related/Spectrum disorders   People with OCD may be diagnosed with other conditions, such as  generalized anxiety disorder ,  anorexia nervosa ,  social anxiety disorder ,  bulimia nervosa ,  Tourette syndrome ,  Asperger syndrome ,  compulsive skin picking ,  body dysmorphic disorder ,  trichotillomania , and (as already mentioned)  obsessive-compulsive personality disorder . There is some research demonstrating a link between  drug addiction  and OCD as well. Many who suffer from OCD also suffer from  panic attacks . There is a higher risk of drug addiction among those with any anxiety disorder (possibly as a way of  coping  with the heightened levels of  anxiety ), but drug addiction among OCD patients may serve as a type of  compulsive behavior  and not just as a coping mechanism.  Depression  is also extremely prevalent among sufferers of OCD. One explanation for the high depression rate among OCD populations was posited by Mineka, Watson, and Clark (1998), who explained that people with OCD (or any other  anxiety disorder ) may feel depressed because of an ""out of control"" type of feeling. [ 24 ]   Some cases are thought to be caused at least in part by childhood  streptococcal  infections and are termed  PANDAS  (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infections). The streptococcal  antibodies  become involved in an  autoimmune  process. Though this idea is not set in stone, if it does prove to be true, there is cause to believe that OCD can to some very small extent be ""caught"" via exposure to strep throat (just as one may catch a cold). However, if OCD is caused by bacteria, this provides hope that  antibiotics  may eventually be used to treat or prevent it. [ 25 ]     [ edit ]   Causes     [ edit ]   Psychological   Scientists studying obsessive-compulsive disorder generally agree that both psychological and biological factors play a role in causing the disorder, although they differ in their degree of emphasis upon either type of factor.   From the 14th to the 16th century in Europe, it was believed that people who experienced blasphemous, sexual, or other obsessive thoughts were  possessed  by the  Devil . [ 26 ]  Based on this reasoning, treatment involved banishing the ""evil"" from the ""possessed"" person through  exorcism . [ 27 ]  In the early 1910s,  Sigmund Freud  attributed obsessive-compulsive behavior to unconscious conflicts which manifested as symptoms. [ 27 ]  Freud describes the clinical history of a typical case of ""touching phobia"" as starting in early childhood, when the person has a strong desire to touch an item. In response, the person develops an ""external prohibition"" against this type of touching. However, this ""prohibition does not succeed in abolishing"" the desire to touch; all it can do is repress the desire and ""force it into the unconscious"". [ 28 ]   The cognitive-behavioral model suggests that compulsive behaviour is carried out to remove anxiety-provoking intrusive thoughts. Unfortunately this only brings about temporary relief as the thought re-emerges. Each time the behaviour occurs it is negatively reinforced (see  Reinforcement ) by the relief from anxiety, thereby explaining why the dysfunctional activity increases and generalises (extends to other, related stimuli) over a period of time. For example, after touching a door-knob a person might have the thought that they may develop a disease as a result of contamination. They then experience anxiety, which is relieved when they wash their hands. This might be followed by the thought ""but did I wash them properly?"" causing an increase in anxiety once more, the hand-washing once again rewarded by the removal of anxiety (albeit briefly) and the cycle being repeated when thoughts of contamination re-occur. The distressing thoughts might then spread to fear of contamination from e.g. a chair (someone might have touched the chair after touching the door handle).     [ edit ]   Biological   There are many different theories about the cause of obsessive-compulsive disorder. The majority of researchers believe that there is some type of abnormality with the  neurotransmitter   serotonin , among other possible psychological or biological abnormalities; however, it is possible that this activity is the brain's  response  to OCD, and not its cause.             This article  may contain  original research  or  unverified claims . Please  improve the article  by adding  references . See the  talk page  for details.  (January 2009)       Serotonin is thought to have a role in regulating anxiety, though it is also thought to be involved in such processes as  sleep  and  memory  function. In order to send chemical messages, serotonin must bind to the  receptor  sites located on the neighboring nerve cell. It is hypothesized that OCD sufferers may have blocked or damaged receptor sites that prevent serotonin from functioning to its full potential. This suggestion is supported by the fact that many OCD patients benefit from the use of  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  (SSRIs)a class of  antidepressant  medications that allow for more serotonin to be readily available to other nerve cells. [ 29 ]  For more about this class of drugs, see the  section about potential treatments  for OCD.   The  Stanford University School of Medicine  OCD webpage states, ""Although the causes of the disorder still elude us, the recent identification of children with OCD caused by an autoimmune response to  Group A streptococcal infection  promises to bring increased understanding of the disorder's pathogenesis."" [ 30 ]   Recent research has revealed a possible  genetic mutation  that could help to cause OCD. Researchers funded by the  National Institutes of Health  have found a  mutation  in the human serotonin transporter gene,  hSERT , in unrelated families with OCD. Moreover, in his study of identical twins, Rasmussen (1994) produced data that supported the idea that there is a ""heritable factor for neurotic anxiety"". [ 31 ]  In addition, he noted that environmental factors also play a role in how these anxiety symptoms are expressed. However, various studies on this topic are still being conducted and the presence of a genetic link is not yet definitely established.   Another possible genetic cause of OCD was discovered in August 2007 by scientists at  Duke University Medical Center  in North Carolina. They genetically engineered mice that lacked a  gene  called  SAPAP3 . This  protein  is highly expressed in the  striatum , an area of the  brain  linked to planning and the initiation of appropriate actions. The mice spent three times as much time grooming themselves as ordinary mice, to the point that their fur fell off. [ 32 ]   Using tools like  positron emission tomography  (PET scans), it has been shown that those with OCD tend to have brain activity that differs from those who do not have this disorder. [ 33 ]  A popular explanation for OCD is that offered in the book  Brain Lock  by Jeffrey Schwartz, which suggests that OCD is caused by the part of the brain that is responsible for translating complex intentions (e.g., ""I will pick up this cup"") into fundamental actions (e.g., ""move arm forward, rotate hand 15 degrees, etc."") failing to correctly communicate the chemical message that an action has been completed. This is perceived as a feeling of doubt and incompleteness, which then leads the individual to attempt to consciously deconstruct their own prior behaviora process which induces anxiety in most people, even those without OCD [ citation needed ] .   It has been theorized that a miscommunication between the  orbitofrontal cortex , the  caudate nucleus , and the  thalamus  may be a factor in the explanation of OCD. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is the first part of the brain to notice whether or not something is wrong. [ vague ]  When the OFC notices that something is wrong, it sends an initial ""worry signal"" to the thalamus. When the thalamus receives this signal, it in turn sends signals back to the OFC to interpret the worrying event. The caudate nucleus lies between the OFC and the thalamus and prevents the initial worry signal from being sent back to the thalamus after it has already been received. However, it is suggested that in those with OCD, the caudate nucleus does not function properly, and therefore does not prevent this initial signal from recurring. This causes the thalamus to become hyperactive and creates a virtually never-ending loop of worry signals being sent back and forth between the OFC and the thalamus. The OFC responds by increasing anxiety and engaging in  compulsive behaviors  in an attempt to relieve this apprehension. [ 29 ]  This overactivity of the OFC is shown to be attenuated in patients who have successfully responded to  SSRI  medication. The increased stimulation of the  serotonin  receptors  5-HT2A  and  5-HT2C  in the OFC is believed to cause this inhibition.  [ 34 ]   Some research has discovered an association between a type of size abnormality in different  brain structures  and the predisposition to develop OCD. Through the use of  magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI), researchers at  Cambridge's Brain Mapping Unit  were able to discover distinctive patterns in the brain structure of individuals with OCD and their close family members.  [ 35 ]  This is the first instance in which it has been demonstrated that those with a familial risk of developing OCD have anatomical differences when compared with ordinary individuals. The discovery of these structural differences in the area of the brain associated with stopping  motor response  may ultimately aid researchers who seek to determine which genes contribute to the development of OCD.   In some patients, the consumption of  caffeine  may make OCD symptoms worse.  [ 36 ]     [ edit ]   Demographics and other statistics   In a 1980 study of 20,000 adults from  New Haven ,  Baltimore ,  St. Louis ,  Durham , and  Los Angeles , the lifetime prevalence rate of OCD for both sexes was recorded at 2.5 percent. Education also appears to be a factor. The lifetime prevalence of OCD is lower for those who have graduated high school than for those who have not (1.9 percent versus 3.4 percent). However, in the case of college education, lifetime prevalence is higher for those who graduate with a degree (3.1 percent) than it is for those who have only some college background (2.4 percent). As far as age is concerned, the onset of OCD usually ranges from the late teenage years until the mid-20s in both sexes, but the age of onset tends to be slightly younger in males than in females. [ 37 ]   It has been alleged that sufferers are generally of above-average  intelligence , as the very nature of the disorder necessitates complicated thinking patterns [ 38 ] .     [ edit ]   Treatment   According to the Expert Consensus Guidelines for the Treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder,  behavioral therapy  (BT),  cognitive therapy  (CT), and  medications  are first-line treatments for OCD.  Psychodynamic psychotherapy  may help in managing some aspects of the disorder, but there are no controlled studies that demonstrate effectiveness of  psychoanalysis  or  dynamic psychotherapy  in OCD. [ 39 ]     [ edit ]   Behavioral therapy   The specific technique used in BT/CBT is called  exposure and ritual prevention  (also known as "" exposure and response prevention "") or ERP; this involves gradually learning to tolerate the anxiety associated with not performing the ritual behavior. At first, for example, someone might touch something only very mildly ""contaminated"" (such as a tissue that has been touched by another tissue that has been touched by the end of a toothpick that has touched a book that came from a ""contaminated"" location, such as a school.) That is the ""exposure"". The ""ritual prevention"" is not washing. Another example might be leaving the house and checking the lock only once (exposure) without going back and checking again (ritual prevention). The person fairly quickly  habituates  to the anxiety-producing situation and discovers that their anxiety level has dropped considerably; they can then progress to touching something more ""contaminated"" or not checking the lock at allagain, without performing the ritual behavior of washing or checking.   Exposure ritual/response prevention has been demonstrated to be the most effective treatment for OCD. It has generally been accepted that  psychotherapy , in combination with  psychotropic medication , is more effective than either option alone. However, more recent studies have shown no difference in outcomes for those treated with the combination of medicine and CBT versus CBT alone. [ 40 ]   Recently it has been reported simultaneous administration of D-Cycloserin (an antibiotic) substantially improves effectiveness of Exposure and Response prevention. [ 41 ]     [ edit ]   Medication   Medications as treatment include  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  (SSRIs) such as  paroxetine (Seroxat, Paxil, Xetanor, ParoMerck, Rexetin) ,  sertraline (Zoloft, Stimuloton) ,  fluoxetine (Prozac, Bioxetin) ,  escitalopram  (Lexapro), and  fluvoxamine (Luvox)  as well as the  tricyclic antidepressants , in particular  clomipramine (Anafranil) . SSRIs prevent excess  serotonin  from being pumped back into the original  neuron  that released it. Instead, serotonin can then bind to the  receptor  sites of nearby neurons and send chemical messages or signals that can help regulate the excessive  anxiety  and obsessive thoughts. In some treatment-resistant cases, a combination of  clomipramine  and an SSRI has shown to be effective even when neither drug on its own has been efficacious.   Benzodiazepines  are also used in treatment. It's not uncommon to administer this class of drugs during the ""latency period"" for SSRIs or as synergistic adjunct long-term. Although widely prescribed, benzodiazepines have not been demonstrated as an effective treatment for OCD and may be habit-forming in those with a history of substance abuse. [ 42 ]   Serotonergic   antidepressants  typically take longer to show benefit in OCD than with most other disorders which they are used to treat, as it is common for 23 months to elapse before any tangible improvement is noticed. In addition to this, the treatment usually requires high doses.  Fluoxetine , for example, is usually prescribed in doses of 20 mg per day for clinical depression, whereas with OCD the dose will often range from 20 mg to 80 mg or higher, if necessary. In most cases  antidepressant therapy  alone will only provide a partial reduction in symptoms, even in cases that are not deemed treatment-resistant. Much current research is devoted to the therapeutic potential of the agents that effect the release of the neurotransmitter  glutamate  or the binding to its receptors. These include  riluzole ,  memantine ,  gabapentin (Neurontin)  and  lamotrigine (Lamictal) .   Low doses of the newer  atypical antipsychotics   olanzapine (Zyprexa) ,  quetiapine (Seroquel) ,  ziprasidone  and  risperidone (Risperdal)  have also been found to be useful as adjuncts in the treatment of OCD. The use of  antipsychotics  in OCD must be undertaken carefully, however, since, although there is very strong evidence that at low doses they are beneficial (most likely due to their  dopamine receptor   antagonism ), at high doses these same antipsychotics have proven to cause dramatic obsessive-compulsive symptoms even in those patients who do not normally have OCD. This can be due to the antagonism of  5-HT2A receptors  becoming very prominent at these doses and outweighing the benefits of  dopamine  antagonism. However antidepressant mirtazapine which is a 5-HT2A antagonist has shown to be of benefit to OCD patients [ 43 ] . Another point that must be noted with antipsychotic treatment is that SSRIs inhibit the chief  enzyme  that is responsible for  metabolising  antipsychotics CYP2D6 so the dose will be effectively higher than expected when these are combined with SSRIs. Also, it must be noted that antipsychotic treatment should be considered as augmentation treatment when SSRI treatment does not bring positive results.     [ edit ]   Alternative drug treatments   The naturally occurring sugar  inositol  has been suggested as a treatment for OCD [ 44 ] , as it appears to modulate the actions of serotonin and reverse  desensitisation  of  neurotransmitter  receptors.  St John's Wort  has been claimed to be of benefit due to its (non-selective) serotonin re-uptake inhibiting qualities [ citations needed ] , although a double-blind study using a flexible-dose schedule (600-1800 mg/day) found no difference between St John's Wort and a placebo [ 45 ] .   Nutrition deficiencies  may also contribute to OCD and other  mental disorders .  Vitamin  and mineral supplements may aid in such disorders and provide  nutrients  necessary for proper mental functioning [ 46 ] .   Opioids  may significantly reduce OCD symptoms, though their use is not sanctioned for treatment due to  physical dependence  and long term drug tolerance [ citations needed ] . Tramadol is an atypical opioid that appears to provide the anti-OCD effects of an  opiate  and inhibit the  re-uptake  of serotonin (in addition to  norepinephrine ) [ 47 ] .   Tryptamine   alkaloid   psilocybin  has been attempted as treatment [ 48 ] . There are reports that other  hallucinogens  such as  LSD  and  peyote  have produced similar effects [ citations needed ] . It has been hypothesised that this effect may be due to stimulation of  5-HT2A receptors  and, less significantly,  5-HT2C receptors ; this causes an inhibitory effect on the  orbitofrontal cortex , an area of the brain in which  hyperactivity  has been strongly associated with OCD [ 49 ] .   Regular  nicotine  treatment may ameliorate symptoms of OCD, although the  pharmacodynamical  mechanism by which this is achieved is not yet known, and more detailed studies are needed to fully confirm this  hypothesis [ 50 ] .     [ edit ]   Psycho-surgery   For some, neither medication, support groups nor psychological treatments are helpful in alleviating obsessive-compulsive symptoms. These patients may choose to undergo  psychosurgery  as a last resort. In this procedure, a surgical  lesion  is made in an area of the brain (the  cingulate bundle ). In one study, 30% of participants benefited significantly from this procedure. [ 8 ]   Deep-brain stimulation  and  vagus nerve stimulation  are possible surgical options which do not require the destruction of  brain tissue , although their efficacy has not been conclusively demonstrated.   In the US, psychosurgery for OCD is a treatment of last resort and will not be performed until the patient has failed several attempts at medication (at the full dosage) with augmentation, and many months of intensive  cognitive-behavioral therapy  with exposure and ritual/response prevention. [ 51 ]  Likewise, in the UK, psychosurgery cannot be performed unless a course of treatment from a suitably qualified cognitive-behavioural therapist has been carried out.     [ edit ]   Neuropsychiatry   Main article:  Neuropsychiatry   OCD primarily involves the  brain regions  of the  striatum , the  orbitofrontal cortex  and the  cingulate cortex . OCD involves several different  receptors , mostly  H 2 ,  M 4 ,  NK 1 ,  NMDA , and non-NMDA  glutamate receptors . [ citation needed ]  The receptors  5-HT 1D ,  5-HT 2C , and the   opioid receptor  exert a secondary effect. The H 2 , M 4 , NK 1 , and  non-NMDA glutamate  receptors are active in the striatum, whereas the  NMDA receptors  are active in the cingulate cortex.   The activity of certain receptors is positively correlated to the severity of OCD, whereas the activity of certain other receptors is negatively correlated to the severity of OCD. Correlations where activity is positively correlated to severity include the histamine receptor ( H 2 ); the Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor( M 4 ); the Tachykinin receptor ( NK 1 ); and non-NMDA  glutamate receptors . Correlations where activity is negatively correlated to severity include the NMDA receptor ( NMDA ); the Mu opioid receptor (  opioid ); and two types of 5-HT receptors ( 5-HT 1D  and  5-HT 2C ) The central dysfunction of OCD may involve the receptors nk1, non-NMDA  glutamate  receptors, and NMDA, whereas the other receptors could simply exert secondary modulatory effects.   Pharmaceuticals that act directly on those core mechanisms are  aprepitant  (nk1 antagonist),  riluzole  (glutamate release inhibitor), and  tautomycin  (NMDA receptor sensitizer). Also, the anti-Alzheimer's drug  memantine  is being studied by the  OC Foundation  in its efficacy in reducing OCD symptoms due to it being an  NMDA antagonist . One case study published in  The American Journal of Psychiatry  suggests that ""memantine may be an option for treatment-resistant OCD, but controlled studies are needed to substantiate this observation."" [ 52 ]  The drugs that are popularly used to fight OCD lack full efficacy because they do not act upon what are believed to be the core mechanisms. Many trials are currently underway to investigate the efficacy of a variety of agents that affect these 'core' neurotransmitters, particularly glutamatergic agents. [2]     [ edit ]   Notable cases     British poet, essayist, and lexicographer  Samuel Johnson  is an example of a historical figure with a  retrospective diagnosis  of OCD. He had elaborate rituals for crossing the thresholds of doorways, repeatedly walked up and down staircases counting the steps, and had compulsions regarding repetitive prayer which were most likely a form of religious scrupulosity. [ 53 ] [ 54 ] [ 55 ]       American aviator and filmmaker  Howard Hughes  is known to have suffered from OCD and it is believed that his mother may have also been a sufferer. Friends of Hughes have mentioned his obsession with minor flaws in clothing and he is reported to have had a great fear of germs, common among OCD patients. [ 56 ]  He did also suffer from Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) due to an aviation accident in which he was severely injured. This resulted in him becoming reclusive later in life.       English footballer  David Beckham  has been outspoken regarding his struggle with OCD. He has told media that he has to count all his clothes, and that magazines have to lie in a straight line. No more than three soda cans are allowed in his refrigerator, and if there are any more at home they have to be placed in a cupboard. He has explained that the reason he gets more tattoos is that he feels addicted to the pain of the needle. In hotels, any books that are on a shelf must be placed in the drawer. He has expressed a desire to get help for his problems.

For other uses, see  OCD (disambiguation) .       Obsessive-compulsive disorder   Classification and external resources       ICD - 10   F 42.       Obsessive-compulsive disorder  ( OCD ) is a  mental disorder  most commonly characterized by  intrusive , repetitive thoughts resulting in  compulsive behaviors  and mental acts that the person feels driven to perform, according to rules that must be applied rigidly, aimed at reducing  anxiety  by preventing some dreaded event or by resolving a more nebulous sense of tension. However, the likelihood that a dreaded event will occur, or the causal relationship between the performance of compulsions and the reduction of this likelihood, tends to be imagined or exaggerated.   OCD is the fourth most common mental disorder and is nearly as common as  asthma  and  diabetes mellitus . [ 1 ]  In the  United States , one in 50 adults has OCD. [ 2 ]  In severe cases, it affects a person's ability to function in everyday activities. The disorder often has a serious impact on the sufferer's (and their family's)  quality of life . Also, the psychological self-awareness of the  irrationality  of the disorder can be painful. For people with severe OCD, it may take several hours a day to carry out the compulsive acts.   The phrase ""obsessive-compulsive"" has become part of the English lexicon, and is often used in an informal or caricatured manner to describe someone who is meticulous,  perfectionistic , absorbed in a cause, or otherwise fixated on something or someone. [ 3 ]  Although these signs are often present in OCD, a person who exhibits them does not necessarily have OCD, and may instead have  obsessive-compulsive  personality  disorder  (OCPD) or some other condition.

The Quick Reference to the diagnostic criteria from DSM-IV-TR (2000) [ 4 ]  states six characteristics of obsessions and compulsions:     Obsessions       Recurrent and persistent thoughts,  impulses , or images that are experienced as intrusive and that cause marked anxiety or distress.   The thoughts, impulses, or images are not simply excessive worries about real-life problems.   The person attempts to ignore or suppress such thoughts, impulses, or images, or to neutralize them with some other thought or action.   The person recognizes that the obsessional thoughts, impulses, or images are a product of his or her own mind, and are not based in reality.       Compulsions       Repetitive behaviors or mental acts that the person feels driven to perform in response to an obsession, or according to rules that must be applied rigidly.   The behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing distress or preventing some dreaded event or situation; however, these behaviors or mental acts are not actually connected to the issue, or they are excessive.     In addition to these criteria, at some point during the course of the disorder, the individual must realize that his/her obsessions or compulsions are unreasonable or excessive. Moreover, the obsessions or compulsions must be time-consuming (taking up more than one hour per day), cause distress, or cause impairment in social, occupational, or school functioning. [ 4 ]  OCD often causes feelings similar to those of  depression .     [ edit ]   Symptoms and prevalence   OCD manifests in a variety of forms. Studies have placed the prevalence between one and three percent, although the prevalence of clinically recognized OCD is much lower, suggesting that many individuals with the disorder may not be diagnosed. [ 5 ]  The fact that many individuals do not seek treatment may be due in part to  stigma  associated with OCD. Another reason for not seeking treatment is that many sufferers of OCD do not realize that they have the condition.   The typical OCD sufferer performs tasks (or  compulsions ) to seek relief from obsession-related anxiety. To others, these tasks may appear odd and unnecessary. But for the sufferer, such tasks can feel critically important, and must be performed in particular ways to ward off dire consequences and to stop the  stress  from building up. Examples of these tasks are repeatedly checking that one's parked car has been locked before leaving it, turning lights on and off a set number of times before exiting a room, repeatedly washing hands at regular intervals throughout the day, touching objects a certain number of times before leaving a room, or walking in a certain routine way. Physical symptoms may include those brought on from anxieties and unwanted thoughts, as well as  tics  or  Parkinson's disease -like symptoms: rigidity, tremor, jerking arm movements, or involuntary movements of the limbs.   Formal diagnosis may be performed by a  psychologist , a  psychiatrist  or  psychoanalyst . OCD sufferers are aware that their thoughts and behavior are not rational, [ 6 ]  but they feel bound to comply with them to fend off feelings of panic or dread. Although everyone may experience unpleasant thoughts at one time or another, these are short-lived and fade away in time. [ 7 ]  For people with OCD, the thoughts are intrusive and persistent, and can cause them great anxiety and distress. [ 8 ]   Intrusive thoughts  are unwelcome, involuntary thoughts, images or unpleasant ideas that may become  obsessions , are upsetting or distressing, and can be difficult to be free of and manage. [ 9 ]  As with other forms of OCD, the awareness of the irrationality of these thoughts can be frustrating as the individual wishes to stop them but cannot. Intrusive thoughts, urges, and images are of inappropriate things at inappropriate times, usually falling into three categories: inappropriate aggressive thoughts, inappropriate sexual thoughts, and blasphemous religious thoughts. [ 10 ]  Most people experience these thoughts; when they are associated with OCD or  depression , they may become paralyzing,  anxiety -provoking, and persistent. Many people experience the type of unpleasant or unwanted thoughts that people with more troubling intrusive thoughts have, but most people are able to dismiss these thoughts. [ 9 ]  When intrusive thoughts co-occur with OCD, patients are less capable of ignoring the unpleasant thoughts and may pay undue attention to them, causing the thoughts to become more frequent and distressing. [ 9 ]   The common underlying theme to the diverse intrusive thoughts is summarised by Bruce  et al  with the example, ""What if I were to snap, lose control of myself, and do something totally uncharacteristic of me--perhaps even without my knowing it--that results in harm to myself or someone else?"" [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   OCD without Overt compulsions   A major subtype of OCD is OCD without overt compulsions. [ 12 ]  OCD without overt compulsions is often referred to as ""pure-O"" by laymen and sufferers of this disorder. The term is a bit of a misnomer, however, since OCD without overt compulsions is no more ""pure"" than any other form of OCD. Nonetheless, OCD without overt compulsions represents a major subtype of OCD with some of the estimates as high 50-60%. [ 13 ]  Rather than engaging in observable rituals and compulsions, the person with OCD without overt compulsions engages in all manner of mental neutralizing behaviours (i.e. ""covert"" compulsions).   Intrusive thoughts may involve violent obsessions about hurting others or oneself. [ 14 ]  They can include such thoughts as harming an innocent child, jumping from a bridge, mountain or the top of a tall building, urges to jump in front of a train or automobile, and urges to push another in front of a train or automobile. [ 10 ]  A survey of healthy college students found that virtually all of them had intrusive thoughts from time to time, including imagining or wishing harm upon a family member or friend, impulses to attack or kill a small child, or animal, or shout something rude or violent. [ 15 ]   The possibility that most patients suffering from intrusive thoughts will ever act on those thoughts is low; patients who are experiencing intense guilt, anxiety, shame, and anger over bad thoughts are different from those who actually act on bad thoughts. The history of violent crime is dominated by those who feel no guilt or remorse; the very fact that someone is tormented by intrusive thoughts, and has never acted on them before, is an excellent predictor that they won't act upon the thoughts. According to Baer, a patient should be concerned that intrusive thoughts are dangerous if the person doesn't feel upset by the thoughts, rather finds them pleasurable; has ever acted on violent or sexual thoughts or urges; hears voices or sees things that others don't see; or feels uncontrollable irresistible anger. [ 16 ]   Sexual obsessions may involve intrusive thoughts or images of ""kissing, hugging a lot, touching, fondling, oral sex, anal sex, intercourse, and rape"" with ""strangers, acquaintances, parents, children, family members, friends, coworkers, animals and religious figures"", involving ""heterosexual or homosexual content"" with persons of any age. [ 17 ]  Like other intrusive, unpleasant thoughts or images, most people have some inappropriate sexual thoughts at times, but people with OCD may attach significance to the unwanted sexual thoughts, generating anxiety and distress. The doubt that accompanies OCD leads to uncertainty regarding whether one might act on the bad thoughts, resulting in self-criticism or loathing. [ 17 ]     [ edit ]   OCD with Overt Compulsions   Other major subtypes of OCD frequently revolve around washing or checking; some sufferers may fear the presence of human body secretions such as saliva, blood, semen, sweat, tears, vomit, or mucus, or excretions such as urine or feces. Some OCD sufferers even fear that the soap they are using is contaminated. [ 18 ]  These anxiety-driven fears often result in various compulsive cleaning behaviours, and may cause a person to experience significant distress, which may make it difficult for a person with OCD to tolerate a workplace, venture into public locations, or conduct normal social relationships.   Symptoms related to performing tasks may include repeated hand washing [ 19 ]  or clearing of the throat; specific counting systems or counting of steps; doing repetitive actionsmore generally, this can involve an obsession with numbers or types of numbers (e.g., odd numbers). For example, when somebody suffering from OCD leaves the house, they might tap the door knob 9 times and if they don't they will go into distress, panic and even at certain times, they will pass out. These obsessive behaviors can cause individuals to feel psychological distress, because they are very concerned about having ""made mistakes"" in the number of steps that they have taken, or the number of stairs on a staircase. For some people with OCD, these obsessive counting and re-counting tasks, along with the attendant anxiety and fear, can take hours of each day, which can make it hard for the person to fulfill their work, family, or social roles. In some cases, these behaviors can also cause adverse physical symptoms: people who obsessively wash their hands with  antibacterial soap  and hot water (to remove germs) can make their skin red and raw with  dermatitis . [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Related conditions   OCD is often confused with the separate condition  obsessive-compulsive personality disorder . The two are not the same condition, however. OCD is  ego  dystonic , meaning that the disorder is incompatible with the sufferer's self-concept.  [ 20 ] [ 21 ]  Because disorders that are ego dystonic go against an individual's perception of his/herself, they tend to cause much distress. OCPD, on the other hand, is  ego syntonic marked by the individual's acceptance that the characteristics displayed as a result of this disorder are compatible with his/her self-image. Ego syntonic disorders understandably cause no distress. Persons suffering from OCD are often aware that their behavior is not rational and are unhappy about their obsessions but nevertheless feel compelled by them. Persons with OCPD are not aware of anything abnormal about themselves; they will readily explain why their actions are rational, and it is usually impossible to convince them otherwise. Persons with OCD are ridden with  anxiety ; persons who suffer from OCPD, by contrast, tend to derive pleasure from their obsessions or compulsions. [ 22 ]  This is a significant difference between these disorders.   Equally frequently, these rationalizations do not apply to the overall behavior, but to each instance individually; for example, a person compulsively checking their front door may argue that the time taken and stress caused by one more check of the front door is considerably less than the time and stress associated with being robbed, and thus the check is the better option. In practice, after that check, the individual is  still  not sure, and it is  still  better in terms of time and stress to do one more check, and this reasoning can continue as long as necessary.   Some OCD sufferers exhibit what is known as  overvalued ideas . In such cases, the person with OCD will truly be uncertain whether the fears that cause them to perform their compulsions are irrational or not. After some discussion, it is possible to convince the individual that their fears may be unfounded. It may be more difficult to do  ERP therapy  on such patients, because they may be, at least initially, unwilling to cooperate. For this reason OCD has often been likened to a disease of pathological doubt, in which the sufferer, while not usually  delusional , is often unable to realize fully what sorts of dreaded events are reasonably possible and which are not. There are severe cases when the sufferer has an unshakeable belief within the context of OCD which is difficult to differentiate from psychosis. [ 23 ]   OCD is different from behaviors such as  gambling  addiction and  overeating . People with these disorders typically experience at least some pleasure from their activity; OCD sufferers do not actively want to perform their compulsive tasks, and experience no pleasure from doing so. OCD is placed in the anxiety class of  mental illness , but like many  chronic stress disorders  it can lead to  clinical depression  over time. The constant stress of the condition can cause sufferers to develop a deadening of spirit, a numbing frustration, or sense of hopelessness. OCD's effects on day-to-day lifeparticularly its substantial consumption of timecan produce difficulties with work, finances and relationships. There is no known cure for OCD as of yet, but there are a number of successful treatment options available.     [ edit ]   Related/Spectrum disorders   People with OCD may be diagnosed with other conditions, such as  generalized anxiety disorder ,  anorexia nervosa ,  social anxiety disorder ,  bulimia nervosa ,  Tourette syndrome ,  Asperger syndrome ,  compulsive skin picking ,  body dysmorphic disorder ,  trichotillomania , and (as already mentioned)  obsessive-compulsive personality disorder . There is some research demonstrating a link between  drug addiction  and OCD as well. Many who suffer from OCD also suffer from  panic attacks . There is a higher risk of drug addiction among those with any anxiety disorder (possibly as a way of  coping  with the heightened levels of  anxiety ), but drug addiction among OCD patients may serve as a type of  compulsive behavior  and not just as a coping mechanism.  Depression  is also extremely prevalent among sufferers of OCD. One explanation for the high depression rate among OCD populations was posited by Mineka, Watson, and Clark (1998), who explained that people with OCD (or any other  anxiety disorder ) may feel depressed because of an ""out of control"" type of feeling. [ 24 ]   Some cases are thought to be caused at least in part by childhood  streptococcal  infections and are termed  PANDAS  (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infections). The streptococcal  antibodies  become involved in an  autoimmune  process. Though this idea is not set in stone, if it does prove to be true, there is cause to believe that OCD can to some very small extent be ""caught"" via exposure to strep throat (just as one may catch a cold). However, if OCD is caused by bacteria, this provides hope that  antibiotics  may eventually be used to treat or prevent it. [ 25 ]     [ edit ]   Causes     [ edit ]   Psychological   Scientists studying obsessive-compulsive disorder generally agree that both psychological and biological factors play a role in causing the disorder, although they differ in their degree of emphasis upon either type of factor.   From the 14th to the 16th century in Europe, it was believed that people who experienced blasphemous, sexual, or other obsessive thoughts were  possessed  by the  Devil . [ 26 ]  Based on this reasoning, treatment involved banishing the ""evil"" from the ""possessed"" person through  exorcism . [ 27 ]  In the early 1910s,  Sigmund Freud  attributed obsessive-compulsive behavior to unconscious conflicts which manifested as symptoms. [ 27 ]  Freud describes the clinical history of a typical case of ""touching phobia"" as starting in early childhood, when the person has a strong desire to touch an item. In response, the person develops an ""external prohibition"" against this type of touching. However, this ""prohibition does not succeed in abolishing"" the desire to touch; all it can do is repress the desire and ""force it into the unconscious"". [ 28 ]   The cognitive-behavioral model suggests that compulsive behaviour is carried out to remove anxiety-provoking intrusive thoughts. Unfortunately this only brings about temporary relief as the thought re-emerges. Each time the behaviour occurs it is negatively reinforced (see  Reinforcement ) by the relief from anxiety, thereby explaining why the dysfunctional activity increases and generalises (extends to other, related stimuli) over a period of time. For example, after touching a door-knob a person might have the thought that they may develop a disease as a result of contamination. They then experience anxiety, which is relieved when they wash their hands. This might be followed by the thought ""but did I wash them properly?"" causing an increase in anxiety once more, the hand-washing once again rewarded by the removal of anxiety (albeit briefly) and the cycle being repeated when thoughts of contamination re-occur. The distressing thoughts might then spread to fear of contamination from e.g. a chair (someone might have touched the chair after touching the door handle).     [ edit ]   Biological   There are many different theories about the cause of obsessive-compulsive disorder. The majority of researchers believe that there is some type of abnormality with the  neurotransmitter   serotonin , among other possible psychological or biological abnormalities; however, it is possible that this activity is the brain's  response  to OCD, and not its cause.             This article  may contain  original research  or  unverified claims . Please  improve the article  by adding  references . See the  talk page  for details.  (January 2009)       Serotonin is thought to have a role in regulating anxiety, though it is also thought to be involved in such processes as  sleep  and  memory  function. In order to send chemical messages, serotonin must bind to the  receptor  sites located on the neighboring nerve cell. It is hypothesized that OCD sufferers may have blocked or damaged receptor sites that prevent serotonin from functioning to its full potential. This suggestion is supported by the fact that many OCD patients benefit from the use of  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  (SSRIs)a class of  antidepressant  medications that allow for more serotonin to be readily available to other nerve cells. [ 29 ]  For more about this class of drugs, see the  section about potential treatments  for OCD.   The  Stanford University School of Medicine  OCD webpage states, ""Although the causes of the disorder still elude us, the recent identification of children with OCD caused by an autoimmune response to  Group A streptococcal infection  promises to bring increased understanding of the disorder's pathogenesis."" [ 30 ]   Recent research has revealed a possible  genetic mutation  that could help to cause OCD. Researchers funded by the  National Institutes of Health  have found a  mutation  in the human serotonin transporter gene,  hSERT , in unrelated families with OCD. Moreover, in his study of identical twins, Rasmussen (1994) produced data that supported the idea that there is a ""heritable factor for neurotic anxiety"". [ 31 ]  In addition, he noted that environmental factors also play a role in how these anxiety symptoms are expressed. However, various studies on this topic are still being conducted and the presence of a genetic link is not yet definitely established.   Another possible genetic cause of OCD was discovered in August 2007 by scientists at  Duke University Medical Center  in North Carolina. They genetically engineered mice that lacked a  gene  called  SAPAP3 . This  protein  is highly expressed in the  striatum , an area of the  brain  linked to planning and the initiation of appropriate actions. The mice spent three times as much time grooming themselves as ordinary mice, to the point that their fur fell off. [ 32 ]   Using tools like  positron emission tomography  (PET scans), it has been shown that those with OCD tend to have brain activity that differs from those who do not have this disorder. [ 33 ]  A popular explanation for OCD is that offered in the book  Brain Lock  by Jeffrey Schwartz, which suggests that OCD is caused by the part of the brain that is responsible for translating complex intentions (e.g., ""I will pick up this cup"") into fundamental actions (e.g., ""move arm forward, rotate hand 15 degrees, etc."") failing to correctly communicate the chemical message that an action has been completed. This is perceived as a feeling of doubt and incompleteness, which then leads the individual to attempt to consciously deconstruct their own prior behaviora process which induces anxiety in most people, even those without OCD [ citation needed ] .   It has been theorized that a miscommunication between the  orbitofrontal cortex , the  caudate nucleus , and the  thalamus  may be a factor in the explanation of OCD. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is the first part of the brain to notice whether or not something is wrong. [ vague ]  When the OFC notices that something is wrong, it sends an initial ""worry signal"" to the thalamus. When the thalamus receives this signal, it in turn sends signals back to the OFC to interpret the worrying event. The caudate nucleus lies between the OFC and the thalamus and prevents the initial worry signal from being sent back to the thalamus after it has already been received. However, it is suggested that in those with OCD, the caudate nucleus does not function properly, and therefore does not prevent this initial signal from recurring. This causes the thalamus to become hyperactive and creates a virtually never-ending loop of worry signals being sent back and forth between the OFC and the thalamus. The OFC responds by increasing anxiety and engaging in  compulsive behaviors  in an attempt to relieve this apprehension. [ 29 ]  This overactivity of the OFC is shown to be attenuated in patients who have successfully responded to  SSRI  medication. The increased stimulation of the  serotonin  receptors  5-HT2A  and  5-HT2C  in the OFC is believed to cause this inhibition.  [ 34 ]   Some research has discovered an association between a type of size abnormality in different  brain structures  and the predisposition to develop OCD. Through the use of  magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI), researchers at  Cambridge's Brain Mapping Unit  were able to discover distinctive patterns in the brain structure of individuals with OCD and their close family members.  [ 35 ]  This is the first instance in which it has been demonstrated that those with a familial risk of developing OCD have anatomical differences when compared with ordinary individuals. The discovery of these structural differences in the area of the brain associated with stopping  motor response  may ultimately aid researchers who seek to determine which genes contribute to the development of OCD.   In some patients, the consumption of  caffeine  may make OCD symptoms worse.  [ 36 ]     [ edit ]   Demographics and other statistics   In a 1980 study of 20,000 adults from  New Haven ,  Baltimore ,  St. Louis ,  Durham , and  Los Angeles , the lifetime prevalence rate of OCD for both sexes was recorded at 2.5 percent. Education also appears to be a factor. The lifetime prevalence of OCD is lower for those who have graduated high school than for those who have not (1.9 percent versus 3.4 percent). However, in the case of college education, lifetime prevalence is higher for those who graduate with a degree (3.1 percent) than it is for those who have only some college background (2.4 percent). As far as age is concerned, the onset of OCD usually ranges from the late teenage years until the mid-20s in both sexes, but the age of onset tends to be slightly younger in males than in females. [ 37 ]   It has been alleged that sufferers are generally of above-average  intelligence , as the very nature of the disorder necessitates complicated thinking patterns [ 38 ] .     [ edit ]   Treatment   According to the Expert Consensus Guidelines for the Treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder,  behavioral therapy  (BT),  cognitive therapy  (CT), and  medications  are first-line treatments for OCD.  Psychodynamic psychotherapy  may help in managing some aspects of the disorder, but there are no controlled studies that demonstrate effectiveness of  psychoanalysis  or  dynamic psychotherapy  in OCD. [ 39 ]     [ edit ]   Behavioral therapy   The specific technique used in BT/CBT is called  exposure and ritual prevention  (also known as "" exposure and response prevention "") or ERP; this involves gradually learning to tolerate the anxiety associated with not performing the ritual behavior. At first, for example, someone might touch something only very mildly ""contaminated"" (such as a tissue that has been touched by another tissue that has been touched by the end of a toothpick that has touched a book that came from a ""contaminated"" location, such as a school.) That is the ""exposure"". The ""ritual prevention"" is not washing. Another example might be leaving the house and checking the lock only once (exposure) without going back and checking again (ritual prevention). The person fairly quickly  habituates  to the anxiety-producing situation and discovers that their anxiety level has dropped considerably; they can then progress to touching something more ""contaminated"" or not checking the lock at allagain, without performing the ritual behavior of washing or checking.   Exposure ritual/response prevention has been demonstrated to be the most effective treatment for OCD. It has generally been accepted that  psychotherapy , in combination with  psychotropic medication , is more effective than either option alone. However, more recent studies have shown no difference in outcomes for those treated with the combination of medicine and CBT versus CBT alone. [ 40 ]   Recently it has been reported simultaneous administration of D-Cycloserin (an antibiotic) substantially improves effectiveness of Exposure and Response prevention. [ 41 ]     [ edit ]   Medication   Medications as treatment include  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  (SSRIs) such as  paroxetine (Seroxat, Paxil, Xetanor, ParoMerck, Rexetin) ,  sertraline (Zoloft, Stimuloton) ,  fluoxetine (Prozac, Bioxetin) ,  escitalopram  (Lexapro), and  fluvoxamine (Luvox)  as well as the  tricyclic antidepressants , in particular  clomipramine (Anafranil) . SSRIs prevent excess  serotonin  from being pumped back into the original  neuron  that released it. Instead, serotonin can then bind to the  receptor  sites of nearby neurons and send chemical messages or signals that can help regulate the excessive  anxiety  and obsessive thoughts. In some treatment-resistant cases, a combination of  clomipramine  and an SSRI has shown to be effective even when neither drug on its own has been efficacious.   Benzodiazepines  are also used in treatment. It's not uncommon to administer this class of drugs during the ""latency period"" for SSRIs or as synergistic adjunct long-term. Although widely prescribed, benzodiazepines have not been demonstrated as an effective treatment for OCD and may be habit-forming in those with a history of substance abuse. [ 42 ]   Serotonergic   antidepressants  typically take longer to show benefit in OCD than with most other disorders which they are used to treat, as it is common for 23 months to elapse before any tangible improvement is noticed. In addition to this, the treatment usually requires high doses.  Fluoxetine , for example, is usually prescribed in doses of 20 mg per day for clinical depression, whereas with OCD the dose will often range from 20 mg to 80 mg or higher, if necessary. In most cases  antidepressant therapy  alone will only provide a partial reduction in symptoms, even in cases that are not deemed treatment-resistant. Much current research is devoted to the therapeutic potential of the agents that effect the release of the neurotransmitter  glutamate  or the binding to its receptors. These include  riluzole ,  memantine ,  gabapentin (Neurontin)  and  lamotrigine (Lamictal) .   Low doses of the newer  atypical antipsychotics   olanzapine (Zyprexa) ,  quetiapine (Seroquel) ,  ziprasidone  and  risperidone (Risperdal)  have also been found to be useful as adjuncts in the treatment of OCD. The use of  antipsychotics  in OCD must be undertaken carefully, however, since, although there is very strong evidence that at low doses they are beneficial (most likely due to their  dopamine receptor   antagonism ), at high doses these same antipsychotics have proven to cause dramatic obsessive-compulsive symptoms even in those patients who do not normally have OCD. This can be due to the antagonism of  5-HT2A receptors  becoming very prominent at these doses and outweighing the benefits of  dopamine  antagonism. However antidepressant mirtazapine which is a 5-HT2A antagonist has shown to be of benefit to OCD patients [ 43 ] . Another point that must be noted with antipsychotic treatment is that SSRIs inhibit the chief  enzyme  that is responsible for  metabolising  antipsychotics CYP2D6 so the dose will be effectively higher than expected when these are combined with SSRIs. Also, it must be noted that antipsychotic treatment should be considered as augmentation treatment when SSRI treatment does not bring positive results.     [ edit ]   Alternative drug treatments   The naturally occurring sugar  inositol  has been suggested as a treatment for OCD [ 44 ] , as it appears to modulate the actions of serotonin and reverse  desensitisation  of  neurotransmitter  receptors.  St John's Wort  has been claimed to be of benefit due to its (non-selective) serotonin re-uptake inhibiting qualities [ citations needed ] , although a double-blind study using a flexible-dose schedule (600-1800 mg/day) found no difference between St John's Wort and a placebo [ 45 ] .   Nutrition deficiencies  may also contribute to OCD and other  mental disorders .  Vitamin  and mineral supplements may aid in such disorders and provide  nutrients  necessary for proper mental functioning [ 46 ] .   Opioids  may significantly reduce OCD symptoms, though their use is not sanctioned for treatment due to  physical dependence  and long term drug tolerance [ citations needed ] . Tramadol is an atypical opioid that appears to provide the anti-OCD effects of an  opiate  and inhibit the  re-uptake  of serotonin (in addition to  norepinephrine ) [ 47 ] .   Tryptamine   alkaloid   psilocybin  has been attempted as treatment [ 48 ] . There are reports that other  hallucinogens  such as  LSD  and  peyote  have produced similar effects [ citations needed ] . It has been hypothesised that this effect may be due to stimulation of  5-HT2A receptors  and, less significantly,  5-HT2C receptors ; this causes an inhibitory effect on the  orbitofrontal cortex , an area of the brain in which  hyperactivity  has been strongly associated with OCD [ 49 ] .   Regular  nicotine  treatment may ameliorate symptoms of OCD, although the  pharmacodynamical  mechanism by which this is achieved is not yet known, and more detailed studies are needed to fully confirm this  hypothesis [ 50 ] .     [ edit ]   Psycho-surgery   For some, neither medication, support groups nor psychological treatments are helpful in alleviating obsessive-compulsive symptoms. These patients may choose to undergo  psychosurgery  as a last resort. In this procedure, a surgical  lesion  is made in an area of the brain (the  cingulate bundle ). In one study, 30% of participants benefited significantly from this procedure. [ 8 ]   Deep-brain stimulation  and  vagus nerve stimulation  are possible surgical options which do not require the destruction of  brain tissue , although their efficacy has not been conclusively demonstrated.   In the US, psychosurgery for OCD is a treatment of last resort and will not be performed until the patient has failed several attempts at medication (at the full dosage) with augmentation, and many months of intensive  cognitive-behavioral therapy  with exposure and ritual/response prevention. [ 51 ]  Likewise, in the UK, psychosurgery cannot be performed unless a course of treatment from a suitably qualified cognitive-behavioural therapist has been carried out.     [ edit ]   Neuropsychiatry   Main article:  Neuropsychiatry   OCD primarily involves the  brain regions  of the  striatum , the  orbitofrontal cortex  and the  cingulate cortex . OCD involves several different  receptors , mostly  H 2 ,  M 4 ,  NK 1 ,  NMDA , and non-NMDA  glutamate receptors . [ citation needed ]  The receptors  5-HT 1D ,  5-HT 2C , and the   opioid receptor  exert a secondary effect. The H 2 , M 4 , NK 1 , and  non-NMDA glutamate  receptors are active in the striatum, whereas the  NMDA receptors  are active in the cingulate cortex.   The activity of certain receptors is positively correlated to the severity of OCD, whereas the activity of certain other receptors is negatively correlated to the severity of OCD. Correlations where activity is positively correlated to severity include the histamine receptor ( H 2 ); the Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor( M 4 ); the Tachykinin receptor ( NK 1 ); and non-NMDA  glutamate receptors . Correlations where activity is negatively correlated to severity include the NMDA receptor ( NMDA ); the Mu opioid receptor (  opioid ); and two types of 5-HT receptors ( 5-HT 1D  and  5-HT 2C ) The central dysfunction of OCD may involve the receptors nk1, non-NMDA  glutamate  receptors, and NMDA, whereas the other receptors could simply exert secondary modulatory effects.   Pharmaceuticals that act directly on those core mechanisms are  aprepitant  (nk1 antagonist),  riluzole  (glutamate release inhibitor), and  tautomycin  (NMDA receptor sensitizer). Also, the anti-Alzheimer's drug  memantine  is being studied by the  OC Foundation  in its efficacy in reducing OCD symptoms due to it being an  NMDA antagonist . One case study published in  The American Journal of Psychiatry  suggests that ""memantine may be an option for treatment-resistant OCD, but controlled studies are needed to substantiate this observation."" [ 52 ]  The drugs that are popularly used to fight OCD lack full efficacy because they do not act upon what are believed to be the core mechanisms. Many trials are currently underway to investigate the efficacy of a variety of agents that affect these 'core' neurotransmitters, particularly glutamatergic agents. [2]     [ edit ]   Notable cases     British poet, essayist, and lexicographer  Samuel Johnson  is an example of a historical figure with a  retrospective diagnosis  of OCD. He had elaborate rituals for crossing the thresholds of doorways, repeatedly walked up and down staircases counting the steps, and had compulsions regarding repetitive prayer which were most likely a form of religious scrupulosity. [ 53 ] [ 54 ] [ 55 ]       American aviator and filmmaker  Howard Hughes  is known to have suffered from OCD and it is believed that his mother may have also been a sufferer. Friends of Hughes have mentioned his obsession with minor flaws in clothing and he is reported to have had a great fear of germs, common among OCD patients. [ 56 ]  He did also suffer from Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) due to an aviation accident in which he was severely injured. This resulted in him becoming reclusive later in life.       English footballer  David Beckham  has been outspoken regarding his struggle with OCD. He has told media that he has to count all his clothes, and that magazines have to lie in a straight line. No more than three soda cans are allowed in his refrigerator, and if there are any more at home they have to be placed in a cupboard. He has explained that the reason he gets more tattoos is that he feels addicted to the pain of the needle. In hotels, any books that are on a shelf must be placed in the drawer. He has expressed a desire to get help for his problems.

For other uses, see  OCD (disambiguation) .       Obsessive-compulsive disorder   Classification and external resources       ICD - 10   F 42.       Obsessive-compulsive disorder  ( OCD ) is a  mental disorder  most commonly characterized by  intrusive , repetitive thoughts resulting in  compulsive behaviors  and mental acts that the person feels driven to perform, according to rules that must be applied rigidly, aimed at reducing  anxiety  by preventing some dreaded event or by resolving a more nebulous sense of tension. However, the likelihood that a dreaded event will occur, or the causal relationship between the performance of compulsions and the reduction of this likelihood, tends to be imagined or exaggerated.   OCD is the fourth most common mental disorder and is nearly as common as  asthma  and  diabetes mellitus . [ 1 ]  In the  United States , one in 50 adults has OCD. [ 2 ]  In severe cases, it affects a person's ability to function in everyday activities. The disorder often has a serious impact on the sufferer's (and their family's)  quality of life . Also, the psychological self-awareness of the  irrationality  of the disorder can be painful. For people with severe OCD, it may take several hours a day to carry out the compulsive acts.   The phrase ""obsessive-compulsive"" has become part of the English lexicon, and is often used in an informal or caricatured manner to describe someone who is meticulous,  perfectionistic , absorbed in a cause, or otherwise fixated on something or someone. [ 3 ]  Although these signs are often present in OCD, a person who exhibits them does not necessarily have OCD, and may instead have  obsessive-compulsive  personality  disorder  (OCPD) or some other condition.

The Quick Reference to the diagnostic criteria from DSM-IV-TR (2000) [ 4 ]  states six characteristics of obsessions and compulsions:     Obsessions       Recurrent and persistent thoughts,  impulses , or images that are experienced as intrusive and that cause marked anxiety or distress.   The thoughts, impulses, or images are not simply excessive worries about real-life problems.   The person attempts to ignore or suppress such thoughts, impulses, or images, or to neutralize them with some other thought or action.   The person recognizes that the obsessional thoughts, impulses, or images are a product of his or her own mind, and are not based in reality.       Compulsions       Repetitive behaviors or mental acts that the person feels driven to perform in response to an obsession, or according to rules that must be applied rigidly.   The behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing distress or preventing some dreaded event or situation; however, these behaviors or mental acts are not actually connected to the issue, or they are excessive.     In addition to these criteria, at some point during the course of the disorder, the individual must realize that his/her obsessions or compulsions are unreasonable or excessive. Moreover, the obsessions or compulsions must be time-consuming (taking up more than one hour per day), cause distress, or cause impairment in social, occupational, or school functioning. [ 4 ]  OCD often causes feelings similar to those of  depression .     [ edit ]   Symptoms and prevalence   OCD manifests in a variety of forms. Studies have placed the prevalence between one and three percent, although the prevalence of clinically recognized OCD is much lower, suggesting that many individuals with the disorder may not be diagnosed. [ 5 ]  The fact that many individuals do not seek treatment may be due in part to  stigma  associated with OCD. Another reason for not seeking treatment is that many sufferers of OCD do not realize that they have the condition.   The typical OCD sufferer performs tasks (or  compulsions ) to seek relief from obsession-related anxiety. To others, these tasks may appear odd and unnecessary. But for the sufferer, such tasks can feel critically important, and must be performed in particular ways to ward off dire consequences and to stop the  stress  from building up. Examples of these tasks are repeatedly checking that one's parked car has been locked before leaving it, turning lights on and off a set number of times before exiting a room, repeatedly washing hands at regular intervals throughout the day, touching objects a certain number of times before leaving a room, or walking in a certain routine way. Physical symptoms may include those brought on from anxieties and unwanted thoughts, as well as  tics  or  Parkinson's disease -like symptoms: rigidity, tremor, jerking arm movements, or involuntary movements of the limbs.   Formal diagnosis may be performed by a  psychologist , a  psychiatrist  or  psychoanalyst . OCD sufferers are aware that their thoughts and behavior are not rational, [ 6 ]  but they feel bound to comply with them to fend off feelings of panic or dread. Although everyone may experience unpleasant thoughts at one time or another, these are short-lived and fade away in time. [ 7 ]  For people with OCD, the thoughts are intrusive and persistent, and can cause them great anxiety and distress. [ 8 ]   Intrusive thoughts  are unwelcome, involuntary thoughts, images or unpleasant ideas that may become  obsessions , are upsetting or distressing, and can be difficult to be free of and manage. [ 9 ]  As with other forms of OCD, the awareness of the irrationality of these thoughts can be frustrating as the individual wishes to stop them but cannot. Intrusive thoughts, urges, and images are of inappropriate things at inappropriate times, usually falling into three categories: inappropriate aggressive thoughts, inappropriate sexual thoughts, and blasphemous religious thoughts. [ 10 ]  Most people experience these thoughts; when they are associated with OCD or  depression , they may become paralyzing,  anxiety -provoking, and persistent. Many people experience the type of unpleasant or unwanted thoughts that people with more troubling intrusive thoughts have, but most people are able to dismiss these thoughts. [ 9 ]  When intrusive thoughts co-occur with OCD, patients are less capable of ignoring the unpleasant thoughts and may pay undue attention to them, causing the thoughts to become more frequent and distressing. [ 9 ]   The common underlying theme to the diverse intrusive thoughts is summarised by Bruce  et al  with the example, ""What if I were to snap, lose control of myself, and do something totally uncharacteristic of me--perhaps even without my knowing it--that results in harm to myself or someone else?"" [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   OCD without Overt compulsions   A major subtype of OCD is OCD without overt compulsions. [ 12 ]  OCD without overt compulsions is often referred to as ""pure-O"" by laymen and sufferers of this disorder. The term is a bit of a misnomer, however, since OCD without overt compulsions is no more ""pure"" than any other form of OCD. Nonetheless, OCD without overt compulsions represents a major subtype of OCD with some of the estimates as high 50-60%. [ 13 ]  Rather than engaging in observable rituals and compulsions, the person with OCD without overt compulsions engages in all manner of mental neutralizing behaviours (i.e. ""covert"" compulsions).   Intrusive thoughts may involve violent obsessions about hurting others or oneself. [ 14 ]  They can include such thoughts as harming an innocent child, jumping from a bridge, mountain or the top of a tall building, urges to jump in front of a train or automobile, and urges to push another in front of a train or automobile. [ 10 ]  A survey of healthy college students found that virtually all of them had intrusive thoughts from time to time, including imagining or wishing harm upon a family member or friend, impulses to attack or kill a small child, or animal, or shout something rude or violent. [ 15 ]   The possibility that most patients suffering from intrusive thoughts will ever act on those thoughts is low; patients who are experiencing intense guilt, anxiety, shame, and anger over bad thoughts are different from those who actually act on bad thoughts. The history of violent crime is dominated by those who feel no guilt or remorse; the very fact that someone is tormented by intrusive thoughts, and has never acted on them before, is an excellent predictor that they won't act upon the thoughts. According to Baer, a patient should be concerned that intrusive thoughts are dangerous if the person doesn't feel upset by the thoughts, rather finds them pleasurable; has ever acted on violent or sexual thoughts or urges; hears voices or sees things that others don't see; or feels uncontrollable irresistible anger. [ 16 ]   Sexual obsessions may involve intrusive thoughts or images of ""kissing, hugging a lot, touching, fondling, oral sex, anal sex, intercourse, and rape"" with ""strangers, acquaintances, parents, children, family members, friends, coworkers, animals and religious figures"", involving ""heterosexual or homosexual content"" with persons of any age. [ 17 ]  Like other intrusive, unpleasant thoughts or images, most people have some inappropriate sexual thoughts at times, but people with OCD may attach significance to the unwanted sexual thoughts, generating anxiety and distress. The doubt that accompanies OCD leads to uncertainty regarding whether one might act on the bad thoughts, resulting in self-criticism or loathing. [ 17 ]     [ edit ]   OCD with Overt Compulsions   Other major subtypes of OCD frequently revolve around washing or checking; some sufferers may fear the presence of human body secretions such as saliva, blood, semen, sweat, tears, vomit, or mucus, or excretions such as urine or feces. Some OCD sufferers even fear that the soap they are using is contaminated. [ 18 ]  These anxiety-driven fears often result in various compulsive cleaning behaviours, and may cause a person to experience significant distress, which may make it difficult for a person with OCD to tolerate a workplace, venture into public locations, or conduct normal social relationships.   Symptoms related to performing tasks may include repeated hand washing [ 19 ]  or clearing of the throat; specific counting systems or counting of steps; doing repetitive actionsmore generally, this can involve an obsession with numbers or types of numbers (e.g., odd numbers). For example, when somebody suffering from OCD leaves the house, they might tap the door knob 9 times and if they don't they will go into distress, panic and even at certain times, they will pass out. These obsessive behaviors can cause individuals to feel psychological distress, because they are very concerned about having ""made mistakes"" in the number of steps that they have taken, or the number of stairs on a staircase. For some people with OCD, these obsessive counting and re-counting tasks, along with the attendant anxiety and fear, can take hours of each day, which can make it hard for the person to fulfill their work, family, or social roles. In some cases, these behaviors can also cause adverse physical symptoms: people who obsessively wash their hands with  antibacterial soap  and hot water (to remove germs) can make their skin red and raw with  dermatitis . [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Related conditions   OCD is often confused with the separate condition  obsessive-compulsive personality disorder . The two are not the same condition, however. OCD is  ego  dystonic , meaning that the disorder is incompatible with the sufferer's self-concept.  [ 20 ] [ 21 ]  Because disorders that are ego dystonic go against an individual's perception of his/herself, they tend to cause much distress. OCPD, on the other hand, is  ego syntonic marked by the individual's acceptance that the characteristics displayed as a result of this disorder are compatible with his/her self-image. Ego syntonic disorders understandably cause no distress. Persons suffering from OCD are often aware that their behavior is not rational and are unhappy about their obsessions but nevertheless feel compelled by them. Persons with OCPD are not aware of anything abnormal about themselves; they will readily explain why their actions are rational, and it is usually impossible to convince them otherwise. Persons with OCD are ridden with  anxiety ; persons who suffer from OCPD, by contrast, tend to derive pleasure from their obsessions or compulsions. [ 22 ]  This is a significant difference between these disorders.   Equally frequently, these rationalizations do not apply to the overall behavior, but to each instance individually; for example, a person compulsively checking their front door may argue that the time taken and stress caused by one more check of the front door is considerably less than the time and stress associated with being robbed, and thus the check is the better option. In practice, after that check, the individual is  still  not sure, and it is  still  better in terms of time and stress to do one more check, and this reasoning can continue as long as necessary.   Some OCD sufferers exhibit what is known as  overvalued ideas . In such cases, the person with OCD will truly be uncertain whether the fears that cause them to perform their compulsions are irrational or not. After some discussion, it is possible to convince the individual that their fears may be unfounded. It may be more difficult to do  ERP therapy  on such patients, because they may be, at least initially, unwilling to cooperate. For this reason OCD has often been likened to a disease of pathological doubt, in which the sufferer, while not usually  delusional , is often unable to realize fully what sorts of dreaded events are reasonably possible and which are not. There are severe cases when the sufferer has an unshakeable belief within the context of OCD which is difficult to differentiate from psychosis. [ 23 ]   OCD is different from behaviors such as  gambling  addiction and  overeating . People with these disorders typically experience at least some pleasure from their activity; OCD sufferers do not actively want to perform their compulsive tasks, and experience no pleasure from doing so. OCD is placed in the anxiety class of  mental illness , but like many  chronic stress disorders  it can lead to  clinical depression  over time. The constant stress of the condition can cause sufferers to develop a deadening of spirit, a numbing frustration, or sense of hopelessness. OCD's effects on day-to-day lifeparticularly its substantial consumption of timecan produce difficulties with work, finances and relationships. There is no known cure for OCD as of yet, but there are a number of successful treatment options available.     [ edit ]   Related/Spectrum disorders   People with OCD may be diagnosed with other conditions, such as  generalized anxiety disorder ,  anorexia nervosa ,  social anxiety disorder ,  bulimia nervosa ,  Tourette syndrome ,  Asperger syndrome ,  compulsive skin picking ,  body dysmorphic disorder ,  trichotillomania , and (as already mentioned)  obsessive-compulsive personality disorder . There is some research demonstrating a link between  drug addiction  and OCD as well. Many who suffer from OCD also suffer from  panic attacks . There is a higher risk of drug addiction among those with any anxiety disorder (possibly as a way of  coping  with the heightened levels of  anxiety ), but drug addiction among OCD patients may serve as a type of  compulsive behavior  and not just as a coping mechanism.  Depression  is also extremely prevalent among sufferers of OCD. One explanation for the high depression rate among OCD populations was posited by Mineka, Watson, and Clark (1998), who explained that people with OCD (or any other  anxiety disorder ) may feel depressed because of an ""out of control"" type of feeling. [ 24 ]   Some cases are thought to be caused at least in part by childhood  streptococcal  infections and are termed  PANDAS  (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infections). The streptococcal  antibodies  become involved in an  autoimmune  process. Though this idea is not set in stone, if it does prove to be true, there is cause to believe that OCD can to some very small extent be ""caught"" via exposure to strep throat (just as one may catch a cold). However, if OCD is caused by bacteria, this provides hope that  antibiotics  may eventually be used to treat or prevent it. [ 25 ]     [ edit ]   Causes     [ edit ]   Psychological   Scientists studying obsessive-compulsive disorder generally agree that both psychological and biological factors play a role in causing the disorder, although they differ in their degree of emphasis upon either type of factor.   From the 14th to the 16th century in Europe, it was believed that people who experienced blasphemous, sexual, or other obsessive thoughts were  possessed  by the  Devil . [ 26 ]  Based on this reasoning, treatment involved banishing the ""evil"" from the ""possessed"" person through  exorcism . [ 27 ]  In the early 1910s,  Sigmund Freud  attributed obsessive-compulsive behavior to unconscious conflicts which manifested as symptoms. [ 27 ]  Freud describes the clinical history of a typical case of ""touching phobia"" as starting in early childhood, when the person has a strong desire to touch an item. In response, the person develops an ""external prohibition"" against this type of touching. However, this ""prohibition does not succeed in abolishing"" the desire to touch; all it can do is repress the desire and ""force it into the unconscious"". [ 28 ]   The cognitive-behavioral model suggests that compulsive behaviour is carried out to remove anxiety-provoking intrusive thoughts. Unfortunately this only brings about temporary relief as the thought re-emerges. Each time the behaviour occurs it is negatively reinforced (see  Reinforcement ) by the relief from anxiety, thereby explaining why the dysfunctional activity increases and generalises (extends to other, related stimuli) over a period of time. For example, after touching a door-knob a person might have the thought that they may develop a disease as a result of contamination. They then experience anxiety, which is relieved when they wash their hands. This might be followed by the thought ""but did I wash them properly?"" causing an increase in anxiety once more, the hand-washing once again rewarded by the removal of anxiety (albeit briefly) and the cycle being repeated when thoughts of contamination re-occur. The distressing thoughts might then spread to fear of contamination from e.g. a chair (someone might have touched the chair after touching the door handle).     [ edit ]   Biological   There are many different theories about the cause of obsessive-compulsive disorder. The majority of researchers believe that there is some type of abnormality with the  neurotransmitter   serotonin , among other possible psychological or biological abnormalities; however, it is possible that this activity is the brain's  response  to OCD, and not its cause.             This article  may contain  original research  or  unverified claims . Please  improve the article  by adding  references . See the  talk page  for details.  (January 2009)       Serotonin is thought to have a role in regulating anxiety, though it is also thought to be involved in such processes as  sleep  and  memory  function. In order to send chemical messages, serotonin must bind to the  receptor  sites located on the neighboring nerve cell. It is hypothesized that OCD sufferers may have blocked or damaged receptor sites that prevent serotonin from functioning to its full potential. This suggestion is supported by the fact that many OCD patients benefit from the use of  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  (SSRIs)a class of  antidepressant  medications that allow for more serotonin to be readily available to other nerve cells. [ 29 ]  For more about this class of drugs, see the  section about potential treatments  for OCD.   The  Stanford University School of Medicine  OCD webpage states, ""Although the causes of the disorder still elude us, the recent identification of children with OCD caused by an autoimmune response to  Group A streptococcal infection  promises to bring increased understanding of the disorder's pathogenesis."" [ 30 ]   Recent research has revealed a possible  genetic mutation  that could help to cause OCD. Researchers funded by the  National Institutes of Health  have found a  mutation  in the human serotonin transporter gene,  hSERT , in unrelated families with OCD. Moreover, in his study of identical twins, Rasmussen (1994) produced data that supported the idea that there is a ""heritable factor for neurotic anxiety"". [ 31 ]  In addition, he noted that environmental factors also play a role in how these anxiety symptoms are expressed. However, various studies on this topic are still being conducted and the presence of a genetic link is not yet definitely established.   Another possible genetic cause of OCD was discovered in August 2007 by scientists at  Duke University Medical Center  in North Carolina. They genetically engineered mice that lacked a  gene  called  SAPAP3 . This  protein  is highly expressed in the  striatum , an area of the  brain  linked to planning and the initiation of appropriate actions. The mice spent three times as much time grooming themselves as ordinary mice, to the point that their fur fell off. [ 32 ]   Using tools like  positron emission tomography  (PET scans), it has been shown that those with OCD tend to have brain activity that differs from those who do not have this disorder. [ 33 ]  A popular explanation for OCD is that offered in the book  Brain Lock  by Jeffrey Schwartz, which suggests that OCD is caused by the part of the brain that is responsible for translating complex intentions (e.g., ""I will pick up this cup"") into fundamental actions (e.g., ""move arm forward, rotate hand 15 degrees, etc."") failing to correctly communicate the chemical message that an action has been completed. This is perceived as a feeling of doubt and incompleteness, which then leads the individual to attempt to consciously deconstruct their own prior behaviora process which induces anxiety in most people, even those without OCD [ citation needed ] .   It has been theorized that a miscommunication between the  orbitofrontal cortex , the  caudate nucleus , and the  thalamus  may be a factor in the explanation of OCD. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is the first part of the brain to notice whether or not something is wrong. [ vague ]  When the OFC notices that something is wrong, it sends an initial ""worry signal"" to the thalamus. When the thalamus receives this signal, it in turn sends signals back to the OFC to interpret the worrying event. The caudate nucleus lies between the OFC and the thalamus and prevents the initial worry signal from being sent back to the thalamus after it has already been received. However, it is suggested that in those with OCD, the caudate nucleus does not function properly, and therefore does not prevent this initial signal from recurring. This causes the thalamus to become hyperactive and creates a virtually never-ending loop of worry signals being sent back and forth between the OFC and the thalamus. The OFC responds by increasing anxiety and engaging in  compulsive behaviors  in an attempt to relieve this apprehension. [ 29 ]  This overactivity of the OFC is shown to be attenuated in patients who have successfully responded to  SSRI  medication. The increased stimulation of the  serotonin  receptors  5-HT2A  and  5-HT2C  in the OFC is believed to cause this inhibition.  [ 34 ]   Some research has discovered an association between a type of size abnormality in different  brain structures  and the predisposition to develop OCD. Through the use of  magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI), researchers at  Cambridge's Brain Mapping Unit  were able to discover distinctive patterns in the brain structure of individuals with OCD and their close family members.  [ 35 ]  This is the first instance in which it has been demonstrated that those with a familial risk of developing OCD have anatomical differences when compared with ordinary individuals. The discovery of these structural differences in the area of the brain associated with stopping  motor response  may ultimately aid researchers who seek to determine which genes contribute to the development of OCD.   In some patients, the consumption of  caffeine  may make OCD symptoms worse.  [ 36 ]     [ edit ]   Demographics and other statistics   In a 1980 study of 20,000 adults from  New Haven ,  Baltimore ,  St. Louis ,  Durham , and  Los Angeles , the lifetime prevalence rate of OCD for both sexes was recorded at 2.5 percent. Education also appears to be a factor. The lifetime prevalence of OCD is lower for those who have graduated high school than for those who have not (1.9 percent versus 3.4 percent). However, in the case of college education, lifetime prevalence is higher for those who graduate with a degree (3.1 percent) than it is for those who have only some college background (2.4 percent). As far as age is concerned, the onset of OCD usually ranges from the late teenage years until the mid-20s in both sexes, but the age of onset tends to be slightly younger in males than in females. [ 37 ]   It has been alleged that sufferers are generally of above-average  intelligence , as the very nature of the disorder necessitates complicated thinking patterns [ 38 ] .     [ edit ]   Treatment   According to the Expert Consensus Guidelines for the Treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder,  behavioral therapy  (BT),  cognitive therapy  (CT), and  medications  are first-line treatments for OCD.  Psychodynamic psychotherapy  may help in managing some aspects of the disorder, but there are no controlled studies that demonstrate effectiveness of  psychoanalysis  or  dynamic psychotherapy  in OCD. [ 39 ]     [ edit ]   Behavioral therapy   The specific technique used in BT/CBT is called  exposure and ritual prevention  (also known as "" exposure and response prevention "") or ERP; this involves gradually learning to tolerate the anxiety associated with not performing the ritual behavior. At first, for example, someone might touch something only very mildly ""contaminated"" (such as a tissue that has been touched by another tissue that has been touched by the end of a toothpick that has touched a book that came from a ""contaminated"" location, such as a school.) That is the ""exposure"". The ""ritual prevention"" is not washing. Another example might be leaving the house and checking the lock only once (exposure) without going back and checking again (ritual prevention). The person fairly quickly  habituates  to the anxiety-producing situation and discovers that their anxiety level has dropped considerably; they can then progress to touching something more ""contaminated"" or not checking the lock at allagain, without performing the ritual behavior of washing or checking.   Exposure ritual/response prevention has been demonstrated to be the most effective treatment for OCD. It has generally been accepted that  psychotherapy , in combination with  psychotropic medication , is more effective than either option alone. However, more recent studies have shown no difference in outcomes for those treated with the combination of medicine and CBT versus CBT alone. [ 40 ]   Recently it has been reported simultaneous administration of D-Cycloserin (an antibiotic) substantially improves effectiveness of Exposure and Response prevention. [ 41 ]     [ edit ]   Medication   Medications as treatment include  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  (SSRIs) such as  paroxetine (Seroxat, Paxil, Xetanor, ParoMerck, Rexetin) ,  sertraline (Zoloft, Stimuloton) ,  fluoxetine (Prozac, Bioxetin) ,  escitalopram  (Lexapro), and  fluvoxamine (Luvox)  as well as the  tricyclic antidepressants , in particular  clomipramine (Anafranil) . SSRIs prevent excess  serotonin  from being pumped back into the original  neuron  that released it. Instead, serotonin can then bind to the  receptor  sites of nearby neurons and send chemical messages or signals that can help regulate the excessive  anxiety  and obsessive thoughts. In some treatment-resistant cases, a combination of  clomipramine  and an SSRI has shown to be effective even when neither drug on its own has been efficacious.   Benzodiazepines  are also used in treatment. It's not uncommon to administer this class of drugs during the ""latency period"" for SSRIs or as synergistic adjunct long-term. Although widely prescribed, benzodiazepines have not been demonstrated as an effective treatment for OCD and may be habit-forming in those with a history of substance abuse. [ 42 ]   Serotonergic   antidepressants  typically take longer to show benefit in OCD than with most other disorders which they are used to treat, as it is common for 23 months to elapse before any tangible improvement is noticed. In addition to this, the treatment usually requires high doses.  Fluoxetine , for example, is usually prescribed in doses of 20 mg per day for clinical depression, whereas with OCD the dose will often range from 20 mg to 80 mg or higher, if necessary. In most cases  antidepressant therapy  alone will only provide a partial reduction in symptoms, even in cases that are not deemed treatment-resistant. Much current research is devoted to the therapeutic potential of the agents that effect the release of the neurotransmitter  glutamate  or the binding to its receptors. These include  riluzole ,  memantine ,  gabapentin (Neurontin)  and  lamotrigine (Lamictal) .   Low doses of the newer  atypical antipsychotics   olanzapine (Zyprexa) ,  quetiapine (Seroquel) ,  ziprasidone  and  risperidone (Risperdal)  have also been found to be useful as adjuncts in the treatment of OCD. The use of  antipsychotics  in OCD must be undertaken carefully, however, since, although there is very strong evidence that at low doses they are beneficial (most likely due to their  dopamine receptor   antagonism ), at high doses these same antipsychotics have proven to cause dramatic obsessive-compulsive symptoms even in those patients who do not normally have OCD. This can be due to the antagonism of  5-HT2A receptors  becoming very prominent at these doses and outweighing the benefits of  dopamine  antagonism. However antidepressant mirtazapine which is a 5-HT2A antagonist has shown to be of benefit to OCD patients [ 43 ] . Another point that must be noted with antipsychotic treatment is that SSRIs inhibit the chief  enzyme  that is responsible for  metabolising  antipsychotics CYP2D6 so the dose will be effectively higher than expected when these are combined with SSRIs. Also, it must be noted that antipsychotic treatment should be considered as augmentation treatment when SSRI treatment does not bring positive results.     [ edit ]   Alternative drug treatments   The naturally occurring sugar  inositol  has been suggested as a treatment for OCD [ 44 ] , as it appears to modulate the actions of serotonin and reverse  desensitisation  of  neurotransmitter  receptors.  St John's Wort  has been claimed to be of benefit due to its (non-selective) serotonin re-uptake inhibiting qualities [ citations needed ] , although a double-blind study using a flexible-dose schedule (600-1800 mg/day) found no difference between St John's Wort and a placebo [ 45 ] .   Nutrition deficiencies  may also contribute to OCD and other  mental disorders .  Vitamin  and mineral supplements may aid in such disorders and provide  nutrients  necessary for proper mental functioning [ 46 ] .   Opioids  may significantly reduce OCD symptoms, though their use is not sanctioned for treatment due to  physical dependence  and long term drug tolerance [ citations needed ] . Tramadol is an atypical opioid that appears to provide the anti-OCD effects of an  opiate  and inhibit the  re-uptake  of serotonin (in addition to  norepinephrine ) [ 47 ] .   Tryptamine   alkaloid   psilocybin  has been attempted as treatment [ 48 ] . There are reports that other  hallucinogens  such as  LSD  and  peyote  have produced similar effects [ citations needed ] . It has been hypothesised that this effect may be due to stimulation of  5-HT2A receptors  and, less significantly,  5-HT2C receptors ; this causes an inhibitory effect on the  orbitofrontal cortex , an area of the brain in which  hyperactivity  has been strongly associated with OCD [ 49 ] .   Regular  nicotine  treatment may ameliorate symptoms of OCD, although the  pharmacodynamical  mechanism by which this is achieved is not yet known, and more detailed studies are needed to fully confirm this  hypothesis [ 50 ] .     [ edit ]   Psycho-surgery   For some, neither medication, support groups nor psychological treatments are helpful in alleviating obsessive-compulsive symptoms. These patients may choose to undergo  psychosurgery  as a last resort. In this procedure, a surgical  lesion  is made in an area of the brain (the  cingulate bundle ). In one study, 30% of participants benefited significantly from this procedure. [ 8 ]   Deep-brain stimulation  and  vagus nerve stimulation  are possible surgical options which do not require the destruction of  brain tissue , although their efficacy has not been conclusively demonstrated.   In the US, psychosurgery for OCD is a treatment of last resort and will not be performed until the patient has failed several attempts at medication (at the full dosage) with augmentation, and many months of intensive  cognitive-behavioral therapy  with exposure and ritual/response prevention. [ 51 ]  Likewise, in the UK, psychosurgery cannot be performed unless a course of treatment from a suitably qualified cognitive-behavioural therapist has been carried out.     [ edit ]   Neuropsychiatry   Main article:  Neuropsychiatry   OCD primarily involves the  brain regions  of the  striatum , the  orbitofrontal cortex  and the  cingulate cortex . OCD involves several different  receptors , mostly  H 2 ,  M 4 ,  NK 1 ,  NMDA , and non-NMDA  glutamate receptors . [ citation needed ]  The receptors  5-HT 1D ,  5-HT 2C , and the   opioid receptor  exert a secondary effect. The H 2 , M 4 , NK 1 , and  non-NMDA glutamate  receptors are active in the striatum, whereas the  NMDA receptors  are active in the cingulate cortex.   The activity of certain receptors is positively correlated to the severity of OCD, whereas the activity of certain other receptors is negatively correlated to the severity of OCD. Correlations where activity is positively correlated to severity include the histamine receptor ( H 2 ); the Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor( M 4 ); the Tachykinin receptor ( NK 1 ); and non-NMDA  glutamate receptors . Correlations where activity is negatively correlated to severity include the NMDA receptor ( NMDA ); the Mu opioid receptor (  opioid ); and two types of 5-HT receptors ( 5-HT 1D  and  5-HT 2C ) The central dysfunction of OCD may involve the receptors nk1, non-NMDA  glutamate  receptors, and NMDA, whereas the other receptors could simply exert secondary modulatory effects.   Pharmaceuticals that act directly on those core mechanisms are  aprepitant  (nk1 antagonist),  riluzole  (glutamate release inhibitor), and  tautomycin  (NMDA receptor sensitizer). Also, the anti-Alzheimer's drug  memantine  is being studied by the  OC Foundation  in its efficacy in reducing OCD symptoms due to it being an  NMDA antagonist . One case study published in  The American Journal of Psychiatry  suggests that ""memantine may be an option for treatment-resistant OCD, but controlled studies are needed to substantiate this observation."" [ 52 ]  The drugs that are popularly used to fight OCD lack full efficacy because they do not act upon what are believed to be the core mechanisms. Many trials are currently underway to investigate the efficacy of a variety of agents that affect these 'core' neurotransmitters, particularly glutamatergic agents. [2]     [ edit ]   Notable cases     British poet, essayist, and lexicographer  Samuel Johnson  is an example of a historical figure with a  retrospective diagnosis  of OCD. He had elaborate rituals for crossing the thresholds of doorways, repeatedly walked up and down staircases counting the steps, and had compulsions regarding repetitive prayer which were most likely a form of religious scrupulosity. [ 53 ] [ 54 ] [ 55 ]       American aviator and filmmaker  Howard Hughes  is known to have suffered from OCD and it is believed that his mother may have also been a sufferer. Friends of Hughes have mentioned his obsession with minor flaws in clothing and he is reported to have had a great fear of germs, common among OCD patients. [ 56 ]  He did also suffer from Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) due to an aviation accident in which he was severely injured. This resulted in him becoming reclusive later in life.       English footballer  David Beckham  has been outspoken regarding his struggle with OCD. He has told media that he has to count all his clothes, and that magazines have to lie in a straight line. No more than three soda cans are allowed in his refrigerator, and if there are any more at home they have to be placed in a cupboard. He has explained that the reason he gets more tattoos is that he feels addicted to the pain of the needle. In hotels, any books that are on a shelf must be placed in the drawer. He has expressed a desire to get help for his problems.

If you or someone you care about has been diagnosed with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), you may feel you are the only person facing the difficulties of this illness. But you are not alone. In the United States, 1 in 50 adults have OCD, and twice that many have had it at some point in their lives. Today very effective treatments for OCD are now available to help you regain a more satisfying life. Here are answers to the most commonly asked questions about OCD.    What Is Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder?   Worries, doubts, and superstitious beliefs are common in everyday life. However, when they become so excessive such as hours of hand washing or driving around and around the block to check that an accident didn't occur then a diagnosis of OCD is made. In OCD,  the brain gets stuck on a particular thought or urge and just can't let go. People with OCD often say the symptoms feel like a case of mental hiccups that won't go away. OCD is a medical brain disorder that causes problems in information processing. It is not your fault or the result of a ""weak"" or unstable personality.    Before the arrival of modern medications and cognitive behavior therapy, OCD was generally thought to be untreatable. Most people with OCD continued to suffer, despite years of ineffective psychotherapy. Today, luckily, treatment can help most people with OCD. Although OCD is usually completely curable only in some individuals, most people achieve meaningful and long-term symptom relief with comprehensive treatment.   What are the symptoms of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder?   OCD involves having both obsessions and compulsions. A person with OCD may sometimes have one or the other.   Common obsessions are: contamination fears of germs, dirt, etc., imagining having harmed oneself or others, imagining losing control or having aggressive urges, intrusive sexual thoughts or urges, excessive religious or moral doubt, forbidden thoughts, a need to have things ""just so,"" and a need to tell, ask, or confess.  Common compulsions are: washing, repeating, checking, touching, and counting.   OCD symptoms can occur in people of all ages. Not all Obsessive-Compulsive behaviors represent an illness. Some rituals (e.g., bedtime songs, religious practices) are a welcome part of daily life. Normal worries, such as contamination fears, may increase during times of stress, such as when someone in the family is sick or dying. Only when symptoms persist, make no sense, cause much distress, or interfere with functioning do they need clinical attention.          Obsessions Obsessions are thoughts, images, or impulses that occur over and over again and feel out of your control. The person does not want to have these ideas. He  finds them disturbing and intrusive, and usually recognizes that they don't really make sense. People with OCD worry excessively about dirt and germs and become obsessed with the idea that they are contaminated or contaminate others.  They may have obsessive fears of having inadvertently harmed someone else even though they usually know this is not realistic. Obsessions are accompanied by uncomfortable feelings, such as fear, disgust, doubt, or a sensation that things have to be done in a way that is ""just so.""         Compulsions People with OCD try to make their obsessions go away by performing compulsions. Compulsions are acts the person performs over and over again, often according to certain ""rules."" People with an obsession about contamination may wash constantly to the point that their hands become raw and inflamed. A person may repeatedly check that she has turned off the stove or iron because of an obsessive fear of burning the house down. She may have to count certain objects over and over because of an obsession about losing them. Unlike compulsive drinking or gambling, OCD compulsions do not give the person pleasure. Rather, the rituals are performed to obtain relief from the discomfort caused by the obsessions.         Other features of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder OCD symptoms cause distress, take up time (more than an hour a day), or significantly interfere with the person's work, social life, or relationships. Most individuals with OCD recognize that their obsessions are coming from  their own minds and are not just excessive worries about real problems. They realize that the compulsions they perform are excessive or unreasonable. When someone with OCD does not recognize that their beliefs and actions are unreasonable, this is called OCD with poor insight. OCD symptoms tend to wax and wane over time. Some may be little more than background noise; others may produce extremely severe distress.       When does Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder begin?    OCD starts at any time from preschool age to adulthood (usually by age 40). One third to one half of adults with OCD report that it started during childhood.   Unfortunately, OCD often goes unrecognized. On average, people with OCD see three to four doctors and spend 9 years seeking treatment before they receive a correct diagnosis. Studies find that it takes an average of 17 years from the time OCD begins for people to obtain appropriate treatment.   OCD tends to be underdiagnosed and undertreated for a number of reasons. People with OCD are secretive about their symptoms or lack insight about their illness. Many healthcare providers are not familiar with the symptoms or are not trained in providing the appropriate treatments. Some people don't have access to treatment resources. This is unfortunate because earlier diagnosis and proper treatment, including finding the right medications, can help people avoid the suffering associated with OCD. This lessens the risk of developing other problems, such as depression, marital and work problems.    Is Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Inherited?    No specific genes for OCD have  been identified.  Research suggests that genes do play a role in the development of the disorder. Childhood-onset OCD runs in families (sometimes in association with tic disorders). When a parent has OCD, there is a slightly increased risk that a child will develop OCD, although the risk is still low. When OCD runs in families, it is the general nature of OCD  that is inherited, not specific symptoms. Thus a child may have checking rituals, while his mother washes compulsively.   What causes Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder?    There is no proven cause of OCD. Research suggests that OCD involves problems in communication between the front part of the brain (the orbital cortex) and deeper structures (the basal ganglia). These brain structures use the chemical messenger serotonin. It is believed that insufficient levels of serotonin are involved in OCD. Drugs that increase the brain concentration of serotonin often help improve OCD symptoms.    Pictures of the brain at work also show that the brain circuits involved in OCD return toward normal in those who improve after taking a serotonin medication or receiving cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy. Although it seems clear that reduced levels of serotonin play a role in OCD, there are no laboratory tests for OCD. The diagnosis is made based on an assessment of the person's symptoms. When OCD starts suddenly in childhood in association with strep throat, an autoimmune mechanism may be involved, and treatment with an antibiotic may prove helpful.    What other problems are sometimes confused with OCD?   Some disorders that closely resemble OCD and may respond to some of the same treatments. They are trichotillomania (compulsive hair pulling), body dysmorphic disorder (imagined ugliness), and habit disorders, such as nail biting or skin picking. While they share superficial similarities, impulse control problems, such as substance abuse, pathological gambling, or compulsive sexual activity, are probably not related to OCD in any substantial way.    The most common conditions that resemble OCD are the tic disorders (Tourette's disorder and other motor and vocal tic disorders). Tics are involuntary motor behaviors (such as facial grimacing) or vocal behaviors (such as snorting) that often occur in response to a feeling of discomfort. More complex tics, like touching or tapping tics, resemble compulsions. Tics and OCD occur together much more often when the OCD or tics begin during childhood.    Depression and OCD often occur in adults, and, less commonly, in children and adolescents. However, unless depression is  present, people with OCD are not sad or lacking in pleasure. People who are depressed but do not have OCD rarely have the kinds of intrusive thoughts that are characteristic of OCD. Stress can make OCD worse. Although most people with OCD report that the symptoms can come and go on their own.    OCD is easy to distinguish from a condition called posttraumatic stress disorder, because OCD is not caused by a terrible event. Schizophrenia, delusional disorders, and other psychotic conditions are usually easy to distinguish from OCD. Unlike psychotic individuals, people with OCD  have a clear idea of what is real and what is not.  OCD may worsen or cause disruptive behaviors  in children and adolescents, exaggerate a pre-existing learning disorder, cause problems with attention and concentration, or interfere with learning at school. In many children with OCD, these disruptive behaviors are related to the OCD and will go away when the OCD is successfully treated.    Individuals with OCD often have substance-abuse problems,  as a result of attempts to self-medicate. Specific treatment for the substance abuse is usually  needed. Children and adults with pervasive developmental disorders (autism, Asperger's Disorder) are extremely rigid and compulsive.  They have stereotyped behaviors that often resembles very severe OCD.  Those with pervasive developmental disorders have extremely severe problems relating to and communicating with other people, which do not occur in OCD.   Only a small number of those with OCD have the collection of personality traits called Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD). Despite its similar name, OCPD does not involve obsessions and compulsions, but rather is a personality pattern that involves a preoccupation with rules, schedules, and lists; perfectionism; an excessive devotion to work; rigidity; and inflexibility. However, when people have both OCPD and OCD, the successful treatment of the OCD often causes a favorable change in the person's personality.                                                             Policy Documents:          Mission Statement  -         Disclaimer  -         Internet Privacy Policy  -         Treatment Providers List: Disclaimer and Terms of Use                   Copyright 2006-2009 by the Obsessive-Compulsive Foundation (OCF).

clueweb09-enwp01-43-13506	"                     Obsessive-compulsive disorder          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  OCD )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search          ""OCD"" redirects here. For other uses, see  OCD (disambiguation) .       Obsessive-compulsive disorder   Classification and external resources       ICD - 10   F 42.       Obsessive-compulsive disorder  ( OCD ) is a  mental disorder  most commonly characterized by intrusive, repetitive thoughts resulting in  compulsive behaviors  and mental acts that the person feels driven to perform, according to rules that must be applied rigidly, aimed at preventing some imagined dreaded event; however, these behaviors or mental acts are not connected to the imagined dreaded event.   According to the current epidemiological data, OCD is the fourth most common mental disorder and OCD is considered nearly as common as  asthma  and  diabetes mellitus . [ 1 ]  In the  United States , 1 in 50 adults have OCD. [ 2 ]  In severe cases, it affects a person's ability to function in everyday activities. The disorder often has a serious impact on the sufferer's (and his/her family's)  quality of life . Also, the psychological self-awareness of the  irrationality  of the disorder can be painful. For people with severe OCD, it may take several hours a day to carry out the compulsive acts.   Experts [ who? ]  believe OCD may be related to levels of a normal chemical in the  brain  called  serotonin . When the proper flow of serotonin is blocked, the brain's ""alarm system"" overreacts. Danger messages are mistakenly triggered. Instead of the brain filtering out these unnecessary thoughts, the brain dwells on themand the person repeatedly experiences unrealistic fears and doubts.   The phrase ""obsessive-compulsive"" has become part of the English lexicon, and is often used in an informal or caricatured manner to describe someone who is meticulous,  perfectionistic , absorbed in a cause, or otherwise fixated on something or someone. [ 3 ]  Although these signs are often present in OCD, a person who exhibits them does not necessarily have OCD, and may instead have  obsessive-compulsive  personality  disorder  (OCPD) or some other condition.

The Quick Reference to the diagnostic criteria from DSM-IV-TR (2000) [ 4 ]  states six characteristics of obsessions and compulsions:     Obsessions       Recurrent and persistent thoughts,  impulses , or images that are experienced as intrusive and that cause marked anxiety or distress.   The thoughts, impulses, or images are not simply excessive worries about real-life problems.   The person attempts to ignore or suppress such thoughts, impulses, or images, or to neutralize them with some other thought or action.   The person recognizes that the obsessional thoughts, impulses, or images are a product of his or her own mind, and are not based in reality.       Compulsions       Repetitive behaviors or mental acts that the person feels driven to perform in response to an obsession, or according to rules that must be applied rigidly.   The behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing distress or preventing some dreaded event or situation; however, these behaviors or mental acts are not actually connected to the issue, or they are excessive.     In addition to these criteria, at some point during the course of the disorder, the individual must realize that his/her obsessions or compulsions are unreasonable or excessive. Moreover, the obsessions or compulsions must be time-consuming (taking up more than one hour per day), cause distress, or cause impairment in social, occupational, or school functioning. [ 4 ]  OCD often causes feelings similar to those of  depression .     [ edit ]   Symptoms and prevalence   OCD manifests in a variety of forms. Studies have placed the prevalence between one and three percent, although the prevalence of clinically recognized OCD is much lower, suggesting that many individuals with the disorder may not be diagnosed. [ 5 ]  The fact that many individuals do not seek treatment may be due in part to  stigma  associated with OCD. Another reason for not seeking treatment is that many sufferers of OCD do not realize that they have the condition.   The typical OCD sufferer performs tasks (or  compulsions ) to seek relief from obsession-related anxiety. To others, these tasks may appear odd and unnecessary. But for the sufferer, such tasks can feel critically important, and must be performed in particular ways to ward off dire consequences and to stop the  stress  from building up. Examples of these tasks are repeatedly checking that one's parked car has been locked before leaving it, turning lights on and off a set number of times before exiting a room, repeatedly washing hands at regular intervals throughout the day, touching objects a certain number of times before leaving a room, or walking in a certain routine way. Physical symptoms may include those brought on from anxieties and unwanted thoughts, as well as  tics  or  Parkinson's disease -like symptoms: rigidity, tremor, jerking arm movements, or involuntary movements of the limbs.   Formal diagnosis may be performed by a  psychologist , a  psychiatrist  or  psychoanalyst . OCD sufferers are aware that their thoughts and behavior are not rational, [ 6 ]  but they feel bound to comply with them to fend off feelings of panic or dread. Although everyone may experience unpleasant thoughts at one time or another, these are short-lived and fade away in time. [ 7 ]  For people with OCD, the thoughts are intrusive and persistent, and can cause them great anxiety and distress. [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Contamination   A major subtype of the fear category is the fear of contamination like  mysophobia ; some sufferers may fear the presence of human body secretions such as saliva, blood, sweat, tears, vomit, or mucus, or excretions such as urine, semen or feces. Some OCD sufferers even fear that the soap they are using is contaminated. [ 9 ]  These anxiety-driven fears may cause a person to experience significant distress, which may make it difficult for a person with OCD to tolerate a workplace, venture into public locations, or conduct normal social relationships.     [ edit ]   Performing tasks   Symptoms related to performing tasks may include repeated hand washing or clearing of the throat; specific counting systems or counting of steps; doing repetitive actionsmore generally, this can involve an obsession with numbers or types of numbers (e.g., odd numbers). For example, when somebody suffering from OCD leaves the house, they might tap the door knob 9 times and if they don't they will go into distress, panic and even at certain times, they will pass out. These obsessive behaviors can cause individuals to feel psychological distress, because they are very concerned about having ""made mistakes"" in the number of steps that they have taken, or the number of stairs on a staircase. For some people with OCD, these obsessive counting and re-counting tasks, along with the attendant anxiety and fear, can take hours of each day, which can make it hard for the person to fulfill their work, family, or social roles. In some cases, these behaviors can also cause adverse physical symptoms: people who obsessively wash their hands with  antibacterial soap  and hot water (to remove germs) can make their skin red and raw with  dermatitis . [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Intrusive thoughts and fears   Intrusive thoughts  are unwelcome, involuntary thoughts, images or unpleasant ideas that may become  obsessions , are upsetting or distressing, and can be difficult to be free of and manage. [ 10 ]  As with other forms of OCD, the awareness of the irrationality of these thoughts can be frustrating as the individual wishes to stop them but cannot. Intrusive thoughts, urges, and images are of inappropriate things at inappropriate times, usually falling into three categories: inappropriate aggressive thoughts, inappropriate sexual thoughts, and blasphemous religious thoughts. [ 11 ]  Most people experience these thoughts; when they are associated with OCD or  depression , they may become paralyzing,  anxiety -provoking, and persistent. Many people experience the type of unpleasant or unwanted thoughts that people with more troubling intrusive thoughts have, but most people are able to dismiss these thoughts. [ 10 ]  When intrusive thoughts co-occur with OCD, patients are less capable of ignoring the unpleasant thoughts and may pay undue attention to them, causing the thoughts to become more frequent and distressing. [ 10 ]   The common underlying theme to the diverse intrusive thoughts is summarised by Bruce  et al  with the example, ""What if I were to snap, lose control of myself, and do something totally uncharacteristic of me--perhaps even without my knowing it--that results in harm to myself or someone else?"" [ 12 ]       [ edit ]   Violent or aggressive thoughts   Intrusive thoughts may involve violent obsessions about hurting others or oneself. [ 13 ]  They can include such thoughts as harming an innocent child, jumping from a bridge, mountain or the top of a tall building, urges to jump in front of a train or automobile, and urges to push another in front of a train or automobile. [ 11 ]  A survey of healthy college students found that virtually all of them had intrusive thoughts from time to time, including imagining or wishing harm upon a family member or friend, impulses to attack or kill a small child, or animal, or shout something rude or violent. [ 14 ]   The possibility that most patients suffering from intrusive thoughts will ever act on those thoughts is low; patients who are experiencing intense guilt, anxiety, shame, and anger over bad thoughts are different from those who actually act on bad thoughts. The history of violent crime is dominated by those who feel no guilt or remorse; the very fact that someone is tormented by intrusive thoughts, and has never acted on them before, is an excellent predictor that they won't act upon the thoughts. According to Baer, a patient should be concerned that intrusive thoughts are dangerous if the person doesn't feel upset by the thoughts, rather finds them pleasurable; has ever acted on violent or sexual thoughts or urges; hears voices or sees things that others don't see; or feels uncontrollable irresistible anger. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Inappropriate sexual thoughts   Sexual obsessions involve intrusive thoughts or images of ""kissing, hugging a lot, touching, fondling, oral sex, anal sex, intercourse, and rape"" with ""strangers, acquaintances, parents, children, family members, friends, coworkers, animals and religious figures"", involving ""heterosexual or homosexual content"" with persons of any age. [ 16 ]  Like other intrusive, unpleasant thoughts or images, most people have some inappropriate sexual thoughts at times, but people with OCD may attach significance to the unwanted sexual thoughts, generating anxiety and distress. The doubt that accompanies OCD leads to uncertainty regarding whether one might act on the bad thoughts, resulting in self-criticism or loathing. [ 16 ]   One of the more common sexual intrusive thoughts occurs when an obsessive person doubts his or her  sexual identity , a symptom of OCD called homosexuality anxiety or HOCD. [ 17 ]  As in the case of most sexual obsessions, sufferers may feel shame and live in isolation, finding it hard to discuss their fears, doubts, and concerns about their sexual identity. [ 18 ]  A person experiencing sexual intrusive thoughts may feel shame, ""embarrassment, guilt, distress, torment, fear that you may act on the thought or perceived impulse and, doubt about whether you have already acted in such a way."" Depression may be a result of the self-loathing that can occur, depending on how much the OCD interferes with daily functioning or causes distress. [ 16 ]  The possibility that most patients suffering from intrusive thoughts to sexually assault people will ever act on those thoughts is low; patients who are experiencing intense guilt, anxiety, shame, and upset over bad thoughts are different from those who actually act on bad thoughts.     [ edit ]   Related conditions   OCD is often confused with the separate condition  obsessive-compulsive personality disorder . The two are not the same condition, however. OCD is  ego  dystonic , meaning that the disorder is incompatible with the sufferer's self-concept. Because disorders that are ego dystonic go against an individual's perception of his/herself, they tend to cause much distress. OCPD, on the other hand, is  ego syntonic marked by the individual's acceptance that the characteristics displayed as a result of this disorder are compatible with his/her self-image. Ego syntonic disorders understandably cause no distress. Persons suffering from OCD are often aware that their behavior is not rational and are unhappy about their obsessions but nevertheless feel compelled by them. Persons with OCPD are not aware of anything abnormal about themselves; they will readily explain why their actions are rational, and it is usually impossible to convince them otherwise. Persons with OCD are ridden with  anxiety ; persons who suffer from OCPD, by contrast, tend to derive pleasure from their obsessions or compulsions. [ 19 ]  This is a significant difference between these disorders.   Equally frequently, these rationalizations do not apply to the overall behavior, but to each instance individually; for example, a person compulsively checking their front door may argue that the time taken and stress caused by one more check of the front door is considerably less than the time and stress associated with being robbed, and thus the check is the better option. In practice, after that check, the individual is  still  not sure, and it is  still  better in terms of time and stress to do one more check, and this reasoning can continue as long as necessary.   Some OCD sufferers exhibit what is known as  overvalued ideas . In such cases, the person with OCD will truly be uncertain whether the fears that cause them to perform their compulsions are irrational or not. After some discussion, it is possible to convince the individual that their fears may be unfounded. It may be more difficult to do  ERP therapy  on such patients, because they may be, at least initially, unwilling to cooperate. For this reason OCD has often been likened to a disease of pathological doubt, in which the sufferer, while not usually  delusional , is often unable to realize fully what sorts of dreaded events are reasonably possible and which are not. There are severe cases when the sufferer has an unshakeable belief within the context of OCD which is difficult to differentiate from psychosis. [ 20 ]   OCD is different from behaviors such as  gambling  addiction and  overeating . People with these disorders typically experience at least some pleasure from their activity; OCD sufferers do not actively want to perform their compulsive tasks, and experience no pleasure from doing so. OCD is placed in the anxiety class of  mental illness , but like many  chronic stress disorders  it can lead to  clinical depression  over time. The constant stress of the condition can cause sufferers to develop a deadening of spirit, a numbing frustration, or sense of hopelessness. OCD's effects on day-to-day lifeparticularly its substantial consumption of timecan produce difficulties with work, finances and relationships. There is no known cure for OCD as of yet, but there are a number of successful treatment options available.     [ edit ]   Related/Spectrum disorders   People with OCD may be diagnosed with other conditions, such as  generalized anxiety disorder ,  anorexia nervosa ,  social anxiety disorder ,  bulimia nervosa ,  Tourette syndrome ,  Asperger syndrome ,  compulsive skin picking ,  body dysmorphic disorder ,  trichotillomania , and (as already mentioned)  obsessive-compulsive personality disorder . There is some research demonstrating a link between  drug addiction  and OCD as well. Many who suffer from OCD also suffer from  panic attacks . There is a higher risk of drug addiction among those with any anxiety disorder (possibly as a way of  coping  with the heightened levels of  anxiety ), but drug addiction among OCD patients may serve as a type of  compulsive behavior  and not just as a coping mechanism.  Depression  is also extremely prevalent among sufferers of OCD. One explanation for the high depression rate among OCD populations was posited by Mineka, Watson, and Clark (1998), who explained that people with OCD (or any other  anxiety disorder ) may feel depressed because of an ""out of control"" type of feeling. [ 21 ]   Some cases are thought to be caused at least in part by childhood  streptococcal  infections and are termed  PANDAS  (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infections). The streptococcal  antibodies  become involved in an  autoimmune  process. Though this idea is not set in stone, if it does prove to be true, there is cause to believe that OCD can to some very small extent be ""caught"" via exposure to strep throat (just as one may catch a cold). However, if OCD is caused by bacteria, this provides hope that  antibiotics  may eventually be used to treat or prevent it. [ 22 ]     [ edit ]   Causes     [ edit ]   Psychological   Scientists studying obsessive-compulsive disorder generally agree that both psychological and biological factors play a role in causing the disorder, although they differ in their degree of emphasis upon either type of factor.   From the 14th to the 16th century in Europe, it was believed that people who experienced blasphemous, sexual, or other obsessive thoughts were  possessed  by the  Devil . Based on this reasoning, treatment involved banishing the ""evil"" from the ""possessed"" person through  exorcism . [ 23 ]  In the early 1910s,  Sigmund Freud  attributed obsessive-compulsive behavior to unconscious conflicts which manifested as symptoms. [ 23 ]  Freud describes the clinical history of a typical case of ""touching phobia"" as starting in early childhood, when the person has a strong desire to touch an item. In response, the person develops an ""external prohibition"" against this type of touching. However, this ""prohibition does not succeed in abolishing"" the desire to touch; all it can do is repress the desire and ""force it into the unconscious"". [ 24 ]   The cognitive-behavioral model suggests that compulsive behaviour is carried out to remove anxiety-provoking intrusive thoughts. Unfortunately this only brings about temporary relief as the thought re-emerges. Each time the behaviour occurs it is negatively reinforced (see  Reinforcement ) by the relief from anxiety, thereby explaining why the dysfunctional activity increases and generalises (extends to other, related stimuli) over a period of time. For example, after touching a door-knob a person might have the thought that they may develop a disease as a result of contamination. They then experience anxiety, which is relieved when they wash their hands. This might be followed by the thought ""but did I wash them properly?"" causing an increase in anxiety once more, the hand-washing once again rewarded by the removal of anxiety (albeit briefly) and the cycle being repeated when thoughts of contamination re-occur. The distressing thoughts might then spread to fear of contamination from e.g. a chair (someone might have touched the chair after touching the door handle).     [ edit ]   Biological   There are many different theories about the cause of obsessive-compulsive disorder. The majority of researchers believe that there is some type of abnormality with the  neurotransmitter   serotonin , among other possible psychological or biological abnormalities; however, it is possible that this activity is the brain's  response  to OCD, and not its cause.             This article  may contain  original research  or  unverified claims . Please  improve the article  by adding  references . See the  talk page  for details.  (January 2009)       Serotonin is thought to have a role in regulating anxiety, though it is also thought to be involved in such processes as  sleep  and  memory  function. In order to send chemical messages, serotonin must bind to the  receptor  sites located on the neighboring nerve cell. It is hypothesized that OCD sufferers may have blocked or damaged receptor sites that prevent serotonin from functioning to its full potential. This suggestion is supported by the fact that many OCD patients benefit from the use of  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  (SSRIs)a class of  antidepressant  medications that allow for more serotonin to be readily available to other nerve cells. [ 25 ]  For more about this class of drugs, see the  section about potential treatments  for OCD.   The  Stanford University School of Medicine  OCD webpage states, ""Although the causes of the disorder still elude us, the recent identification of children with OCD caused by an autoimmune response to  Group A streptococcal infection  promises to bring increased understanding of the disorder's pathogenesis."" [ 26 ]   Recent research has revealed a possible  genetic mutation  that could help to cause OCD. Researchers funded by the  National Institutes of Health  have found a  mutation  in the human serotonin transporter gene,  hSERT , in unrelated families with OCD. Moreover, in his study of identical twins, Rasmussen (1994) produced data that supported the idea that there is a ""heritable factor for neurotic anxiety"". [ 27 ]  In addition, he noted that environmental factors also play a role in how these anxiety symptoms are expressed. However, various studies on this topic are still being conducted and the presence of a genetic link is not yet definitely established.   Another possible genetic cause of OCD was discovered in August 2007 by scientists at  Duke University Medical Center  in North Carolina. They genetically engineered mice that lacked a  gene  called  SAPAP3 . This  protein  is highly expressed in the  striatum , an area of the  brain  linked to planning and the initiation of appropriate actions. The mice spent three times as much time grooming themselves as ordinary mice, to the point that their fur fell off. [ 28 ]   Using tools like  positron emission tomography  (PET scans), it has been shown that those with OCD tend to have brain activity that differs from those who do not have this disorder. [ 29 ]  A popular explanation for OCD is that offered in the book  Brain Lock  by Jeffrey Schwartz, which suggests that OCD is caused by the part of the brain that is responsible for translating complex intentions (e.g., ""I will pick up this cup"") into fundamental actions (e.g., ""move arm forward, rotate hand 15 degrees, etc."") failing to correctly communicate the chemical message that an action has been completed. This is perceived as a feeling of doubt and incompleteness, which then leads the individual to attempt to consciously deconstruct their own prior behaviora process which induces anxiety in most people, even those without OCD [ citation needed ] .   It has been theorized that a miscommunication between the  orbitofrontal cortex , the  caudate nucleus , and the  thalamus  may be a factor in the explanation of OCD. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is the first part of the brain to notice whether or not something is wrong. [ vague ]  When the OFC notices that something is wrong, it sends an initial ""worry signal"" to the thalamus. When the thalamus receives this signal, it in turn sends signals back to the OFC to interpret the worrying event. The caudate nucleus lies between the OFC and the thalamus and prevents the initial worry signal from being sent back to the thalamus after it has already been received. However, it is suggested that in those with OCD, the caudate nucleus does not function properly, and therefore does not prevent this initial signal from recurring. This causes the thalamus to become hyperactive and creates a virtually never-ending loop of worry signals being sent back and forth between the OFC and the thalamus. The OFC responds by increasing anxiety and engaging in  compulsive behaviors  in an attempt to relieve this apprehension. [ 25 ]  This overactivity of the OFC is shown to be attenuated in patients who have successfully responded to  SSRI  medication. The increased stimulation of the  serotonin  receptors  5-HT2A  and  5-HT2C  in the OFC is believed to cause this inhibition.  [ 30 ]   Some research has discovered an association between a type of size abnormality in different  brain structures  and the predisposition to develop OCD. Through the use of  magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI), researchers at  Cambridge's Brain Mapping Unit  were able to discover distinctive patterns in the brain structure of individuals with OCD and their close family members.  [ 31 ]  This is the first instance in which it has been demonstrated that those with a familial risk of developing OCD have anatomical differences when compared with ordinary individuals. The discovery of these structural differences in the area of the brain associated with stopping  motor response  may ultimately aid researchers who seek to determine which genes contribute to the development of OCD.   In some patients, the consumption of  caffeine  may make OCD symptoms worse.  [ 32 ]     [ edit ]   Demographics and other statistics   In a 1980 study of 20,000 adults from  New Haven ,  Baltimore ,  St. Louis ,  Durham , and  Los Angeles , the lifetime prevalence rate of OCD for both sexes was recorded at 2.5 percent. Education also appears to be a factor. The lifetime prevalence of OCD is lower for those who have graduated high school than for those who have not (1.9 percent versus 3.4 percent). However, in the case of college education, lifetime prevalence is higher for those who graduate with a degree (3.1 percent) than it is for those who have only some college background (2.4 percent). As far as age is concerned, the onset of OCD usually ranges from the late teenage years until the mid-20s in both sexes, but the age of onset tends to be slightly younger in males than in females. [ 33 ]   It has been alleged that sufferers are generally of above-average  intelligence , as the very nature of the disorder necessitates complicated thinking patterns [ 34 ] .     [ edit ]   Treatment   According to the Expert Consensus Guidelines for the Treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder,  behavioral therapy  (BT),  cognitive therapy  (CT), and  medications  are first-line treatments for OCD.  Psychodynamic psychotherapy  may help in managing some aspects of the disorder, but there are no controlled studies that demonstrate effectiveness of  psychoanalysis  or  dynamic psychotherapy  in OCD. [ 35 ]     [ edit ]   Behavioral therapy   The specific technique used in BT/CBT is called  exposure and ritual prevention  (also known as "" exposure and response prevention "") or ERP; this involves gradually learning to tolerate the anxiety associated with not performing the ritual behavior. At first, for example, someone might touch something only very mildly ""contaminated"" (such as a tissue that has been touched by another tissue that has been touched by the end of a toothpick that has touched a book that came from a ""contaminated"" location, such as a school.) That is the ""exposure"". The ""ritual prevention"" is not washing. Another example might be leaving the house and checking the lock only once (exposure) without going back and checking again (ritual prevention). The person fairly quickly  habituates  to the anxiety-producing situation and discovers that their anxiety level has dropped considerably; they can then progress to touching something more ""contaminated"" or not checking the lock at allagain, without performing the ritual behavior of washing or checking.   Exposure ritual/response prevention has been demonstrated to be the most effective treatment for OCD. It has generally been accepted that  psychotherapy , in combination with  psychotropic medication , is more effective than either option alone. However, more recent studies have shown no difference in outcomes for those treated with the combination of medicine and CBT versus CBT alone. [ 36 ]   Recently it has been reported simultaneous administration of D-Cycloserin (an antibiotic) substantialy improves effectiveness of Exposure and Response prevention. [ 37 ]     [ edit ]   Medication   Medications as treatment include  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  (SSRIs) such as  paroxetine (Seroxat, Paxil, Xetanor, ParoMerck, Rexetin) ,  sertraline (Zoloft, Stimuloton) ,  fluoxetine (Prozac, Bioxetin) ,  escitalopram  (Lexapro), and  fluvoxamine (Luvox)  as well as the  tricyclic antidepressants , in particular  clomipramine (Anafranil) . SSRIs prevent excess  serotonin  from being pumped back into the original  neuron  that released it. Instead, serotonin can then bind to the  receptor  sites of nearby neurons and send chemical messages or signals that can help regulate the excessive  anxiety  and obsessive thoughts. In some treatment-resistant cases, a combination of  clomipramine  and an SSRI has shown to be effective even when neither drug on its own has been efficacious.   Benzodiazepines  are also used in treatment. It's not uncommon to administer this class of drugs during the ""latency period"" for SSRIs or as synergistic adjunct long-term. Although widely prescribed, benzodiazepines have not been demonstrated as an effective treatment for OCD and can be addictive. [ 38 ]   Serotonergic   antidepressants  typically take longer to show benefit in OCD than with most other disorders which they are used to treat, as it is common for 23 months to elapse before any tangible improvement is noticed. In addition to this, the treatment usually requires high doses.  Fluoxetine , for example, is usually prescribed in doses of 20 mg per day for clinical depression, whereas with OCD the dose will often range from 20 mg to 80 mg or higher, if necessary. In most cases  antidepressant therapy  alone will only provide a partial reduction in symptoms, even in cases that are not deemed treatment-resistant. Much current research is devoted to the therapeutic potential of the agents that effect the release of the neurotransmitter  glutamate  or the binding to its receptors. These include  riluzole ,  memantine ,  gabapentin (Neurontin)  and  lamotrigine (Lamictal) .   Low doses of the newer  atypical antipsychotics   olanzapine (Zyprexa) ,  quetiapine (Seroquel) ,  ziprasidone  and  risperidone (Risperdal)  have also been found to be useful as adjuncts in the treatment of OCD. The use of  antipsychotics  in OCD must be undertaken carefully, however, since, although there is very strong evidence that at low doses they are beneficial (most likely due to their  dopamine receptor   antagonism ), at high doses these same antipsychotics have proven to cause dramatic obsessive-compulsive symptoms even in those patients who do not normally have OCD. This is most likely due to the antagonism of  5-HT2A receptors  becoming very prominent at these doses and outweighing the benefits of  dopamine  antagonism. Another point that must be noted with antipsychotic treatment is that SSRIs inhibit the chief  enzyme  that is responsible for  metabolising  antipsychotics CYP2D6 so the dose will be effectively higher than expected when these are combined with SSRIs. Also, it must be noted that antipsychotic treatment should be considered as augmentation treatment when SSRI treatment does not bring positive results.     [ edit ]   Alternative drug treatments   The naturally occurring sugar  inositol  may be an effective treatment for OCD. Inositol appears to modulate the actions of serotonin and has been found to reverse  desensitisation  of the  neurotransmitter 's receptors. [ 39 ]   St John's Wort  has been claimed to be of benefit due to its (non-selective) serotonin re-uptake inhibiting qualities, and studies have emerged that have shown positive results. However, a double-blind study, using a flexible-dose schedule (600-1800 mg/day), found no difference between St John's Wort and the placebo. [ 40 ]  Studies have also been done that show  nutrition deficiencies  may also contribute to OCD and other  mental disorders . Certain  vitamin  and  mineral supplements  may aid in such disorders and provide the  nutrients  necessary for proper mental functioning.  [ 41 ]   Recent research has found increasing evidence that  opioids  may significantly reduce OCD symptoms, though the use of them is not sanctioned for treatment and considered an ""off-label"" use, factors being  physical dependence  and long term drug tolerance. Anecdotal reports suggest that some OCD sufferers have successfully self-medicated with opioids such as  tramadol  (Ultram) and  hydrocodone  (Vicodin, Lortab), though the off-label use of such  painkillers  is not widely accepted, research on this has been limited. Tramadol is an atypical opioid that may be a viable option as it has a low potential for  abuse  and  addiction , mild side effects, and shows signs of rapid efficacy in OCD. Tramadol not only provides the anti-OCD effects of an  opiate , but also inhibits the  re-uptake  of serotonin (in addition to  norepinephrine ). This may provide additional benefits, but should not be taken in combination with  antidepressant  medication unless under careful medical supervision due to potential  serotonin syndrome . [ 42 ]   Recent studies at the  University of Arizona  using the  tryptamine   alkaloid   psilocybin  have shown promising results. [ 43 ]  There are reports that other  hallucinogens  such as  LSD  and  peyote  have produced similar benefits. It has been hypothesised that this effect may be due to stimulation of  5-HT2A receptors  and, less importantly,  5-HT2C receptors . This causes, among many other effects, an  inhibitory effect  on the  orbitofrontal cortex , an area of the brain in which  hyperactivity  has been strongly associated with OCD. [ 44 ]   Emerging evidence suggests that regular  nicotine  treatment may be helpful in improving symptoms of OCD, although the  pharmacodynamical  mechanism by which this improvement is achieved is not yet known, and more detailed studies are needed to fully confirm this  hypothesis . Anecdotal reports suggest OCD can worsen when cigarettes are smoked as a way of obtaining nicotine. [ 45 ]     [ edit ]   Psycho-surgery   For some, neither medication, support groups nor psychological treatments are helpful in alleviating obsessive-compulsive symptoms. These patients may choose to undergo  psychosurgery  as a last resort. In this procedure, a surgical  lesion  is made in an area of the brain (the  cingulate bundle ). In one study, 30% of participants benefited significantly from this procedure. [ 8 ]   Deep-brain stimulation  and  vagus nerve stimulation  are possible surgical options which do not require the destruction of  brain tissue , although their efficacy has not been conclusively demonstrated.   In the US, psychosurgery for OCD is a treatment of last resort and will not be performed until the patient has failed several attempts at medication (at the full dosage) with augmentation, and many months of intensive  cognitive-behavioral therapy  with exposure and ritual/response prevention. [ 46 ]  Likewise, in the UK, psychosurgery cannot be performed unless a course of treatment from a suitably qualified cognitive-behavioural therapist has been carried out.     [ edit ]   Transcranial magnetic stimulation   Though in its early stages of research,  Transcranial magnetic stimulation  (TMS) has shown promising results. The magnetic pulses are focused on the brain's  supplementary motor area  (SMA), which plays a role in filtering out extraneous internal stimuli, such as ruminations, obsessions, and tics. The TMS treatment is an attempt to normalize the SMA's activity, so that it properly filters out thoughts and behaviors associated with OCD.  [ 47 ] [ 48 ]     [ edit ]   Neuropsychiatry       Main article:  Neuropsychiatry       OCD primarily involves the  brain regions  of the  striatum , the  orbitofrontal cortex  and the  cingulate cortex . OCD involves several different  receptors , mostly  H 2 ,  M 4 ,  NK 1 ,  NMDA , and non-NMDA  glutamate receptors . [ citation needed ]  The receptors  5-HT 1D ,  5-HT 2C , and the   opioid receptor  exert a secondary effect. The H 2 , M 4 , NK 1 , and  non-NMDA glutamate  receptors are active in the striatum, whereas the  NMDA receptors  are active in the cingulate cortex.   The activity of certain receptors is positively correlated to the severity of OCD, whereas the activity of certain other receptors is negatively correlated to the severity of OCD. Correlations where activity is positively correlated to severity include the histamine receptor ( H 2 ); the Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor( M 4 ); the Tachykinin receptor ( NK 1 ); and non-NMDA  glutamate receptors . Correlations where activity is negatively correlated to severity include the NMDA receptor ( NMDA ); the Mu opioid receptor (  opioid ); and two types of 5-HT receptors ( 5-HT 1D  and  5-HT 2C ) The central dysfunction of OCD may involve the receptors nk1, non-NMDA  glutamate  receptors, and NMDA, whereas the other receptors could simply exert secondary modulatory effects.   Pharmaceuticals that act directly on those core mechanisms are  aprepitant  (nk1 antagonist),  riluzole  (glutamate release inhibitor), and  tautomycin  (NMDA receptor sensitizer). Also, the anti-Alzheimer's drug  memantine  is being studied by the  OC Foundation  in its efficacy in reducing OCD symptoms due to it being an  NMDA antagonist . One case study published in  The American Journal of Psychiatry  suggests that ""memantine may be an option for treatment-resistant OCD, but controlled studies are needed to substantiate this observation."" [ 49 ]  The drugs that are popularly used to fight OCD lack full efficacy because they do not act upon what are believed to be the core mechanisms. Many trials are currently underway to investigate the efficacy of a variety of agents that affect these 'core' neurotransmitters, particularly glutamatergic agents. [2]     [ edit ]   Notable cases     British poet, essayist, and lexicographer  Samuel Johnson  is an example of a historical figure with a  retrospective diagnosis  of OCD. He had elaborate rituals for crossing the thresholds of doorways, repeatedly walked up and down staircases counting the steps, and had compulsions regarding repetitive prayer which were most likely a form of religious scrupulosity.  [ 50 ] [ 51 ] [ 52 ]       American aviator and filmmaker  Howard Hughes  is known to have suffered from OCD and it is believed that his mother may have also been a sufferer. Friends of Hughes have mentioned his obsession with minor flaws in clothing and he is reported to have had a great fear of germs, common among OCD patients.  [ 53 ]  He did also suffer from Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) due to an aviation accident in which he was severely injured. This resulted in him becoming reclusive later in life.       English footballer  David Beckham  has been outspoken regarding his struggle with OCD. He has told media that he has to count all his clothes, and that magazines have to lie in a straight line. No more than three soda cans are allowed in his refrigerator, and if there are any more at home they have to be placed in a cupboard. He has explained that the reason he gets more tattoos is that he feels addicted to the pain of the needle. In hotels, any books that are on a shelf must be placed in the drawer. He has expressed a desire to get help for his problems.

For other uses, see  OCD (disambiguation) .       Obsessive-compulsive disorder   Classification and external resources       ICD - 10   F 42.       Obsessive-compulsive disorder  ( OCD ) is a  mental disorder  most commonly characterized by  intrusive , repetitive thoughts resulting in  compulsive behaviors  and mental acts that the person feels driven to perform, according to rules that must be applied rigidly, aimed at reducing  anxiety  by preventing some dreaded event or by resolving a more nebulous sense of tension. However, the likelihood that a dreaded event will occur, or the causal relationship between the performance of compulsions and the reduction of this likelihood, tends to be imagined or exaggerated.   OCD is the fourth most common mental disorder and is nearly as common as  asthma  and  diabetes mellitus . [ 1 ]  In the  United States , one in 50 adults has OCD. [ 2 ]  In severe cases, it affects a person's ability to function in everyday activities. The disorder often has a serious impact on the sufferer's (and their family's)  quality of life . Also, the psychological self-awareness of the  irrationality  of the disorder can be painful. For people with severe OCD, it may take several hours a day to carry out the compulsive acts.   The phrase ""obsessive-compulsive"" has become part of the English lexicon, and is often used in an informal or caricatured manner to describe someone who is meticulous,  perfectionistic , absorbed in a cause, or otherwise fixated on something or someone. [ 3 ]  Although these signs are often present in OCD, a person who exhibits them does not necessarily have OCD, and may instead have  obsessive-compulsive  personality  disorder  (OCPD) or some other condition.

The Quick Reference to the diagnostic criteria from DSM-IV-TR (2000) [ 4 ]  states six characteristics of obsessions and compulsions:     Obsessions       Recurrent and persistent thoughts,  impulses , or images that are experienced as intrusive and that cause marked anxiety or distress.   The thoughts, impulses, or images are not simply excessive worries about real-life problems.   The person attempts to ignore or suppress such thoughts, impulses, or images, or to neutralize them with some other thought or action.   The person recognizes that the obsessional thoughts, impulses, or images are a product of his or her own mind, and are not based in reality.       Compulsions       Repetitive behaviors or mental acts that the person feels driven to perform in response to an obsession, or according to rules that must be applied rigidly.   The behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing distress or preventing some dreaded event or situation; however, these behaviors or mental acts are not actually connected to the issue, or they are excessive.     In addition to these criteria, at some point during the course of the disorder, the individual must realize that his/her obsessions or compulsions are unreasonable or excessive. Moreover, the obsessions or compulsions must be time-consuming (taking up more than one hour per day), cause distress, or cause impairment in social, occupational, or school functioning. [ 4 ]  OCD often causes feelings similar to those of  depression .     [ edit ]   Symptoms and prevalence   OCD manifests in a variety of forms. Studies have placed the prevalence between one and three percent, although the prevalence of clinically recognized OCD is much lower, suggesting that many individuals with the disorder may not be diagnosed. [ 5 ]  The fact that many individuals do not seek treatment may be due in part to  stigma  associated with OCD. Another reason for not seeking treatment is that many sufferers of OCD do not realize that they have the condition.   The typical OCD sufferer performs tasks (or  compulsions ) to seek relief from obsession-related anxiety. To others, these tasks may appear odd and unnecessary. But for the sufferer, such tasks can feel critically important, and must be performed in particular ways to ward off dire consequences and to stop the  stress  from building up. Examples of these tasks are repeatedly checking that one's parked car has been locked before leaving it, turning lights on and off a set number of times before exiting a room, repeatedly washing hands at regular intervals throughout the day, touching objects a certain number of times before leaving a room, or walking in a certain routine way. Physical symptoms may include those brought on from anxieties and unwanted thoughts, as well as  tics  or  Parkinson's disease -like symptoms: rigidity, tremor, jerking arm movements, or involuntary movements of the limbs.   Formal diagnosis may be performed by a  psychologist , a  psychiatrist  or  psychoanalyst . OCD sufferers are aware that their thoughts and behavior are not rational, [ 6 ]  but they feel bound to comply with them to fend off feelings of panic or dread. Although everyone may experience unpleasant thoughts at one time or another, these are short-lived and fade away in time. [ 7 ]  For people with OCD, the thoughts are intrusive and persistent, and can cause them great anxiety and distress. [ 8 ]   Intrusive thoughts  are unwelcome, involuntary thoughts, images or unpleasant ideas that may become  obsessions , are upsetting or distressing, and can be difficult to be free of and manage. [ 9 ]  As with other forms of OCD, the awareness of the irrationality of these thoughts can be frustrating as the individual wishes to stop them but cannot. Intrusive thoughts, urges, and images are of inappropriate things at inappropriate times, usually falling into three categories: inappropriate aggressive thoughts, inappropriate sexual thoughts, and blasphemous religious thoughts. [ 10 ]  Most people experience these thoughts; when they are associated with OCD or  depression , they may become paralyzing,  anxiety -provoking, and persistent. Many people experience the type of unpleasant or unwanted thoughts that people with more troubling intrusive thoughts have, but most people are able to dismiss these thoughts. [ 9 ]  When intrusive thoughts co-occur with OCD, patients are less capable of ignoring the unpleasant thoughts and may pay undue attention to them, causing the thoughts to become more frequent and distressing. [ 9 ]   The common underlying theme to the diverse intrusive thoughts is summarised by Bruce  et al  with the example, ""What if I were to snap, lose control of myself, and do something totally uncharacteristic of me--perhaps even without my knowing it--that results in harm to myself or someone else?"" [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   OCD without Overt compulsions   A major subtype of OCD is OCD without overt compulsions. [ 12 ]  OCD without overt compulsions is often referred to as ""pure-O"" by laymen and sufferers of this disorder. The term is a bit of a misnomer, however, since OCD without overt compulsions is no more ""pure"" than any other form of OCD. Nonetheless, OCD without overt compulsions represents a major subtype of OCD with some of the estimates as high 50-60%. [ 13 ]  Rather than engaging in observable rituals and compulsions, the person with OCD without overt compulsions engages in all manner of mental neutralizing behaviours (i.e. ""covert"" compulsions).   Intrusive thoughts may involve violent obsessions about hurting others or oneself. [ 14 ]  They can include such thoughts as harming an innocent child, jumping from a bridge, mountain or the top of a tall building, urges to jump in front of a train or automobile, and urges to push another in front of a train or automobile. [ 10 ]  A survey of healthy college students found that virtually all of them had intrusive thoughts from time to time, including imagining or wishing harm upon a family member or friend, impulses to attack or kill a small child, or animal, or shout something rude or violent. [ 15 ]   The possibility that most patients suffering from intrusive thoughts will ever act on those thoughts is low; patients who are experiencing intense guilt, anxiety, shame, and anger over bad thoughts are different from those who actually act on bad thoughts. The history of violent crime is dominated by those who feel no guilt or remorse; the very fact that someone is tormented by intrusive thoughts, and has never acted on them before, is an excellent predictor that they won't act upon the thoughts. According to Baer, a patient should be concerned that intrusive thoughts are dangerous if the person doesn't feel upset by the thoughts, rather finds them pleasurable; has ever acted on violent or sexual thoughts or urges; hears voices or sees things that others don't see; or feels uncontrollable irresistible anger. [ 16 ]   Sexual obsessions may involve intrusive thoughts or images of ""kissing, hugging a lot, touching, fondling, oral sex, anal sex, intercourse, and rape"" with ""strangers, acquaintances, parents, children, family members, friends, coworkers, animals and religious figures"", involving ""heterosexual or homosexual content"" with persons of any age. [ 17 ]  Like other intrusive, unpleasant thoughts or images, most people have some inappropriate sexual thoughts at times, but people with OCD may attach significance to the unwanted sexual thoughts, generating anxiety and distress. The doubt that accompanies OCD leads to uncertainty regarding whether one might act on the bad thoughts, resulting in self-criticism or loathing. [ 17 ]     [ edit ]   OCD with Overt Compulsions   Other major subtypes of OCD frequently revolve around washing or checking; some sufferers may fear the presence of human body secretions such as saliva, blood, semen, sweat, tears, vomit, or mucus, or excretions such as urine or feces. Some OCD sufferers even fear that the soap they are using is contaminated. [ 18 ]  These anxiety-driven fears often result in various compulsive cleaning behaviours, and may cause a person to experience significant distress, which may make it difficult for a person with OCD to tolerate a workplace, venture into public locations, or conduct normal social relationships.   Symptoms related to performing tasks may include repeated hand washing [ 19 ]  or clearing of the throat; specific counting systems or counting of steps; doing repetitive actionsmore generally, this can involve an obsession with numbers or types of numbers (e.g., odd numbers). For example, when somebody suffering from OCD leaves the house, they might tap the door knob 9 times and if they don't they will go into distress, panic and even at certain times, they will pass out. These obsessive behaviors can cause individuals to feel psychological distress, because they are very concerned about having ""made mistakes"" in the number of steps that they have taken, or the number of stairs on a staircase. For some people with OCD, these obsessive counting and re-counting tasks, along with the attendant anxiety and fear, can take hours of each day, which can make it hard for the person to fulfill their work, family, or social roles. In some cases, these behaviors can also cause adverse physical symptoms: people who obsessively wash their hands with  antibacterial soap  and hot water (to remove germs) can make their skin red and raw with  dermatitis . [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Related conditions   OCD is often confused with the separate condition  obsessive-compulsive personality disorder . The two are not the same condition, however. OCD is  ego  dystonic , meaning that the disorder is incompatible with the sufferer's self-concept.  [ 20 ] [ 21 ]  Because disorders that are ego dystonic go against an individual's perception of his/herself, they tend to cause much distress. OCPD, on the other hand, is  ego syntonic marked by the individual's acceptance that the characteristics displayed as a result of this disorder are compatible with his/her self-image. Ego syntonic disorders understandably cause no distress. Persons suffering from OCD are often aware that their behavior is not rational and are unhappy about their obsessions but nevertheless feel compelled by them. Persons with OCPD are not aware of anything abnormal about themselves; they will readily explain why their actions are rational, and it is usually impossible to convince them otherwise. Persons with OCD are ridden with  anxiety ; persons who suffer from OCPD, by contrast, tend to derive pleasure from their obsessions or compulsions. [ 22 ]  This is a significant difference between these disorders.   Equally frequently, these rationalizations do not apply to the overall behavior, but to each instance individually; for example, a person compulsively checking their front door may argue that the time taken and stress caused by one more check of the front door is considerably less than the time and stress associated with being robbed, and thus the check is the better option. In practice, after that check, the individual is  still  not sure, and it is  still  better in terms of time and stress to do one more check, and this reasoning can continue as long as necessary.   Some OCD sufferers exhibit what is known as  overvalued ideas . In such cases, the person with OCD will truly be uncertain whether the fears that cause them to perform their compulsions are irrational or not. After some discussion, it is possible to convince the individual that their fears may be unfounded. It may be more difficult to do  ERP therapy  on such patients, because they may be, at least initially, unwilling to cooperate. For this reason OCD has often been likened to a disease of pathological doubt, in which the sufferer, while not usually  delusional , is often unable to realize fully what sorts of dreaded events are reasonably possible and which are not. There are severe cases when the sufferer has an unshakeable belief within the context of OCD which is difficult to differentiate from psychosis. [ 23 ]   OCD is different from behaviors such as  gambling  addiction and  overeating . People with these disorders typically experience at least some pleasure from their activity; OCD sufferers do not actively want to perform their compulsive tasks, and experience no pleasure from doing so. OCD is placed in the anxiety class of  mental illness , but like many  chronic stress disorders  it can lead to  clinical depression  over time. The constant stress of the condition can cause sufferers to develop a deadening of spirit, a numbing frustration, or sense of hopelessness. OCD's effects on day-to-day lifeparticularly its substantial consumption of timecan produce difficulties with work, finances and relationships. There is no known cure for OCD as of yet, but there are a number of successful treatment options available.     [ edit ]   Related/Spectrum disorders   People with OCD may be diagnosed with other conditions, such as  generalized anxiety disorder ,  anorexia nervosa ,  social anxiety disorder ,  bulimia nervosa ,  Tourette syndrome ,  Asperger syndrome ,  compulsive skin picking ,  body dysmorphic disorder ,  trichotillomania , and (as already mentioned)  obsessive-compulsive personality disorder . There is some research demonstrating a link between  drug addiction  and OCD as well. Many who suffer from OCD also suffer from  panic attacks . There is a higher risk of drug addiction among those with any anxiety disorder (possibly as a way of  coping  with the heightened levels of  anxiety ), but drug addiction among OCD patients may serve as a type of  compulsive behavior  and not just as a coping mechanism.  Depression  is also extremely prevalent among sufferers of OCD. One explanation for the high depression rate among OCD populations was posited by Mineka, Watson, and Clark (1998), who explained that people with OCD (or any other  anxiety disorder ) may feel depressed because of an ""out of control"" type of feeling. [ 24 ]   Some cases are thought to be caused at least in part by childhood  streptococcal  infections and are termed  PANDAS  (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infections). The streptococcal  antibodies  become involved in an  autoimmune  process. Though this idea is not set in stone, if it does prove to be true, there is cause to believe that OCD can to some very small extent be ""caught"" via exposure to strep throat (just as one may catch a cold). However, if OCD is caused by bacteria, this provides hope that  antibiotics  may eventually be used to treat or prevent it. [ 25 ]     [ edit ]   Causes     [ edit ]   Psychological   Scientists studying obsessive-compulsive disorder generally agree that both psychological and biological factors play a role in causing the disorder, although they differ in their degree of emphasis upon either type of factor.   From the 14th to the 16th century in Europe, it was believed that people who experienced blasphemous, sexual, or other obsessive thoughts were  possessed  by the  Devil . [ 26 ]  Based on this reasoning, treatment involved banishing the ""evil"" from the ""possessed"" person through  exorcism . [ 27 ]  In the early 1910s,  Sigmund Freud  attributed obsessive-compulsive behavior to unconscious conflicts which manifested as symptoms. [ 27 ]  Freud describes the clinical history of a typical case of ""touching phobia"" as starting in early childhood, when the person has a strong desire to touch an item. In response, the person develops an ""external prohibition"" against this type of touching. However, this ""prohibition does not succeed in abolishing"" the desire to touch; all it can do is repress the desire and ""force it into the unconscious"". [ 28 ]   The cognitive-behavioral model suggests that compulsive behaviour is carried out to remove anxiety-provoking intrusive thoughts. Unfortunately this only brings about temporary relief as the thought re-emerges. Each time the behaviour occurs it is negatively reinforced (see  Reinforcement ) by the relief from anxiety, thereby explaining why the dysfunctional activity increases and generalises (extends to other, related stimuli) over a period of time. For example, after touching a door-knob a person might have the thought that they may develop a disease as a result of contamination. They then experience anxiety, which is relieved when they wash their hands. This might be followed by the thought ""but did I wash them properly?"" causing an increase in anxiety once more, the hand-washing once again rewarded by the removal of anxiety (albeit briefly) and the cycle being repeated when thoughts of contamination re-occur. The distressing thoughts might then spread to fear of contamination from e.g. a chair (someone might have touched the chair after touching the door handle).     [ edit ]   Biological   There are many different theories about the cause of obsessive-compulsive disorder. The majority of researchers believe that there is some type of abnormality with the  neurotransmitter   serotonin , among other possible psychological or biological abnormalities; however, it is possible that this activity is the brain's  response  to OCD, and not its cause.             This article  may contain  original research  or  unverified claims . Please  improve the article  by adding  references . See the  talk page  for details.  (January 2009)       Serotonin is thought to have a role in regulating anxiety, though it is also thought to be involved in such processes as  sleep  and  memory  function. In order to send chemical messages, serotonin must bind to the  receptor  sites located on the neighboring nerve cell. It is hypothesized that OCD sufferers may have blocked or damaged receptor sites that prevent serotonin from functioning to its full potential. This suggestion is supported by the fact that many OCD patients benefit from the use of  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  (SSRIs)a class of  antidepressant  medications that allow for more serotonin to be readily available to other nerve cells. [ 29 ]  For more about this class of drugs, see the  section about potential treatments  for OCD.   The  Stanford University School of Medicine  OCD webpage states, ""Although the causes of the disorder still elude us, the recent identification of children with OCD caused by an autoimmune response to  Group A streptococcal infection  promises to bring increased understanding of the disorder's pathogenesis."" [ 30 ]   Recent research has revealed a possible  genetic mutation  that could help to cause OCD. Researchers funded by the  National Institutes of Health  have found a  mutation  in the human serotonin transporter gene,  hSERT , in unrelated families with OCD. Moreover, in his study of identical twins, Rasmussen (1994) produced data that supported the idea that there is a ""heritable factor for neurotic anxiety"". [ 31 ]  In addition, he noted that environmental factors also play a role in how these anxiety symptoms are expressed. However, various studies on this topic are still being conducted and the presence of a genetic link is not yet definitely established.   Another possible genetic cause of OCD was discovered in August 2007 by scientists at  Duke University Medical Center  in North Carolina. They genetically engineered mice that lacked a  gene  called  SAPAP3 . This  protein  is highly expressed in the  striatum , an area of the  brain  linked to planning and the initiation of appropriate actions. The mice spent three times as much time grooming themselves as ordinary mice, to the point that their fur fell off. [ 32 ]   Using tools like  positron emission tomography  (PET scans), it has been shown that those with OCD tend to have brain activity that differs from those who do not have this disorder. [ 33 ]  A popular explanation for OCD is that offered in the book  Brain Lock  by Jeffrey Schwartz, which suggests that OCD is caused by the part of the brain that is responsible for translating complex intentions (e.g., ""I will pick up this cup"") into fundamental actions (e.g., ""move arm forward, rotate hand 15 degrees, etc."") failing to correctly communicate the chemical message that an action has been completed. This is perceived as a feeling of doubt and incompleteness, which then leads the individual to attempt to consciously deconstruct their own prior behaviora process which induces anxiety in most people, even those without OCD [ citation needed ] .   It has been theorized that a miscommunication between the  orbitofrontal cortex , the  caudate nucleus , and the  thalamus  may be a factor in the explanation of OCD. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is the first part of the brain to notice whether or not something is wrong. [ vague ]  When the OFC notices that something is wrong, it sends an initial ""worry signal"" to the thalamus. When the thalamus receives this signal, it in turn sends signals back to the OFC to interpret the worrying event. The caudate nucleus lies between the OFC and the thalamus and prevents the initial worry signal from being sent back to the thalamus after it has already been received. However, it is suggested that in those with OCD, the caudate nucleus does not function properly, and therefore does not prevent this initial signal from recurring. This causes the thalamus to become hyperactive and creates a virtually never-ending loop of worry signals being sent back and forth between the OFC and the thalamus. The OFC responds by increasing anxiety and engaging in  compulsive behaviors  in an attempt to relieve this apprehension. [ 29 ]  This overactivity of the OFC is shown to be attenuated in patients who have successfully responded to  SSRI  medication. The increased stimulation of the  serotonin  receptors  5-HT2A  and  5-HT2C  in the OFC is believed to cause this inhibition.  [ 34 ]   Some research has discovered an association between a type of size abnormality in different  brain structures  and the predisposition to develop OCD. Through the use of  magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI), researchers at  Cambridge's Brain Mapping Unit  were able to discover distinctive patterns in the brain structure of individuals with OCD and their close family members.  [ 35 ]  This is the first instance in which it has been demonstrated that those with a familial risk of developing OCD have anatomical differences when compared with ordinary individuals. The discovery of these structural differences in the area of the brain associated with stopping  motor response  may ultimately aid researchers who seek to determine which genes contribute to the development of OCD.   In some patients, the consumption of  caffeine  may make OCD symptoms worse.  [ 36 ]     [ edit ]   Demographics and other statistics   In a 1980 study of 20,000 adults from  New Haven ,  Baltimore ,  St. Louis ,  Durham , and  Los Angeles , the lifetime prevalence rate of OCD for both sexes was recorded at 2.5 percent. Education also appears to be a factor. The lifetime prevalence of OCD is lower for those who have graduated high school than for those who have not (1.9 percent versus 3.4 percent). However, in the case of college education, lifetime prevalence is higher for those who graduate with a degree (3.1 percent) than it is for those who have only some college background (2.4 percent). As far as age is concerned, the onset of OCD usually ranges from the late teenage years until the mid-20s in both sexes, but the age of onset tends to be slightly younger in males than in females. [ 37 ]   It has been alleged that sufferers are generally of above-average  intelligence , as the very nature of the disorder necessitates complicated thinking patterns [ 38 ] .     [ edit ]   Treatment   According to the Expert Consensus Guidelines for the Treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder,  behavioral therapy  (BT),  cognitive therapy  (CT), and  medications  are first-line treatments for OCD.  Psychodynamic psychotherapy  may help in managing some aspects of the disorder, but there are no controlled studies that demonstrate effectiveness of  psychoanalysis  or  dynamic psychotherapy  in OCD. [ 39 ]     [ edit ]   Behavioral therapy   The specific technique used in BT/CBT is called  exposure and ritual prevention  (also known as "" exposure and response prevention "") or ERP; this involves gradually learning to tolerate the anxiety associated with not performing the ritual behavior. At first, for example, someone might touch something only very mildly ""contaminated"" (such as a tissue that has been touched by another tissue that has been touched by the end of a toothpick that has touched a book that came from a ""contaminated"" location, such as a school.) That is the ""exposure"". The ""ritual prevention"" is not washing. Another example might be leaving the house and checking the lock only once (exposure) without going back and checking again (ritual prevention). The person fairly quickly  habituates  to the anxiety-producing situation and discovers that their anxiety level has dropped considerably; they can then progress to touching something more ""contaminated"" or not checking the lock at allagain, without performing the ritual behavior of washing or checking.   Exposure ritual/response prevention has been demonstrated to be the most effective treatment for OCD. It has generally been accepted that  psychotherapy , in combination with  psychotropic medication , is more effective than either option alone. However, more recent studies have shown no difference in outcomes for those treated with the combination of medicine and CBT versus CBT alone. [ 40 ]   Recently it has been reported simultaneous administration of D-Cycloserin (an antibiotic) substantially improves effectiveness of Exposure and Response prevention. [ 41 ]     [ edit ]   Medication   Medications as treatment include  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  (SSRIs) such as  paroxetine (Seroxat, Paxil, Xetanor, ParoMerck, Rexetin) ,  sertraline (Zoloft, Stimuloton) ,  fluoxetine (Prozac, Bioxetin) ,  escitalopram  (Lexapro), and  fluvoxamine (Luvox)  as well as the  tricyclic antidepressants , in particular  clomipramine (Anafranil) . SSRIs prevent excess  serotonin  from being pumped back into the original  neuron  that released it. Instead, serotonin can then bind to the  receptor  sites of nearby neurons and send chemical messages or signals that can help regulate the excessive  anxiety  and obsessive thoughts. In some treatment-resistant cases, a combination of  clomipramine  and an SSRI has shown to be effective even when neither drug on its own has been efficacious.   Benzodiazepines  are also used in treatment. It's not uncommon to administer this class of drugs during the ""latency period"" for SSRIs or as synergistic adjunct long-term. Although widely prescribed, benzodiazepines have not been demonstrated as an effective treatment for OCD and may be habit-forming in those with a history of substance abuse. [ 42 ]   Serotonergic   antidepressants  typically take longer to show benefit in OCD than with most other disorders which they are used to treat, as it is common for 23 months to elapse before any tangible improvement is noticed. In addition to this, the treatment usually requires high doses.  Fluoxetine , for example, is usually prescribed in doses of 20 mg per day for clinical depression, whereas with OCD the dose will often range from 20 mg to 80 mg or higher, if necessary. In most cases  antidepressant therapy  alone will only provide a partial reduction in symptoms, even in cases that are not deemed treatment-resistant. Much current research is devoted to the therapeutic potential of the agents that effect the release of the neurotransmitter  glutamate  or the binding to its receptors. These include  riluzole ,  memantine ,  gabapentin (Neurontin)  and  lamotrigine (Lamictal) .   Low doses of the newer  atypical antipsychotics   olanzapine (Zyprexa) ,  quetiapine (Seroquel) ,  ziprasidone  and  risperidone (Risperdal)  have also been found to be useful as adjuncts in the treatment of OCD. The use of  antipsychotics  in OCD must be undertaken carefully, however, since, although there is very strong evidence that at low doses they are beneficial (most likely due to their  dopamine receptor   antagonism ), at high doses these same antipsychotics have proven to cause dramatic obsessive-compulsive symptoms even in those patients who do not normally have OCD. This can be due to the antagonism of  5-HT2A receptors  becoming very prominent at these doses and outweighing the benefits of  dopamine  antagonism. However antidepressant mirtazapine which is a 5-HT2A antagonist has shown to be of benefit to OCD patients [ 43 ] . Another point that must be noted with antipsychotic treatment is that SSRIs inhibit the chief  enzyme  that is responsible for  metabolising  antipsychotics CYP2D6 so the dose will be effectively higher than expected when these are combined with SSRIs. Also, it must be noted that antipsychotic treatment should be considered as augmentation treatment when SSRI treatment does not bring positive results.     [ edit ]   Alternative drug treatments   The naturally occurring sugar  inositol  has been suggested as a treatment for OCD [ 44 ] , as it appears to modulate the actions of serotonin and reverse  desensitisation  of  neurotransmitter  receptors.  St John's Wort  has been claimed to be of benefit due to its (non-selective) serotonin re-uptake inhibiting qualities [ citations needed ] , although a double-blind study using a flexible-dose schedule (600-1800 mg/day) found no difference between St John's Wort and a placebo [ 45 ] .   Nutrition deficiencies  may also contribute to OCD and other  mental disorders .  Vitamin  and mineral supplements may aid in such disorders and provide  nutrients  necessary for proper mental functioning [ 46 ] .   Opioids  may significantly reduce OCD symptoms, though their use is not sanctioned for treatment due to  physical dependence  and long term drug tolerance [ citations needed ] . Tramadol is an atypical opioid that appears to provide the anti-OCD effects of an  opiate  and inhibit the  re-uptake  of serotonin (in addition to  norepinephrine ) [ 47 ] .   Tryptamine   alkaloid   psilocybin  has been attempted as treatment [ 48 ] . There are reports that other  hallucinogens  such as  LSD  and  peyote  have produced similar effects [ citations needed ] . It has been hypothesised that this effect may be due to stimulation of  5-HT2A receptors  and, less significantly,  5-HT2C receptors ; this causes an inhibitory effect on the  orbitofrontal cortex , an area of the brain in which  hyperactivity  has been strongly associated with OCD [ 49 ] .   Regular  nicotine  treatment may ameliorate symptoms of OCD, although the  pharmacodynamical  mechanism by which this is achieved is not yet known, and more detailed studies are needed to fully confirm this  hypothesis [ 50 ] .     [ edit ]   Psycho-surgery   For some, neither medication, support groups nor psychological treatments are helpful in alleviating obsessive-compulsive symptoms. These patients may choose to undergo  psychosurgery  as a last resort. In this procedure, a surgical  lesion  is made in an area of the brain (the  cingulate bundle ). In one study, 30% of participants benefited significantly from this procedure. [ 8 ]   Deep-brain stimulation  and  vagus nerve stimulation  are possible surgical options which do not require the destruction of  brain tissue , although their efficacy has not been conclusively demonstrated.   In the US, psychosurgery for OCD is a treatment of last resort and will not be performed until the patient has failed several attempts at medication (at the full dosage) with augmentation, and many months of intensive  cognitive-behavioral therapy  with exposure and ritual/response prevention. [ 51 ]  Likewise, in the UK, psychosurgery cannot be performed unless a course of treatment from a suitably qualified cognitive-behavioural therapist has been carried out.     [ edit ]   Neuropsychiatry   Main article:  Neuropsychiatry   OCD primarily involves the  brain regions  of the  striatum , the  orbitofrontal cortex  and the  cingulate cortex . OCD involves several different  receptors , mostly  H 2 ,  M 4 ,  NK 1 ,  NMDA , and non-NMDA  glutamate receptors . [ citation needed ]  The receptors  5-HT 1D ,  5-HT 2C , and the   opioid receptor  exert a secondary effect. The H 2 , M 4 , NK 1 , and  non-NMDA glutamate  receptors are active in the striatum, whereas the  NMDA receptors  are active in the cingulate cortex.   The activity of certain receptors is positively correlated to the severity of OCD, whereas the activity of certain other receptors is negatively correlated to the severity of OCD. Correlations where activity is positively correlated to severity include the histamine receptor ( H 2 ); the Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor( M 4 ); the Tachykinin receptor ( NK 1 ); and non-NMDA  glutamate receptors . Correlations where activity is negatively correlated to severity include the NMDA receptor ( NMDA ); the Mu opioid receptor (  opioid ); and two types of 5-HT receptors ( 5-HT 1D  and  5-HT 2C ) The central dysfunction of OCD may involve the receptors nk1, non-NMDA  glutamate  receptors, and NMDA, whereas the other receptors could simply exert secondary modulatory effects.   Pharmaceuticals that act directly on those core mechanisms are  aprepitant  (nk1 antagonist),  riluzole  (glutamate release inhibitor), and  tautomycin  (NMDA receptor sensitizer). Also, the anti-Alzheimer's drug  memantine  is being studied by the  OC Foundation  in its efficacy in reducing OCD symptoms due to it being an  NMDA antagonist . One case study published in  The American Journal of Psychiatry  suggests that ""memantine may be an option for treatment-resistant OCD, but controlled studies are needed to substantiate this observation."" [ 52 ]  The drugs that are popularly used to fight OCD lack full efficacy because they do not act upon what are believed to be the core mechanisms. Many trials are currently underway to investigate the efficacy of a variety of agents that affect these 'core' neurotransmitters, particularly glutamatergic agents. [2]     [ edit ]   Notable cases     British poet, essayist, and lexicographer  Samuel Johnson  is an example of a historical figure with a  retrospective diagnosis  of OCD. He had elaborate rituals for crossing the thresholds of doorways, repeatedly walked up and down staircases counting the steps, and had compulsions regarding repetitive prayer which were most likely a form of religious scrupulosity. [ 53 ] [ 54 ] [ 55 ]       American aviator and filmmaker  Howard Hughes  is known to have suffered from OCD and it is believed that his mother may have also been a sufferer. Friends of Hughes have mentioned his obsession with minor flaws in clothing and he is reported to have had a great fear of germs, common among OCD patients. [ 56 ]  He did also suffer from Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) due to an aviation accident in which he was severely injured. This resulted in him becoming reclusive later in life.       English footballer  David Beckham  has been outspoken regarding his struggle with OCD. He has told media that he has to count all his clothes, and that magazines have to lie in a straight line. No more than three soda cans are allowed in his refrigerator, and if there are any more at home they have to be placed in a cupboard. He has explained that the reason he gets more tattoos is that he feels addicted to the pain of the needle. In hotels, any books that are on a shelf must be placed in the drawer. He has expressed a desire to get help for his problems.

For other uses, see  OCD (disambiguation) .       Obsessive-compulsive disorder   Classification and external resources       ICD - 10   F 42.       Obsessive-compulsive disorder  ( OCD ) is a  mental disorder  most commonly characterized by  intrusive , repetitive thoughts resulting in  compulsive behaviors  and mental acts that the person feels driven to perform, according to rules that must be applied rigidly, aimed at reducing  anxiety  by preventing some dreaded event or by resolving a more nebulous sense of tension. However, the likelihood that a dreaded event will occur, or the causal relationship between the performance of compulsions and the reduction of this likelihood, tends to be imagined or exaggerated.   OCD is the fourth most common mental disorder and is nearly as common as  asthma  and  diabetes mellitus . [ 1 ]  In the  United States , one in 50 adults has OCD. [ 2 ]  In severe cases, it affects a person's ability to function in everyday activities. The disorder often has a serious impact on the sufferer's (and their family's)  quality of life . Also, the psychological self-awareness of the  irrationality  of the disorder can be painful. For people with severe OCD, it may take several hours a day to carry out the compulsive acts.   The phrase ""obsessive-compulsive"" has become part of the English lexicon, and is often used in an informal or caricatured manner to describe someone who is meticulous,  perfectionistic , absorbed in a cause, or otherwise fixated on something or someone. [ 3 ]  Although these signs are often present in OCD, a person who exhibits them does not necessarily have OCD, and may instead have  obsessive-compulsive  personality  disorder  (OCPD) or some other condition.

The Quick Reference to the diagnostic criteria from DSM-IV-TR (2000) [ 4 ]  states six characteristics of obsessions and compulsions:     Obsessions       Recurrent and persistent thoughts,  impulses , or images that are experienced as intrusive and that cause marked anxiety or distress.   The thoughts, impulses, or images are not simply excessive worries about real-life problems.   The person attempts to ignore or suppress such thoughts, impulses, or images, or to neutralize them with some other thought or action.   The person recognizes that the obsessional thoughts, impulses, or images are a product of his or her own mind, and are not based in reality.       Compulsions       Repetitive behaviors or mental acts that the person feels driven to perform in response to an obsession, or according to rules that must be applied rigidly.   The behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing distress or preventing some dreaded event or situation; however, these behaviors or mental acts are not actually connected to the issue, or they are excessive.     In addition to these criteria, at some point during the course of the disorder, the individual must realize that his/her obsessions or compulsions are unreasonable or excessive. Moreover, the obsessions or compulsions must be time-consuming (taking up more than one hour per day), cause distress, or cause impairment in social, occupational, or school functioning. [ 4 ]  OCD often causes feelings similar to those of  depression .     [ edit ]   Symptoms and prevalence   OCD manifests in a variety of forms. Studies have placed the prevalence between one and three percent, although the prevalence of clinically recognized OCD is much lower, suggesting that many individuals with the disorder may not be diagnosed. [ 5 ]  The fact that many individuals do not seek treatment may be due in part to  stigma  associated with OCD. Another reason for not seeking treatment is that many sufferers of OCD do not realize that they have the condition.   The typical OCD sufferer performs tasks (or  compulsions ) to seek relief from obsession-related anxiety. To others, these tasks may appear odd and unnecessary. But for the sufferer, such tasks can feel critically important, and must be performed in particular ways to ward off dire consequences and to stop the  stress  from building up. Examples of these tasks are repeatedly checking that one's parked car has been locked before leaving it, turning lights on and off a set number of times before exiting a room, repeatedly washing hands at regular intervals throughout the day, touching objects a certain number of times before leaving a room, or walking in a certain routine way. Physical symptoms may include those brought on from anxieties and unwanted thoughts, as well as  tics  or  Parkinson's disease -like symptoms: rigidity, tremor, jerking arm movements, or involuntary movements of the limbs.   Formal diagnosis may be performed by a  psychologist , a  psychiatrist  or  psychoanalyst . OCD sufferers are aware that their thoughts and behavior are not rational, [ 6 ]  but they feel bound to comply with them to fend off feelings of panic or dread. Although everyone may experience unpleasant thoughts at one time or another, these are short-lived and fade away in time. [ 7 ]  For people with OCD, the thoughts are intrusive and persistent, and can cause them great anxiety and distress. [ 8 ]   Intrusive thoughts  are unwelcome, involuntary thoughts, images or unpleasant ideas that may become  obsessions , are upsetting or distressing, and can be difficult to be free of and manage. [ 9 ]  As with other forms of OCD, the awareness of the irrationality of these thoughts can be frustrating as the individual wishes to stop them but cannot. Intrusive thoughts, urges, and images are of inappropriate things at inappropriate times, usually falling into three categories: inappropriate aggressive thoughts, inappropriate sexual thoughts, and blasphemous religious thoughts. [ 10 ]  Most people experience these thoughts; when they are associated with OCD or  depression , they may become paralyzing,  anxiety -provoking, and persistent. Many people experience the type of unpleasant or unwanted thoughts that people with more troubling intrusive thoughts have, but most people are able to dismiss these thoughts. [ 9 ]  When intrusive thoughts co-occur with OCD, patients are less capable of ignoring the unpleasant thoughts and may pay undue attention to them, causing the thoughts to become more frequent and distressing. [ 9 ]   The common underlying theme to the diverse intrusive thoughts is summarised by Bruce  et al  with the example, ""What if I were to snap, lose control of myself, and do something totally uncharacteristic of me--perhaps even without my knowing it--that results in harm to myself or someone else?"" [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   OCD without Overt compulsions   A major subtype of OCD is OCD without overt compulsions. [ 12 ]  OCD without overt compulsions is often referred to as ""pure-O"" by laymen and sufferers of this disorder. The term is a bit of a misnomer, however, since OCD without overt compulsions is no more ""pure"" than any other form of OCD. Nonetheless, OCD without overt compulsions represents a major subtype of OCD with some of the estimates as high 50-60%. [ 13 ]  Rather than engaging in observable rituals and compulsions, the person with OCD without overt compulsions engages in all manner of mental neutralizing behaviours (i.e. ""covert"" compulsions).   Intrusive thoughts may involve violent obsessions about hurting others or oneself. [ 14 ]  They can include such thoughts as harming an innocent child, jumping from a bridge, mountain or the top of a tall building, urges to jump in front of a train or automobile, and urges to push another in front of a train or automobile. [ 10 ]  A survey of healthy college students found that virtually all of them had intrusive thoughts from time to time, including imagining or wishing harm upon a family member or friend, impulses to attack or kill a small child, or animal, or shout something rude or violent. [ 15 ]   The possibility that most patients suffering from intrusive thoughts will ever act on those thoughts is low; patients who are experiencing intense guilt, anxiety, shame, and anger over bad thoughts are different from those who actually act on bad thoughts. The history of violent crime is dominated by those who feel no guilt or remorse; the very fact that someone is tormented by intrusive thoughts, and has never acted on them before, is an excellent predictor that they won't act upon the thoughts. According to Baer, a patient should be concerned that intrusive thoughts are dangerous if the person doesn't feel upset by the thoughts, rather finds them pleasurable; has ever acted on violent or sexual thoughts or urges; hears voices or sees things that others don't see; or feels uncontrollable irresistible anger. [ 16 ]   Sexual obsessions may involve intrusive thoughts or images of ""kissing, hugging a lot, touching, fondling, oral sex, anal sex, intercourse, and rape"" with ""strangers, acquaintances, parents, children, family members, friends, coworkers, animals and religious figures"", involving ""heterosexual or homosexual content"" with persons of any age. [ 17 ]  Like other intrusive, unpleasant thoughts or images, most people have some inappropriate sexual thoughts at times, but people with OCD may attach significance to the unwanted sexual thoughts, generating anxiety and distress. The doubt that accompanies OCD leads to uncertainty regarding whether one might act on the bad thoughts, resulting in self-criticism or loathing. [ 17 ]     [ edit ]   OCD with Overt Compulsions   Other major subtypes of OCD frequently revolve around washing or checking; some sufferers may fear the presence of human body secretions such as saliva, blood, semen, sweat, tears, vomit, or mucus, or excretions such as urine or feces. Some OCD sufferers even fear that the soap they are using is contaminated. [ 18 ]  These anxiety-driven fears often result in various compulsive cleaning behaviours, and may cause a person to experience significant distress, which may make it difficult for a person with OCD to tolerate a workplace, venture into public locations, or conduct normal social relationships.   Symptoms related to performing tasks may include repeated hand washing [ 19 ]  or clearing of the throat; specific counting systems or counting of steps; doing repetitive actionsmore generally, this can involve an obsession with numbers or types of numbers (e.g., odd numbers). For example, when somebody suffering from OCD leaves the house, they might tap the door knob 9 times and if they don't they will go into distress, panic and even at certain times, they will pass out. These obsessive behaviors can cause individuals to feel psychological distress, because they are very concerned about having ""made mistakes"" in the number of steps that they have taken, or the number of stairs on a staircase. For some people with OCD, these obsessive counting and re-counting tasks, along with the attendant anxiety and fear, can take hours of each day, which can make it hard for the person to fulfill their work, family, or social roles. In some cases, these behaviors can also cause adverse physical symptoms: people who obsessively wash their hands with  antibacterial soap  and hot water (to remove germs) can make their skin red and raw with  dermatitis . [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Related conditions   OCD is often confused with the separate condition  obsessive-compulsive personality disorder . The two are not the same condition, however. OCD is  ego  dystonic , meaning that the disorder is incompatible with the sufferer's self-concept.  [ 20 ] [ 21 ]  Because disorders that are ego dystonic go against an individual's perception of his/herself, they tend to cause much distress. OCPD, on the other hand, is  ego syntonic marked by the individual's acceptance that the characteristics displayed as a result of this disorder are compatible with his/her self-image. Ego syntonic disorders understandably cause no distress. Persons suffering from OCD are often aware that their behavior is not rational and are unhappy about their obsessions but nevertheless feel compelled by them. Persons with OCPD are not aware of anything abnormal about themselves; they will readily explain why their actions are rational, and it is usually impossible to convince them otherwise. Persons with OCD are ridden with  anxiety ; persons who suffer from OCPD, by contrast, tend to derive pleasure from their obsessions or compulsions. [ 22 ]  This is a significant difference between these disorders.   Equally frequently, these rationalizations do not apply to the overall behavior, but to each instance individually; for example, a person compulsively checking their front door may argue that the time taken and stress caused by one more check of the front door is considerably less than the time and stress associated with being robbed, and thus the check is the better option. In practice, after that check, the individual is  still  not sure, and it is  still  better in terms of time and stress to do one more check, and this reasoning can continue as long as necessary.   Some OCD sufferers exhibit what is known as  overvalued ideas . In such cases, the person with OCD will truly be uncertain whether the fears that cause them to perform their compulsions are irrational or not. After some discussion, it is possible to convince the individual that their fears may be unfounded. It may be more difficult to do  ERP therapy  on such patients, because they may be, at least initially, unwilling to cooperate. For this reason OCD has often been likened to a disease of pathological doubt, in which the sufferer, while not usually  delusional , is often unable to realize fully what sorts of dreaded events are reasonably possible and which are not. There are severe cases when the sufferer has an unshakeable belief within the context of OCD which is difficult to differentiate from psychosis. [ 23 ]   OCD is different from behaviors such as  gambling  addiction and  overeating . People with these disorders typically experience at least some pleasure from their activity; OCD sufferers do not actively want to perform their compulsive tasks, and experience no pleasure from doing so. OCD is placed in the anxiety class of  mental illness , but like many  chronic stress disorders  it can lead to  clinical depression  over time. The constant stress of the condition can cause sufferers to develop a deadening of spirit, a numbing frustration, or sense of hopelessness. OCD's effects on day-to-day lifeparticularly its substantial consumption of timecan produce difficulties with work, finances and relationships. There is no known cure for OCD as of yet, but there are a number of successful treatment options available.     [ edit ]   Related/Spectrum disorders   People with OCD may be diagnosed with other conditions, such as  generalized anxiety disorder ,  anorexia nervosa ,  social anxiety disorder ,  bulimia nervosa ,  Tourette syndrome ,  Asperger syndrome ,  compulsive skin picking ,  body dysmorphic disorder ,  trichotillomania , and (as already mentioned)  obsessive-compulsive personality disorder . There is some research demonstrating a link between  drug addiction  and OCD as well. Many who suffer from OCD also suffer from  panic attacks . There is a higher risk of drug addiction among those with any anxiety disorder (possibly as a way of  coping  with the heightened levels of  anxiety ), but drug addiction among OCD patients may serve as a type of  compulsive behavior  and not just as a coping mechanism.  Depression  is also extremely prevalent among sufferers of OCD. One explanation for the high depression rate among OCD populations was posited by Mineka, Watson, and Clark (1998), who explained that people with OCD (or any other  anxiety disorder ) may feel depressed because of an ""out of control"" type of feeling. [ 24 ]   Some cases are thought to be caused at least in part by childhood  streptococcal  infections and are termed  PANDAS  (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infections). The streptococcal  antibodies  become involved in an  autoimmune  process. Though this idea is not set in stone, if it does prove to be true, there is cause to believe that OCD can to some very small extent be ""caught"" via exposure to strep throat (just as one may catch a cold). However, if OCD is caused by bacteria, this provides hope that  antibiotics  may eventually be used to treat or prevent it. [ 25 ]     [ edit ]   Causes     [ edit ]   Psychological   Scientists studying obsessive-compulsive disorder generally agree that both psychological and biological factors play a role in causing the disorder, although they differ in their degree of emphasis upon either type of factor.   From the 14th to the 16th century in Europe, it was believed that people who experienced blasphemous, sexual, or other obsessive thoughts were  possessed  by the  Devil . [ 26 ]  Based on this reasoning, treatment involved banishing the ""evil"" from the ""possessed"" person through  exorcism . [ 27 ]  In the early 1910s,  Sigmund Freud  attributed obsessive-compulsive behavior to unconscious conflicts which manifested as symptoms. [ 27 ]  Freud describes the clinical history of a typical case of ""touching phobia"" as starting in early childhood, when the person has a strong desire to touch an item. In response, the person develops an ""external prohibition"" against this type of touching. However, this ""prohibition does not succeed in abolishing"" the desire to touch; all it can do is repress the desire and ""force it into the unconscious"". [ 28 ]   The cognitive-behavioral model suggests that compulsive behaviour is carried out to remove anxiety-provoking intrusive thoughts. Unfortunately this only brings about temporary relief as the thought re-emerges. Each time the behaviour occurs it is negatively reinforced (see  Reinforcement ) by the relief from anxiety, thereby explaining why the dysfunctional activity increases and generalises (extends to other, related stimuli) over a period of time. For example, after touching a door-knob a person might have the thought that they may develop a disease as a result of contamination. They then experience anxiety, which is relieved when they wash their hands. This might be followed by the thought ""but did I wash them properly?"" causing an increase in anxiety once more, the hand-washing once again rewarded by the removal of anxiety (albeit briefly) and the cycle being repeated when thoughts of contamination re-occur. The distressing thoughts might then spread to fear of contamination from e.g. a chair (someone might have touched the chair after touching the door handle).     [ edit ]   Biological   There are many different theories about the cause of obsessive-compulsive disorder. The majority of researchers believe that there is some type of abnormality with the  neurotransmitter   serotonin , among other possible psychological or biological abnormalities; however, it is possible that this activity is the brain's  response  to OCD, and not its cause.             This article  may contain  original research  or  unverified claims . Please  improve the article  by adding  references . See the  talk page  for details.  (January 2009)       Serotonin is thought to have a role in regulating anxiety, though it is also thought to be involved in such processes as  sleep  and  memory  function. In order to send chemical messages, serotonin must bind to the  receptor  sites located on the neighboring nerve cell. It is hypothesized that OCD sufferers may have blocked or damaged receptor sites that prevent serotonin from functioning to its full potential. This suggestion is supported by the fact that many OCD patients benefit from the use of  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  (SSRIs)a class of  antidepressant  medications that allow for more serotonin to be readily available to other nerve cells. [ 29 ]  For more about this class of drugs, see the  section about potential treatments  for OCD.   The  Stanford University School of Medicine  OCD webpage states, ""Although the causes of the disorder still elude us, the recent identification of children with OCD caused by an autoimmune response to  Group A streptococcal infection  promises to bring increased understanding of the disorder's pathogenesis."" [ 30 ]   Recent research has revealed a possible  genetic mutation  that could help to cause OCD. Researchers funded by the  National Institutes of Health  have found a  mutation  in the human serotonin transporter gene,  hSERT , in unrelated families with OCD. Moreover, in his study of identical twins, Rasmussen (1994) produced data that supported the idea that there is a ""heritable factor for neurotic anxiety"". [ 31 ]  In addition, he noted that environmental factors also play a role in how these anxiety symptoms are expressed. However, various studies on this topic are still being conducted and the presence of a genetic link is not yet definitely established.   Another possible genetic cause of OCD was discovered in August 2007 by scientists at  Duke University Medical Center  in North Carolina. They genetically engineered mice that lacked a  gene  called  SAPAP3 . This  protein  is highly expressed in the  striatum , an area of the  brain  linked to planning and the initiation of appropriate actions. The mice spent three times as much time grooming themselves as ordinary mice, to the point that their fur fell off. [ 32 ]   Using tools like  positron emission tomography  (PET scans), it has been shown that those with OCD tend to have brain activity that differs from those who do not have this disorder. [ 33 ]  A popular explanation for OCD is that offered in the book  Brain Lock  by Jeffrey Schwartz, which suggests that OCD is caused by the part of the brain that is responsible for translating complex intentions (e.g., ""I will pick up this cup"") into fundamental actions (e.g., ""move arm forward, rotate hand 15 degrees, etc."") failing to correctly communicate the chemical message that an action has been completed. This is perceived as a feeling of doubt and incompleteness, which then leads the individual to attempt to consciously deconstruct their own prior behaviora process which induces anxiety in most people, even those without OCD [ citation needed ] .   It has been theorized that a miscommunication between the  orbitofrontal cortex , the  caudate nucleus , and the  thalamus  may be a factor in the explanation of OCD. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is the first part of the brain to notice whether or not something is wrong. [ vague ]  When the OFC notices that something is wrong, it sends an initial ""worry signal"" to the thalamus. When the thalamus receives this signal, it in turn sends signals back to the OFC to interpret the worrying event. The caudate nucleus lies between the OFC and the thalamus and prevents the initial worry signal from being sent back to the thalamus after it has already been received. However, it is suggested that in those with OCD, the caudate nucleus does not function properly, and therefore does not prevent this initial signal from recurring. This causes the thalamus to become hyperactive and creates a virtually never-ending loop of worry signals being sent back and forth between the OFC and the thalamus. The OFC responds by increasing anxiety and engaging in  compulsive behaviors  in an attempt to relieve this apprehension. [ 29 ]  This overactivity of the OFC is shown to be attenuated in patients who have successfully responded to  SSRI  medication. The increased stimulation of the  serotonin  receptors  5-HT2A  and  5-HT2C  in the OFC is believed to cause this inhibition.  [ 34 ]   Some research has discovered an association between a type of size abnormality in different  brain structures  and the predisposition to develop OCD. Through the use of  magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI), researchers at  Cambridge's Brain Mapping Unit  were able to discover distinctive patterns in the brain structure of individuals with OCD and their close family members.  [ 35 ]  This is the first instance in which it has been demonstrated that those with a familial risk of developing OCD have anatomical differences when compared with ordinary individuals. The discovery of these structural differences in the area of the brain associated with stopping  motor response  may ultimately aid researchers who seek to determine which genes contribute to the development of OCD.   In some patients, the consumption of  caffeine  may make OCD symptoms worse.  [ 36 ]     [ edit ]   Demographics and other statistics   In a 1980 study of 20,000 adults from  New Haven ,  Baltimore ,  St. Louis ,  Durham , and  Los Angeles , the lifetime prevalence rate of OCD for both sexes was recorded at 2.5 percent. Education also appears to be a factor. The lifetime prevalence of OCD is lower for those who have graduated high school than for those who have not (1.9 percent versus 3.4 percent). However, in the case of college education, lifetime prevalence is higher for those who graduate with a degree (3.1 percent) than it is for those who have only some college background (2.4 percent). As far as age is concerned, the onset of OCD usually ranges from the late teenage years until the mid-20s in both sexes, but the age of onset tends to be slightly younger in males than in females. [ 37 ]   It has been alleged that sufferers are generally of above-average  intelligence , as the very nature of the disorder necessitates complicated thinking patterns [ 38 ] .     [ edit ]   Treatment   According to the Expert Consensus Guidelines for the Treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder,  behavioral therapy  (BT),  cognitive therapy  (CT), and  medications  are first-line treatments for OCD.  Psychodynamic psychotherapy  may help in managing some aspects of the disorder, but there are no controlled studies that demonstrate effectiveness of  psychoanalysis  or  dynamic psychotherapy  in OCD. [ 39 ]     [ edit ]   Behavioral therapy   The specific technique used in BT/CBT is called  exposure and ritual prevention  (also known as "" exposure and response prevention "") or ERP; this involves gradually learning to tolerate the anxiety associated with not performing the ritual behavior. At first, for example, someone might touch something only very mildly ""contaminated"" (such as a tissue that has been touched by another tissue that has been touched by the end of a toothpick that has touched a book that came from a ""contaminated"" location, such as a school.) That is the ""exposure"". The ""ritual prevention"" is not washing. Another example might be leaving the house and checking the lock only once (exposure) without going back and checking again (ritual prevention). The person fairly quickly  habituates  to the anxiety-producing situation and discovers that their anxiety level has dropped considerably; they can then progress to touching something more ""contaminated"" or not checking the lock at allagain, without performing the ritual behavior of washing or checking.   Exposure ritual/response prevention has been demonstrated to be the most effective treatment for OCD. It has generally been accepted that  psychotherapy , in combination with  psychotropic medication , is more effective than either option alone. However, more recent studies have shown no difference in outcomes for those treated with the combination of medicine and CBT versus CBT alone. [ 40 ]   Recently it has been reported simultaneous administration of D-Cycloserin (an antibiotic) substantially improves effectiveness of Exposure and Response prevention. [ 41 ]     [ edit ]   Medication   Medications as treatment include  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  (SSRIs) such as  paroxetine (Seroxat, Paxil, Xetanor, ParoMerck, Rexetin) ,  sertraline (Zoloft, Stimuloton) ,  fluoxetine (Prozac, Bioxetin) ,  escitalopram  (Lexapro), and  fluvoxamine (Luvox)  as well as the  tricyclic antidepressants , in particular  clomipramine (Anafranil) . SSRIs prevent excess  serotonin  from being pumped back into the original  neuron  that released it. Instead, serotonin can then bind to the  receptor  sites of nearby neurons and send chemical messages or signals that can help regulate the excessive  anxiety  and obsessive thoughts. In some treatment-resistant cases, a combination of  clomipramine  and an SSRI has shown to be effective even when neither drug on its own has been efficacious.   Benzodiazepines  are also used in treatment. It's not uncommon to administer this class of drugs during the ""latency period"" for SSRIs or as synergistic adjunct long-term. Although widely prescribed, benzodiazepines have not been demonstrated as an effective treatment for OCD and may be habit-forming in those with a history of substance abuse. [ 42 ]   Serotonergic   antidepressants  typically take longer to show benefit in OCD than with most other disorders which they are used to treat, as it is common for 23 months to elapse before any tangible improvement is noticed. In addition to this, the treatment usually requires high doses.  Fluoxetine , for example, is usually prescribed in doses of 20 mg per day for clinical depression, whereas with OCD the dose will often range from 20 mg to 80 mg or higher, if necessary. In most cases  antidepressant therapy  alone will only provide a partial reduction in symptoms, even in cases that are not deemed treatment-resistant. Much current research is devoted to the therapeutic potential of the agents that effect the release of the neurotransmitter  glutamate  or the binding to its receptors. These include  riluzole ,  memantine ,  gabapentin (Neurontin)  and  lamotrigine (Lamictal) .   Low doses of the newer  atypical antipsychotics   olanzapine (Zyprexa) ,  quetiapine (Seroquel) ,  ziprasidone  and  risperidone (Risperdal)  have also been found to be useful as adjuncts in the treatment of OCD. The use of  antipsychotics  in OCD must be undertaken carefully, however, since, although there is very strong evidence that at low doses they are beneficial (most likely due to their  dopamine receptor   antagonism ), at high doses these same antipsychotics have proven to cause dramatic obsessive-compulsive symptoms even in those patients who do not normally have OCD. This can be due to the antagonism of  5-HT2A receptors  becoming very prominent at these doses and outweighing the benefits of  dopamine  antagonism. However antidepressant mirtazapine which is a 5-HT2A antagonist has shown to be of benefit to OCD patients [ 43 ] . Another point that must be noted with antipsychotic treatment is that SSRIs inhibit the chief  enzyme  that is responsible for  metabolising  antipsychotics CYP2D6 so the dose will be effectively higher than expected when these are combined with SSRIs. Also, it must be noted that antipsychotic treatment should be considered as augmentation treatment when SSRI treatment does not bring positive results.     [ edit ]   Alternative drug treatments   The naturally occurring sugar  inositol  has been suggested as a treatment for OCD [ 44 ] , as it appears to modulate the actions of serotonin and reverse  desensitisation  of  neurotransmitter  receptors.  St John's Wort  has been claimed to be of benefit due to its (non-selective) serotonin re-uptake inhibiting qualities [ citations needed ] , although a double-blind study using a flexible-dose schedule (600-1800 mg/day) found no difference between St John's Wort and a placebo [ 45 ] .   Nutrition deficiencies  may also contribute to OCD and other  mental disorders .  Vitamin  and mineral supplements may aid in such disorders and provide  nutrients  necessary for proper mental functioning [ 46 ] .   Opioids  may significantly reduce OCD symptoms, though their use is not sanctioned for treatment due to  physical dependence  and long term drug tolerance [ citations needed ] . Tramadol is an atypical opioid that appears to provide the anti-OCD effects of an  opiate  and inhibit the  re-uptake  of serotonin (in addition to  norepinephrine ) [ 47 ] .   Tryptamine   alkaloid   psilocybin  has been attempted as treatment [ 48 ] . There are reports that other  hallucinogens  such as  LSD  and  peyote  have produced similar effects [ citations needed ] . It has been hypothesised that this effect may be due to stimulation of  5-HT2A receptors  and, less significantly,  5-HT2C receptors ; this causes an inhibitory effect on the  orbitofrontal cortex , an area of the brain in which  hyperactivity  has been strongly associated with OCD [ 49 ] .   Regular  nicotine  treatment may ameliorate symptoms of OCD, although the  pharmacodynamical  mechanism by which this is achieved is not yet known, and more detailed studies are needed to fully confirm this  hypothesis [ 50 ] .     [ edit ]   Psycho-surgery   For some, neither medication, support groups nor psychological treatments are helpful in alleviating obsessive-compulsive symptoms. These patients may choose to undergo  psychosurgery  as a last resort. In this procedure, a surgical  lesion  is made in an area of the brain (the  cingulate bundle ). In one study, 30% of participants benefited significantly from this procedure. [ 8 ]   Deep-brain stimulation  and  vagus nerve stimulation  are possible surgical options which do not require the destruction of  brain tissue , although their efficacy has not been conclusively demonstrated.   In the US, psychosurgery for OCD is a treatment of last resort and will not be performed until the patient has failed several attempts at medication (at the full dosage) with augmentation, and many months of intensive  cognitive-behavioral therapy  with exposure and ritual/response prevention. [ 51 ]  Likewise, in the UK, psychosurgery cannot be performed unless a course of treatment from a suitably qualified cognitive-behavioural therapist has been carried out.     [ edit ]   Neuropsychiatry   Main article:  Neuropsychiatry   OCD primarily involves the  brain regions  of the  striatum , the  orbitofrontal cortex  and the  cingulate cortex . OCD involves several different  receptors , mostly  H 2 ,  M 4 ,  NK 1 ,  NMDA , and non-NMDA  glutamate receptors . [ citation needed ]  The receptors  5-HT 1D ,  5-HT 2C , and the   opioid receptor  exert a secondary effect. The H 2 , M 4 , NK 1 , and  non-NMDA glutamate  receptors are active in the striatum, whereas the  NMDA receptors  are active in the cingulate cortex.   The activity of certain receptors is positively correlated to the severity of OCD, whereas the activity of certain other receptors is negatively correlated to the severity of OCD. Correlations where activity is positively correlated to severity include the histamine receptor ( H 2 ); the Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor( M 4 ); the Tachykinin receptor ( NK 1 ); and non-NMDA  glutamate receptors . Correlations where activity is negatively correlated to severity include the NMDA receptor ( NMDA ); the Mu opioid receptor (  opioid ); and two types of 5-HT receptors ( 5-HT 1D  and  5-HT 2C ) The central dysfunction of OCD may involve the receptors nk1, non-NMDA  glutamate  receptors, and NMDA, whereas the other receptors could simply exert secondary modulatory effects.   Pharmaceuticals that act directly on those core mechanisms are  aprepitant  (nk1 antagonist),  riluzole  (glutamate release inhibitor), and  tautomycin  (NMDA receptor sensitizer). Also, the anti-Alzheimer's drug  memantine  is being studied by the  OC Foundation  in its efficacy in reducing OCD symptoms due to it being an  NMDA antagonist . One case study published in  The American Journal of Psychiatry  suggests that ""memantine may be an option for treatment-resistant OCD, but controlled studies are needed to substantiate this observation."" [ 52 ]  The drugs that are popularly used to fight OCD lack full efficacy because they do not act upon what are believed to be the core mechanisms. Many trials are currently underway to investigate the efficacy of a variety of agents that affect these 'core' neurotransmitters, particularly glutamatergic agents. [2]     [ edit ]   Notable cases     British poet, essayist, and lexicographer  Samuel Johnson  is an example of a historical figure with a  retrospective diagnosis  of OCD. He had elaborate rituals for crossing the thresholds of doorways, repeatedly walked up and down staircases counting the steps, and had compulsions regarding repetitive prayer which were most likely a form of religious scrupulosity. [ 53 ] [ 54 ] [ 55 ]       American aviator and filmmaker  Howard Hughes  is known to have suffered from OCD and it is believed that his mother may have also been a sufferer. Friends of Hughes have mentioned his obsession with minor flaws in clothing and he is reported to have had a great fear of germs, common among OCD patients. [ 56 ]  He did also suffer from Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) due to an aviation accident in which he was severely injured. This resulted in him becoming reclusive later in life.       English footballer  David Beckham  has been outspoken regarding his struggle with OCD. He has told media that he has to count all his clothes, and that magazines have to lie in a straight line. No more than three soda cans are allowed in his refrigerator, and if there are any more at home they have to be placed in a cupboard. He has explained that the reason he gets more tattoos is that he feels addicted to the pain of the needle. In hotels, any books that are on a shelf must be placed in the drawer. He has expressed a desire to get help for his problems.

For other uses, see  OCD (disambiguation) .       Obsessive-compulsive disorder   Classification and external resources       ICD - 10   F 42.       Obsessive-compulsive disorder  ( OCD ) is a  mental disorder  most commonly characterized by intrusive, repetitive thoughts resulting in  compulsive behaviors  and mental acts that the person feels driven to perform, according to rules that must be applied rigidly, aimed at preventing some imagined dreaded event; however, these behaviors or mental acts are not connected to the imagined dreaded event.   According to the current epidemiological data, OCD is the fourth most common mental disorder and OCD is considered nearly as common as  asthma  and  diabetes mellitus . [ 1 ]  In the  United States , 1 in 50 adults have OCD. [ 2 ]  In severe cases, it affects a person's ability to function in everyday activities. The disorder often has a serious impact on the sufferer's (and his/her family's)  quality of life . Also, the psychological self-awareness of the  irrationality  of the disorder can be painful. For people with severe OCD, it may take several hours a day to carry out the compulsive acts.   Experts [ who? ]  believe OCD may be related to levels of a normal chemical in the  brain  called  serotonin . When the proper flow of serotonin is blocked, the brain's ""alarm system"" overreacts. Danger messages are mistakenly triggered. Instead of the brain filtering out these unnecessary thoughts, the brain dwells on themand the person repeatedly experiences unrealistic fears and doubts.   The phrase ""obsessive-compulsive"" has become part of the English lexicon, and is often used in an informal or caricatured manner to describe someone who is meticulous,  perfectionistic , absorbed in a cause, or otherwise fixated on something or someone. [ 3 ]  Although these signs are often present in OCD, a person who exhibits them does not necessarily have OCD, and may instead have  obsessive-compulsive  personality  disorder  (OCPD) or some other condition.

The Quick Reference to the diagnostic criteria from DSM-IV-TR (2000) [ 4 ]  states six characteristics of obsessions and compulsions:     Obsessions       Recurrent and persistent thoughts,  impulses , or images that are experienced as intrusive and that cause marked anxiety or distress.   The thoughts, impulses, or images are not simply excessive worries about real-life problems.   The person attempts to ignore or suppress such thoughts, impulses, or images, or to neutralize them with some other thought or action.   The person recognizes that the obsessional thoughts, impulses, or images are a product of his or her own mind, and are not based in reality.       Compulsions       Repetitive behaviors or mental acts that the person feels driven to perform in response to an obsession, or according to rules that must be applied rigidly.   The behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing distress or preventing some dreaded event or situation; however, these behaviors or mental acts are not actually connected to the issue, or they are excessive.     In addition to these criteria, at some point during the course of the disorder, the individual must realize that his/her obsessions or compulsions are unreasonable or excessive. Moreover, the obsessions or compulsions must be time-consuming (taking up more than one hour per day), cause distress, or cause impairment in social, occupational, or school functioning. [ 4 ]  OCD often causes feelings similar to those of  depression .     [ edit ]   Symptoms and prevalence   OCD manifests in a variety of forms. Studies have placed the prevalence between one and three percent, although the prevalence of clinically recognized OCD is much lower, suggesting that many individuals with the disorder may not be diagnosed. [ 5 ]  The fact that many individuals do not seek treatment may be due in part to  stigma  associated with OCD. Another reason for not seeking treatment is that many sufferers of OCD do not realize that they have the condition.   The typical OCD sufferer performs tasks (or  compulsions ) to seek relief from obsession-related anxiety. To others, these tasks may appear odd and unnecessary. But for the sufferer, such tasks can feel critically important, and must be performed in particular ways to ward off dire consequences and to stop the  stress  from building up. Examples of these tasks are repeatedly checking that one's parked car has been locked before leaving it, turning lights on and off a set number of times before exiting a room, repeatedly washing hands at regular intervals throughout the day, touching objects a certain number of times before leaving a room, or walking in a certain routine way. Physical symptoms may include those brought on from anxieties and unwanted thoughts, as well as  tics  or  Parkinson's disease -like symptoms: rigidity, tremor, jerking arm movements, or involuntary movements of the limbs.   Formal diagnosis may be performed by a  psychologist , a  psychiatrist  or  psychoanalyst . OCD sufferers are aware that their thoughts and behavior are not rational, [ 6 ]  but they feel bound to comply with them to fend off feelings of panic or dread. Although everyone may experience unpleasant thoughts at one time or another, these are short-lived and fade away in time. [ 7 ]  For people with OCD, the thoughts are intrusive and persistent, and can cause them great anxiety and distress. [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Contamination   A major subtype of the fear category is the fear of contamination like  mysophobia ; some sufferers may fear the presence of human body secretions such as saliva, blood, sweat, tears, vomit, or mucus, or excretions such as urine, semen or feces. Some OCD sufferers even fear that the soap they are using is contaminated. [ 9 ]  These anxiety-driven fears may cause a person to experience significant distress, which may make it difficult for a person with OCD to tolerate a workplace, venture into public locations, or conduct normal social relationships.     [ edit ]   Performing tasks   Symptoms related to performing tasks may include repeated hand washing or clearing of the throat; specific counting systems or counting of steps; doing repetitive actionsmore generally, this can involve an obsession with numbers or types of numbers (e.g., odd numbers). For example, when somebody suffering from OCD leaves the house, they might tap the door knob 9 times and if they don't they will go into distress, panic and even at certain times, they will pass out. These obsessive behaviors can cause individuals to feel psychological distress, because they are very concerned about having ""made mistakes"" in the number of steps that they have taken, or the number of stairs on a staircase. For some people with OCD, these obsessive counting and re-counting tasks, along with the attendant anxiety and fear, can take hours of each day, which can make it hard for the person to fulfill their work, family, or social roles. In some cases, these behaviors can also cause adverse physical symptoms: people who obsessively wash their hands with  antibacterial soap  and hot water (to remove germs) can make their skin red and raw with  dermatitis . [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Intrusive thoughts and fears   Intrusive thoughts  are unwelcome, involuntary thoughts, images or unpleasant ideas that may become  obsessions , are upsetting or distressing, and can be difficult to be free of and manage. [ 10 ]  As with other forms of OCD, the awareness of the irrationality of these thoughts can be frustrating as the individual wishes to stop them but cannot. Intrusive thoughts, urges, and images are of inappropriate things at inappropriate times, usually falling into three categories: inappropriate aggressive thoughts, inappropriate sexual thoughts, and blasphemous religious thoughts. [ 11 ]  Most people experience these thoughts; when they are associated with OCD or  depression , they may become paralyzing,  anxiety -provoking, and persistent. Many people experience the type of unpleasant or unwanted thoughts that people with more troubling intrusive thoughts have, but most people are able to dismiss these thoughts. [ 10 ]  When intrusive thoughts co-occur with OCD, patients are less capable of ignoring the unpleasant thoughts and may pay undue attention to them, causing the thoughts to become more frequent and distressing. [ 10 ]   The common underlying theme to the diverse intrusive thoughts is summarised by Bruce  et al  with the example, ""What if I were to snap, lose control of myself, and do something totally uncharacteristic of me--perhaps even without my knowing it--that results in harm to myself or someone else?"" [ 12 ]       [ edit ]   Violent or aggressive thoughts   Intrusive thoughts may involve violent obsessions about hurting others or oneself. [ 13 ]  They can include such thoughts as harming an innocent child, jumping from a bridge, mountain or the top of a tall building, urges to jump in front of a train or automobile, and urges to push another in front of a train or automobile. [ 11 ]  A survey of healthy college students found that virtually all of them had intrusive thoughts from time to time, including imagining or wishing harm upon a family member or friend, impulses to attack or kill a small child, or animal, or shout something rude or violent. [ 14 ]   The possibility that most patients suffering from intrusive thoughts will ever act on those thoughts is low; patients who are experiencing intense guilt, anxiety, shame, and anger over bad thoughts are different from those who actually act on bad thoughts. The history of violent crime is dominated by those who feel no guilt or remorse; the very fact that someone is tormented by intrusive thoughts, and has never acted on them before, is an excellent predictor that they won't act upon the thoughts. According to Baer, a patient should be concerned that intrusive thoughts are dangerous if the person doesn't feel upset by the thoughts, rather finds them pleasurable; has ever acted on violent or sexual thoughts or urges; hears voices or sees things that others don't see; or feels uncontrollable irresistible anger. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Inappropriate sexual thoughts   Sexual obsessions involve intrusive thoughts or images of ""kissing, hugging a lot, touching, fondling, oral sex, anal sex, intercourse, and rape"" with ""strangers, acquaintances, parents, children, family members, friends, coworkers, animals and religious figures"", involving ""heterosexual or homosexual content"" with persons of any age. [ 16 ]  Like other intrusive, unpleasant thoughts or images, most people have some inappropriate sexual thoughts at times, but people with OCD may attach significance to the unwanted sexual thoughts, generating anxiety and distress. The doubt that accompanies OCD leads to uncertainty regarding whether one might act on the bad thoughts, resulting in self-criticism or loathing. [ 16 ]   One of the more common sexual intrusive thoughts occurs when an obsessive person doubts his or her  sexual identity , a symptom of OCD called homosexuality anxiety or HOCD. [ 17 ]  As in the case of most sexual obsessions, sufferers may feel shame and live in isolation, finding it hard to discuss their fears, doubts, and concerns about their sexual identity. [ 18 ]  A person experiencing sexual intrusive thoughts may feel shame, ""embarrassment, guilt, distress, torment, fear that you may act on the thought or perceived impulse and, doubt about whether you have already acted in such a way."" Depression may be a result of the self-loathing that can occur, depending on how much the OCD interferes with daily functioning or causes distress. [ 16 ]  The possibility that most patients suffering from intrusive thoughts to sexually assault people will ever act on those thoughts is low; patients who are experiencing intense guilt, anxiety, shame, and upset over bad thoughts are different from those who actually act on bad thoughts.     [ edit ]   Related conditions   OCD is often confused with the separate condition  obsessive-compulsive personality disorder . The two are not the same condition, however. OCD is  ego  dystonic , meaning that the disorder is incompatible with the sufferer's self-concept. Because disorders that are ego dystonic go against an individual's perception of his/herself, they tend to cause much distress. OCPD, on the other hand, is  ego syntonic marked by the individual's acceptance that the characteristics displayed as a result of this disorder are compatible with his/her self-image. Ego syntonic disorders understandably cause no distress. Persons suffering from OCD are often aware that their behavior is not rational and are unhappy about their obsessions but nevertheless feel compelled by them. Persons with OCPD are not aware of anything abnormal about themselves; they will readily explain why their actions are rational, and it is usually impossible to convince them otherwise. Persons with OCD are ridden with  anxiety ; persons who suffer from OCPD, by contrast, tend to derive pleasure from their obsessions or compulsions. [ 19 ]  This is a significant difference between these disorders.   Equally frequently, these rationalizations do not apply to the overall behavior, but to each instance individually; for example, a person compulsively checking their front door may argue that the time taken and stress caused by one more check of the front door is considerably less than the time and stress associated with being robbed, and thus the check is the better option. In practice, after that check, the individual is  still  not sure, and it is  still  better in terms of time and stress to do one more check, and this reasoning can continue as long as necessary.   Some OCD sufferers exhibit what is known as  overvalued ideas . In such cases, the person with OCD will truly be uncertain whether the fears that cause them to perform their compulsions are irrational or not. After some discussion, it is possible to convince the individual that their fears may be unfounded. It may be more difficult to do  ERP therapy  on such patients, because they may be, at least initially, unwilling to cooperate. For this reason OCD has often been likened to a disease of pathological doubt, in which the sufferer, while not usually  delusional , is often unable to realize fully what sorts of dreaded events are reasonably possible and which are not. There are severe cases when the sufferer has an unshakeable belief within the context of OCD which is difficult to differentiate from psychosis. [ 20 ]   OCD is different from behaviors such as  gambling  addiction and  overeating . People with these disorders typically experience at least some pleasure from their activity; OCD sufferers do not actively want to perform their compulsive tasks, and experience no pleasure from doing so. OCD is placed in the anxiety class of  mental illness , but like many  chronic stress disorders  it can lead to  clinical depression  over time. The constant stress of the condition can cause sufferers to develop a deadening of spirit, a numbing frustration, or sense of hopelessness. OCD's effects on day-to-day lifeparticularly its substantial consumption of timecan produce difficulties with work, finances and relationships. There is no known cure for OCD as of yet, but there are a number of successful treatment options available.     [ edit ]   Related/Spectrum disorders   People with OCD may be diagnosed with other conditions, such as  generalized anxiety disorder ,  anorexia nervosa ,  social anxiety disorder ,  bulimia nervosa ,  Tourette syndrome ,  Asperger syndrome ,  compulsive skin picking ,  body dysmorphic disorder ,  trichotillomania , and (as already mentioned)  obsessive-compulsive personality disorder . There is some research demonstrating a link between  drug addiction  and OCD as well. Many who suffer from OCD also suffer from  panic attacks . There is a higher risk of drug addiction among those with any anxiety disorder (possibly as a way of  coping  with the heightened levels of  anxiety ), but drug addiction among OCD patients may serve as a type of  compulsive behavior  and not just as a coping mechanism.  Depression  is also extremely prevalent among sufferers of OCD. One explanation for the high depression rate among OCD populations was posited by Mineka, Watson, and Clark (1998), who explained that people with OCD (or any other  anxiety disorder ) may feel depressed because of an ""out of control"" type of feeling. [ 21 ]   Some cases are thought to be caused at least in part by childhood  streptococcal  infections and are termed  PANDAS  (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infections). The streptococcal  antibodies  become involved in an  autoimmune  process. Though this idea is not set in stone, if it does prove to be true, there is cause to believe that OCD can to some very small extent be ""caught"" via exposure to strep throat (just as one may catch a cold). However, if OCD is caused by bacteria, this provides hope that  antibiotics  may eventually be used to treat or prevent it. [ 22 ]     [ edit ]   Causes     [ edit ]   Psychological   Scientists studying obsessive-compulsive disorder generally agree that both psychological and biological factors play a role in causing the disorder, although they differ in their degree of emphasis upon either type of factor.   From the 14th to the 16th century in Europe, it was believed that people who experienced blasphemous, sexual, or other obsessive thoughts were  possessed  by the  Devil . Based on this reasoning, treatment involved banishing the ""evil"" from the ""possessed"" person through  exorcism . [ 23 ]  In the early 1910s,  Sigmund Freud  attributed obsessive-compulsive behavior to unconscious conflicts which manifested as symptoms. [ 23 ]  Freud describes the clinical history of a typical case of ""touching phobia"" as starting in early childhood, when the person has a strong desire to touch an item. In response, the person develops an ""external prohibition"" against this type of touching. However, this ""prohibition does not succeed in abolishing"" the desire to touch; all it can do is repress the desire and ""force it into the unconscious"". [ 24 ]   The cognitive-behavioral model suggests that compulsive behaviour is carried out to remove anxiety-provoking intrusive thoughts. Unfortunately this only brings about temporary relief as the thought re-emerges. Each time the behaviour occurs it is negatively reinforced (see  Reinforcement ) by the relief from anxiety, thereby explaining why the dysfunctional activity increases and generalises (extends to other, related stimuli) over a period of time. For example, after touching a door-knob a person might have the thought that they may develop a disease as a result of contamination. They then experience anxiety, which is relieved when they wash their hands. This might be followed by the thought ""but did I wash them properly?"" causing an increase in anxiety once more, the hand-washing once again rewarded by the removal of anxiety (albeit briefly) and the cycle being repeated when thoughts of contamination re-occur. The distressing thoughts might then spread to fear of contamination from e.g. a chair (someone might have touched the chair after touching the door handle).     [ edit ]   Biological   There are many different theories about the cause of obsessive-compulsive disorder. The majority of researchers believe that there is some type of abnormality with the  neurotransmitter   serotonin , among other possible psychological or biological abnormalities; however, it is possible that this activity is the brain's  response  to OCD, and not its cause.             This article  may contain  original research  or  unverified claims . Please  improve the article  by adding  references . See the  talk page  for details.  (January 2009)       Serotonin is thought to have a role in regulating anxiety, though it is also thought to be involved in such processes as  sleep  and  memory  function. In order to send chemical messages, serotonin must bind to the  receptor  sites located on the neighboring nerve cell. It is hypothesized that OCD sufferers may have blocked or damaged receptor sites that prevent serotonin from functioning to its full potential. This suggestion is supported by the fact that many OCD patients benefit from the use of  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  (SSRIs)a class of  antidepressant  medications that allow for more serotonin to be readily available to other nerve cells. [ 25 ]  For more about this class of drugs, see the  section about potential treatments  for OCD.   The  Stanford University School of Medicine  OCD webpage states, ""Although the causes of the disorder still elude us, the recent identification of children with OCD caused by an autoimmune response to  Group A streptococcal infection  promises to bring increased understanding of the disorder's pathogenesis."" [ 26 ]   Recent research has revealed a possible  genetic mutation  that could help to cause OCD. Researchers funded by the  National Institutes of Health  have found a  mutation  in the human serotonin transporter gene,  hSERT , in unrelated families with OCD. Moreover, in his study of identical twins, Rasmussen (1994) produced data that supported the idea that there is a ""heritable factor for neurotic anxiety"". [ 27 ]  In addition, he noted that environmental factors also play a role in how these anxiety symptoms are expressed. However, various studies on this topic are still being conducted and the presence of a genetic link is not yet definitely established.   Another possible genetic cause of OCD was discovered in August 2007 by scientists at  Duke University Medical Center  in North Carolina. They genetically engineered mice that lacked a  gene  called  SAPAP3 . This  protein  is highly expressed in the  striatum , an area of the  brain  linked to planning and the initiation of appropriate actions. The mice spent three times as much time grooming themselves as ordinary mice, to the point that their fur fell off. [ 28 ]   Using tools like  positron emission tomography  (PET scans), it has been shown that those with OCD tend to have brain activity that differs from those who do not have this disorder. [ 29 ]  A popular explanation for OCD is that offered in the book  Brain Lock  by Jeffrey Schwartz, which suggests that OCD is caused by the part of the brain that is responsible for translating complex intentions (e.g., ""I will pick up this cup"") into fundamental actions (e.g., ""move arm forward, rotate hand 15 degrees, etc."") failing to correctly communicate the chemical message that an action has been completed. This is perceived as a feeling of doubt and incompleteness, which then leads the individual to attempt to consciously deconstruct their own prior behaviora process which induces anxiety in most people, even those without OCD [ citation needed ] .   It has been theorized that a miscommunication between the  orbitofrontal cortex , the  caudate nucleus , and the  thalamus  may be a factor in the explanation of OCD. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is the first part of the brain to notice whether or not something is wrong. [ vague ]  When the OFC notices that something is wrong, it sends an initial ""worry signal"" to the thalamus. When the thalamus receives this signal, it in turn sends signals back to the OFC to interpret the worrying event. The caudate nucleus lies between the OFC and the thalamus and prevents the initial worry signal from being sent back to the thalamus after it has already been received. However, it is suggested that in those with OCD, the caudate nucleus does not function properly, and therefore does not prevent this initial signal from recurring. This causes the thalamus to become hyperactive and creates a virtually never-ending loop of worry signals being sent back and forth between the OFC and the thalamus. The OFC responds by increasing anxiety and engaging in  compulsive behaviors  in an attempt to relieve this apprehension. [ 25 ]  This overactivity of the OFC is shown to be attenuated in patients who have successfully responded to  SSRI  medication. The increased stimulation of the  serotonin  receptors  5-HT2A  and  5-HT2C  in the OFC is believed to cause this inhibition.  [ 30 ]   Some research has discovered an association between a type of size abnormality in different  brain structures  and the predisposition to develop OCD. Through the use of  magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI), researchers at  Cambridge's Brain Mapping Unit  were able to discover distinctive patterns in the brain structure of individuals with OCD and their close family members.  [ 31 ]  This is the first instance in which it has been demonstrated that those with a familial risk of developing OCD have anatomical differences when compared with ordinary individuals. The discovery of these structural differences in the area of the brain associated with stopping  motor response  may ultimately aid researchers who seek to determine which genes contribute to the development of OCD.   In some patients, the consumption of  caffeine  may make OCD symptoms worse.  [ 32 ]     [ edit ]   Demographics and other statistics   In a 1980 study of 20,000 adults from  New Haven ,  Baltimore ,  St. Louis ,  Durham , and  Los Angeles , the lifetime prevalence rate of OCD for both sexes was recorded at 2.5 percent. Education also appears to be a factor. The lifetime prevalence of OCD is lower for those who have graduated high school than for those who have not (1.9 percent versus 3.4 percent). However, in the case of college education, lifetime prevalence is higher for those who graduate with a degree (3.1 percent) than it is for those who have only some college background (2.4 percent). As far as age is concerned, the onset of OCD usually ranges from the late teenage years until the mid-20s in both sexes, but the age of onset tends to be slightly younger in males than in females. [ 33 ]   It has been alleged that sufferers are generally of above-average  intelligence , as the very nature of the disorder necessitates complicated thinking patterns [ 34 ] .     [ edit ]   Treatment   According to the Expert Consensus Guidelines for the Treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder,  behavioral therapy  (BT),  cognitive therapy  (CT), and  medications  are first-line treatments for OCD.  Psychodynamic psychotherapy  may help in managing some aspects of the disorder, but there are no controlled studies that demonstrate effectiveness of  psychoanalysis  or  dynamic psychotherapy  in OCD. [ 35 ]     [ edit ]   Behavioral therapy   The specific technique used in BT/CBT is called  exposure and ritual prevention  (also known as "" exposure and response prevention "") or ERP; this involves gradually learning to tolerate the anxiety associated with not performing the ritual behavior. At first, for example, someone might touch something only very mildly ""contaminated"" (such as a tissue that has been touched by another tissue that has been touched by the end of a toothpick that has touched a book that came from a ""contaminated"" location, such as a school.) That is the ""exposure"". The ""ritual prevention"" is not washing. Another example might be leaving the house and checking the lock only once (exposure) without going back and checking again (ritual prevention). The person fairly quickly  habituates  to the anxiety-producing situation and discovers that their anxiety level has dropped considerably; they can then progress to touching something more ""contaminated"" or not checking the lock at allagain, without performing the ritual behavior of washing or checking.   Exposure ritual/response prevention has been demonstrated to be the most effective treatment for OCD. It has generally been accepted that  psychotherapy , in combination with  psychotropic medication , is more effective than either option alone. However, more recent studies have shown no difference in outcomes for those treated with the combination of medicine and CBT versus CBT alone. [ 36 ]   Recently it has been reported simultaneous administration of D-Cycloserin (an antibiotic) substantially improves effectiveness of Exposure and Response prevention. [ 37 ]     [ edit ]   Medication   Medications as treatment include  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  (SSRIs) such as  paroxetine (Seroxat, Paxil, Xetanor, ParoMerck, Rexetin) ,  sertraline (Zoloft, Stimuloton) ,  fluoxetine (Prozac, Bioxetin) ,  escitalopram  (Lexapro), and  fluvoxamine (Luvox)  as well as the  tricyclic antidepressants , in particular  clomipramine (Anafranil) . SSRIs prevent excess  serotonin  from being pumped back into the original  neuron  that released it. Instead, serotonin can then bind to the  receptor  sites of nearby neurons and send chemical messages or signals that can help regulate the excessive  anxiety  and obsessive thoughts. In some treatment-resistant cases, a combination of  clomipramine  and an SSRI has shown to be effective even when neither drug on its own has been efficacious.   Benzodiazepines  are also used in treatment. It's not uncommon to administer this class of drugs during the ""latency period"" for SSRIs or as synergistic adjunct long-term. Although widely prescribed, benzodiazepines have not been demonstrated as an effective treatment for OCD and can be addictive. [ 38 ]   Serotonergic   antidepressants  typically take longer to show benefit in OCD than with most other disorders which they are used to treat, as it is common for 23 months to elapse before any tangible improvement is noticed. In addition to this, the treatment usually requires high doses.  Fluoxetine , for example, is usually prescribed in doses of 20 mg per day for clinical depression, whereas with OCD the dose will often range from 20 mg to 80 mg or higher, if necessary. In most cases  antidepressant therapy  alone will only provide a partial reduction in symptoms, even in cases that are not deemed treatment-resistant. Much current research is devoted to the therapeutic potential of the agents that effect the release of the neurotransmitter  glutamate  or the binding to its receptors. These include  riluzole ,  memantine ,  gabapentin (Neurontin)  and  lamotrigine (Lamictal) .   Low doses of the newer  atypical antipsychotics   olanzapine (Zyprexa) ,  quetiapine (Seroquel) ,  ziprasidone  and  risperidone (Risperdal)  have also been found to be useful as adjuncts in the treatment of OCD. The use of  antipsychotics  in OCD must be undertaken carefully, however, since, although there is very strong evidence that at low doses they are beneficial (most likely due to their  dopamine receptor   antagonism ), at high doses these same antipsychotics have proven to cause dramatic obsessive-compulsive symptoms even in those patients who do not normally have OCD. This is most likely due to the antagonism of  5-HT2A receptors  becoming very prominent at these doses and outweighing the benefits of  dopamine  antagonism. Another point that must be noted with antipsychotic treatment is that SSRIs inhibit the chief  enzyme  that is responsible for  metabolising  antipsychotics CYP2D6 so the dose will be effectively higher than expected when these are combined with SSRIs. Also, it must be noted that antipsychotic treatment should be considered as augmentation treatment when SSRI treatment does not bring positive results.     [ edit ]   Alternative drug treatments   The naturally occurring sugar  inositol  may be an effective treatment for OCD. Inositol appears to modulate the actions of serotonin and has been found to reverse  desensitisation  of the  neurotransmitter 's receptors. [ 39 ]   St John's Wort  has been claimed to be of benefit due to its (non-selective) serotonin re-uptake inhibiting qualities, and studies have emerged that have shown positive results. However, a double-blind study, using a flexible-dose schedule (600-1800 mg/day), found no difference between St John's Wort and the placebo. [ 40 ]  Studies have also been done that show  nutrition deficiencies  may also contribute to OCD and other  mental disorders . Certain  vitamin  and  mineral supplements  may aid in such disorders and provide the  nutrients  necessary for proper mental functioning.  [ 41 ]   Recent research has found increasing evidence that  opioids  may significantly reduce OCD symptoms, though the use of them is not sanctioned for treatment and considered an ""off-label"" use, factors being  physical dependence  and long term drug tolerance. Anecdotal reports suggest that some OCD sufferers have successfully self-medicated with opioids such as  tramadol  (Ultram) and  hydrocodone  (Vicodin, Lortab), though the off-label use of such  painkillers  is not widely accepted, research on this has been limited. Tramadol is an atypical opioid that may be a viable option as it has a low potential for  abuse  and  addiction , mild side effects, and shows signs of rapid efficacy in OCD. Tramadol not only provides the anti-OCD effects of an  opiate , but also inhibits the  re-uptake  of serotonin (in addition to  norepinephrine ). This may provide additional benefits, but should not be taken in combination with  antidepressant  medication unless under careful medical supervision due to potential  serotonin syndrome . [ 42 ]   Recent studies at the  University of Arizona  using the  tryptamine   alkaloid   psilocybin  have shown promising results. [ 43 ]  There are reports that other  hallucinogens  such as  LSD  and  peyote  have produced similar benefits. It has been hypothesised that this effect may be due to stimulation of  5-HT2A receptors  and, less importantly,  5-HT2C receptors . This causes, among many other effects, an  inhibitory effect  on the  orbitofrontal cortex , an area of the brain in which  hyperactivity  has been strongly associated with OCD. [ 44 ]   Emerging evidence suggests that regular  nicotine  treatment may be helpful in improving symptoms of OCD, although the  pharmacodynamical  mechanism by which this improvement is achieved is not yet known, and more detailed studies are needed to fully confirm this  hypothesis . Anecdotal reports suggest OCD can worsen when cigarettes are smoked as a way of obtaining nicotine. [ 45 ]     [ edit ]   Psycho-surgery   For some, neither medication, support groups nor psychological treatments are helpful in alleviating obsessive-compulsive symptoms. These patients may choose to undergo  psychosurgery  as a last resort. In this procedure, a surgical  lesion  is made in an area of the brain (the  cingulate bundle ). In one study, 30% of participants benefited significantly from this procedure. [ 8 ]   Deep-brain stimulation  and  vagus nerve stimulation  are possible surgical options which do not require the destruction of  brain tissue , although their efficacy has not been conclusively demonstrated.   In the US, psychosurgery for OCD is a treatment of last resort and will not be performed until the patient has failed several attempts at medication (at the full dosage) with augmentation, and many months of intensive  cognitive-behavioral therapy  with exposure and ritual/response prevention. [ 46 ]  Likewise, in the UK, psychosurgery cannot be performed unless a course of treatment from a suitably qualified cognitive-behavioural therapist has been carried out.     [ edit ]   Transcranial magnetic stimulation   Though in its early stages of research,  Transcranial magnetic stimulation  (TMS) has shown promising results. The magnetic pulses are focused on the brain's  supplementary motor area  (SMA), which plays a role in filtering out extraneous internal stimuli, such as ruminations, obsessions, and tics. The TMS treatment is an attempt to normalize the SMA's activity, so that it properly filters out thoughts and behaviors associated with OCD.  [ 47 ] [ 48 ]     [ edit ]   Neuropsychiatry       Main article:  Neuropsychiatry       OCD primarily involves the  brain regions  of the  striatum , the  orbitofrontal cortex  and the  cingulate cortex . OCD involves several different  receptors , mostly  H 2 ,  M 4 ,  NK 1 ,  NMDA , and non-NMDA  glutamate receptors . [ citation needed ]  The receptors  5-HT 1D ,  5-HT 2C , and the   opioid receptor  exert a secondary effect. The H 2 , M 4 , NK 1 , and  non-NMDA glutamate  receptors are active in the striatum, whereas the  NMDA receptors  are active in the cingulate cortex.   The activity of certain receptors is positively correlated to the severity of OCD, whereas the activity of certain other receptors is negatively correlated to the severity of OCD. Correlations where activity is positively correlated to severity include the histamine receptor ( H 2 ); the Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor( M 4 ); the Tachykinin receptor ( NK 1 ); and non-NMDA  glutamate receptors . Correlations where activity is negatively correlated to severity include the NMDA receptor ( NMDA ); the Mu opioid receptor (  opioid ); and two types of 5-HT receptors ( 5-HT 1D  and  5-HT 2C ) The central dysfunction of OCD may involve the receptors nk1, non-NMDA  glutamate  receptors, and NMDA, whereas the other receptors could simply exert secondary modulatory effects.   Pharmaceuticals that act directly on those core mechanisms are  aprepitant  (nk1 antagonist),  riluzole  (glutamate release inhibitor), and  tautomycin  (NMDA receptor sensitizer). Also, the anti-Alzheimer's drug  memantine  is being studied by the  OC Foundation  in its efficacy in reducing OCD symptoms due to it being an  NMDA antagonist . One case study published in  The American Journal of Psychiatry  suggests that ""memantine may be an option for treatment-resistant OCD, but controlled studies are needed to substantiate this observation."" [ 49 ]  The drugs that are popularly used to fight OCD lack full efficacy because they do not act upon what are believed to be the core mechanisms. Many trials are currently underway to investigate the efficacy of a variety of agents that affect these 'core' neurotransmitters, particularly glutamatergic agents. [2]     [ edit ]   Notable cases     British poet, essayist, and lexicographer  Samuel Johnson  is an example of a historical figure with a  retrospective diagnosis  of OCD. He had elaborate rituals for crossing the thresholds of doorways, repeatedly walked up and down staircases counting the steps, and had compulsions regarding repetitive prayer which were most likely a form of religious scrupulosity.  [ 50 ] [ 51 ] [ 52 ]       American aviator and filmmaker  Howard Hughes  is known to have suffered from OCD and it is believed that his mother may have also been a sufferer. Friends of Hughes have mentioned his obsession with minor flaws in clothing and he is reported to have had a great fear of germs, common among OCD patients.  [ 53 ]  He did also suffer from Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) due to an aviation accident in which he was severely injured. This resulted in him becoming reclusive later in life.       English footballer  David Beckham  has been outspoken regarding his struggle with OCD. He has told media that he has to count all his clothes, and that magazines have to lie in a straight line. No more than three soda cans are allowed in his refrigerator, and if there are any more at home they have to be placed in a cupboard. He has explained that the reason he gets more tattoos is that he feels addicted to the pain of the needle. In hotels, any books that are on a shelf must be placed in the drawer. He has expressed a desire to get help for his problems.

For other uses, see  OCD (disambiguation) .       Obsessive-compulsive disorder   Classification and external resources       ICD - 10   F 42.       Obsessive-compulsive disorder  ( OCD ) is a  mental disorder  most commonly characterized by intrusive, repetitive thoughts resulting in  compulsive behaviors  and mental acts that the person feels driven to perform, according to rules that must be applied rigidly, aimed at preventing some imagined dreaded event; however, these behaviors or mental acts are not connected to the imagined dreaded event.   According to the current epidemiological data, OCD is the fourth most common mental disorder and OCD is considered nearly as common as  asthma  and  diabetes mellitus . [ 1 ]  In the  United States , 1 in 50 adults have OCD. [ 2 ]  In severe cases, it affects a person's ability to function in everyday activities. The disorder often has a serious impact on the sufferer's (and his/her family's)  quality of life . Also, the psychological self-awareness of the  irrationality  of the disorder can be painful. For people with severe OCD, it may take several hours a day to carry out the compulsive acts.   Experts [ who? ]  believe OCD may be related to levels of a normal chemical in the  brain  called  serotonin . When the proper flow of serotonin is blocked, the brain's ""alarm system"" overreacts. Danger messages are mistakenly triggered. Instead of the brain filtering out these unnecessary thoughts, the brain dwells on themand the person repeatedly experiences unrealistic fears and doubts.   The phrase ""obsessive-compulsive"" has become part of the English lexicon, and is often used in an informal or caricatured manner to describe someone who is meticulous,  perfectionistic , absorbed in a cause, or otherwise fixated on something or someone. [ 3 ]  Although these signs are often present in OCD, a person who exhibits them does not necessarily have OCD, and may instead have  obsessive-compulsive  personality  disorder  (OCPD) or some other condition.

The Quick Reference to the diagnostic criteria from DSM-IV-TR (2000) [ 4 ]  states six characteristics of obsessions and compulsions:     Obsessions       Recurrent and persistent thoughts,  impulses , or images that are experienced as intrusive and that cause marked anxiety or distress.   The thoughts, impulses, or images are not simply excessive worries about real-life problems.   The person attempts to ignore or suppress such thoughts, impulses, or images, or to neutralize them with some other thought or action.   The person recognizes that the obsessional thoughts, impulses, or images are a product of his or her own mind, and are not based in reality.       Compulsions       Repetitive behaviors or mental acts that the person feels driven to perform in response to an obsession, or according to rules that must be applied rigidly.   The behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing distress or preventing some dreaded event or situation; however, these behaviors or mental acts are not actually connected to the issue, or they are excessive.     In addition to these criteria, at some point during the course of the disorder, the individual must realize that his/her obsessions or compulsions are unreasonable or excessive. Moreover, the obsessions or compulsions must be time-consuming (taking up more than one hour per day), cause distress, or cause impairment in social, occupational, or school functioning. [ 4 ]  OCD often causes feelings similar to those of  depression .     [ edit ]   Symptoms and prevalence   OCD manifests in a variety of forms. Studies have placed the prevalence between one and three percent, although the prevalence of clinically recognized OCD is much lower, suggesting that many individuals with the disorder may not be diagnosed. [ 5 ]  The fact that many individuals do not seek treatment may be due in part to  stigma  associated with OCD. Another reason for not seeking treatment is that many sufferers of OCD do not realize that they have the condition.   The typical OCD sufferer performs tasks (or  compulsions ) to seek relief from obsession-related anxiety. To others, these tasks may appear odd and unnecessary. But for the sufferer, such tasks can feel critically important, and must be performed in particular ways to ward off dire consequences and to stop the  stress  from building up. Examples of these tasks are repeatedly checking that one's parked car has been locked before leaving it, turning lights on and off a set number of times before exiting a room, repeatedly washing hands at regular intervals throughout the day, touching objects a certain number of times before leaving a room, or walking in a certain routine way. Physical symptoms may include those brought on from anxieties and unwanted thoughts, as well as  tics  or  Parkinson's disease -like symptoms: rigidity, tremor, jerking arm movements, or involuntary movements of the limbs.   Formal diagnosis may be performed by a  psychologist , a  psychiatrist  or  psychoanalyst . OCD sufferers are aware that their thoughts and behavior are not rational, [ 6 ]  but they feel bound to comply with them to fend off feelings of panic or dread. Although everyone may experience unpleasant thoughts at one time or another, these are short-lived and fade away in time. [ 7 ]  For people with OCD, the thoughts are intrusive and persistent, and can cause them great anxiety and distress. [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Contamination   A major subtype of the fear category is the fear of contamination like  mysophobia ; some sufferers may fear the presence of human body secretions such as saliva, blood, semen, sweat, tears, vomit, or mucus, or excretions such as urine, or feces. Some OCD sufferers even fear that the soap they are using is contaminated. [ 9 ]  These anxiety-driven fears may cause a person to experience significant distress, which may make it difficult for a person with OCD to tolerate a workplace, venture into public locations, or conduct normal social relationships.     [ edit ]   Performing tasks   Symptoms related to performing tasks may include repeated hand washing or clearing of the throat; specific counting systems or counting of steps; doing repetitive actionsmore generally, this can involve an obsession with numbers or types of numbers (e.g., odd numbers). For example, when somebody suffering from OCD leaves the house, they might tap the door knob 9 times and if they don't they will go into distress, panic and even at certain times, they will pass out. These obsessive behaviors can cause individuals to feel psychological distress, because they are very concerned about having ""made mistakes"" in the number of steps that they have taken, or the number of stairs on a staircase. For some people with OCD, these obsessive counting and re-counting tasks, along with the attendant anxiety and fear, can take hours of each day, which can make it hard for the person to fulfill their work, family, or social roles. In some cases, these behaviors can also cause adverse physical symptoms: people who obsessively wash their hands with  antibacterial soap  and hot water (to remove germs) can make their skin red and raw with  dermatitis .     [ edit ]   Intrusive thoughts and fears   Intrusive thoughts  are unwelcome, involuntary thoughts, images or unpleasant ideas that may become  obsessions , are upsetting or distressing, and can be difficult to be free of and manage. [ 10 ]  As with other forms of OCD, the awareness of the irrationality of these thoughts can be frustrating as the individual wishes to stop them but cannot. Intrusive thoughts, urges, and images are of inappropriate things at inappropriate times, usually falling into three categories: inappropriate aggressive thoughts, inappropriate sexual thoughts, and blasphemous religious thoughts. [ 11 ]  Most people experience these thoughts; when they are associated with OCD or  depression , they may become paralyzing,  anxiety -provoking, and persistent. Many people experience the type of unpleasant or unwanted thoughts that people with more troubling intrusive thoughts have, but most people are able to dismiss these thoughts. [ 10 ]  When intrusive thoughts co-occur with OCD, patients are less capable of ignoring the unpleasant thoughts and may pay undue attention to them, causing the thoughts to become more frequent and distressing. [ 10 ]   The common underlying theme to the diverse intrusive thoughts is summarised by Bruce  et al  with the example, ""What if I were to snap, lose control of myself, and do something totally uncharacteristic of me--perhaps even without my knowing it--that results in harm to myself or someone else?"" [ 12 ]       [ edit ]   Violent or aggressive thoughts   Intrusive thoughts may involve violent obsessions about hurting others or oneself. [ 13 ]  They can include such thoughts as harming an innocent child, jumping from a bridge, mountain or the top of a tall building, urges to jump in front of a train or automobile, and urges to push another in front of a train or automobile. [ 11 ]  A survey of healthy college students found that virtually all of them had intrusive thoughts from time to time, including imagining or wishing harm upon a family member or friend, impulses to attack or kill a small child, or animal, or shout something rude or violent. [ 14 ]   The possibility that most patients suffering from intrusive thoughts will ever act on those thoughts is low; patients who are experiencing intense guilt, anxiety, shame, and anger over bad thoughts are different from those who actually act on bad thoughts. The history of violent crime is dominated by those who feel no guilt or remorse; the very fact that someone is tormented by intrusive thoughts, and has never acted on them before, is an excellent predictor that they won't act upon the thoughts. According to Baer, a patient should be concerned that intrusive thoughts are dangerous if the person doesn't feel upset by the thoughts, rather finds them pleasurable; has ever acted on violent or sexual thoughts or urges; hears voices or sees things that others don't see; or feels uncontrollable irresistible anger. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Inappropriate sexual thoughts   Sexual obsessions involve intrusive thoughts or images of ""kissing, hugging a lot, touching, fondling, oral sex, anal sex, intercourse, and rape"" with ""strangers, acquaintances, parents, children, family members, friends, coworkers, animals and religious figures"", involving ""heterosexual or homosexual content"" with persons of any age. [ 16 ]  Like other intrusive, unpleasant thoughts or images, most people have some inappropriate sexual thoughts at times, but people with OCD may attach significance to the unwanted sexual thoughts, generating anxiety and distress. The doubt that accompanies OCD leads to uncertainty regarding whether one might act on the bad thoughts, resulting in self-criticism or loathing. [ 16 ]       [ edit ]   Related conditions   OCD is often confused with the separate condition  obsessive-compulsive personality disorder . The two are not the same condition, however. OCD is  ego  dystonic , meaning that the disorder is incompatible with the sufferer's self-concept. Because disorders that are ego dystonic go against an individual's perception of his/herself, they tend to cause much distress. OCPD, on the other hand, is  ego syntonic marked by the individual's acceptance that the characteristics displayed as a result of this disorder are compatible with his/her self-image. Ego syntonic disorders understandably cause no distress. Persons suffering from OCD are often aware that their behavior is not rational and are unhappy about their obsessions but nevertheless feel compelled by them. Persons with OCPD are not aware of anything abnormal about themselves; they will readily explain why their actions are rational, and it is usually impossible to convince them otherwise. Persons with OCD are ridden with  anxiety ; persons who suffer from OCPD, by contrast, tend to derive pleasure from their obsessions or compulsions. [ 17 ]  This is a significant difference between these disorders.   Equally frequently, these rationalizations do not apply to the overall behavior, but to each instance individually; for example, a person compulsively checking their front door may argue that the time taken and stress caused by one more check of the front door is considerably less than the time and stress associated with being robbed, and thus the check is the better option. In practice, after that check, the individual is  still  not sure, and it is  still  better in terms of time and stress to do one more check, and this reasoning can continue as long as necessary.   Some OCD sufferers exhibit what is known as  overvalued ideas . In such cases, the person with OCD will truly be uncertain whether the fears that cause them to perform their compulsions are irrational or not. After some discussion, it is possible to convince the individual that their fears may be unfounded. It may be more difficult to do  ERP therapy  on such patients, because they may be, at least initially, unwilling to cooperate. For this reason OCD has often been likened to a disease of pathological doubt, in which the sufferer, while not usually  delusional , is often unable to realize fully what sorts of dreaded events are reasonably possible and which are not. There are severe cases when the sufferer has an unshakeable belief within the context of OCD which is difficult to differentiate from psychosis. [ 18 ]   OCD is different from behaviors such as  gambling  addiction and  overeating . People with these disorders typically experience at least some pleasure from their activity; OCD sufferers do not actively want to perform their compulsive tasks, and experience no pleasure from doing so. OCD is placed in the anxiety class of  mental illness , but like many  chronic stress disorders  it can lead to  clinical depression  over time. The constant stress of the condition can cause sufferers to develop a deadening of spirit, a numbing frustration, or sense of hopelessness. OCD's effects on day-to-day lifeparticularly its substantial consumption of timecan produce difficulties with work, finances and relationships. There is no known cure for OCD as of yet, but there are a number of successful treatment options available.     [ edit ]   Related/Spectrum disorders   People with OCD may be diagnosed with other conditions, such as  generalized anxiety disorder ,  anorexia nervosa ,  social anxiety disorder ,  bulimia nervosa ,  Tourette syndrome ,  Asperger syndrome ,  compulsive skin picking ,  body dysmorphic disorder ,  trichotillomania , and (as already mentioned)  obsessive-compulsive personality disorder . There is some research demonstrating a link between  drug addiction  and OCD as well. Many who suffer from OCD also suffer from  panic attacks . There is a higher risk of drug addiction among those with any anxiety disorder (possibly as a way of  coping  with the heightened levels of  anxiety ), but drug addiction among OCD patients may serve as a type of  compulsive behavior  and not just as a coping mechanism.  Depression  is also extremely prevalent among sufferers of OCD. One explanation for the high depression rate among OCD populations was posited by Mineka, Watson, and Clark (1998), who explained that people with OCD (or any other  anxiety disorder ) may feel depressed because of an ""out of control"" type of feeling. [ 19 ]   Some cases are thought to be caused at least in part by childhood  streptococcal  infections and are termed  PANDAS  (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infections). The streptococcal  antibodies  become involved in an  autoimmune  process. Though this idea is not set in stone, if it does prove to be true, there is cause to believe that OCD can to some very small extent be ""caught"" via exposure to strep throat (just as one may catch a cold). However, if OCD is caused by bacteria, this provides hope that  antibiotics  may eventually be used to treat or prevent it. [ 20 ]     [ edit ]   Causes     [ edit ]   Psychological   Scientists studying obsessive-compulsive disorder generally agree that both psychological and biological factors play a role in causing the disorder, although they differ in their degree of emphasis upon either type of factor.   From the 14th to the 16th century in Europe, it was believed that people who experienced blasphemous, sexual, or other obsessive thoughts were  possessed  by the  Devil . Based on this reasoning, treatment involved banishing the ""evil"" from the ""possessed"" person through  exorcism . [ 21 ]  In the early 1910s,  Sigmund Freud  attributed obsessive-compulsive behavior to unconscious conflicts which manifested as symptoms. [ 21 ]  Freud describes the clinical history of a typical case of ""touching phobia"" as starting in early childhood, when the person has a strong desire to touch an item. In response, the person develops an ""external prohibition"" against this type of touching. However, this ""prohibition does not succeed in abolishing"" the desire to touch; all it can do is repress the desire and ""force it into the unconscious"". [ 22 ]   The cognitive-behavioral model suggests that compulsive behaviour is carried out to remove anxiety-provoking intrusive thoughts. Unfortunately this only brings about temporary relief as the thought re-emerges. Each time the behaviour occurs it is negatively reinforced (see  Reinforcement ) by the relief from anxiety, thereby explaining why the dysfunctional activity increases and generalises (extends to other, related stimuli) over a period of time. For example, after touching a door-knob a person might have the thought that they may develop a disease as a result of contamination. They then experience anxiety, which is relieved when they wash their hands. This might be followed by the thought ""but did I wash them properly?"" causing an increase in anxiety once more, the hand-washing once again rewarded by the removal of anxiety (albeit briefly) and the cycle being repeated when thoughts of contamination re-occur. The distressing thoughts might then spread to fear of contamination from e.g. a chair (someone might have touched the chair after touching the door handle).     [ edit ]   Biological   There are many different theories about the cause of obsessive-compulsive disorder. The majority of researchers believe that there is some type of abnormality with the  neurotransmitter   serotonin , among other possible psychological or biological abnormalities; however, it is possible that this activity is the brain's  response  to OCD, and not its cause.             This article  may contain  original research  or  unverified claims . Please  improve the article  by adding  references . See the  talk page  for details.  (January 2009)       Serotonin is thought to have a role in regulating anxiety, though it is also thought to be involved in such processes as  sleep  and  memory  function. In order to send chemical messages, serotonin must bind to the  receptor  sites located on the neighboring nerve cell. It is hypothesized that OCD sufferers may have blocked or damaged receptor sites that prevent serotonin from functioning to its full potential. This suggestion is supported by the fact that many OCD patients benefit from the use of  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  (SSRIs)a class of  antidepressant  medications that allow for more serotonin to be readily available to other nerve cells. [ 23 ]  For more about this class of drugs, see the  section about potential treatments  for OCD.   The  Stanford University School of Medicine  OCD webpage states, ""Although the causes of the disorder still elude us, the recent identification of children with OCD caused by an autoimmune response to  Group A streptococcal infection  promises to bring increased understanding of the disorder's pathogenesis."" [ 24 ]   Recent research has revealed a possible  genetic mutation  that could help to cause OCD. Researchers funded by the  National Institutes of Health  have found a  mutation  in the human serotonin transporter gene,  hSERT , in unrelated families with OCD. Moreover, in his study of identical twins, Rasmussen (1994) produced data that supported the idea that there is a ""heritable factor for neurotic anxiety"". [ 25 ]  In addition, he noted that environmental factors also play a role in how these anxiety symptoms are expressed. However, various studies on this topic are still being conducted and the presence of a genetic link is not yet definitely established.   Another possible genetic cause of OCD was discovered in August 2007 by scientists at  Duke University Medical Center  in North Carolina. They genetically engineered mice that lacked a  gene  called  SAPAP3 . This  protein  is highly expressed in the  striatum , an area of the  brain  linked to planning and the initiation of appropriate actions. The mice spent three times as much time grooming themselves as ordinary mice, to the point that their fur fell off. [ 26 ]   Using tools like  positron emission tomography  (PET scans), it has been shown that those with OCD tend to have brain activity that differs from those who do not have this disorder. [ 27 ]  A popular explanation for OCD is that offered in the book  Brain Lock  by Jeffrey Schwartz, which suggests that OCD is caused by the part of the brain that is responsible for translating complex intentions (e.g., ""I will pick up this cup"") into fundamental actions (e.g., ""move arm forward, rotate hand 15 degrees, etc."") failing to correctly communicate the chemical message that an action has been completed. This is perceived as a feeling of doubt and incompleteness, which then leads the individual to attempt to consciously deconstruct their own prior behaviora process which induces anxiety in most people, even those without OCD [ citation needed ] .   It has been theorized that a miscommunication between the  orbitofrontal cortex , the  caudate nucleus , and the  thalamus  may be a factor in the explanation of OCD. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is the first part of the brain to notice whether or not something is wrong. [ vague ]  When the OFC notices that something is wrong, it sends an initial ""worry signal"" to the thalamus. When the thalamus receives this signal, it in turn sends signals back to the OFC to interpret the worrying event. The caudate nucleus lies between the OFC and the thalamus and prevents the initial worry signal from being sent back to the thalamus after it has already been received. However, it is suggested that in those with OCD, the caudate nucleus does not function properly, and therefore does not prevent this initial signal from recurring. This causes the thalamus to become hyperactive and creates a virtually never-ending loop of worry signals being sent back and forth between the OFC and the thalamus. The OFC responds by increasing anxiety and engaging in  compulsive behaviors  in an attempt to relieve this apprehension. [ 23 ]  This overactivity of the OFC is shown to be attenuated in patients who have successfully responded to  SSRI  medication. The increased stimulation of the  serotonin  receptors  5-HT2A  and  5-HT2C  in the OFC is believed to cause this inhibition.  [ 28 ]   Some research has discovered an association between a type of size abnormality in different  brain structures  and the predisposition to develop OCD. Through the use of  magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI), researchers at  Cambridge's Brain Mapping Unit  were able to discover distinctive patterns in the brain structure of individuals with OCD and their close family members.  [ 29 ]  This is the first instance in which it has been demonstrated that those with a familial risk of developing OCD have anatomical differences when compared with ordinary individuals. The discovery of these structural differences in the area of the brain associated with stopping  motor response  may ultimately aid researchers who seek to determine which genes contribute to the development of OCD.   In some patients, the consumption of  caffeine  may make OCD symptoms worse.  [ 30 ]     [ edit ]   Demographics and other statistics   In a 1980 study of 20,000 adults from  New Haven ,  Baltimore ,  St. Louis ,  Durham , and  Los Angeles , the lifetime prevalence rate of OCD for both sexes was recorded at 2.5 percent. Education also appears to be a factor. The lifetime prevalence of OCD is lower for those who have graduated high school than for those who have not (1.9 percent versus 3.4 percent). However, in the case of college education, lifetime prevalence is higher for those who graduate with a degree (3.1 percent) than it is for those who have only some college background (2.4 percent). As far as age is concerned, the onset of OCD usually ranges from the late teenage years until the mid-20s in both sexes, but the age of onset tends to be slightly younger in males than in females. [ 31 ]   It has been alleged that sufferers are generally of above-average  intelligence , as the very nature of the disorder necessitates complicated thinking patterns [ 32 ] .     [ edit ]   Treatment   According to the Expert Consensus Guidelines for the Treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder,  behavioral therapy  (BT),  cognitive therapy  (CT), and  medications  are first-line treatments for OCD.  Psychodynamic psychotherapy  may help in managing some aspects of the disorder, but there are no controlled studies that demonstrate effectiveness of  psychoanalysis  or  dynamic psychotherapy  in OCD. [ 33 ]     [ edit ]   Behavioral therapy   The specific technique used in BT/CBT is called  exposure and ritual prevention  (also known as "" exposure and response prevention "") or ERP; this involves gradually learning to tolerate the anxiety associated with not performing the ritual behavior. At first, for example, someone might touch something only very mildly ""contaminated"" (such as a tissue that has been touched by another tissue that has been touched by the end of a toothpick that has touched a book that came from a ""contaminated"" location, such as a school.) That is the ""exposure"". The ""ritual prevention"" is not washing. Another example might be leaving the house and checking the lock only once (exposure) without going back and checking again (ritual prevention). The person fairly quickly  habituates  to the anxiety-producing situation and discovers that their anxiety level has dropped considerably; they can then progress to touching something more ""contaminated"" or not checking the lock at allagain, without performing the ritual behavior of washing or checking.   Exposure ritual/response prevention has been demonstrated to be the most effective treatment for OCD. It has generally been accepted that  psychotherapy , in combination with  psychotropic medication , is more effective than either option alone. However, more recent studies have shown no difference in outcomes for those treated with the combination of medicine and CBT versus CBT alone. [ 34 ]   Recently it has been reported simultaneous administration of D-Cycloserin (an antibiotic) substantially improves effectiveness of Exposure and Response prevention. [ 35 ]     [ edit ]   Medication   Medications as treatment include  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  (SSRIs) such as  paroxetine (Seroxat, Paxil, Xetanor, ParoMerck, Rexetin) ,  sertraline (Zoloft, Stimuloton) ,  fluoxetine (Prozac, Bioxetin) ,  escitalopram  (Lexapro), and  fluvoxamine (Luvox)  as well as the  tricyclic antidepressants , in particular  clomipramine (Anafranil) . SSRIs prevent excess  serotonin  from being pumped back into the original  neuron  that released it. Instead, serotonin can then bind to the  receptor  sites of nearby neurons and send chemical messages or signals that can help regulate the excessive  anxiety  and obsessive thoughts. In some treatment-resistant cases, a combination of  clomipramine  and an SSRI has shown to be effective even when neither drug on its own has been efficacious.   Benzodiazepines  are also used in treatment. It's not uncommon to administer this class of drugs during the ""latency period"" for SSRIs or as synergistic adjunct long-term. Although widely prescribed, benzodiazepines have not been demonstrated as an effective treatment for OCD and can be addictive. [ 36 ]   Serotonergic   antidepressants  typically take longer to show benefit in OCD than with most other disorders which they are used to treat, as it is common for 23 months to elapse before any tangible improvement is noticed. In addition to this, the treatment usually requires high doses.  Fluoxetine , for example, is usually prescribed in doses of 20 mg per day for clinical depression, whereas with OCD the dose will often range from 20 mg to 80 mg or higher, if necessary. In most cases  antidepressant therapy  alone will only provide a partial reduction in symptoms, even in cases that are not deemed treatment-resistant. Much current research is devoted to the therapeutic potential of the agents that effect the release of the neurotransmitter  glutamate  or the binding to its receptors. These include  riluzole ,  memantine ,  gabapentin (Neurontin)  and  lamotrigine (Lamictal) .   Low doses of the newer  atypical antipsychotics   olanzapine (Zyprexa) ,  quetiapine (Seroquel) ,  ziprasidone  and  risperidone (Risperdal)  have also been found to be useful as adjuncts in the treatment of OCD. The use of  antipsychotics  in OCD must be undertaken carefully, however, since, although there is very strong evidence that at low doses they are beneficial (most likely due to their  dopamine receptor   antagonism ), at high doses these same antipsychotics have proven to cause dramatic obsessive-compulsive symptoms even in those patients who do not normally have OCD. This is most likely due to the antagonism of  5-HT2A receptors  becoming very prominent at these doses and outweighing the benefits of  dopamine  antagonism. However antidepressant mirtazapine which is a 5-HT2A antagonist has shown to be of benefit to OCD patients [ 37 ] . Another point that must be noted with antipsychotic treatment is that SSRIs inhibit the chief  enzyme  that is responsible for  metabolising  antipsychotics CYP2D6 so the dose will be effectively higher than expected when these are combined with SSRIs. Also, it must be noted that antipsychotic treatment should be considered as augmentation treatment when SSRI treatment does not bring positive results.     [ edit ]   Alternative drug treatments   The naturally occurring sugar  inositol  has been suggested as a treatment for OCD [ 38 ] , as it appears to modulate the actions of serotonin and reverse  desensitisation  of  neurotransmitter  receptors.  St John's Wort  has been claimed to be of benefit due to its (non-selective) serotonin re-uptake inhibiting qualities [ citations needed ] , although a double-blind study using a flexible-dose schedule (600-1800 mg/day) found no difference between St John's Wort and a placebo [ 39 ] .   Nutrition deficiencies  may also contribute to OCD and other  mental disorders .  Vitamin  and mineral supplements may aid in such disorders and provide  nutrients  necessary for proper mental functioning [ 40 ] .   Opioids  may significantly reduce OCD symptoms, though their use is not sanctioned for treatment due to  physical dependence  and long term drug tolerance [ citations needed ] . Tramadol is an atypical opioid that appears to provide the anti-OCD effects of an  opiate  and inhibit the  re-uptake  of serotonin (in addition to  norepinephrine ) [ 41 ] .   Tryptamine   alkaloid   psilocybin  has been attempted as treatment [ 42 ] . There are reports that other  hallucinogens  such as  LSD  and  peyote  have produced similar effects [ citations needed ] . It has been hypothesised that this effect may be due to stimulation of  5-HT2A receptors  and, less significantly,  5-HT2C receptors ; this causes an inhibitory effect on the  orbitofrontal cortex , an area of the brain in which  hyperactivity  has been strongly associated with OCD [ 43 ] .   Regular  nicotine  treatment may ameliorate symptoms of OCD, although the  pharmacodynamical  mechanism by which this is achieved is not yet known, and more detailed studies are needed to fully confirm this  hypothesis [ 44 ] .     [ edit ]   Psycho-surgery   For some, neither medication, support groups nor psychological treatments are helpful in alleviating obsessive-compulsive symptoms. These patients may choose to undergo  psychosurgery  as a last resort. In this procedure, a surgical  lesion  is made in an area of the brain (the  cingulate bundle ). In one study, 30% of participants benefited significantly from this procedure. [ 8 ]   Deep-brain stimulation  and  vagus nerve stimulation  are possible surgical options which do not require the destruction of  brain tissue , although their efficacy has not been conclusively demonstrated.   In the US, psychosurgery for OCD is a treatment of last resort and will not be performed until the patient has failed several attempts at medication (at the full dosage) with augmentation, and many months of intensive  cognitive-behavioral therapy  with exposure and ritual/response prevention. [ 45 ]  Likewise, in the UK, psychosurgery cannot be performed unless a course of treatment from a suitably qualified cognitive-behavioural therapist has been carried out.     [ edit ]   Neuropsychiatry       Main article:  Neuropsychiatry       OCD primarily involves the  brain regions  of the  striatum , the  orbitofrontal cortex  and the  cingulate cortex . OCD involves several different  receptors , mostly  H 2 ,  M 4 ,  NK 1 ,  NMDA , and non-NMDA  glutamate receptors . [ citation needed ]  The receptors  5-HT 1D ,  5-HT 2C , and the   opioid receptor  exert a secondary effect. The H 2 , M 4 , NK 1 , and  non-NMDA glutamate  receptors are active in the striatum, whereas the  NMDA receptors  are active in the cingulate cortex.   The activity of certain receptors is positively correlated to the severity of OCD, whereas the activity of certain other receptors is negatively correlated to the severity of OCD. Correlations where activity is positively correlated to severity include the histamine receptor ( H 2 ); the Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor( M 4 ); the Tachykinin receptor ( NK 1 ); and non-NMDA  glutamate receptors . Correlations where activity is negatively correlated to severity include the NMDA receptor ( NMDA ); the Mu opioid receptor (  opioid ); and two types of 5-HT receptors ( 5-HT 1D  and  5-HT 2C ) The central dysfunction of OCD may involve the receptors nk1, non-NMDA  glutamate  receptors, and NMDA, whereas the other receptors could simply exert secondary modulatory effects.   Pharmaceuticals that act directly on those core mechanisms are  aprepitant  (nk1 antagonist),  riluzole  (glutamate release inhibitor), and  tautomycin  (NMDA receptor sensitizer). Also, the anti-Alzheimer's drug  memantine  is being studied by the  OC Foundation  in its efficacy in reducing OCD symptoms due to it being an  NMDA antagonist . One case study published in  The American Journal of Psychiatry  suggests that ""memantine may be an option for treatment-resistant OCD, but controlled studies are needed to substantiate this observation."" [ 46 ]  The drugs that are popularly used to fight OCD lack full efficacy because they do not act upon what are believed to be the core mechanisms. Many trials are currently underway to investigate the efficacy of a variety of agents that affect these 'core' neurotransmitters, particularly glutamatergic agents. [2]     [ edit ]   Notable cases     British poet, essayist, and lexicographer  Samuel Johnson  is an example of a historical figure with a  retrospective diagnosis  of OCD. He had elaborate rituals for crossing the thresholds of doorways, repeatedly walked up and down staircases counting the steps, and had compulsions regarding repetitive prayer which were most likely a form of religious scrupulosity.  [ 47 ] [ 48 ] [ 49 ]       American aviator and filmmaker  Howard Hughes  is known to have suffered from OCD and it is believed that his mother may have also been a sufferer. Friends of Hughes have mentioned his obsession with minor flaws in clothing and he is reported to have had a great fear of germs, common among OCD patients.  [ 50 ]  He did also suffer from Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) due to an aviation accident in which he was severely injured. This resulted in him becoming reclusive later in life.       English footballer  David Beckham  has been outspoken regarding his struggle with OCD. He has told media that he has to count all his clothes, and that magazines have to lie in a straight line. No more than three soda cans are allowed in his refrigerator, and if there are any more at home they have to be placed in a cupboard. He has explained that the reason he gets more tattoos is that he feels addicted to the pain of the needle. In hotels, any books that are on a shelf must be placed in the drawer. He has expressed a desire to get help for his problems.

Home  :: Asbestos Workplace Exposure         Asbestos Workplace Exposure                                             Increase Font Size               Print Article                                 Exposure to the fibrous mineral asbestos can cause serious injury or illness such as  mesothelioma ,  lung cancer , respiratory complications, and more. People who develop an illness or disease from asbestos are usually those who are regularly exposed to the hazardous fibers in the workplace. Regular asbestos exposure most commonly occurs when employees either directly handle asbestos or are exposed through significant environmental contact.  Workplace exposure to asbestos poses the highest risk of developing mesothelioma and other  asbestos related diseases  .    The risk of injury or illness greatly rises depending on the  duration  and  intensity  of asbestos exposure. In some cases, victims of mesothelioma and other illnesses have had only a few months exposure to asbestos. However, most cases of mesothelioma are caused by high levels of workplace exposure to asbestos.    Who is at risk for workplace exposure?    Asbestos was widely used and manufactured in a number of industries worldwide. Millions of employees have been subjected to dangerous workplace exposure. Tradesmen in the  steel, electrical, plumbing, mining, milling, shipbuilding ( navy mesothelioma & asbestos exposure navy ships ), and insulation industries , among others are the most at risk for breathing in toxic asbestos fibers while on the job. In addition,  demolition workers, firefighters, drywall removers, and similar tradesmen  are at risk of workplace exposure to asbestos.    Workplace exposure laws    Federal and state governments have recognized the serious health hazards posed by workplace exposure to dangerous asbestos fibers and have established laws and regulations accordingly. The  Occupational and Safety Health Administration ( OSHA )  is the federal agency that enforces workplace exposure laws created to protect workers. These laws define the permissible workplace exposure level at 0.1 fibers per cubic centimeter for an eight-hour workday and one fiber per cubic centimeter in any thirty-minute time frame.    Furthermore,  asbestos workplace exposure  laws require employers to provide employees with protective clothing and respiratory equipment, sufficient hygiene facilities (to wash off clinging asbestos fibers), routine health exams, and training to safely work with asbestos.    What are my legal rights?    If you or a loved one has developed a serious illness or disease as a result of workplace exposure to asbestos, you have the legal right to pursue an  asbestos lawsuit  to seek compensation for your losses and suffering.    Because  mesothelioma  and other diseases have a long latency period and may not develop years until after asbestos exposure, you may still seek monetary recovery after you've been diagnosed with an illness. In rare cases, a worker who expects to develop an illness from workplace asbestos exposure can also file a lawsuit. In the event that a worker was killed as a result of an asbestos-related illness, family members can file an  asbestos claim  to seek compensation for their losses.    If you want to learn more information about workplace exposure to asbestos or wish to pursue a lawsuit, it is wise to consult a qualified asbestos attorney who can evaluate your case, inform you of your legal options, protect your rights, and maximize your interests.

The entire film is available on GoggleVideo.  This clip describes key properties of asbestos and some of its uses in the 1950s.  Inhaling asbestos dust, can cause asbestosis, lung cancer and esothelioma. Asbestos manufacturers knew of these diseases by the 1930s.  Tens of thousands of (mostly) workers have been made sick and died from asbestos exposure.

Over the past 20 years, with more stringent US regulations in place concerning the use of asbestos and greater awareness of the health effects of the material, many buildings with asbestos problems were abandoned by corporations and left for the government to clean up.  These buildings still present a threat due to large amounts of asbestos containing materials (ACM).   Tragically, asbestos building materials and other products, such as brake shoes, are still being used in the US in 2008.

Understanding asbestos is important because the illnesses associated with the substance can cause serious medical problems and even death. Knowledge truly is power and it is crucial to know what asbestos is and how to take precautions to avoid it.   What is Asbestos?   Asbestos is a naturally occurring mineral that has been mined for commercial use since the late 1800s. Though the U.S. Bureau of Mines has listed more than 100 types of asbestiform minerals, only six are regulated by the government. Although it is well known that asbestos is a dangerous mineral, a few countries still allow for it to be mined. The United States still allows the use of asbestos and many roofing and construction materials still contain the toxic mineral, as well as brake pads and clutches. Of all the  asbestos types , chrysotile is most commonly used throughout the world.   Why Worry About Asbestos?   The  light, fine, and virtually indestructible fibers wreck havoc on the human body. Free asbestos fibers in the air are easily inhaled into the the lungs, and are quite difficult to expel. The lungs  try to repair the tiny irritations, which can result in scarring. Scarred lung tissue cannot readily absorb oxygen from the air or easily pass back carbon dioxide. As a result of this process,  asbestosis  can develop, and may even turn into cancer.    Asbestos exposure can also cause cancer, such as  mesothelioma  and lung cancer, and has been linked to gastrointestinal and colon cancer, as well as a slew of other cancers. Mesothelioma  most commonly affects of the lining of the lungs, known as pleural mesothelioma. This cancer can also affect the abdominal cavity (peritoneal), the lining of the heart (pericardial), and in very rare cases, the testes.     Some of the highest incidences of mesothelioma have not been from adults who worked with asbestos, but among their children. Children are more susceptible to its  effects than adults and were often exposed to asbestos since it was carried home on parents' work clothes. This is why there is so much concern about asbestos-containing materials (ACM) in school buildings. Many institutions of higher learning have published  surveys of ACM in their buildings, which include plans to manage and prevent further exposure,  plans to remove it, and programs to educate local populations about the dangers of disturbing ACM. Some universities even maintain their own accredited asbestos testing labs and abatement crews. If you are at risk for these illnesses because  high levels of asbestos exposure,  have regular medical checkups.     Where Asbestos Can be Found: Naturally Occurring Asbestos    If you live in an area where asbestos occurs naturally,  limit your exposure by being aware of where there are or have been commercial operations to mine and process asbestos. Some helpful hints include:       Use paved trails rather than open soil to hike, bike, walk, or jog; wheeled vehicles such as mountain bikes, dirt bikes, and ATVs are especially likely to throw  dust into the air.     Perform outdoor activities in areas where the ground is covered with mulch, wood chips, sand, pea gravel, grass, asphalt, or rubber.      Label soil that  does not contain asbestos. Never dig without wetting the soil thoroughly  to keep the asbestos in the soil instead of the air.      Do not use a leaf blower. It is better to use water to clear sidewalks and patios, or at least to wet the surface dust down before clearing it with a broom (that should be left outside).       Prevent the family or pets from tracking dry soil into the house - use doormats or remove  shoes. Do not allow the pets to bring in dry dust from outside.       Keep windows and doors closed when it is windy or when any of the neighbors are digging for construction, gardening, or other purposes.     Drive slowly over unpaved roads with the car windows closed, and share your concern with local authorities. Get the car washed often and pave your own driveway and walkways.      Always use wet rags and mops to clean up dust from furniture, floors, and outdoor equipment. Wash the rags before they dry, and never shake a dust mop or rag to clean it.      Use washable area rugs on easily mopped floors; wash both often.      Vacuum the carpet often and use a machine with a HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) filter, and wet down the contents of the dust cup before emptying.      Where Asbestos Can be Found: A Brief History   Asbestos has been useful to humans for  thousands of years. Archaeologists discovered that asbestos was mixed into clay pots made in Finland in 2500 BC. Ancient documents have been found that describe asbestos fibers being used for everlasting lamp wicks and to weave shrouds for wrapping bodies for cremation.  The first real industrial application began with textiles from Italy in the early nineteenth century.    The United States has embraced asbestos in  commercial use since the late 1800s. Asbestos use grew  as the Industrial Revolution came to full maturity with mass production techniques and new demands for friction products, such as  brake shoes  and  clutches  for automobiles. Demand and production fell off during the Great Depression of the 1930s, but World War II brought another boost to the use of asbestos for thermal insulation and fire prevention, among many other uses. Through the 1950s and '60s, asbestos continued to be heavily used for its many advantages. It was integrated in more than 3,000 different commercial and domestic products. It was light, fireproof, strong, insulating (both thermally and electrically), and mixed well with a number of other building materials.   A 1984 survey by the Environmental Protection Agency found friable asbestos (susceptible to releasing its fibers into the air) in 42 of the agency's own 270 buildings. In 1988, the EPA found asbestos in at least 700,000 public and commercial buildings across the country, more than a half million of them with damaged (friable) asbestos.     Where Asbestos Can be Found: In the Home     The amount of asbestos that can be found within a home depends on when the home was built or renovated. If the house, or anything in it, was built  before the mid-1970s, there is a  good chance of finding asbestos-containing materials. However, asbestos was still used in homes though the 1980s and is found in construction products made today. These materials can be found in a variety of places ranging from the roof to the basement.    Asbestos materials that are difficult to locate include vinyl wall coverings, ceiling tiles, and sprayed or troweled on ""popcorn"" textured coatings. For  these products, the only way to find the asbestos-containing fibers is to scientifically sample them for testing by using an EPA-certified lab.    It is important to determine if asbestos is located in the water or steam  pipes . If the pipes do contain asbestos, they are safe as long as they are not damaged by water leaks or by children playing nearby. It is best to coat them with  modern protection such as plastic sheeting or  sprays that will harden and encapsulate the asbestos fibers. These protections, however, will make it more difficult to remove the insulation and will have to be removed at a later date. Most states and/or municipalities require  separate removal and proper disposal of all asbestos-containing materials when any building is demolished, or when an area is renovated where such materials are present.     What is the  Difference Between Friable and Non-Friable?     There is a major distinction between  friable and non-friable  asbestos materials. Asbestos-containing material (flooring,  roofing ,  pipe wrap, insulation, etc.) in the home can be crushed, pulverized, or turned to powder by the pressure of the average human hand are known as friable materials and can release dry asbestos fibers into the air. Non-friable materials are either tough or  flexible enough to contain the embedded asbestos fibers, but with age and normal wear and tear, these non-friable materials can become friable.    Federal law recognizes these variations within the classification of non-friable asbestos. There are two categories of  non-friable material. One distinguishes material that has become friable for one reason or another (Category I). The other is material that remains non-friable (Category II). Even Category II material may be regulated as friable material. If Category II non-friable material has been cut, scraped, sanded, or disturbed to where it produces dust, or if it is likely to be be disturbed during demolition or renovation, it falls under the friable and Category I materials.    What is Banned?       In 1972, asbestos was banned from clothing      In 1973, spraying asbestos-containing materials on buildings to fireproof them was no longer allowed     In 1977, asbestos was taken out of patching compounds and gas heaters      As of 1979, hair dryer manufacturers voluntarily recalled products that use asbestos as insulation. They replaced the asbestos with other materials and stopped using asbestos in their new products.     In 1986, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposed a 10-year program that would result in a comprehensive ban on commercial use of asbestos. The ban passed in 1989 and the first phase was implemented in 1990, but the rule was overturned by a federal appeals court in 1991. After another two years of clarification, the EPA found itself with six types of asbestos-containing materials still banned, and all others nominally still on the free market (though most categories were  rapidly losing popularity).   These six include:       Flooring felt - asbestos paper saturated with asphalt or another material to serve as underlayment for vinyl tiles or sheet flooring       ""Commercial paper"" - used in thin barriers for insulation or muffling       ""Corrugated paper"" - similar to corrugated cardboard, but with asbestos in one or more of the layers of paper       ""Rollboard"" - two sheets of asbestos paper laminated together (using a roller) into a continuous, flexible sheet. Particularly used in office partitions, garage paneling, linings for stoves and electrical boxes, and fireproofing for security boxes, safes, and file storage.     ""Specialty paper"" - for use in filters for beverages and other fluids. Also in cooling towers for liquids from industrial processes and air conditioning systems       ""New uses of asbestos"" - products have not historically contained asbestos at of the start of the regulatory process in 1989      Some other regulations under the Clean Air Act restrict other particular methods of applying asbestos-containing materials.    What are the Categories of Asbestos-Containing Materials?     To qualify as an asbestos-containing material (ACM) under the law, a product must contain more than 1 percent asbestos, either by weight for bulky materials or by area for flat ones. Regulations distinguish between friable ACM (can be reduced to dust by the crushing of hands)  and non-friable ACM (cannot be crushed or damaged so easily).     There are two categories within the group of non-friable ACMs. Category I  distinguishes material that has become friable because of whether,  aging, or  force and can release asbestos fibers into the air. Category II is everything else non-friable. Category II ACMs can also come under regulation if they are cut, sanded, or scraped to the point where they produce dust and presumably airborne asbestos fibers. During the course of renovation or demolition, both of these categories  become ""regulated asbestos-containing materials"" (RACM).     What to Look For   It is not  easy to identify asbestos-containing materials in use. But it is safe to assume  any material of an appropriate age was likely made with asbestos.  To really know if a material contains asbestos, it is best to hire a professional to sample the material in question,  who then sends  collected samples to a laboratory certified by the Environmental Protection Agency for examination. Then an experienced technician uses a polarized microscope to  located asbestos fibers.

In fact, the properties of asbestos were widely hailed as miraculous and this was due to its fire retardant properties and its low cost. Given the name asbestos by the Ancient Greeks, this material was used for many centuries, and continued to be used into the 1980s. However, as more and more evidence came to light in relation to the dangers of asbestos it quickly became of great concern all around the world.           It turns out that although the Ancient Greeks praised the versatility and fire proof properties of asbestos, they also noted the harm that this substance had done to workers. However, despite these records asbestos continued to be used throughout the years. This flexible and soft material was used in all sorts of items from insulation, one of its most popular uses, to floor and ceiling tiles, piping, and even a range of household and auto products.      During the industrial revolution, asbestos became widely used for insulation purposes thanks to its cost effectiveness and fire proof qualities. This was despite the fact that many people in the asbestos industry – management and company owners – were all too aware of the dangers of asbestos. Despite this knowledge, workers were allowed to obliviously continue working with this potentially deadly substance, unaware that many of them were slowly killing themselves by breathing in the dust and fibers from the substance.     It was not until the 1900s that the facts regarding the risks involved to workers began to re-emerge. An English physician carried out a post-mortem on a man who had worked with asbestos for many years, and he found traces of fibers and dust in the man’s lungs. The doctor stated that the man had died due to his exposure to this mineral. Over the next 20 or so years professionals in many countries began to notice the fact that disease, illness and death was uncommonly high among asbestos workers.     In the mid 1920s, an English doctor made the first diagnosis of asbestosis, and this was followed by a study, which showed that 25% of English asbestos workers showed signs of a related lung disease. Laws were then stepped up in England to provide better ventilation and more protection to workers who were regularly exposed to asbestos. These steps were slowly followed by other countries over the next decade.      One of the diseases for which asbestos is particularly well known is mesothelioma, which is a deadly form of cancer caused by asbestos fibers and dust being ingested or breathed in. This form of cancer can take up to several decades to manifest, which means that people that worked with asbestos in the 1960s, 70s and 80s could be walking around with this cancer festering but may not find out that they have it for some years.      Despite the evidence with regards to the dangers and hazards of working with asbestos, many people find themselves exposed to this substance as an occupational hazard. Although there are strict regulations in place in the USA and many other countries with regards to protection for those working with asbestos, many other countries do not have such regulations in place, endangering the lives of many people unnecessarily.      Over recent years, many asbestos companies and related companies have been sued by those that have fallen victim to the hazards of asbestos. In many cases this was because the victims had been allowed to continue working with asbestos despite the fact that companies were all too aware of the dangers of the material. As a result many asbestos and related companies have found themselves facing multi-million dollar suits, and many have gone bankrupt altogether through asbestos litigation.

Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)                   Symptoms, Thoughts and Behaviors, and Treatment                                                                                                     It’s normal, on occasion, to go back and double-check that the iron is unplugged                   or your car is locked. But in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), obsessive thoughts                   and compulsive behaviors become so excessive that they interfere with daily life. And                   no matter what you do, you can’t seem to shake them.                    If you or someone you love has obsessive-compulsive disorder, you may feel isolated                   and helpless, but there is help available. Many treatments and self-help strategies                   can reduce the symptoms of OCD.

John’s story                     John is a 42-year-old accountant whose obsessive “checking” behaviors                     are gradually taking up more and more of his time. He spends at least an hour every                     morning checking and rechecking that the windows are latched, the security alarm                     is set, and the front door is locked. At work, John goes over his clients’ books                     again and again, out of fear that he’s missed something or made a mathematical                     error. Consequently, his productivity has plummeted. Lately, John has also started                     to worry about his wife’s safety, calling her every three hours to see if she’s                     okay. He’s afraid that if he misses a call, something bad will happen to her.                                      Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is an anxiety disorder characterized by uncontrollable,                   unwanted thoughts and repetitive, ritualized behaviors you feel compelled to perform.                   If you have OCD, you probably recognize that your obsessive thoughts and compulsive                   behaviors are irrational – but even so, you feel unable to resist them and break                   free.                   Like a needle getting stuck on an old record, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)                   causes the brain to get stuck on a particular thought or urge. For example, you may                   check the stove twenty times to make sure it’s really turned off, you’re                   your hands until they’re scrubbed raw, or drive around for hours to make sure                   that the bump you heard while driving wasn’t a person you ran over.                    Understanding obsessions and compulsions                   Obsessions  are involuntary, seemingly uncontrollable thoughts, images, or                   impulses that occur over and over again in your mind. You don’t want to have                   these ideas – in fact, you know that they don’t make any sense. But you                   can’t stop them. Unfortunately, these obsessive thoughts are usually disturbing                   and distracting.                     Compulsions  are behaviors or rituals that you feel driven to act out again                   and again. Usually, compulsions are performed in an attempt to make obsessions go away.                   For example, if you’re afraid of contamination, you might develop elaborate cleaning                   rituals. However, the relief never lasts. In fact, the obsessive thoughts usually come                   back stronger. And the compulsive behaviors often end up causing anxiety themselves                   as they become more demanding and time-consuming.                    Most people with obsessive-compulsive disorder fall into one of the following categories:                                         Washers  are afraid of contamination. They usually have cleaning                     or hand-washing compulsions.                       Checkers  repeatedly check things (oven turned off, door locked,                     etc.) that they associate with harm or danger.                       Doubters and sinners  are afraid that if everything isn’t                     perfect or done just right something terrible will happen or they will be punished.                       Counters and arrangers  are obsessed with order and symmetry.                     They may have superstitions about certain numbers, colors, or arrangements.                        Hoarders  fear that something bad will happen if they throw anything                     away. They compulsively hoard things that they don’t need or use.                                                           Just because you have obsessive thoughts or perform compulsive behaviors                       does NOT mean that you have obsessive-compulsive disorder.  Many people                       have mild obsessions or compulsions that are strange or irrational, but they’re                       still able to lead their lives without much disruption. But with obsessive-compulsive                       disorder, these thoughts and behaviors cause tremendous distress, take up a lot                       of time, and interfere with your daily routine, job, or relationships.                                     Signs and symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)                   Most people with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) have both obsessions and compulsions,                   but some people experience just one or the other. The symptoms of OCD may wax and wane                   over time. Often, the symptoms get worse in times of stress.                   Common obsessive thoughts in OCD include:                                        Fear of being contaminated by germs or dirt or contaminating others                      Fear of causing harm to yourself or others                       Intrusive sexually explicit or violent thoughts and images                       Excessive focus on religious or moral ideas                       Fear of losing or not having things you might need                       Order and symmetry: the idea that everything must line up “just right.”                      Superstitions; excessive attention to something considered lucky or unlucky                                     Common compulsive behaviors in OCD include:                                        Excessive double-checking of things, such as locks, appliances, and switches.                       Repeatedly checking in on loved ones to make sure they’re safe.                      Counting, tapping, repeating certain words, or doing other senseless things to                     reduce anxiety.                       Spending a lot of time washing or cleaning.                       Ordering, evening out, or arranging things “just so.”                      Praying excessively or engaging in rituals triggered by religious fear.                       Accumulating “junk” such as old newspapers, magazines, and empty food                     containers, or other things you don’t have a use for.                                                         Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms in children                     While the onset of obsessive-compulsive disorder usually occurs during adolescence                     or young adulthood, younger children sometimes have symptoms that look like OCD.                     However, the symptoms of other disorders, such as ADD, autism, and Tourette’s                     syndrome can also look like obsessive-compulsive disorder, so a thorough medical                     and psychological exam is essential before any diagnosis is made. It’s also                     important to note that OCD is an anxiety disorder, and in children, the symptoms                     of anxiety usually change over time. So a child with OCD symptoms will not necessarily                     have OCD as an adult. What’s most important is to make environmental and behavioral                     changes to reduce your child’s anxiety.                                      Therapy for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)                   There are many effective treatments for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), ranging                   from therapy to self-help and medication. However, the treatment for OCD with the most                   research supporting its effectiveness is cognitive-behavioral therapy.                   Cognitive-behavioral therapy for obsessive-compulsive disorder involves two components:                                        Exposure and response prevention                       Cognitive therapy                                     Exposure and response prevention for OCD                   Exposure and response prevention  involves repeated exposure to the source                   of your obsession. Then you are asked to refrain from the compulsive behavior you’d                   usually perform to reduce your anxiety.                    For example, if you are a compulsive hand washer, you might be asked to touch the                   door handle in a public restroom and then be prevented from washing up. As you sit                   with the anxiety, the urge to wash your hands will gradually begin to go away on its                   own. In this way, you learn that you don’t need the ritual to get rid of your                   anxiety – that you have some control over your obsessive thoughts and compulsive                   behaviors.                   Studies show that exposure and response prevention can actually “retrain” the                   brain, permanently reducing the occurrence of obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms.                   This type of OCD therapy can even extinguish compulsive behaviors entirely.                   Cognitive therapy for OCD                   The  cognitive therapy  component   for obsessive-compulsive disorder                   (OCD) focuses on the catastrophic thoughts and exaggerated sense of responsibility                   you feel. A big part of cognitive therapy for OCD is teaching you healthy and effective                   ways of responding to obsessive thoughts, without resorting to compulsive behavior.                                       Four Steps for Conquering Obsessive Thoughts and Compulsive Urges                     Psychiatrist Jeffrey Schwartz, author of  Brain Lock: Free Yourself from Obsessive-Compulsive                       Behavior , offers the following four steps for dealing with OCD:                                             RELABEL  – Recognize that the intrusive obsessive thoughts                       and urges are the RESulT OF OCD.                         REATTRIBUTE  – Realize that the intensity and intrusiveness                       of the thought or urge is CAUSED BY OCD; it is probably related to a biochemical                       imbalance in the brain.                         REFOCUS  –   Work around the OCD thoughts by focusing                       your attention on something else, at least for a few minutes: DO ANOTHER BEHAVIOR.                         REVALUE  –   Do not take the OCD thought at face value.                       It Is not significant in itself.                                         Source:  Westwood Institute                         for Anxiety Disorders                                     Other treatments for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)                   In addition to cognitive-behavioral therapy, the following treatments are also used                   for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD):                                         Medication  –   Antidepressants are sometimes used in                     conjunction with therapy for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder. However,                     medication alone is rarely effective in relieving the symptoms of OCD.                        Family Therapy  – Because OCD often causes problems in family                     life and social adjustment, family therapy is often advised. Family therapy promotes                     understanding of the disorder and can help reduce family conflicts. It can also motivate                     family members and teach them how to help their loved one.                       Group Therapy  – Group therapy is another helpful obsessive-compulsive                     disorder treatment. Through interaction with fellow OCD sufferers, group therapy                     provides support and encouragement and decreases feelings of isolation.                                                         Getting                     therapy for anxiety                     Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is an anxiety disorder, so many of the therapies                     that are used for other types of anxiety are also helpful when it comes to OCD.

Self-help for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)                    If you have obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), you can help yourself in many ways.                   Educating yourself about the disorder is a vital first step. It’s also important                   to practice the cognitive-behavioral techniques you’ve learned from therapy on                   your own. Renowned OCD researcher Jeffrey Schwartz emphasizes the importance of self-treatment                   on a day-to-day basis.                    Dealing with and obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors:                                         Educate yourself.  Learn everything you can about OCD. Read books                     on the disorder and talk to your therapist and doctor. The more you know, the better                     able you will be to manage your symptoms. You can find many books about OCD at local                     or online bookstores.                        Practice the skills you’ve learned in therapy.  Using the                     skills you’ve learned in therapy, actively work toward eliminating your obsessions                     and compulsive behaviors. This is a challenge that requires commitment and daily                     practice.                       Stay connected to family and friends.  Obsessions and compulsions                     can consume your life to the point of social isolation. In turn, social isolation                     can aggravate your OCD. It’s important to have a network of family and friends                     you can turn to for help and support. Involving others in your treatment can help                     guard against setbacks and keep you motivated.                       Join an OCD support group.  You’re not alone in your struggle                     with OCD, and participating in a support group is an effective reminder of that.                     In a support group, you can share your experience and learn from others who are going                     through the same thing you are.

Meditation, yoga, deep breathing,                     and other stress relief techniques may help reduce the symptoms of anxiety brought                     on by OCD. Mindfulness meditation may be particularly helpful to OCD sufferers.

Helping a loved one with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)                   If your friend or family member has OCD, your most important job is to educate yourself                   about the disorder. Learn everything you can about the disorder and make sure your                   loved one has access to information about it as well. Share what you’ve learned                   with your friend or family member and let them know there is help available. Simply                   knowing the condition is treatable may provide enough motivation to get them into a                   therapist’s office.                                       How to Relate to Your Family Member with OCD                                             View your relative’s obsessive-compulsive behaviors as symptoms,                         not character flaws.  Remember that your relative is a person with a                         disorder, but who is healthy and able in many other ways. Focus on the whole                         person.                          Do not allow OCD to take over family life.  As much as possible,                       keep stress low and family life normal.                         Do not participate in your relative’s rituals.  If you                       have helped with rituals in the past, it may take time and practice to change this                       pattern. In order for people with OCD to make progress, family and friends must                       resist helping with ritual behaviors. Supporting the rituals, including reassurance                       rituals, hinders progress.                          Communicate positively, directly and clearly . State what you                       want to happen, rather than criticizing your relative for past behaviors. Avoiding                       personal criticism can help your relative feel accepted while he or she is making                       difficult changes.                          Mix humor with caring.  Support doesn’t always have to                       be serious. People with OCD know how absurd their fears are. They can often see                       the funny side of their symptoms, as long as the humor does not feel disrespectful.                       Family members say that humor can often help their relative become more detached                       from symptoms.                                         Source:  Centre                       for Addiction and Mental Health                                     The way you react to your loved one’s OCD symptoms has a big impact. Negative                   comments or criticism can make OCD worse, while a calm, supportive environment can                   help improve the outcome of treatment. There’s no point in scolding someone with                   OCD or telling the person to stop performing rituals. They can’t comply, and                   the pressure to stop will only make the behaviors worse. The best way to help a loved                   one cope with OCD is to be as kind and patient as possible.

Increase Font Size               Print Article                                 Asbestos refers to a group of six naturally occurring fibrous minerals. Three of the six types of asbestos were once widely used in the United States for the strength and durability of their fibers. The federal government began strictly regulating asbestos in the mid-1970s after discovering that the mineral caused serious health problems, including  asbestosis  and  mesothelioma  .    Asbestos becomes dangerous when the fibers are released into the air and inhaled or ingested in high concentrations over a prolonged period of time. Individuals face the risk of inhaling or ingesting airborne fibers when asbestos-containing products are worn down, disturbed, or damaged.    Millions of American workers have been exposed to asbestos since the 1940s when its use peaked in the United States. While certain occupations are known to increase the risk for asbestos exposure, there are also a number of non-occupational asbestos exposure risks.    Occupational Asbestos Exposure Risk    Many people are exposed to  asbestos at work . The following are some of the occupational environments that may increase an individual's asbestos exposure risk:      Construction sites   Asbestos product manufacturing sites   Oil refineries   Mines   Shipyards   Steel mills   Power plants   Automotive manufacturing facilities   Offshore rust removal sites   Railroads   Maritime operation sites   Demolition sites    Non-Occupational Asbestos Exposure Risk    Not all asbestos exposure occurs in the workplace. The following are a few non-occupational asbestos exposure risks:      Asbestos-contaminated drinking water   Asbestos products  including talc and various older appliances   Vermiculite-containing garden products such as certain fertilizers and pesticides     Another asbestos exposure risk is called  paraoccupational exposure  and occurs when an individual is exposed to asbestos through a family member who works around the dangerous fibers. Workers heavily exposed to asbestos may bring the hazardous fibers into the home on their shoes, clothing, skin, and hair.  Family members  or others who live in the same home face an increased asbestos exposure risk.    If you have a heightened asbestos exposure risk, you may wish to consult with a physician experienced in the evaluation and management of asbestos-related diseases.    You may also wish to speak with a qualified asbestos attorney if you have developed mesothelioma or similar asbestos-related disease.
