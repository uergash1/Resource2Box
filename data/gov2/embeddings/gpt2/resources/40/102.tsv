GX261-04-5042896	"13th National Veterans Golden Age Games Tuesday, August 10, 1999  Peter Cassullo: Ninety-two and Still Roaring By Lori Nuce ""Roaring Lions,"" the team from the Lyons, N.J., VA Medical Center, is competing for the first time in this year 's Games, and they brought with them Peter th Cassullo, 92 -- the oldest participant at the 13 National Veterans Golden Age Games. Born in Costeggio, Italy, Cassullo considers himself to be an American-Italian. He traveled to the United States in 1910 with his family, aboard the Kanopic (the Kanopic was a ship of the White Star Line, which is infamous for the Titanic). Cassullo's father was a miller in Italy until the town's river overflowed and destroyed his father 's mill. The family then came to America to buy a mill, with plans to soon return to Italy. The family even left Cassullo's oldest sister in Italy to attend to the family's affairs. Unfortunately, WWI began and the family did not return. In fact, Cassullo only saw his sister once after the family left. Unable to return to their homeland, the Cassullo family settled in Westside, N.Y. Cassullo worked in an office for a few years, and then on a dairy and grain farm for five years in Pittstown, N.J. He was drafted into the Army in 1942, and trained with the th 36 Division at Ft. McClellan, Alabama. He recalled that he was drafted in September of that year, when he was 36 years old. However, he turned 37 in December, making him too old for combat duty, so he was reclassified as limited serth vice. This allowed him to be transferred to the 112 General Hospital in England as a driver for the motor pool. Even though Cassullo was unable to be part of a combat unit, he was wounded in the service nonetheless -- his right leg was injured when an ambulance hit him and he had to spend three months in the hospital.As a driver, he transported several Colonels while in the Army, but one in particular stands out in his memory. ""There was one that liked to make speeches,"" said Cassullo. ""I'd listen to him and when he would raise his voice, I'd go out to the car and come back [when he was done] and tell him how great his speech was."" After his time in the Army, Cassullo married Kay Johnson and spent the next 25 years as a longshoreman. His wife has since passed away, but the twinkle is still in his eye when he speaks of the woman he loved for so many years. Cassullo also has fond memories of his older brother and how he trained horses for the Cavalry in WWI. Cassullo has been a patient at the Lyons VAMC for almost three years. He goes to therapy three times a week and rides the bicycle, among other things, to keep in shape. When asked how he maintains his youthful appearance, he said with a laugh, ""I'm just lucky."" He does like to keep his mind active by playing Scrabble with his fellow veterans at the VA medical center. Assisting Cassullo and the seven other veterans that comprise the ""Roaring Lions"" are coaches Judi Panzano, Toni Ann Pattman, Angie FreemanTalmadge and John Santello. Cassullo said that the coaches ""do a very good job and work hard."" Panzano said that the veterans have been training for the Games once a week since April. When asked his impressions about the Golden Age Games, Cassullo said, ""They are taking good care of us here and we are honored."" He hopes to be able to come back again next year. He has been unable to locate any of his buddies th from the 112 General Hospital from England. If anyone was assigned to this hospital from 1942 to 1945, stop by and meet with Cassullo. He has a wonderful sense of humor, and always has a smile on his face. You'll be amazed that this gentleman is 92 years young!   Attention Athletes ALL WHEELCHAIR ATHLETES: Please try to arrive at the Scandling dining hall 15 minutes early for lunch and dinner (10:45 a.m. for lunch, and 4:45 p.m. for dinner) each day.

You've heard from the novices, now let's hear from athletes who have participated in the Games for at least five years. We asked some of them, ""What is your favorite memory from the Golden Age Games?"" And this is what they had to say: ""The Golden Age Games have helped me get my life together. I came to the VA homeless, and now I have my own apartment. The Games helped me change my attitude toward life. Now, I volunteer daily in a nursing home. I love all the Games but especially the one in Lyle, Illinois, in 1994. It was my second Games-- the fellowship and participation was just great."" - James Tyree, 61, Martinsburg, WVa. ""It was the opportunity of a lifetime and one of my greatest experiences...being able to participate in the pentathlon at the Games in Johnson City, Tennessee, in 1993. The excitement was so great when I won a Gold medal for five events!"" - Houston Brumit, 77, Denison, Texas ""We were in Lyle, Illinois, in 1994. This was the first and only time Archery was offered as an event in the Golden Age Games competition. I won the gold medal and got a two-foot-high trophy. I lit up like a Christmas Tree!"" - Lawrence Tate, 67, South Holland, Ill. ""I have been to ten Games in a row. The one in St. Petersburg, Florida, in 1991 is where I met my buddy Lawrence Tate, and we have been friends ever since. Thirty-one veterans from 31 states sent me Christmas cards this past year. That's the type of camaraderie that we end up with after the events. We become a family; we have a lot in common."" - Clair ""Scotty"" Otis, 66, Pentwater, Mich. ""In 1992, Ann Arbor, Michigan, was my first and most memorable Golden Age Games. I was so impressed when I saw the people performing to the best of their limits. It became an incentive to me to do well, since I was only 55 years old at the time. It is a very gratifying experience. I intend to do the Games until I die.

GX269-07-10913534	15 January 2004 Governor Tim Pawlenty, State of Minnesota Commissioner Dan McElroy, Department of Finance Dan McElroy, Chair Stadium Screening Committee It gives me great pleasure to submit this proposal for the Star of the North Stadium Complex, a combined Baseball  Football facility. I look forward to an opportunity for a personal presentation to you and the distinguished members of the Stadium Screening Committee on 20 January. Thank you. Respectfully,  Richard G. Wolfgramm 807 Osceola Avenue Saint Paul, Minnesota 55105-3329   STA I NTRODUCTION  R OF THE  NORTH STADIUM CO  MPLEX  We should not build stadiums because teams threaten to leave town. We should build stadiums because they are civic structures, like theaters, libraries, performing arts centers and universities. We should build stadiums because, properly designed, they are a community asset, reflecting a public purpose and our values as participants and competitors in the larger world. NARR  ATIVE DESCRIPTION  Certain key concepts drive the development of this design for a sports-complex: We should build two stadiums to be used by three primary tenants (the Minnesota Twins, the Minnesota Vikings and the Minnesota Gophers. The two stadiums should be built on a single site, creating a destination for additional users and minimizing the cost of infrastructure improvements. The two stadiums should be built with one movable roof, capable of being slid from one venue to the other. The two stadiums should be built now to take advantage of the forty-year low of interest rates. The twin stadiums should be built on the Saint Paul campus of the University of Minnesota. The University should own the stadiums and it would share in revenues generated by leases to professional sports teams. The University of Minnesota is the most beloved institution in the State. It could benefit enormously by participating in a development that addresses its own needs as well as the needs of professional teams.   I.  SIT  E IZE  1. LOCATION/S  The location of the proposed site is 50 acres, out of several hundred acres of land, currently used for agricultural research on the Saint Paul campus of the University of Minnesota. The campus is in Falcon Heights, adjacent to the State Fair. The Midway area is in the geographic center of the Twin Cities Metropolitan region. This location will help quell the political rhetoric, eliminate the animosity between two cities, and end the wasteful spending of planning departments in two municipalities that has characterized and plagued development for years. At some time in the future the University's agricultural research fields will be relocated to a 7,000-acre site in Rosemount. Agricultural research is no longer viable in an urban area. A baseball stadium large enough to accommodate 42,000 seats on four levels (Lower Deck, Suite Level, Club Level and Upper Deck), expandable to 45,000 seats should be built. A majority of the seats will be along the 1st and 3rd base lines. The design will include 60 private suites; 12 group party suites; 4,000 Club seats, and accessible seating for 800; requirements outlined by the team. With concourses, restroom areas, concession areas, restaurants, etc., the design will be compatible with the requirements of the Minnesota Twins as outlined in a recent presentation to the Screening Committee. Additional design features and elements are outlined below in Item #6: Nature of Combined Facilities. 2. AC  CESSIBILITY  This site is equally accessible from the East and West Metro areas, and from either downtown. The site is north of Interstate I-94, east of Hwy. 280, and south of the intersection of 35W and Hwy. 36. There are currently no improvements scheduled by MnDot. for either Hwy. 280, or Hwy. 36. Long-overdue and necessary improvements to these highways could coincide with the construction of the stadiums and be planned for in the same way roads, bridges and other public infrastructure systems were upgraded for the Mall of America. 3. PARKING/I  NFRASTRUCTURE  There is ample space for surface parking or parking structures adjacent to the stadium. Parking structures would be used for University commuters and as transit terminals.   4. TRA  NSIT  CONNE  CTIONS  Transit is critical to sports due the nature of large crowds coming and going simultaneously and in large groups. Transportation will depend on the integration of several modes. A true inter-modal transit system, to include automobile, conventional transit, PRT, and perhaps LRT, will be required. The Center for Transportation Studies at the University would lead and coordinate the efforts of the Department of Transportation and the Metropolitan Council to develop a transit model for this project. 5. STADIUM RE D  LATED  EVELOPMENT  A stadium complex would become a destination for other events and activities including University sports, professional soccer, outdoor major league hockey games, and high school baseball and football tournaments. The sports complex could be home to many more teams than the Viking's regularly scheduled eight to ten professional football games and the Twin's 81 professional baseball games. The University will be in a position to develop additional sports related curriculum through its medical school, like a sports medicine research program and a sports fitness program for the aging - a growing concern for the boomer generation. Other development in the vicinity of the complex will include a major hotel, 5,000 units of student housing and various retail establishments. 6. COMBINED LOCATIO  N  Combined planning and construction will require phasing of various elements. The Minnesota Twins do not want to delay an opportunity for a new stadium while the Vikings and Gophers are still planning. Not only are the stadiums combined, but the stadium complex also needs to be integrated into the long-range development plans of the University. Academic buildings, student housing, transit systems and plans for openspaces need to be considered jointly. A plan for co-locating the stadiums need not delay the Twins current initiative. The idea of co-locating the baseball and Properly designed, the stadiums can share areas, ticketing areas, mechanical systems, design solution that does not compromise turf, etc. football stadiums offers several advantages. elements like the roof, concourses, training etc. This will make for a more cost-effective other design criteria like sight lines, natural  For purposes of discussion and comparison, Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix serves as the baseball prototype for this proposal. Bank One Ballpark was designed by Ellerbe-Becket Architects for the Arizona Diamondbacks. (Ellerbe-Becket Architects of Minneapolis was originally founded by Tom Ellerbe of Saint Paul.)   Bank One Ballpark is unique in that the orientation of the field is perpendicular to the orientation of the building. The long axis of the field from home plate to center field is perpendicular to the long axis of the building shell and roof structure. Putting a ballpark into a building with a fixed roof is a little bit like putting a round peg into a square hole. Compromises are made; the building becomes obsolete. Putting a ballpark into a building with a retractable roof is both difficult and extremely costly while a movable roof (accommodating two stadiums built side by side) is doable and far less expensive. The football stadium for the Vikings and the Gophers will be designed to meet the requirements of both teams. The Vikings want seating for 68,500 expandable to 72,000. The Gophers want seating for 50,000 expandable to 80,000. A stadium for 70,000 expandable to 80,000 is realistic. A stadium with a movable roof, as described above, will allow for games in all seasons and in all weather. A stadium with a movable roof will allow for aerial television shots from the Monday Night Football blimp and for dramatic outdoor fireworks displays after a victory. This design will have no compromise for the fans or the players.   II.  FINANCING ES AND  1. SOURC  USES  Financing will be provided through a combination of private business contributions and bonds issued pursuant to the laws of the State of Minnesota with such authorizations for revenue safeguards as the Minnesota State Legislature shall deem appropriate. 2. PRIV ATE INVESTMENT  Private contributions will be in the form of required individual and corporate contributions from the leagues and professional sports team owners. 3. PUBLIC I  NVESTMENT  Public investment will be through bonds issued by the State of Minnesota. The prevailing interest rates are the lowest in 40 years and create an opportunity for cost savings to the public. Financing may also involve dedicated revenue streams such as prepaid rent, naming rights, and concessions from end users of the facility. The Saint Paul campus of the University of Minnesota is efficient for taxpayers who will not have to build other University stadiums at significant cost to the public. This plan allows the University to have modern state-of-the-art facilities on a shared basis with professional teams without the burden of placing a `full faith and credit' obligation against that institution. Another advantage of one-site planning is the cost efficiency of providing utilities and roads, many of which can be planned for as if for a single tenant. 4. O M  WNERSHIP AND  ANAGEMENT  Owner: Manager: III.  The University of Minnesota The Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission COMMUNITY SUPPORT  LOCAL G  OVERNMENT AND  Neither the University of Minnesota nor the City of Falcon Heights have been approached regarding this proposal.   CONC  LUSION  :  Stadiums must have an overriding PUBLIC PURPOSE, a notion that is absolutely essential to the success of this effort. PUBLIC PURPOSE is the ingredient that has been missing from previous discussions. It is a key element of the largest public-private partnership in the State of Minnesota. This proposal changes the conversation. This proposal illustrates a plan that can capture the passion that people have for sports and can include our residents, taxpayers and voting public as stakeholders in the process, a true civic venture.

The                Skate Park has been constructed at the northwest corner of the Jerome                Smith Road Parking Lot.  April 7, 2003 Annual Town                Meeting voters approved $50,000 for this project, which has been                a priority for the Recreation Commission and the Board of Selectmen.                The skate park creates a recreational outlet for an extremely popular                sport, and will relieve the hazards and congestion caused by skaters                on Commercial Street. The skate park's cost of $89,670 includes                $74,670 for ramps, jumps, rails, wedges, quarter pipes, spines and                fun boxes, plus $15,000 for paving, fencing, signage and contingencies.                     The Recreation Commission is raising                $40,000 for this project through private donations.                  On October 22, 2001, the Board of Selectmen                voted, pursuant to MGL Chapter 44, section 53A, to establish a ""Skate                Park Gift Fund"" with the balance in said fund to be expended                without further appropriation by the Board of Selectmen for expenses                associated with a skate park.

GX107-41-12488652	"STATEMENT OF PAUL TAGLIABUE COMMISSIONER OF THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE BEFORE THE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  February 6, 1996                   STATEMENT OF PAUL TAGLIABUE            Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, I appreciate your invitation and the opportunity to address the legal and business uncertainties that continue to face professional sports leagues, the communities in which they operate, and sports fans across America.            In many respects, those uncertainties are more profound - and more troubling - today than they were over a decade ago, when the Judiciary Committee last considered whether the internal decisions of a professional sports league including a league's decision on where to locate its teams - should be treated for antitrust purposes as a ""contract, combination or conspiracy"" among independent economic competitors.  Since that time, professional sports leagues have continued to be subject to antitrust concepts that, ignoring economic reality, ultimately undermine the public interest.  Without a clarification of the governing antitrust principles by judicial decision or congressional action, that situation is bound to continue.                  Current Conditions In Professional Sports            Today there is a widespread perception - and sometimes deep concern - that professional sports involve unprecedented levels of financial stress and conflict, often reflected in complicated court battles or other dizzying legal disputes.  The controversies include impasses as to planned or proposed new stadiums; concerns about ""bidding wars"" pitting community against community or ""franchise hopping"" in the location and relocation of teams; prolonged conflicts (including work stoppages) between leagues and their players' unions; and a steady    2 - diet of sports, business, and legal debate on related issues, all of which are of intense interest to fans and the public at large.            While the specific aspects of the stadium and team location controversies often differ by state or region, a number of considerations, in one measure or another, are generally involved in the mix.            First, there are obvious and significant differences in the size and characteristics of the communities or ""markets"" in which a league's teams operate.  These produce significant differences in revenue potential among teams, no matter how well they are managed.  In addition, at any given time, about one-half of a league's teams have below average won-loss records and are therefore vulnerable to declines in fan interest. (This requires a league structure that assures the stability of all teams even when they are in a losing cycle.) The differences in individual team revenue potentials are affected - and often aggravated - by changes in larger economic circumstances ( M.., demographic changes, shifts of population, changes in industrial activity, plant closures, or ""down-sizing"").  Nonetheless, and despite differing market conditions and team revenue levels, in order to provide an attractive entertainment product, the members of a professional sports league must compete on the field with a reasonable degree of comparability or equality of opportunity.            Second, in the NFL there have been dramatic changes in the past three years in the terms and conditions of player employment.  These changes resulted from player-sponsored antitrust litigation that challenged collectively-bargained limitations on ""free agency"" and player movement.  The new provisions include a   3 -  costly, League-wide commitment to revenue sharing with the players through their union and extensive, unrestricted Vee agency"" for veteran players.  While this collectively- bargained agreement has brought ""labor peace"" to the NFL, these new operating conditions are presenting the NFL's teams, particularly those with average or below-average local revenues, with unprecedented and severe financial challenges.            Third, there has been a steady increase in the number of professional sports franchises operating in the various leagues throughout the United States.  There is vigorous competition for the interest and spending of consumers on sports and entertainment generally.  This competition is often intensified in particular markets by new teams, by the construction of new facilities with attractive fan amenities, and by other such factors.  I will address this issue in more detail below.            Fourth, many of the professional baseball and football stadiums throughout the United States were constructed as dual-purpose stadiums during the 1960s when the nation witnessed an explosion of interest in professional sports. (During that time, for example, the American Football League emerged and, with the endorsement of Congress in 1966, ultimately merged with the NFL.  The number of professional football teams therefore increased from 12 in 1959 to 26 in 1970.) Now, many of those stadiums are in need of extensive renovation or replacement.            Fifth, there have been significant changes over the decades in federal, state and local policies with respect to the use of tax receipts or tax exempt bonds in the financing of public facilities, including sports stadiums.  These changes include   4 -  the use of other sources of public funding, such as lotteries, for stadiums and the privatizing of stadium construction costs in some communities through various additional charges to fans in the form of seat ""premiums"" or ""licenses."" In addition, the occasional use of public funds on a selective or preferential basis for new stadiums or arenas in one sport has aggravated conditions for competing franchises that lack new facilities.   Finally, confusion, inconsistency, and uncertainty about federal antitrust standards as they apply to the location and relocation of sports teams continue to be a major problem.  Coupled with the vagaries of venue as a factor in the outcome of civil litigation, this circumstance has left both sports leagues and communities seeking to retain such teams with difficult choices and little predictability in assessing the likely outcomes of aftemative courses of action.   Because of the direct bearing of this latter issue on your inquiry, I will address it at some length below, followed by a discussion of the intense economic competition for the sports and entertainment dollar.                    The Team Relocation Antitrust Issue  A professional sports league is an unusual business entity because it creates and markets a single, jointly produced entertainment ""product."" The National Football League, for example, produces athletic competition among 30 separately owned clubs, none of which can produce and present that product on its own.  The NFL's sports entertainment product competes in the marketplace with other sports    5 -  leagues, each of which also creates a single, jointly-produced product, and with other entertainment producers of all kinds.            To encourage strong local ties and operations, and in an effort to ensure the integrity of their competitive performances on the playing field, each NFL franchise is held by separate ownership.  A League franchise, however, entails a formal commitment to all other member clubs to operate in a particular home location, defined as ""the city in which such club is located and for which R holds a franchise and plays its home games . . ."" Under the League's Constitution and By- Laws, the relocation of a team requires a three-fourth's vote of the League's membership.            A review of the NFL's operations over the past forty years demonstrates the League's firm commitment to competitive and geographic balance in the location of its franchises, to franchise stability, and to the protection of fan and community interests.  Compelling evidence of that commitment is reflected, among other places, in the League's revenue sharing policies, which enable the League to conduct team operations on a nation-wide scale and in communities of vastly differing economic potential.            Approximately 55 percent of the revenues of the average NFL club today come from thejoint presentation of NFL games on national television networks both broadcast and cable.  These revenues are shared equally among all clubs   6 -  without regard to each club's market size or revenue potential.-!' As a result of the sharing of these and other revenues (including, for example, game receipts that are shared with visiting clubs), the economic advantages of the clubs in the bettersituated markets are balanced, albeit not always fully offset, by revenue sharing with the clubs in smaller communities (such as Minnesota, Green Bay, Buffalo, Kansas City, Cincinnati, and New Orleans) or less well- situated markets.            In the past decade, the NFL's member clubs have modified and focused their revenue-sharing policies to support new stadium construction and renovation.  By deciding to waive a portion of the game receipts that otherwise would be shared by visiting clubs, all League clubs effectively contribute to the payment of stadium construction (or related financing) costs.  Through this mechanism, the League's member clubs have collectively supported the construction of new stadiums in a number of communities (g_%, Atlanta, Miami).  The clubs are also collectively supporting the extensive renovation of existing stadiums-in a number of communities, including Buffalo, New Orleans, and San Diego.            In this context, an internal decision of a professional sports league whether it relates to funding stadium construction or determining where to locate its franchises - bears no resemblance whatsoever to a ""contract, combination or conspiracy"" among independent economic competitors that provides a coherent basis for applying the antitrust laws.  V There is a short-term exception for the League's two new expansion franchises, the Carolina Panthers and the Jacksonville Jaguars.    7 -            The Judiciary Committee's consideration of this issue in the 1980s was prompted by the Raiders litig ation against the NFL, in which a federal court determined that Section 1 of the Sherman Act should apply to such internal league decisions.  In that case, a Los Angeles jury found that the NFL had acted ""unreasonably"" in reciprocating the loyalty of Oakland fans (reflected in twelve consecutive sell-out seasons) and denying the Raiders permission to move the Oakland NFL franchise to Los Angeles.  As a result of that decision, the Raiders were allowed, over the NFL's objection, to abandon Oakland; and a new weapon ""antitrust brinkmanship"" - was introduced into the relationship between sports leagues and the communities that they represent.            Prior to the Raiders litigation, a sports league franchise was viewed as a license to serve the leaoue's fans and to play leacque games in a prescribed geographical area.  A franchise was the means by which the league created a stable, continuous relationship with a community, subject to change only by league decision, ordinarily through a supra- majority vote.            This stable franchise concept reflected the courts' recognition that, in determining the location of a league's franchises, league members ""are not competitors in the economic sense ... They are, in fact, all members of a single unit competing as such with other similar professional leagues.""-' Not coinci-91     San Francisco Seals, Ltd. v. National Hockey Lenue, 379 F. Supp. 966, 96970 (C.D. Cal. 1974) (rejecting on summary judgment antitrust challenge to the NHL's denial of the Seals' request to move its NHL franchise from San Francisco to Vancouver).    8 -  Incidentally, prior to the Raiders decision, NFL clubs had been committed to and stable in their home territories for decades.            Since the Raiders decision, federal courts, seeing the Raiders precedent, have failed to recognize (and potential litigants have elected to ignore) the economic reality of a sports league - that league members are co-producers of a joint product, and thus together constitute a single league enterprise in competition with other entertainment providers.  Instead, courts and others have tended to raise form over substance, viewing each team franchise as an independent competitive entity that is portable and transient without regard to Rs commitments as a member of the league enterprise, the needs and preferences of the league, or the interests of the league's fans.            As a result, some clubs - all of which had agreed to be bound by the league's internal procedures for determining franchise location - have been persuaded to abandon their commitments to the league and their fans, and unilaterally to move the league's operations to a new location.  If a league seeks to enforce its contractual rights against such moves, it faces substantial antitrust risks, notwithstanding that every other business enterprise in America can decide without antitrust exposure where to conduct its operations.            The antitrust weapon has been claimed not only by clubs that seek greener pastures elsewhere; it has also been brandished by governmental agencies (including state attorneys general), stadium landlords (who assert that they compete in a ""market' for club tenants), and former club owners as well.  All such parties   9 -  purport to find a basis in the Raiders experience to threaten antitrust litigation to influence or prevent the League's exercise of Rs business judgment - for or against - a proposed franchise move.            These threats necessarily affect League decisionmaking.  Regardless of Rs merits, each such threat raises the specter of burdensome, divisive, and costly litigation, similar to the Raiders case in the 1980s, that inevitably takes years to resolve.  If such a suit is successful in establishing financial injury - a possibility that exists especially when the issues are litigated before a ""home-town"" jury (as in the Raiders case) - each plaintiff automatically receives Punitive damages, three times the ""injury"" that the jury believes has been proved.            The National Football League has experienced such threats numerous times over the last ten or twelve years, and it has paid the price, in litigation expenses and/or settlements, on several occasions.  In an effort to keep the Raiders in Oakland, during the 1980s the NFL spent almost $50 million in legal fees and in ultimate settlement of the antitrust judgment.  Ironically, the Raiders and the City of Oakland are currently suing the League for hundreds of millions of dollars because of the League's alleged refusal to allow the Raiders - the Oakland Raiders, as of September 1995 - to return from Los Angeles to Oakland in 1994.  The Raiders sued the NFL in the 1980s, claiming that the League was holding the club ""hostage"" in Oakland; now the Raiders are suing the NFL for holding the club ""hostage"" in Los Angeles and delaying its return to Oakland.   10-            The recent Raiders' lawsuit, moreover, involves a situation where the club never sought - and the League therefore never held - a vote on the proposed 1994 move.  Similarly, a former owner of the New England Patriots, even though he also never submitted a relocation proposal to the League, has filed an antitrust suit against the NFL claiming that the League diminished the value of the Patriots franchise by prevent ing him from moving the club out of New England in the early 1990s. (in separate lawsuits pending in Boston, New York and Philadelphia, three former owners of the Patriots are now suing the NFL for ""antitrust"" grievances, each allegedly arising from a Merent internal League rule or policy.)            Last year, the Rams and the City of St. Louis used the threat of antitrust litigation to force the NFL to acquiesce in the Rams' move from Southern California to St. Louis.  By a vote of the League's members, the NFL initially rejected the proposed move based in part on a report that 1, as Commissioner, filed with the membership finding that the proposed move did not satisfy the specific criteria of the League's guidelines for franchise relocation.  The League's initial decision was immediately met with public and private threats - by the Rams and by the State's Attorney General - to seek ""billions"" of dollars in antitrust damages from the NFL in suits to be filed in St. Louis.            As a result, the membership eventually reversed its initial decision and reluctantly voted to permit the Rams to move.  Even though we believed that we should have prevailed in any lawsuit, the NFL members were unwilling to endure years of antitrust litigation in a St. Louis court - not to mention the punitive nature  of any errant treble damage judgment - in order to enforce their contractual right to require the Rams to remain in Los Angeles.  In short, the League's judgment was understandably influenced by a preference for antitrust peace rather than war, especially in light of the legal conflicts that had recently plagued other sports and have been negatively viewed by millions of fans.            Even though the League allowed the Rams to move, St. Louis sued anyway.  Their complaint, filed in St. Louis by the St. Louis Convention and Visitors Center, alleges that our franchise relocation rules violate the antitrust laws.  That suit demonstrates that, in the absence of legislation, exploitation of the antitrust weapon against professional sports leagues will continue regardless of how the League resolves any particular franchise relocation issue.            Finally, after the League met for the first time to discuss the Browns' proposed relocation, the Maryland Stadium Authority sued the League in Baltimore, claiming in effect that our failure to vote on the proposal at that first meeting constituted a violation of the antitrust laws.  Where will this sort of litigation end?  And what public interest does R serve?            Now we face the prospect of additional team moves, with the earlier moves being viewed as indications that a League vote carries an unacceptable antitrust risk, or as ""precedents"" justifying additional moves, or as establishing a requirement of ""equal treatment"" enforceable with the threat of treble damage claims.  In the absence of legislation addressing the application of the antitrust laws in these circumstances, the NFL's ability to exercise Rs business judgment with regard to   12 -  these and other moves will inevitably be colored by the specter of antitrust litigation, threats of which have already surfaced.            In 1984, reviewing the trial court decision favoring the Raiders, a federal court of appeals suggested changes supposedly designed to enable the NFL's rules and procedures governing franchise relocation - and the NFL's reliance upon those rules - to pass muster under the antitrust ""rule of reason."" The NFL adopted the court's suggestions, as well as a set of objective business criteria for evaluating proposed franchise moves in the future.  A copy of those procedures and criteria is attached.            Despite these provisions, misguided treatment of league members as independent economic competitors continues to confuse the antitrust analysis and to make any league decision susceptible to being characterized as an unreasonable restraint on 'competition"" Thus, we know that if we rely on those criteria to bar a proposed franchise move, the NFL can be involved for years in expensive and internally divisive antitrust litigation.  The dispute would likely be litigated in an interested forum, as was the Raiders' case; and the potential damage exposure associated with a jury's second- guessing of the League's internal decision could be astronomical.  Regardless of our confidence in the 12roprig& of a decision barring a proposed move, the prospect of such litigation can understandably have a chilling influence on a league's willingness to enforce Ks contractual rights.   13 -  The Economic Issues           A key factor driving clubs to seek to construct new stadiums or to renovate existing stadiums, with more favorable stadium financial terms, is intense competition for the sports and entertainment dollar.           Such competition exists in all American cities having major league sports franchises.  In Cleveland, for example, the Browns compete with the baseball Indians and the basketball Cavaliers not only for fan support, but also for business and other support.  In 1994, when the Browns' baseball and basketball counterparts received attractive new facilities built with major investment of public funds - Jacobs Field and Gund Arena - the Browns were not simply faced with intensified competition for fan interest; the Browns lost significant existing revenue streams.  For example, a substantial proportion of the Browns' suite-holders cancelled their leases at Memorial Stadium, which was built in 1931, in favor of suites in the city's brand new, fan-friendly facilities built for the baseball and basketball teams.  The following data, reprinted from materials recently submitted to the NFL by the Browns, illustrate the point.   14 -   LOGE OCCUPANCY RATE AT CLEVELAND SPORTS FACILITIES                                        Total                  Facility            Number       1993      19941995                   Gund Arena              92                   9292                                                           (100%)(100%)                   Jacobs Field           133                  133133                                                           (100%)(100%)                   Cleveland Stadium      108        108        8283                                                 (100%)     (76%)(78%)    The new baseball and basketball facilities in Cleveland also intensify  the competition for potential sources of new revenues for the Browns,  including advertising and naming rights, to identify just two examples.   Similar competitive factors are now at work - or will soon exist - in  Phoenix and Seattle, among other NFL cities.  Furthermore, in many American cities, there is substantial competition for dollars available to fund the community's participation in the public- private partnerships necessary to replace or renovate aging facilities.  Cleveland again provides an excellent example.  That community invested $175 million to build Jacobs Field and $152 million to build Gund Arena (as well as $92 million to build the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame); the funds necessary to complete proposed renovations of Memorial Stadium (or to construct a replacement stadium) will have to be developed from many of the same public and private sources.   Thus, it is not surprising that despite extraordinary fan loyalty and support - a factor that weighs heavily in our analysis of the League's interests with respect to any relocation proposal - competition on a variety of fronts has caused   15 -  the Browns (after years of effort in pursuit of a new stadium in Cleveland) to consider - and ultimately to accept - an offer of alternative stadium arrangements in Baltimore.            These are different circumstances from those that existed only a decade ago in many NFL markets.  The Washington Redskins, for example, who play in the League's smallest stadium and who have sought for years to build their own privately financed stadium, are already facing new, intense competition from the MCI Center, the publicly financed, state-of-the-art facility in downtown Washington that will be the new home of Washington's NBA and NHL clubs.  The Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who for years were the only professional sports franchise on Florida's West Coast, today face competition from both an NBA club and the NHL, and will soon compete with a Major League Baseball team, which will play in a publiclyfinanced stadium in St. Petersburg.            This intense competition for the local sports dollar comes at a time when player costs are escalating at an extraordinary rate.  Even with a collectively bargained salary cap, during the League Year just ended, NFL clubs spent more than $1.4 billion on a cash basis on player compensation and benefits, nearly 45 percent more than the amount spent only three years before.  In addition, signing bonuses involving large upfront payments have become an increasingly important element in attracting and retaining free agent player talent in the NFL.  Thus, despite extensive revenue sharing that provides even small-market clubs with a foundation on which to build a team, NFL clubs are now more than ever before dependent on   16 -  the revenues generated by modern stadium facilities in order to field representative and competitive football teams.            In business and economic circumstances such as these, sports leagues face complex and difficult questions that require a balance of multiple interests those of fans in communities with teams, those of fans in communities seeking teams, league interests, and individual club interests - to arrive at sound decisions with respect to the location of league teams.  In the NFL, the League itself has increasingly been involved both with its teams and with public officials in seeking to develop solutions to the stadium and facility challenges that are presented in the current environment.            Whatever the outcome of such efforts and decisions, a sports league cannot function in a responsible and predictable manner - and without a nearly paralyzing stream of actual and threatened antitrust treble damage claims - if its decision-making processes on team location matters continue to be subject to review by antitrust courts and juries under the ""conspiracy"" standards of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.                 A Statutory Approach To The Antitrust Issue            My predecessor Pete Rozelle coined the phrase ""franchise free agency"" in the early 1 980s in predicting the long-term consequences of the Raiders decision.  Yet he was only one of many observers who recognized at an early stage the inappropriateness of treating internal league decisions on franchise relocation as   17 -   ""contracts, combinations, or conspiracies"" subject to the restrictions and penalties of the antitrust laws.            In August 1982, for example, Senator Heflin addressed the Senate Judiciary Committee on this subject.  He began by recognizing that the NFL ""is not composed of economic competitors.  They are engaged in a common business operation."" He made clear that ""[alrititrust policies which permit individual team owners to ignore the league's relationship and act as if they were sole proprietors do not reflect free enterprise principles, and they do not serve the public interest."" Senator Heflin concluded that ""league agreements voluntarily entered into by league members should be enforced according to their terms"" and not subjected to the antitrust laws.            In June 1985, the then-Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, Charles F. Rule, testified on the same subject.  Supporting ""an antitrust exemption for league decisions to block franchise relocations,"" he urged on behalf of the Department of Justice that ""a league's franchise relocation rule should be deemed per se lawful unless it adversely affects competition with other leagues or is merely a subterfuge to disguise some other egregious anticompetitive conduct.""            Indeed, over forty years ago, in the first in-depth antitrust analysis of the nature.of a professional sports league, United States District Judge Allen K. Grim explained that the traditional premises for application of the antitrust laws do not apply to the internal decisions of professional sports leagues.  He recognized that   18 -  clubs in a professional sports league are not independent business competitors, and that treating them as if they were would lead to ""first, the creation of greater and greater inequalities in the strength of the teams; second, the weaker teams being driven out of business; and third, the destruction of the entire League.'@-' He concluded:            The League is truly a unique business enterprise, which is           entitled to protect Ks very existence by agreeing to           reasonable restrictions on its member clubs.1'            In the following quarter century, numerous jurists and           distinguished           academics concurred.  Chief Justice Rehnquist, for example,           observed:            The NFL owners are joint venturers who produce a product, professional football, which competes with other sports and other forms of entertainment in the entertainment marketplace.  Although individual NFL teams compete on the playing field, they rarely compete in the marketplace ... [OrdinarilyJ the league competes as a unit against other forms of entertainments'  Similarly, Judge Robert Bork has recognized:            Some activities can only be carried out jointly.  Perhaps           the leading example is league sports.  When a league of           professional lacrosse teams is formed, it would be           pointless to declare their cooperation illegal on the           United States v. National Football League, 116 F. Supp. 319,      324 (E.D. Pa. 1953).  A/    Id. at 326.  ki North American Soccer League v. National Football Leagge, 459 U.S. 1074, 1077 (1982) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari).    19-   ground that there are not other professional lacrosse teamsY            Notwithstanding these thoughtful views, when Congress considered these issues in the early- and mid-1980s, it was not accepted that the Raiders decision - which departed from the principles recognized by Chief Justice Rehnquist, Senator Heflin, Judge Bork, and the Department of Justice - would undermine the relationship between professional sports leagues and the communities that they represent.  The Raiders, of course, had moved from Oakland to Los Angeles.  And the Colts had moved from Baltimore to Indianapolis at a time when the NFL - engrossed in litigation with the Raiders - felt powerless to stop them.  But to some in Congress, these moves appeared to be isolated and unrelated to any general or enduring antitrust anomalies that would affect league operations.  The need to correct the anomalous consequences of the Raiders decision therefore did not lead to legislation at that time.            Today, however, there is an ample proof demonstrating that uncertainty over this narrow antitrust issue has had a substantial and deleterious effect.  Congress now has an opportunity - and an ample record - to address this problem and to end the antitrust brinkmanship that (1) impedes a professional sports league's ability to make rational internal decisions and reasonable business judgments about its own affairs and (2) subjects communities to the vagaries of individual team   Robert Bork, The Antitrust Paradox 278 (1978).   20 -  decisions on the next best stadium offer without regard to a league's enforceable evaluation and decision on the proposed move.            Such legislation - to treat sports leagues as a single enterprise for internal decisions on such matters as franchise relocation - would not freeze the status quo.  It simply would allow a sports league to exercise its reasonable business judgment without the threat of antitrust treble damage litigation and, in doing so, to take appropriate account of community interests and fan loyalties.            PROCEDURES FOR PROPOSED FRANCHISE RELOCATIONS     Article 8.5 of the NFL Constitution and Bylaws vests in the  Commissioner the authority to 'interpret and from time to time  establish policy and procedure in respect to the provisions of the  Constitution and Bylaws and any enforcement thereof."" Set forth  below are procedures and policy to apply to League consideration,  pursuant to Section 4.3 of the Constitution and Bylaws, of any  proposed transfer of a home territory.  These provisions were  established in December of 1984 and remain in effect.   Section 4.3 requires prior approval by the affirmative vote of  three-fourths of the member clubs of the League (the normal voting  margin for League business) before a club may transfer its  franchise or playing site to a different city either within or  outside its home territory.  While the following provisions apply  by their terms to a proposed transfer to a different home  territory, a transfer of a club's playing site to a different  location within its home territory may also raise issues of League-  wide significance.  Accordingly, the preAnnual Meeting notification  date prescribed in section (A) (1) below also applies to a proposed  intra-territory relocation, and the Commissioner may require that  some or all of the following procedures be followed with respect to  such a move.  A.   Notice and Evaluation of the Proposed Transfer   Before any club may transfer its franchise or playing site outside  its current home territory, the club must submit a proposal for  such transfer to the League on the following basis:  1    A club proposing a transfer outside its home territory must      give written notice of the proposed transfer to the      Commissioner no later than 30 days prior to the opening date of      the Annual Meeting in the year in which the club proposes to      commence play in a new location.  Such notice will be      accompanied by a "" statement of reasons"" in support of the      proposed transfer that will include the information outlined in      Part B below.  2.   The Commissioner will, with the assistance of appropriate      League committees, evaluate the proposed transfer and report to      the membership; if possible, he will do so within 20 days of      his receipt of the club's notice and accompanying ustatement of      reasons.' The Commissioner may also convene a special committee      to perform factfinding or other functions with respect to any      such proposed transfer.  3.   Following the Commissioner's report on the proposed transfer,      the transfer will be presented to the membership for action      in accordance with the Constitution and Bylaws, either at a      Special Meeting of the League held for that purpose or at the      Annual Meeting.  S. ""Statement of Reasons"" for the Proposed Transfer     Any club proposing a transfer outside its home territory must,    in its accompanying ""statement of reasons,"" furnish information    to the Commissioner essential to consideration of whether such    a move is justified and whether it is in the League's interest.     In this connection, the club proposing to transfer must present    in writing its views to why its recent financial experience    would support a relocation of the club.  Such information would    include a comparison of the club's home revenues with League    averages and medians; past and projected ticket sales and other    stadium revenues at both the existing and proposed locations;    and operating profits or losses during the most recent four    seasons.  The club should also comment on any other factors it    regards as relevant to the League's consideration of the    proposed transfer, including but not limited to operations of    other professional or college sports in the existing and    proposed home territories, and the effects of the proposed    transfer on NFL scheduling patterns, travel requirements,    current divisional alignments, traditional rivalries, League-    wide television patterns and interests, the quality of stadium    facilities, and fan and public perceptions of the NFL and its    member clubs.     To permit such a review, at least the following information    will accompany the ""statement of reasons"" for the proposed    transfer:  1  A copy of the club's existing stadium lease and any other    agreements relating to the club's use of its current stadium    (e.g., concession agreements, box suite agreements, scoreboard    advertising agreements) or to a stadium authority's or    municipality's provision of related facilities (e.g., practice    facilities).  2. Audited financial statements for the club for the fiscal years    covering the preceding four seasons.  3. An assessment of the suitability of the club's existing stadium,    costs of and prospects for making any desired improvements to the    stadium, and the status of efforts to negotiate such improvements    with the stadium authority.  4. A description and financial analysis of the projected lease and    operating terms available to the club in its proposed new    location.  5. A description and financial analysis of the stadium lease and    operating terms available to the club in its existing home    territory, on a basis that permits comparison with the projected    arrangements in the proposed new location.  6. A budget projection, using accepted League charts of account,    showing a projected profit and loss statement for the fiscal    years covering the first three seasons in the proposed new    location.    C. Factors to be Considered in Evaluating the Proposed Transfer     While the League has analyzed many factors in making expansion    and team-move decisions in the past, the Commissioner will also    give consideration to the factors listed below, among others,    in reporting to the membership on any proposed transfer outside    a home territory.  Such factors were contained in a bill    reported by a Senate committee in 1984; they essentially    restate matters that the League has considered vital in    connection with team location decisions in the past.     Accordingly, any club proposing to transfer should, in its    submission to the Commissioner's office, present the club's    position as to the bearing of these factors on its proposed    transfer, stating specifically why such a move is regarded as    justified on these standards:  1 .   The adequacy of the stadium in which the team played its home    games in the previous season, and the willingness of the stadium    or arena authority to remedy any deficiencies in such facility;  2. The extent to which fan loyalty to and support for the team has    been demonstrated during the team's tenure in the existing    community;  3. The extent to which the team, directly or indirectly, received    public financial support by means of any publicly financed    playing facility, special tax treatment and any other form of    public financial support;  4. The degree to which the ownership or management of the team has    contributed to any circumstance which might otherwise demonstrate    the need for such relocation;  5. Whether the team has incurred net operating losses, exclusive of    depreciation and amortization, sufficient to threaten the    continued financial viability of the team;  6. The degree to which the team has engaged in good faith    negotiations with appropriate persons concerning terms and    conditions under which the team would continue to play its games    in such community or elsewhere within its current home territory;  7. Whether any other team in the League is located in the community    in which the team is currently located;  8. Whether the team proposes to relocate to a community in which no    other team in the League is located; and        9. Whether the stadium authority, if public, is not opposed to     such relocation.  Any club proposing to transfer will have a full opportunity to state its position to the membership and to make its case for the proposed transfer.  In order to fully assess a proposed transfer in light of the variety of League interests involved, and to fairly resolve the interests of all parties, it is essential that the membership be fully apprised of the relevant facts with respect to any proposed transfer.  The procedures and policies outlined above are directed to that end.       Judiciary Homepage"

GX239-10-7128046	"July 10, 1996   ADVISORY NOTICE NO. 14   SUBJECT: EVENTS, TOURNAMENTS OR CONTESTS   TO:  All retail and wholesale licensees and manufacturers    Section 5.32 of the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board Regulations [40 Pa. Code 5.32], which formerly prohibited events, tournaments, contests and the awarding of prizes on licensed premises, has been amended effective May 11, 1996.  Hotels, restaurants, clubs, privately-owned public golf courses, privately-owned private golf courses, municipal golf courses, brew pubs, and malt beverage eating place retail dispensers may now conduct self-sponsored (paid for  and  carried out by the licensee) events, tournaments and contests.  A copy of section 5.32 is included with this advisory notice.    The holding of events, tournaments and contests may often involve elements of gambling.  The easing of restrictions on events, tournaments and contests does not permit any form of unlawful gambling.  Inquiries concerning gambling laws should be addressed to state and local police or the District Attorney where the licensed premises is located.  The following questions and answers should further your understanding of this regulatory change:     Who other than the above licensees can sponsor events, tournaments and contests on licensed premises?  Can distributors or manufacturers be sponsors at retail establishments?    The regulation specifically restricts sponsorship to bona fide charitable organizations, governing bodies of certain sports (golf, skiing, tennis, bowling and pocket billiards), and the State Athletic Commission.  Other classes of licenses and non-licensee sponsors are not included under the amended regulation.  If any other entity desires to participate with the licensee in sponsoring events, tournaments or contests, it is strongly recommended that a request be submitted for the Board's review and for the issuance of a legal opinion pursuant to section 211.1 of the Liquor Code as to sponsorship permissibility.  [47 P.S. 2-211.1].  It should be noted that distributors and importing distributors are not prohibited from holding events, tournaments or contests on their  own  premises.    May distributors, importing distributors or manufacturers provide prizes to retail licensees to award in the retail licensees' self-sponsored events?    No, because the prize must be paid for by the retail licensee to constitute self-sponsorship.  Moreover, section 13.51(a) of the Board's regulations prohibits licensees from directly or indirectly contributing to or accepting from licensees of a different class anything of value by means of advertisement, contributions, purchase, sale of tickets, donations, or by any device, for any purpose.  [40 Pa. Code 13.51(a)].    Are drawings for prizes that are conducted by the retail licensee legal?    Yes, but once again licensees are cautioned concerning unlawful gambling.  Three elements are necessary to constitute gambling; they are:   consideration ,  chance  and  reward .  For example, playing cards for money is not permitted if players have to pay to compete.  However, a self-sponsored (paid for  and  carried out by the licensee) drawing, where no consideration is paid by participants in order to enter would be permitted.   Is it permissible for retail licensees to award prizes to video game contestants?    Yes, provided it is a competitive endeavor between players who are not required to pay in order to compete.  It should be noted that many video poker machines and all slot machines not classified as antiques are considered ""gambling devices per se.""  The mere possession of these devices constitutes a gambling violation.  However, ""games,"" defined in section 5.30 of the regulations, are permitted on the premises, where payment is required to play, as long as players can only win free plays.    What are the limits on the value of prizes?    Golf, skiing, tennis, bowling, pocket billiards, as well as events sanctioned by the State Athletic Commission have no prize value restrictions.  Moreover, those organizations that hold a bingo and/or small games of chance license/permit  and  are eligible to conduct events, tournaments and contests as set forth in this regulation are subject to the prize limitations of the Local Option Small Games of Chance Act [10 P.S. 311-327] and/or the Bingo Law [10 P.S. 301-308.1].  All other permitted sponsors have a $500 limit for any event, tournament or contest and the total value of all prizes awarded in any seven-day period may not exceed $5,000.    Does the amended regulation affect retail licensees' participation in manufacturers' sweepstakes?    No.  Retail licensees may continue to permit their premises to be used as a drop-off and pick-up point for manufacturers' sweepstakes, but not for conducting a drawing or the awarding of sweepstakes prizes.    Is it permissible to conduct a ""Wet T-Shirt contest"" on licensed premises?    Yes, however, particular attention should be paid to the Board's regulation prohibiting lewd, immoral or improper conduct by the licensee, its servants, agents, employees, patrons or  event ,  contest  or  tournament   participants .  [40 Pa. Code 5.32(f)(1)].    Are chugging or drinking contests allowed?    No.  The Board's regulations prohibit an event, contest or tournament which involves the consumption of alcoholic beverages by an event, tournament or contest participant.  [40 Pa. Code 5.32(f)(3)].  In addition, it is illegal to award alcoholic beverages as a prize.    May a charge for admission to an event, tournament or contest be assessed?    Yes.  A cover charge is permitted unless it is for admission to an event involving chance and reward.  In addition, the price of a ticket or evidence of admission to an event, tournament or contest may not include a charge for alcoholic beverages, or entitle the holder thereof to receive an alcoholic beverage.  Furthermore, a ticket purchased in order to gain admission to an event, tournament or contest may not be used in a drawing for door prizes.    Does the regulatory change involve any additional record keeping for participating licensees?     Yes.  Licensees must maintain an itemized list of all prizes awarded, their value, and the name and address of the recipient on the licensed premises for a period of two years from the date of the event.

GX018-74-12365691	General History   Naming of the Stadium   Memorable Moments        General History  August 20, 1967 - the San Diego Chargers take the field to play their first game in the  newly completed San Diego Stadium.  Formerly the Los Angeles Chargers, owner Barron  Hilton had been convinced by local sports writer Jack Murphy to move his team from the  LA Coliseum to San Diego.  Unfortunately, San Diego had no major league Stadium  when the team moved here in 1961.  Thus, Murphy's next challenge was to convince the  City to build a stadium for their team.  This was accomplished when Proposition 1 passed  by a wide margin and $27.75 million was authorized to build a new state-of-the-art multi- purpose stadium with 53,000 seats.   In 1984, the Stadium was expanded to nearly 61,000 and 50 suites added at cost of $9.1 million. In 1997 a major expansion costing $78 million was undertaken with the following taking place: 10,500 seats were added bringing the total seating capacity to 71,500; 34 suites added for a total of 113; Club Level seating added with 4 lounges; upgraded food service; two new video screens and a practice facility for the Chargers.      Naming of the Stadium  The original name of the Stadium was San Diego Stadium when Jack Murphy died on  September 24, 1980 then Mayor Pete Wilson and the City Council voted to rename the  Stadium San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium.  Some citizens were opposed to naming the  Stadium after Jack Murphy and in 1984 the issue was put before the voters.  The voters  approved leaving the name San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium.     Once again in 1997, the name changed.  QUALCOMM a local San Diego  Telecommunication Company agreed to pay the City $18 million to complete the  expansion project.  In return the name of the Stadium change to QUALCOMM Stadium.

The festival is a free event that is held September 6,  2003 and benifits Breast Cancer Awareness. Because there is no fee for the actual festival we depend on corporate sponsors and donations to put the festival on. This year we are doing our part by putting on a show at the Patchogue Theatre June 25th 2003 whereby all the  proceeds will go to fund the All American Music Festival for Breast Cancer Awareness. The show is going to be one Kick Butt show .. On the bill is:  1. The Legendary MNB3 - The legend continues in this extreamly rare appearance of this band  2. Kerry Kearney - Long Island's Top slide guitar players has toured with The Allman Brothers band and with the Dicky Betts Band. For this appearance he is going to have as a special guest Mr. Michael Falzarano from Hot Tuna playing with him. This promises to be one hell of a great set by one of Long Island Top guitar players!  3. Phil Grande - Hot hot hot is they only way to describe Phil's performance. Which is why Joe Cockers had Phil as his guitar player for so many years! Phil Grande is going to show you just why he is consider  one of the hottest guitar players on the east coast!  4. JPBlues - JP just got back from playing the Dogwood Festival in  Georgia and you have got to see this 14 year old blues guitar player rip into that guitar!  5. Sam Taylor - Headling the show is Long Island's own blues legend and Hall of famer, Mr. Sam Taylor. Sam has played with almost everyone from Sam and Dave to Big Bill Broonzy. Albert Collins to Otis Redding. To see Sam perform is more than just great show it's an unbeliveable experiance!  6. Peter Bales - Our Master of Ceremonies - Has long been recognized  as one of Long Island's Top comedic talents. Peter is definately going to  keep the show moving and the audiance in stitches.  7. Paul Bond - His work on HBO, Comedy Central with the likes of Jim  Brewer and other great comics has made him one of the hottest comics on the circuit today. Paul recently has had some things in the workings that is going to make this new young comic one of the hottest acts around.  You won't  want to miss him now when you can say I saw him when!  Think about it .. Here you will have a show with 4 GREAT Bands, 2 GREAT Comics and a special appreance by JPBlues the 14 year old blues guitar prodgy. AND ..

Which dimension would that be? I'm not sure what you're referring to. When we first announced the formation of the BNLMC in the Bulletin and when you first subscribed to the BNLMC mailing list, Sept, 2001, the message read:  ""The BNL Music Club is looking for musicians to participate in weekly improvisational workshops. Musical styles will include blues, folk, jazz, bluegrass and rock. Acoustic instruments are preferred.""   Except for electrified solid body basses, all the jams that I've attended have been acoustic. I still prefer to play acoustic and don't use a ""gramophone"" to hear my guitar. Acoustic is preferred but an instrument whose sound is to soft to be heard among the others can use a little ""sound reinforcement"". The idea is to play ""ensemble"" rather than compete for volume. I realize the acoustic piano is a good 9 to 12 db above the acoustic guitars but that's something we work around for now. When BNLMC members like yourself can find a suitable ""permanent"" rehearsal space we can use a more controllable electric piano through a small S/R system.  >  is there a site for everyone else?   The site I designed  IS  for everyone, at BNL or outside BNL, interested in what the BNLMC is doing. You are always welcome to email me and request a link from the BNLMC to your webpage or to design and post a webpage of your own.    I do hope I've addressed your two questions fully. If you have some ideas to share or solutions offer please come to the next meeting/jam on Tuesday at the Brookhaven Center North Room at noon.

The classification recognizes four basic processes: (1) producing (i.e.,  presenting) events; (2) organizing, managing, and/or promoting events; (3) managing and  representing entertainers; and (4) providing the artistic, creative and technical skills  necessary to the production of these live events. Also, this subsector contains four industries  for performing arts companies. Each is defined on the basis of the particular skills of the  entertainers involved in the presentations.     The industry structure for this subsector makes a clear distinction between performing arts  companies and performing artists (i.e., independent or freelance). Although not unique to arts  and entertainment, freelancing is a particularly important phenomenon in this Performing Arts,  Spectator Sports, and Related Industries subsector. Distinguishing this activity from the  production activity is a meaningful process differentiation. This approach, however, is difficult  to implement in the case of musical groups (i.e., companies) and artists, especially pop groups.  These establishments tend to be more loosely organized and it can be difficult to distinguish  companies from freelancers. For this reason, NAICS includes one industry that covers both musical  groups and musical artists.     This subsector contains two industries for Industry Group 7113, Promoters of Performing Arts,  Sports, and Similar Events, one for those that operate facilities and another for those that do  not. This is because there are significant differences in cost structures between those promoters  that manage and provide the staff to operate facilities and those that do not. In addition to  promoters without facilities, other industries in this subsector include establishments that may  operate without permanent facilities. These types of establishments include: performing arts  companies, musical groups and artists, spectator sports, and independent (i.e., freelance)  artists, writers, and performers.     Excluded from this subsector are nightclubs. Some nightclubs promote live entertainment on a  regular basis and it can be argued that they could be classified in Industry Group 7113,  Promoters of Performing Arts, Sports, and Similar Events. However, since most of these  establishments function as any other drinking place when they do not promote entertainment and  because most of their revenue is derived from sale of food and beverages, they are classified in  Subsector 722, Food Services and Drinking Places.      7111  Performing Arts Companies                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        This industry group comprises establishments primarily engaged in producing live presentations  involving the performances of actors and actresses, singers, dancers, musical groups and artists,  and other performing artists.      71111  Theater Companies and Dinner Theaters                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          See industry description for 711110 below.      711110  Theater Companies and Dinner Theaters                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        This industry comprises (1) companies, groups, or theaters primarily engaged in producing the  following live theatrical presentations: musicals; operas; plays; and comedy, improvisational,  mime, and puppet shows and (2) establishments, commonly known as dinner theaters, engaged in  producing live theatrical productions and in providing food and beverages for consumption on the  premises.

Joe and the Muddy River Band played at the CA BVar-b-que on Fri (in the rain of course) they were great as usual, he's looking for help at this years      Festival, unfortunately it's on the same day as our club bar-b-que...........     Subject: Blues Festival to Raise Money for Breast Cancer Awareness   Fellow Motorcyclist,        My name is Joe Vignola and I'm a member of the BNL Cycletrons Motorcycle Club. You may know about The All American Music Festival for Breast Cancer Awareness. I am representing this organization and asking you if your clubs would be interested in organizing a volunteer recruitment among your membership in support of this great cause.        Last year over 6000 people attended the September Festival and over $10000 was raised for Breast Cancer. Sam Taylor, Kerry Kearney, Lex Gray, Phil Grande, Toby Walker all performed.  The event and the volunteer staff of 40 was fantastic if not over extended. This year we are attempting to recruit 140 volunteers. While we don't expect to get all from your clubs we thought it was be a good population to approach for help. We all live locally and many of us know the affects of cancer, we tend to be supportive of charities and we all are scientific enough to understand the need for breast cancer research.     Volunteers will work only 2-3 hours the day of the event. All volunteers will receive a free event/staff tee shirt and there will be food and drink available too. And of course a great day of music. So  I ask ... can you help, will you consider this request and contact me if (how) we can work together?   thank you, Ride Safe  Joe Vaginal 631 399 4596  promryder at aol.com     -------------- next part -------------- An HTML attachment was scrubbed...

Blues Show   Coming to Westhampton Beach Performing Arts Center  Friday, June 27, 8:00 PM   Westhampton Beach, NY June 2, 2003: South of the Highway Blues continues the celebration of ""The Year of The Blues"" as designated by US Senate proclamation, with the third in a series of 2003 Blues concerts at The Westhampton Beach Performing Arts Center. The ""Are You Experienced?"" Blues Show recognizes Jimi Hendrix's influence on contemporary blues artists during what would have been his 60th year.   This event features Andy Aledort and The Groove Kings. Aledort is an extraordinary guitar player who has performed with Stevie Ray Vaughan, the Allman Brothers, Johnny Winters, and Buddy Guy. He also recorded and performed with Jimi Hendrix's rhythm section, Band of Gypsys, and is producing a series of instructional DVD/Videos with the Hendrix estate.   Seasoned blues performers, Joe Vicino and the Smoke Daddys will also be performing. Vicino delivers scorching guitar work and soulful vocals. Drawing from Jimi Hendrix and the traditional blues sounds of pioneers like Robert Johnson, this band was Long Island's representative in the 2000 International Blues Competition held in Memphis. You can hear them on Netscape Radio (under Electric Blues) along with B.B. King, Buddy Guy, Freddy King and Eric Clapton.   Jessica Starr is a singer songwriter who lights up the stage with a style influenced by Janis Joplin, early Cat Stevens and Heart. This San Francisco Bay area transplant has wowed audiences at The Bitter End, B.B. King's and the Village Underground. Her album ""Rising"" was produced by Bob Matthews (Grateful Dead) and featured players from Huey Lewis & the News, Jefferson Starship and Hot Tuna.   The first two blues shows were rave reviewed sellouts. The show starts at 8pm. There will be door prizes and giveaways, including an electric guitar autographed by the performers. The concert concludes with the series signature all-star jam, with special guest, harmonica virtuoso Frank Latorre and an after party across the street at the Margarita Grille, where ticket holders can enjoy great drink specials. Tickets are $32 and $37. The WHB Performing Arts Center Box Office is open Wednesday through Sunday from 1pm to 6pm. For Tickets call (631) 288-1500.

The festival        which is co-sponsored by the Music City Blues Society, also features Blue        Mother Tupelo, Dave MacKenzie, and James Nixon and the New Imperials. The        event is free and open to the public.           Gray, a Chicago-styled          musician with an instantly recognizable sound, has four nominations in          the 2002 WC Handy Awards in the categories of: Tradtional Blues- Male          Artist of the Year, Blues Instrumentalist- Piano, Comeback Blues Album          of the Year, and Traditional Blues Album of the Year. He's also been honored          with the Big Easy Award in the Blues Category. Still riding high on the          heels of his first solo release Lucky Man (1988), Gray's latest project          Watch Yourself continues his distinctive, Chicago-styled tradition.                    ""This          album (Watch Yourself) could have been released in any of the past five          decades, as a testament to the timelessness of both the music and the          man. There are 10 fine Gray originals, best of which - the slow burners          Cold Chills and Feel Like a Stranger, the rocking, piano-and-slide instrumental          Scratch the Cat, and the cheerfully threatening title tune - are time          capsules, reminders of what blues was before its ""benefactors""          started turning it into a cartoon. The depth of feeling on Watch Yourself          is remarkable,"" writes Jeff Calvin in the November 2001 edition of          Blues Revue.                   Gray's internationally          known talents are probably best remembered by true blues-enthusiasts during          Howlin' Wolf's legendary jam sessions in the 1960's. Tail Dragger, Goin'          Down Slow, You'll Be Mine and Billy Boy Arnold's I Wish You Would are          just a few of the crowns on Gray's musical crown.                    More recently,          Henry received a Grammy nomination for his work on TelArc Records' 1998          release A Tribute to Howlin' Wolf. Also, Mick Jagger and the Rolling Stones          paid homage to Henry by having him play at Jagger's 55th birthday bash          in Paris in '98 along with a few other blues legends.                   During the          last thirty years, Henry has performed at virtually all New Orleans Jazz          Festivals, two Chicago Blues festivals (1987 & 1989), the Montreal          Jazz Fest (1988), nearly every Baton Rouge Blues Festival since its inception,          the San Francisco Blues Festival, Memphis's W.C. Handy Blues Festival,          several Festival Internationals (Lafayette, Louisiana), the Mississippi          Valley Blues Festival, the King Biscuit festival (Helena, Arkansas), and          many other festivals around the United States.                    Blue Mother          Tupelo, recently nominated as Acoustic Blues Act of the Year, in Nashville's          9th Annual Music City Blues Awards & Celebration will represent the          Music City Blues Society at the 18th Annual International Blues Challenge          sponsored by The Blues Foundation. Knoxville's Metropulse readers have          repeatedly nominated the group, who are often compared to Little Feat,          Bonnie Raitt, and Delaney & Bonnie, as ""Best Blues Band"".                   Blues guitarist          Dave MacKenzie, a two-time recipient of the Music City Blues Society's          Acoustic Blues Act of the Year Award, is a regular at the Bourbon Street          Blues & Boogie Bar in Printer's Alley.

Nixon, a native Nashvillian, has played with Jimi Hendirx, Billy Cox,          Bob Diddley, Bobby Bland and Johnny Taylor. His work in the Blues in the          Schools program won him the international Keeping the Blues Alive award          in 2000. He also teaches guitar for the Metro Board of Parks and Recreation's          Cultural Arts Program.

Gahan  To: tg  Sent: Saturday, June 28, 2003 4:25 PM Subject: Blues update     FIFTH  ANNUAL RIVERHEAD BLUES FESTIVAL UPDATE  Long Island's Largest Music Event July 18 - 19 - 20    Many people have inquired about ""what else is there to do"" around Riverhead  during the morning or early afternoon hours of the Blues Festival weekend.   Here's a short list. For more ""stuff around town"" contact the Riverhead  Chamber of Commerce 631-727-7600 for an information package.      For the ""Who's playin' when and where""  list log on www.riverheadblues.com    Hot fun in the summertime . . . Riverhead Town has four beaches, three on  the Long Island Sound and one on Peconic Bay in Jamesport. All are salt  water beaches. Jamesport is probably the best bet if you have little kids.   Showers and a snack bar are available at Jamesport too . All beaches vary  in distance  (10-20  minutes)  from of the Festival site. If you are not a  Riverhead Town resident, a $10 one day parking permit is available at the  beach. For directions and more information contact the Riverhead Recreation  Dept.  631-727-5744.     Catfish Blues' - yep thar's real good reelin' and rockin' in these parts .  Saltwater anglers can catch weakfish, Blues (my favorite !!) and an  occasional fluke off the beaches and public areas. Check with the local  tackle shops, they'll point you to a good spot and what the best bait is at  that time.  If freshwater is your thing, there are champion size pike and  pickerel lurking in the upper Peconic River and some of the best bass  fishing in the state is up river in Calverton's quiet ponds fed by the  Peconic. You do need a NY State fishing licensee for freshwater fishing.  You can get them at Riverhead Town Hall M- F 8:30 - 4 p.m. 631-727-3200 ask  for the Town Clerk's office.     Atlantis Aquarium 631-208-9200 a great way to see the fish after they've  been caught. Great exhibits includes huge shark tank , seals, etc.  A  couple of blocks away from the Main Stage.      Pick up a new pair of Blue Suede Shoes  . . . Tanger Outlet Center  Riverhead is the world's largest outlet store mega -mall.  Something for  everybody. West Main Street just of LIE Exit 72.   1-800-TANGER  4 miles  from the Main Stage.     Suffolk County Historical Museum . . . 300 West Main Rvhd .  Check out  whats' been happenin' in  Suffolk County for the last 300 years. Free  admission, donations accepted 631- 727-2881 Closed Sunday.   Just picture it .. .  Visit the Blue Door Gallery at Flower Alley just off  East Main Street ( next door to Eastenders Coffee House) . Featured during Blues Fest weekend is a Blues art show - how appropriate - say hello to Sandi the gallery owner...      Riverhead is the Suffolk County Seat. You can see the exterior of the  original courthouse on the north side of Main Street just off Roanoke Ave.  The 'holding cell' jail is around back.  The last public hanging in Suffolk  County (that we know of) took place at the intersection of Peconic and Main  Street in 1911. Local legend says that the boards from the original gallows  still sit in the basement of one of the nearby buildings. On Peconic Avenue  is the National Historic Landmark Vail-Leavitt Music Hall constructed in  1881. Edison experimented with 'talkie' picture shows there. Ironically the  Vail -Leavitt went out of business a few years later when it couldn't  complete with the 'talkie' movie theatre built where the parking lot is today between Vail-Leavitt Music Hall and the Suffolk County National Bank Acoustic Stage. (its since been . . .'Tore Down).  Even more ironic - The Vail-Leavitt is now fully restored and will be a featured part of RBF5.       Give Me a Home Where the Buffalo . . . . go north on Roanoke Avenue,   1  1/2  miles north of the Rte 58 traffic circle on the left is Long Island's  only Buffalo ranch, North Quarter Farm.. DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT ATTEMPT to  feed, touch or harass these suckers. They're cute but NASTY varmints.  You're no match for a 3,000 pound pissed off bison. Grazin' in the Grass is  a Gas Baby!       Hear My Train a Comin' . . . Rail Road Museum Griffing Ave at the RR tracks  just north of Main Street. Some very cool vintage choo - choo (cha-boogie)  engines.  Yep, this is within walking distance of the KeySpan Stage  too.631-727-7920. The LIRR station, is a 3 minute walk from the Festival.      'Malted Milk . Star Confectionery (a.k.a. Papa Nick's)  'Crossroads of  Roanoke and East Main. Mellow Down Easy, Homemade 'Nice' Cream. Add a star  if you like real tin ceilings and stained glass.      Farm Stands & Vineyards. Great places to pick up some goodies for later  that evening. Drive in any direction in Riverhead Town and y'all will bump  into one or both.     We're still getting inquiries about available campsites: . . .  Wildwood State Park, Hulse Landing Road Wading River 631929-4314. About 15  minutes to downtown Riverhead. Tent and full hook ups, trailer sites,  showers, food stands, and beach.     Indian Island County Park, Riverhead 631-852-3232. Sites for trailers and  tents, (no hook-ups) 7 minute ride to where the 'Blues is.     Gonna Wait 'Til the Midnight Hour?
