GX230-98-8922913	"BEFORE THE STATE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION OF ThE STATE OF CALIFORNIA  In the Matter of the Appeal of) HOLLOWAY INVESTblENT COMPANY  1 )  Appearances: For Appellant: For Respondent: Richard H. Wise Attorney at Law Kendall E. Kinyon Counsel  O - P-I N I O N This appeal is made pursuant to section 25666 of the Revenue and Taxation Code from the action of the Franchise Tax Board on the protest of Holloway Investment Company against proposed assessments of additional franchise tax in the amounts of $5,900 and $7,146 for the years 1974 and 1975, respectively.  -99-   %peal of Holloway_Investment Cornpan _1--_---11- - The issue is whether respondent properly classified gains realized in 1974 and 1975 on sales of certain Illinois property interests as business income subject to formula apportionment. Appellant is an Illinois corporation which was originally formed by the 13olloway family to make and sell the famous Holloway Milk Duds. The factory and other manufacturing assets of the company were located in Illinois. In 1960 appellant sold its manufacturing facilities and, thereafter, limited its activities to holding and managing investments. Sometime a,fter 1960, but prior to the appeal yearsI appellant moved from Illinois to California. During this time the corporate founder died and his son, Charles Holloway, acquired his father's stock interest. Charles became the president and only full time employee of the corporation. After appellant terminated the candy business, it retained some remnants of its former activity, including two parcel:; of Illinois real property. The basis for the 1974 assessment in issue involves the treatment of a gain from the sale of one of those parcels, a vacant lot which had been used as a parking lot for appellant's factory employees prior to 1960. After the sale of the candy operations in 1960, the lot was retained and leased to a parking lot operator. During 1974 and 1975 appellant was a general or limited partner in five unrelated partnerships. All of the partnerships were involved in either commercial or residential real'estate ventures. Four of the five partnerships owned and operated real property located in California and were acquired after appellant terminated its candy operations and moved to California. Appellant also owned a limited partnership interest in the fifth venture, Market Basket Shopping Center (Market B,ssket). Market Basket owned and operated a small shopping center in Illinois. Appellant had acquired its interest in this partnership in 1959, the year before its sale of the candy operations. In 1975 Market Basket sold its assets and liquidated. The gain realized from the liquidation formed the basis for the 1975 assessment in question. Appellant's other assets included stock, bonds, option contracts, savings certificates and cash deposits. During 1974 and 1975 appellant received income in the form of dividends, interest, rents, partners.hip distributions and gains from the sale or liquidation of property interests. -lOO-  ?   ADeal of Holloway Investment Company _-__-I___ ----_,.-On the theory that it was not engaged, in a single unitary business, appellant reported the gains realized on the 1974 sale of the former parking lot and on the 1975 liquidation of Market Basket as nonbusiness income specifically allocable to their Illinois situs. Respondent determined that appellant was conducting a unitary business regularly engaged in investing in securities, real property and real property partnerships. Accordingly, respondent concluded that the gains realized on the sale of the Illinois real property and the liquidation of the Illinois limited partnership constituted business income subject to formula apportionment. Appellant protested the proposed assessments. After the protest was denied, this appeal was initiated. Since its adoption in 1966, the Uniform Division of Income for Tax Purposes Act (Rev. & Tax. Code, SS 25120-25139) (UDITPA) has provided a comprehensive statutory scheme of apportionment and allocation rules to measure California's share of the income earned by a taxpayer engaged in a multistate or multinational unitary business. UDITPA distinguishes between ""business income,"" which must be apportioned by formula, and ""nonbusiness income,"" which is specifically allocated by situs or commercial domicile. Business income is defined as: income arising from transactions and activity in the regular course of the taxpayer's trade or business and includes income from tangible and intangible property if the acquisition, management, and disposition of the property constitute integral parts of the taxpayer's regular trade or business operations. (Rev. & Tax. Code,  25120, subd. (a).) Nonbusiness income, on the other hand, is defined as ""all income other than business income."" (Rev. & Tax. Code, S 25120, subd. (a).) Before it becomes necessary to consider whether the gains in question constitute business or nonbusiness income, however, we must be able to conclude that appellant's activities constitute a single unitary business under either the three-unities test (Butler Bros. v. McColgan, 17 Cal.2d 664 [ill P.2d 334P(1m)ffd., --I---_ 315 U.S. 501 [86 L.Ed. 9911 (1942)) or the contribution or dependency test (Edison California Stores, Inc. v. McColgan, ..-_.-._-.- 30 Cal.2d Tj_'[183P.2d163r(1947)). 'or our purposes, unless a unitary business exists, there can be -lOl-   Appeal  of  Investment Company Holloway __  no ""business income;"" the income in question would merely be specifically allocated by situs. Respondent's regulations dealing with business and nonbusiness income recognize the necessity for determining that appellant's activities constitute a single integrated economic enterprise by providing, in part: Income of any type or class and from any source is business income if it arises from transactions and activity occurring in the regular course of a trade or business. Accordingly, the critical element in determining whether income is ""business income"" or ""nonbusiness income"" is the identification of the transactions and #activity which are the elements of a particular trade or business. In general all transactions and activities of the taxpayer which are dependent upon or contribute to the operations of the-taxpayer's economic enterprise as a whole constitute the taxpayer's trade or business and will be transactions and activity arising in the regular course of, and will constitute integral parts of, a trade or business. . . . (Cal. Admin. Code;tit. 18, reg. 25120, subd. (a) (art. (Emphasis added.) 2.5))  .  The facts of record in this appeal may be summarized as follows: Prior to the 1960 sale of its manufacturing facilities, appellant was engaged in the single unitary business of manufacturing and selling candy. Appellant""s unitary candy business terminated at, or near, the time the business was sold. Thereafter, appellant retained some of the property related to the manufacturing operation, including the parking lot. Appellant also retained Market Basket, an investment acquired the year before the sale of the candy operation. Finally, over a period of years appellant acquired various other totally unrelated investments which were located or managed from its new corporate home in California. Based upon this record, we cannot conclude that appellant's various investment activities constituted a single unitary investment business, the income from which must be apportioned by formula. We are particularly impressed with the lack of any significant common relationship between any of appellant's various investments. From all that appears in the record, each investment is separate and distinct. In no way do any of appellant's investments contribute to or depend upon any of the other -:102-   Appeal of Holloway Investment Company _  investments for their success or failure. Because of the disparate nature of each of appellant's investments and the lack of any significant common relationship between them, we cannot consider these activities as constituting a single integrated economic unit. '(See Appeal of Unitco, Inc., Cal. St. Bd. of Equal., June 21, 19g3xpeal of Bax mm Company, Cal. St. Bd. of Equal., June 29, 1982; Appeal of Hollywood Film Enterprises, Inc., Cal. St Bd. of Equal., lYarch 31, 1982.) In concluding that the out-of-state activities of a purported unitary business must be related in some concrete way to the in-state activities, the United States Supreme Court recently stated: there [must] be some sharing or exchange of value not capable of precise identification or measurement--beyond the mere flow of funds arising out of a passive investment or a distinct business operation--which renders formula apportionment a reasonable method of taxation. (Container -_----. v. Franchise Tax Board, No. 81-523, slip Corp. OP. at gU.S.S.C. JLz27, 1983).) There simply is no significant ""sharing or exchange of value not capable of precise identification or measurement"" between appellant's various investment activities which would justify a determination that the activities constituted a single unitary business thus rendering formula apportionment a reasonable m,ethod of taxation. Respondent relies on Appeal -of -Capital h S o u t decided January 16, 1973, and Appeal of west Corporation, Isidor Weinstein Investment Co., decided April 6, 1977, PO suppbGYYi_ts position. CzpTeal Southwest is not helpful to respondent because the fact that the taxpayer was engaged in a unitary business was uncontested. In this appeal, appellant has steadfastly denied that it was engaged in a single unitary business. Similarly, Weinstein, a burden of proof case, does not help respondent materially. In that appeal the taxpayer contended that it was not engaged in a unitary business. However, when the taxpayer failed to offer any evidence to substantiate its contention, we held that the taxpayer had failed to disprove respondent's determination that the business was unitary. -103-   gpeal of Holloway Investment  COIItpany  Since we have concluded that appellant is not engaged in a single unitary business, it fol!lows that appellant properly reported the 1974.and 1975 gains from the sale and liquidation of Illinois property as being' specifically allocable to their Illinois situs.  -104-   Appeal of Holloway Investment Company -__--  O -R D E R Pursuant to the views expressed in the opinion of the board on file in this proceeding, and good cause appearing therefor, pursuant to section 25667 of the Revenue and Taxation  IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED,  protest of Holloway Investment Company against proposed  Code, that the action of the Franchise Tax Board on the assessments of additional franchise tax in the amounts of $5,900 and $7,146 for the years 1974 and 1975, respectively, be and the same is hereby reversed.

GX009-20-14160526	"Union Information           Great         News! Now commuters have a real choice about how to get to work. Recent changes to the         Internal Revenue Code make it easier for companies to offer public transportation benefits         to their employees. U.S. employers spend $36 billion annually on employee parking. 1 It is the most common commute benefit offered to employees and the         most common fringe benefit of any kind. It means that the majority of Americans who         commute drive to work  alone  and that is the problem .             Driving to work alone contributes more air         pollution, wastes energy and causes traffic congestion. It is also a luxury that many         Americans cannot afford. For many workers and would-be workers, public transportation is         the vital link. Vice President Gore summed it up quite accurately, ""if you can’t         get to work, you can’t go to work.""            Whether it is the worker who is driving alone or         the would-be worker who can’t afford to drive, this country’s tremendous         investment in public transportation is not being fully used. Now, there are financial         incentives to get more cars off the roads and more commuters into efficient travel         arrangements. The cost of commuting by mass transit is a  "" tax-free ""  employment         benefit.            Commuter Choice = Tax         Free            The  Commuter Choice  benefit             It’s called  Commuter Choice  because         it gives employees an attractive alternative to driving to work alone – a real         choice. Presently, an employer may give up to $65 a month or up to $780 a year, in actual         eligible transportation costs  tax-free  to an employee. Participating employers         lower their FICA and Federal income tax costs. In many areas, state and city income taxes         are reduced as well. The maximum  tax-free  benefit may increase each year based on         increases in the cost of living. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will announce any         annual increase in the eligible  tax-free  amount. In 2002, the maximum  tax-free          benefit allowed will automatically increase to cover actual costs up to $100 per month or         up to $1,200 per year.  Commuter Choice  may be used on public transit buses, trains,         ferries and vanpools.             Not every employer can afford to pay for the full         transportation benefit so the  Commuter Choice  has built-in flexibility. Take a look         at the options.            A Program for Every         Budget           Employer-Paid Benefit Option             Increasingly, employers by agreement with their         unions or as a matter of company policy, are offering the full transit benefit to         employees. When employers pay for the benefit, it boosts employee satisfaction and that         can translate into more satisfied customers. When employers pick up the tab for their         employees, the  Commuter Choice  transit benefit is equivalent to a low cost salary         or wage enhancement because for tax purposes, the benefit is not counted as income for the         employee and the employer is not required to pay FICA taxes on the benefit.           The chart below shows how the Commuter Choice         transportation benefit stacks up against a cash salary increase. Actual savings and tax         avoidance will vary based on the employee’s income tax bracket and actual state         income tax rates:                                     Private Employer costs               Transportation Benefit               Salary Increase               Difference                                       Annual             Benefit               Amount               $780               $780               -0-                                       Employee FICA              Paid @7.65%                -0-               ($59.67)               ($59.67)                                       Fed Income Taxes Paid @             28%               -0-                ($234.00)               ($234.00)                                       State Income               Tax Paid @ 6%               -0-               ($46.80)               ($46.80)                                       Value to Employee               +$780               +$439.53               -$340.47                                 You do the math. If employees were         to receive an equivalent cash salary raise of $780 per year instead of the  tax-free          transit benefit, they would actually end up paying for it, reducing the value of the         benefit by more than 50%. It would take almost $1,300 in taxable salary to yield $780         after taxes.            Employee-Paid Pre-tax Benefit Option            Under this option, since the employer does         not pay for the  Commuter Choice  benefit, the union may ask the employer to         implement the Employee Paid Pre-tax Benefit program outside of the normal negotiation         cycle.            By establishing a pre-tax deduction plan, the         company permits your employees to exchange part of their existing gross income for an         employer-provided transit or vanpool pass. Since bargaining employees fund for the         benefit, they save Federal payroll and income taxes. The amount of the pre-tax deduction         is no longer treated or reported as taxable salary. In many areas, this deduction may also         be free of state or city income tax.            This special transportation pre-tax benefit         program is exempt from complex use restrictions common to cafeteria plans and flexible         spending accounts (FSA). These ""qualified transportation fringe benefits"" are         excluded from cafeteria plans under section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code (Title 26).         The company will not have to write a plan document or obtain IRS approval. So there is         less paperwork. There are no irrevocable elections or forms. A pre-tax program can be         started any time of the year, or enrollment can be limited to certain times of the         year.            While there is a great deal of flexibility in         creating a pre-tax transit benefit program, it is advisable to consult with tax counsel to         determine how your program may affect ceiling or cap limitations on employee-directed tax         deferred retirement accounts, such as 401(k) plans.             Fare Share Benefit Option             The third option is for the employer and employee         to share the costs. That’s why this approach is called the  Fare Share  option.         The employer could subsidize a part of the $65 benefit and allow your employees the option         to pay the balance from pre-tax income. The employer’s contribution will be in         addition to salary or wages. Employers purchase the passes or vouchers, using the         contributions from employer funds and employee salaries, and then distribute them to the         employees.           The best way for your employees to stretch the         value of the amount they are paying, is to arrange for the funds to be taken out of their         paychecks before taxes are applied, as a pre-tax benefit. For example, an employer could         provide any employee who elects to participate in the program a transit pass worth $35 in         addition to his/her regular salary. The employees could use pre-tax income that is         exchanged for a pass for $30, for a total monthly benefit of $65. The company receives an         equivalent deduction from business income taxes for the $35 expense, while employees save         on Federal payroll and income taxes on the $30. The company would also save on payroll         taxes on the $30.            Cash Reimbursement         Restrictions           Cash Reimbursement for transit expenses is         permitted in very limited circumstances. These tax incentives are intended to boost         transit ridership, so cash reimbursement for commuting expense is discouraged. In fact,         the only time an employer can reimburse employees for cash outlay for transit is in areas         where vouchers or bus/rail passes, tokens, farecards, tickets, etc. are not ""readily         available"" to be exchanged for transit media or vanpool services. See IRS rules         governing section 132(f) benefits for a definition of ""readily available."" In         most cases, the employer must provide vouchers or bus/rail passes, tokens, farecards,         tickets, etc., instead of cash reimbursement.            For purposes of illustration, if the employee         commutes on Transit Agency A and the transit agency  only  accepts cash payments,         cash reimbursement up to the $65 limit would be permitted. In areas where such vouchers or         passes do not exist or where the transit agency does not accept vouchers, employees may be         reimbursed for their actual transit and vanpool costs up to the $65 limit. The         reimbursement may be made from corporate funds or pre-tax employee salaries, or a         combination of both.            What’s Covered?           Buses, Trains, Ferries and . . .             Vanpools. Also referred to as ""Commuter         Highway Vehicles"" under IRS rules, vanpools are defined as any highway vehicle that         has seating capacity of at least six adults excluding the driver and meets two         requirements for mileage use. At least 80 percent of the vehicle mileage use must be         reasonably expected to be (1) for transporting employees in connection with travel between         their residences and their place of employment, and (2) on trips during which the number         of employees transported for commuting is, on average, at least one-half of the adult         seating capacity excluding the driver.             The designated employee ""prime member""         (often the driver or the person assigned the parking space) who travels in a vanpool and         uses commercial parking is eligible for the parking benefit (up to $175 per month). At the         same time, the prime member is eligible to receive the vanpool benefit (up to $65 per         month). All other employees commuting in a vanpool who are not the ""prime         member"" are only eligible for the vanpool benefit and not the parking benefit. Only         one person can receive the parking benefit.            The Parking Connection            Those who have to drive to make a connection         to public transportation may be eligible for the parking connection benefit.   In         recent years, residential growth and expansion has occurred away from the downtown urban         areas, making it difficult to rely solely on mass transit.  Commuter Choice  makes it         possible for commuters to enjoy  tax-free  incentives for driving when the automobile         is a part of the commute trip and mass transit is used for the remainder of the trip. For         instance, the eligible parking benefit may be up to $175 per month to pay for parking at a         location from which employees commute by public transportation, such as a park-and-ride         lot, transit station or facility, or vanpool staging area. Employers can pay for the         benefit and receive an equivalent deduction from business income taxes. Your members will         receive the benefit completely free of all Federal payroll and income taxes up to the $175         limit.            Eligible parking costs may be provided as a         direct benefit, a pre-tax deduction, or as a shared expense. The same tax savings, reduced         payroll costs and program flexibility apply to eligible parking expenses.            But We Provide Parking           Cash out and Convert              Many employers provide free or subsidized parking         for employees, making it more economical for the employee to commute by automobile. The         goal of  Commuter Choice  is to make it as economical for employees to use mass         transit. If the employer only provides parking and your employees want to take advantage         of public transportation and other alternatives, a parking "" cash out ""         program may be the appropriate choice. Here, employees may forego parking and cash out the         value of the parking benefit. The value of the parking benefit will be subject to taxes.         However, if up to $65 of the value is converted to  Commuter Choice  transit or         eligible vanpool benefits, the amount converted will not be subject to taxes.            There is no real cost to employers, if they are         leasing parking spaces for employees. They may simply transfer the cost for the parking         space to a direct payment to employees. Should an employee decide to accept the cash value         rather than a  tax-free   Commuter Choice  transit or vanpool benefit, the         amount is treated as additional compensation and s/he also would incur payroll and income         taxes. If the cash out value is greater than $65, employees could accept a  tax-free           Commuter Choice  transit or vanpool benefit and receive the balance in taxable         salary. The employer will have to pay payroll taxes on the taxable portion of the cash out         benefit provided. To offset that cost, the employer could simply lower the cash out amount         by his or her your share of the payroll taxes as follows:                                      Cost of Parking Space               $150                                       Payroll Taxes                  (12)                                       Cash out Offer               $138                                  The employee could apply the         additional compensation towards costs associated with commuting modes that are not         considered qualified transportation fringe benefits, such as walking, bicycling,         carpooling, or rollerblading to work.            Cash out provides an incentive for your employees         to try other commuting alternatives. The tax status of members employees who continue         receiving the parking benefit would not be affected.             2 + 2 = More            The Bottom Line             Commuter Choice  makes sense. It is a great         way to provide workers with a cost-effective, value-added benefit. The changes in the         Internal Revenue Code provide the greatest flexibility to create a program that works for         any organization, any budget and many, many workers.            Commuter Choice . . . It works for workers. It         works for the economy. It works for the environment. It works for the country.            So what are you waiting for? Contact your local         transit provider today to find out how you can take full advantage of the  tax-free   Commuter         Choice  transportation benefit. Remember these options can provide real savings to the         employees you represent.                     1 .

Commuter Choice=Tax Free The Commuter Choice Benefit It's called Commuter Choice because it gives employees an attractive alternative to driving to work alone  a real choice. Presently, an employer may give up to $65 a month or up to $780 a year, in actual eligible transportation costs tax-free to an employee. Participating employers lower their FICA and Federal income tax costs. In many areas, state and city income taxes are reduced as well. The maximum tax-free benefit may increase each year based on increases in the cost of living. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will announce any annual increase in the eligible tax-free amount. In 2002, the maximum tax-free benefit allowed will automatically increase to cover actual costs up to $100 per month or up to $1,200 per year. Commuter Choice may be used on public transit buses, trains, ferries and vanpools. Not every employer can afford to pay for the full transportation benefit so the Commuter Choice has built-in flexibility. Take a look at the options.  Driving to work alone contributes more air pollution, wastes energy and causes traffic congestion. It is also a luxury that many Americans cannot afford. For many workers and would-be workers, public transportation is the vital link. Vice President Gore summed it up quite accurately, ""if you can't get to work, you can't go to work.""  A P r o g r a m f o r E v e ry Budget Employer-Paid Benefit Option Increasingly, employers by agreement with their unions or as a matter of company policy, are offering the full transit benefit to employees. When employers pay for the benefit, it boosts employee satisfaction and that can translate into more satisfied customers. The Commuter Choice transit benefit is equivalent to a low cost salary or wage enhancement because for tax purposes, the benefit is not counted as income for the employee and the employer is not required to pay FICA taxes on the benefit. The chart below shows how the Commuter Choice benefit stacks up against a cash salary increase. Actual savings and tax avoidance will vary based on the employee's income tax bracket and actual state income tax rates: Private Employer costs Annual Benefit Amount Employee FICA Paid @7.65% Fed Income Taxes Paid @ 28% State Income Tax Paid @ 6% Value to Employee Transportation Benefit $780.00 -0-0-0+$780.00 Salary Increase $780.00 ($59.67) ($234.00) ($46.80) +$439.53 Difference  Whether it is the worker who is driving alone or the would-be worker who can't afford to drive, this country's tremendous investment in public transportation is not being fully used. Now, there are financial incentives to get more cars off U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Transit Administration 400 Seventh Street, SW Washington, DC 20590 (202) 366-1698 Fax: (202) 366-7116 www.fta.dot.gov  -0($59.67) ($234.00) ($46.80) -$340.47  the roads and more commuters into efficient travel arrangements. The cost of commuting by mass transit is a ""tax-free"" employment benefit.   If employees were to receive an equivalent cash salary raise of $780 per year instead of the tax-free transit benefit, they would actually end up paying for it, reducing the value of the benefit by more than 50%. It would take almost $1,300 in taxable salary to yield $780 after taxes.  Employee-Paid Pre-tax Benefit Option Under this option, since the employer does not pay for the Commuter Choice benefit, the union may ask the employer to implement the Employee-Paid Pre-tax Benefit program outside of the normal negotiation cycle. By establishing a pre-tax deduction plan, the company permits employees to exchange part of their existing gross income for an employerprovided transit or vanpool pass. Since bargaining employees fund the benefit, they save Federal payroll and income taxes. The amount of the pre-tax deduction is no longer treated or reported as taxable salary. In many areas, this deduction may also be free of state or city income tax. This special transportation pre-tax benefit program is exempt from complex use restrictions common to cafeteria plans and flexible spending accounts (FSA). These ""qualified transportation fringe benefits"" are excluded from cafeteria plans under section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code (Title 26). The company will not have to write a plan document or obtain IRS approval. So there is less paperwork. There are no irrevocable elections or forms. A pre-tax program can be started any time of the year, or enrollment can be limited to certain times of the year. While there is a great deal of flexibility in creating a pre-tax transit benefit program, it is advisable to consult with tax counsel to determine how your program may affect ceiling or cap limitations on employee-directed tax deferred retirement accounts, such as 401(k) plans.  tax income. The employer's contribution will be in addition to salary or wages. Employers purchase the passes and vouchers, using the contributions from employer funds and employee salaries, and then distribute them to the employees. The best way for employees to stretch the value of the amount they are paying, is to arrange for the funds to be taken out of their paychecks before taxes are applied, as a pre-tax benefit. For example, an employer could provide any employee who elects to participate in the program a transit pass worth $35 in addition to his/her regular salary. The employees could use pre-tax income that is exchanged for a pass for $30, for a total monthly benefit of $65. The company receives an equivalent deduction from business income taxes for the $35 expense, while employees save on Federal payroll and income taxes on the $30. The company would also save on payroll taxes on the $30.  member is eligible to receive the vanpool benefit (up to $65 per month). All other employees commuting in a vanpool who are not the ""prime member"" are only eligible for the vanpool benefit and not the parking benefit. Only one person can receive the parking benefit.  on the taxable portion of the cash out benefit provided. To offset that cost, the employer could simply lower the cash out amount by his or her share of the payroll taxes as follows: Cost of Parking Space Payroll Taxes Cash out Offer $150 (12) $138  The Parking Connection Those who have to drive to make a connection to public transportation may be eligible for the parking connection benefit. In recent years, residential growth and expansion has occurred away from the downtown urban areas, making it difficult to rely solely on mass transit. Commuter Choice makes it possible for commuters to enjoy tax-free incentives for driving when the automobile is a part of the commute trip and mass transit is used for the remainder of the trip. For instance, the eligible parking benefit may be up to $175 per month to pay for parking at a location from which employees commute by public transportation, such as a park-and-ride lot, transit station or facility, or vanpool staging area. Employers can pay for the benefit and receive an equivalent deduction from business income taxes. Your members will receive the benefit completely free of all Federal payroll and income taxes up to the $175 limit. Eligible parking costs may be provided as a direct benefit, a pre-tax deduction, or as a shared expense. The same tax savings, reduced payroll costs and program flexibility apply to eligible parking expenses.  The employee could apply the additional compensation towards costs associated with commuting modes that are not considered qualified transportation fringe benefits, such as walking, bicycling, carpooling, or rollerblading to work. Cash out provides an incentive for employees to try other commuting alternatives. The tax status of employees who continue receiving the parking benefit would not be affected.  2 + 2 = More The Bottom Line Commuter Choice makes sense. It is a great way to provide employees with a cost-effective, value-added benefit. The changes in the Internal Revenue Code allow companies the greatest flexibility to create programs that work for employees. Commuter Choice . . . It works for workers. It works for the economy. It works for the environment. It works for the country. So what are you waiting for? Contact your local transit provider today to find out how you can take full advantage of the tax-free Commuter Choice transportation benefit. These options can provide real savings to the employees you represent.  Cash Reimbursement Restrictions Cash Reimbursement for transit expenses is permitted in very limited circumstances. These tax incentives are intended to boost transit ridership, so cash reimbursement for commuting expense is discouraged. In fact, an employer can only reimburse employees for cash outlay for transit in areas where vouchers or bus/rail passes, tokens, farecards, tickets, etc. are not ""readily available"" to be exchanged for transit or vanpool services. See IRS rules governing section 132(f) benefits for a definition of ""readily available."" In most cases, the employer must provide vouchers or bus/rail passes, tokens, farecards, tickets, etc., instead of cash reimbursement. For purposes of illustration, if the employee commutes on Transit Agency A and the agency only accepts cash payments, cash reimbursement up to the $65 limit would be permitted. The reimbursement may be made from corporate funds or pretax employee salaries, or a combination of both.  But We Provide Parking Cash out and Convert Many employers provide free or subsidized parking for employees, making it more economical for the employee to commute by automobile. The goal of Commuter Choice is to make it as economical for employees to use mass transit. If the employer only provides parking and employees want to take advantage of public transportation and other alternatives, a parking ""cash out"" program may be the appropriate choice. Here, employees may forego parking and cash out the value of the parking benefit. The value of the parking benefit will be subject to taxes. However, if up to $65 of the value is converted to Commuter Choice transit or eligible vanpool benefits, the amount converted will not be subject to taxes. There is no real cost to employers, if they are leasing parking spaces for employees. They may simply transfer the cost for the parking space to a direct payment to employees. Should an employee decide to accept the cash value rather than a tax-free Commuter Choice transit or vanpool benefit, the amount is treated as additional compensation and s/he also would incur payroll and income taxes. If the cash out value is greater than $65, employees could accept a tax-free Commuter Choice transit or vanpool benefit and receive the balance in taxable salary. The employer will have to pay payroll taxes  What s Covered ? Buses, Trains, Ferries and . . . Vanpools. Also referred to as ""Commuter Highway Vehicles"" under IRS rules, vanpools are defined as any highway vehicle that has seating capacity of at least six adults excluding the driver and meets two requirements for mileage use. At least 80 percent of the vehicle mileage use must be reasonably expected to be (1) for transporting employees in connection with travel between their residences and their place of employment, and (2) on trips during which the number of employees transported for commuting is, on average, at least one-half of the adult seating capacity excluding the driver. The designated employee ""prime member"" (often the driver or the person assigned the parking space) who travels in a vanpool and uses commercial parking is eligible for the parking benefit (up to $175 per month). At the same time, the prime  Fare Share Benefit Option The third option is for the employer and employee to share the costs. That's why this approach is called the Fare Share option.

An eligible employee is any employee of the State, a State college or university, or other State agency who is eligible to par ticipate in the State Health Benefits Program, except those par t-time employees made eligible under Chapter 172, P.L. 2003. Commuter Tax$ave consists of two separate component plans, and an eligible employee may elect to par ticipate in any combination -- both, one, or neither of the plans.   $100 per month ($1,200 per year) deducted from salar y to pay for mass transit commutation costs to and from work (mass transit includes train, bus, ferr y, and vanpool expenses); and/or  $195 per month ($2,340 per year) to pay for parking at work or at park and ride sites. Pre-tax monies deducted from salar y are not subject to federal income taxes, Social Security taxes, or Medicare taxes. There is a minimum deduction of $15 for either mass transit or parking deductions. There are no provisions for higher deductions on an after-tax basis. Deductions may only be made for use with the employee's personal commuting costs for going to and from work. Deductions may not be made to pay for commuting costs of dependents. In addition, Inter nal Revenue Ser vice rules require that mass transit benefits be delivered as tickets, payment cards, or vouchers that can only be used to purchase mass transit tickets. Parking benefits can be delivered as a payment card, voucher, or as a reimbursement of expenses.  PROGRAM BENEFITS The two components of Commuter Tax$ave are for mass transit expenses and commuter parking expenses.

ENROLLMENT Unlike the Section 125 por tion of the State's Tax$ave Program (Medical and/or Dependent Care Spending Accounts) that requires one annual election, the Commuter Tax$ave Progra m allows an employee to opt in and out or change amounts on a monthly basis. Eligible employees  may enroll in the program or end par ticipation at any time during the year and may change deductions as often as they like during the year. Once an employee has enrolled, the employee remains enrolled for all subsequent months at the same level of par ticipation until the employee makes a change to the deduction amounts or elects to end par ticipation.

An eligible employee enrolls by contacting TransitCenter directly. Enrollment can be done through an Integrated Voice Response Unit by calling 1-866-823-3248, or over the Inter net at: www.mycommuter taxsave.com Upon enrollment, an employee's eligibility is confir med with the employer who will arrange for payroll deductions to begin. Deductions for the benefit are taken from the first payroll check in the month. TransitCenter will then process tickets, payment cards, or vouchers and mail them directly to the employee. The total time required for processing before the benefit begins is approximately 45 days. The schedule for enrollments/changes during a typical year is shown in the following char t: ENROLLMENT PERIOD Januar y 16 - Februar y 15 Februar y 16 - March 15 March 16 - April 15 April 16 - May 15 May 16 - June 15 June 16 - July 15 July 16 - August 15 August 16 - September 15 September 16 - October 15 October 16 - November 15 November 16 - December 15 December 16 - Januar y 15 BENEFIT PERIOD April May June July August September October November December Januar y Februar y March  SOCIAL SECURITY IMPLICATIONS Since payments to the Commuter Tax$ave Program lower annual ear nings against which Social Security deductions are made, there is a concer n that par ticipation in these plans would result in reduced Social Security benefits at retirement. If you were bor n after 1928, your Social Security benefits are calculated using a 35-year average of your ear nings. A reduction of up to $3,540 a year (the program's maximum) over some por tion of this 35-year span would have little effect on your average salar y and, therefore, minimal impact on your Social Secur ity benefits. The Social Secur ity Administration has provided us with an example of an employee who retired in 1998 at age 65 whose wages had been at the maximum wages subject to Social Security deductions. Upon retirement, this individual's monthly Social Security allowance was $1,343. If that same person had been contributing $2,000 a year for the last 10 years to Commuter Tax$ave, the subsequent reduction in Social Security wages would have produced a monthly Social Security allowance of $1,335, a difference of only $8 per month.  Note that the monthly deduction for the Commuter Tax$ave Program will be taken from only the first paycheck each month.

These tax incentives, defined as qualified transportation fringe benefits and commonly referred to as Commuter Choice Programs (Programs), are intended to reduce employee commuting costs and the incidence of employees driving single-occupancy vehicles to work. First introduced in 1984, the fringe benefits employees receive can now equal up to $100 per month for mass transit passes or up to $180 per month for eligible parking. Employers who pay fringe benefits receive an equivalent deduction from their business income taxes. Employees receive the fringe benefit free of all taxes. While certain Federal agencies are required to offer these fringe benefits to their employees, no Federal or New York State law requires other employers in the public or private sectors to offer these benefits. Thus, employers provide such benefits on a voluntary basis. Four upstate New York Public Transportation Authorities (the Capital District Transportation Authority, the Central New York Regional Transportation Authority, the Rochester-Genesee Regional Transportation Authority and the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority) have all encouraged employers to enroll in Programs whereby their employees can either receive mass transit passes as a fringe benefit or buy them on a pre-tax basis. In September 2001, these Authorities' records showed that 222 employers and 5,384 employees were participating in the Programs. Authorities receive no State funds to implement these Programs. For the period January 1, 1998 through September 30, 2001, we addressed the following questions about the effectiveness of Authorities' Commuter Choice Programs:    Do Commuter Choice Programs increase ridership? Do the Authorities use performance measures to track Program progress? Are Authorities effectively marketing their Programs?  T   AUDIT OBSERVATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS  W  hile there have been modest increases in ridership at all the Authorities during our audit period, Authorities do not know how much their Programs have contributed to the increase. Authorities have not set ridership goals for their Programs, developed methods to measure Program-related increases or collected data about changes in employees' use of mass transit as a result of their Programs. We also found the Authorities need to enhance their efforts to market their Programs with employers. To determine the extent to which Programs encourage the use of mass transit, the Authorities should track Program-related increases in ridership. Authorities should also set specific, measurable goals for their Programs and establish performance measures to help gauge their progress in meeting the goals. We found the Authorities do not track Program-related increases in ridership, set specific Program goals and performance measures or collect complete and reliable data needed to assess the Program's impact. For example, Authorities do not track the number of employees who participate in their Programs, or determine whether their Programs change commuting practices by attracting new riders, encouraging more trips on mass transit, or influencing riders to continue using mass transit. We recommend the Authorities establish performance targets and develop procedures for collecting reliable Program-related data that will be used to quantify the Programs' impact on ridership. (See pp. 9-18) We concluded that Authorities should enhance the marketing of their Programs. After mailing brochures about their Programs to employers, Authorities do not follow up with employers to actively solicit their enrollment. Further, Authorities do not document which employers have received materials and why some employers reject the Program. Our own survey of 549 non-enrolled employers in the counties where the Authorities are located found that 61 of 86 respondents had not heard of the Authorities' Programs. We recommend that Authorities do regular follow up with employers who are prospective enrollees, and that they record the contacts made. Authorities should also document, and work to address, employers' stated reasons for rejecting enrollment in their Programs. (See pp. 21-27)  COMMENTS OF AUTHORITIES OFFICIALS  A  draft copy of this report was provided to officials at each of the four authorities for their review and comment.

These provisions are contained in Section 132(f) of the Internal Revenue Code. These tax incentives are defined as qualified transportation fringe benefits (fringe benefits) and commonly referred to as Commuter Choice Programs (Programs). These fringe benefits are intended to reduce employee commuting costs and the incidence of single-occupancy vehicles. According to the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, this reduction in vehicle miles traveled will in turn improve air quality, reduce traffic congestion and conserve energy. These fringe benefits can also help mass transit providers compete with free or low-cost parking for commuters. This in turn can result in increased ridership and fare revenue. Fringe benefits were introduced with the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984, which created a tax-free non-cash fringe benefit for employees that could not exceed $15 per month. The Comprehensive National Energy Policy Act of 1992 allowed employers to offer tax-free fringe benefits to employees in addition to compensation with a maximum value of $60 per month for mass transit passes (transit benefits) and $155 per month for eligible parking (parking benefits), subject to inflation. Eligible parking is parking at or near the place of employment or in an area from which the employee can commute using public or private (e.g., vanpool) mass transportation. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 allowed parking benefits to be provided in lieu of (rather than in addition to) compensation. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), enacted in October 1998, increased the maximum value for transit benefits and eligible parking benefits paid in lieu of compensation to $65 and $175 per month, respectively, subject to an inflation adjustment and allowed employers to also provide transit benefits in lieu of compensation. Beginning January 1, 2002, employers were allowed to give their employees up to $100 per month in transit benefits and up to $180 per month for eligible parking. Employers pay for the fringe benefit and receive an equivalent   deduction from their business income taxes. Employees receive the fringe benefit free of all income, Social Security and Medicare taxes. Rather than provide employees with transit and parking benefits, employers permit employees to set aside, on a monthly basis, the same amounts of pre-tax income to pay for transit, eligible vanpool, and eligible parking. Employees save on income, Social Security and Medicare taxes on the amount of the fringe benefit they purchase, because that amount is no longer treated or reported as taxable salary. Employers' payroll costs are reduced, as payroll taxes do not apply to the amount set aside, which is regarded as a benefit. According to a brochure published by the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority, using pre-tax dollars to buy a monthly bus pass can save employees up to 30 percent, depending on their tax bracket, off the regular cost of the bus pass. TEA-21 also allows employers to provide a parking cash out program, whereby employees may choose to forego employerprovided parking and receive either the taxable cash value of the parking or a tax-free transit or eligible vanpool benefit of up to $100 per month. The employer transfers its expenditure for the parking space, assuming it is leased, to a direct payment to the employee and incurs payroll tax only on the cash value provided. The additional compensation allows the employee to finance other commuting modes that are not considered fringe benefits, such as walking, bicycling, or carpooling. Reducing employee demand for parking can free up parking spaces for customers, reduce the demand for parking or permit space that can be used for other purposes. On April 21, 2000, President Clinton issued Executive Order 13150, which required that all Federal employees in the National Capital Region receive transit benefits equal to their commuting costs, not to exceed the maximum amount allowed by the law. In addition, the Executive Order required that all Federal employees outside the National Capital Region be allowed to reduce their pre-tax income by the maximum amount allowable for transit or vanpool expenses no later than October 1, 2000. The Executive Order also created a Nationwide Pilot Program (Pilot), in which all employees of the Departments of Transportation and Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency nationwide would receive the maximum allowable transit benefit equal to their commuting costs. This Pilot began  2   October 1, 2000 and will last for three years. Upon completion, the Pilot will be analyzed to ascertain, among other things, if it reduced single-occupancy vehicle travel and local area traffic congestion. Results will help determine whether the transit benefits will be offered to other Federal employees nationwide. While Federal agencies in the National Capital Region are required to offer these transit benefits to their employees, neither the Federal nor New York State governments have required other employers in the public or private sectors to offer these benefits. Thus, these employers provide transit benefits on a voluntary basis. In the 2000-01 New York State budget, Governor Pataki proposed a new transit initiative to reduce commuting costs for State employees and to stimulate ridership for transit systems. The initiative allows State employees to use up to $65 of their pre-tax monthly income to pay for transit or mass transportation expenses. A committee is evaluating the provision of qualified transportation fringe benefits to State employees, but no proposal has been developed. Even though employers are not required to offer transit benefits to their employees, the Capital District Transportation Authority (Albany), the Central New York Regional Transportation Authority (Syracuse), the Rochester-Genesee Regional Transportation Authority (Rochester), and the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority (Buffalo) have all encouraged employers in their service areas to enroll in the Programs, whereby their employees can receive transit benefits as a fringe benefit or as a pre-tax payroll deduction. Enrolled employers simply purchase the Authority's regular fare media, generally monthly bus passes, and distribute these bus passes to their employees. The employees use these bus passes to pay their bus fare. Each of these Authorities provides fixed route public bus service and paratransit bus service within its service area. The Buffalo authority also provides light rail service within downtown Buffalo. These Authorities market their own Programs, which were established during the 1990s under the following names: Albany's Swiper Corporate (April 1994); Syracuse's Fare Deal (April 1996); Rochester's Employer Support (April 1995); and Buffalo's Greenback Plan (April 2000). Prior to implementing the Greenback Plan, Buffalo accepted CommuterCheks, which are checks issued to employers by a private company for the purchase of fare media for use on the Authority's buses and  3   light rail. CommuterCheks, are still in use, according to Buffalo officials, but on a limited basis in the Buffalo area. Records provided by the Authorities, show that in September 2001, 222 employers were enrolled in the Programs, and 5,384 employees were participating. None of the Authorities has received any technical assistance or funding from any State agency to implement their Programs. It is important to note that the employees participating in these Programs may not receive transit benefits as defined by the tax law. For example, an employee in Albany's Program who purchases discounted bus passes through his or her employer, but who does not receive the passes as a fringe benefit or purchase them with pre-tax payroll deductions, does not receive the benefits established by the tax law. Nevertheless, the employee pays less for transportation, and the employer can still achieve the transit benefit goals by moving commuting employees from single-occupancy vehicles to mass transit. In addition, certain local social services districts (districts) purchase mass transit passes for their clients to use in Welfareto-Work programs. These clients are employed or attend training/education classes to prepare them for work. Thus, they are commuting by mass transit, which the Programs promote, and increasing bus ridership, which the Authorities want to achieve. However, neither they nor the districts are receiving transit benefits as defined in the tax law. According to published employment data, the areas served by the four Authorities had a total of about 1,931,700 payroll jobs in September 2001: 464,200 in Albany; 356,900 in Syracuse; 553,000 in Rochester; and 557,600 in Buffalo. Data is not available to identify the size of the market for these Authorities' Programs. However, the market for the Programs is likely to be considerably less than the job market for a variety of reasons, including a worksite's inaccessibility by available transit service, employees' need to use their cars to perform work duties, and work hours that do not coincide with transit schedules. However, even if only 96,585 (5 percent of 1,931,700 jobs) employees in these areas are likely Program participants, the market for these Programs is far from saturated, since only 5,384 employees were participating in September 2001.  4   Audit Scope, Objectives and Methodology  W  e audited Albany's Swiper Corporate Program, Syracuse's Fare Deal Program, Rochester's Employer Support Program, and Buffalo's Greenback Plan for the period January 1, 1998 through September 30, 2001. The objectives of our performance audit were to determine whether these Programs increased ridership, whether the Authorities use performance measures to track Program progress, and whether the Authorities effectively market their Programs. To accomplish our objectives, we interviewed officials at the four Authorities, reviewed Program enrollment data and Program sales reports and reviewed passenger ridership statistical reports. We also contacted officials from the Federal Transit Administration, the U. S. General Accounting Office (GAO), the U. S. General Services Administration, the U. S. Office of Inspector General, the New York Public Transit Association, and the New York State Departments of Transportation and Environmental Conservation. Further, we contacted 11 public transit providers in other states, 5 transportation-planning organizations, and 3 Commuter Choice administrators to determine how they evaluate their Commuter Choice Programs. We reviewed various studies prepared by four public transit providers in other states, one transportation planning organization, two Commuter Choice administrators, the GAO, and the U.S. Office of Inspector General to identify the methodology used to measure program results and to identify the reported studies' findings. We sent a questionnaire to the 213 employers enrolled in the Authorities' Programs in September 2000 to find out how they provide transportation fringe benefits and if they maintain data on whether employees receiving these benefits have increased their use of mass transit as a result. We also contacted 40 employers who received marketing information but did not enroll to determine their reasons for not enrolling. We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Such standards require that we plan and perform our audit to adequately assess those operations of the Authorities that are within our scope. Further, these standards require that we understand the Authorities' internal control structure and compliance with those laws, rules and regulations that are relevant to our audit scope. An audit includes examining on a test basis evidence supporting  5   transactions in the accounting and operating records and applying such other procedures we consider necessary in the circumstances. An audit also includes assessing the estimates, decisions and judgments made by management. We believe our audit provides a reasonable basis for our findings, conclusions and recommendations. We use a risk-based approach to select activities for audit. We therefore focus our efforts on those activities we have identified as having the greatest potential for needing improvement. Consequently, by design, we use finite audit resources to identify where and how improvements can be made. We devote little audit effort to reviewing operations that may be relatively efficient and effective. As a result, we prepare our audit reports on ""an exception basis."" This audit report, therefore, highlights those areas needing improvement and does not address activities that may be functioning properly.  Comments of Authorities Officials to Audit  A  draft copy of this report was provided to officials at each of the four authorities for their review and comment. The comments from the Capital District Transportation Authority, the Central New York Regional Transportation Authority, and the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority have been considered in preparing this final report, and are included as Appendix B. The Rochester-Genesee Regional Transportation Authority chose not respond to the draft report. The three Authorities that did respond indicated that they accept the findings and will implement the recommendations in the report. Capital District Transportation Authority officials added that their Program has been successful and has been recognized with marketing awards and community support. They also indicated that the audit recommendations will assist them to continue to improve the services they offer customers. The responses from Central New York Regional Transportation Authority and the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority contained similar comments. Within 90 days after final release of this report, as required by Section 170 of the Executive Law, the Chairmen of the Capital District Transportation Authority, the Central New York Regional Transportation Authority, the Rochester-Genesee Regional Transportation Authority and the Niagara Frontier  6   Transportation Authority shall report to the Governor, the State Comptroller, and the leaders of the Legislature and fiscal committees, advising what steps were taken to implement the recommendations contained herein, and where recommendations were not implemented, the reasons therefor.  7   8   PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT  T  he use of formal performance measures is an important tool to help managers assess their programs' progress towards achieving stated goals and objectives. The comparison of actual performance with measurable performance objectives can also function as an important tool of accountability when such data is communicated to elected officials and the public. To determine the extent to which the Authorities' Programs are effective in encouraging the use of mass transit, the Authorities should establish formal performance measures to assess the extent to which Programs have increased ridership. However, we found that Authorities have not established specific measurable goals for their Programs, or developed methods to measure any Program-related increases in ridership. In addition, three of the four Authorities do not collect data on whether employees participating in the Programs have increased their use of public transit as a result. Instead, the Authorities tend to view the Programs as just another way to increase, or at least retain, ridership. As a result, Authorities do not know the extent to which transit benefits encourage employees to use mass transit in upstate areas. To assess the Programs' impact, we mailed questionnaires to all 213 employers enrolled in the Programs in September 2000 and received 104 employer responses. The responses received from the 49 employers who maintained Program data showed the Program had a modest impact on commuting practices. We also reviewed the results of Buffalo's January 2001 survey of participating employees, as well as the surveys other entities conducted of employers and employees enrolled in Commuter Choice Programs. Buffalo's survey showed that 17 percent of respondents were new riders, and other entities' surveys showed ridership increases ranging from 11 to 36 percent. Thus, we conclude the upstate Programs have potential for increasing ridership, and we encourage the Authorities to develop methods to measure this increase.  9   Performance Measurement by Authorities  A  ll the Authorities have established objectives for their Programs that are generally aimed at attracting new riders and retaining existing riders. Rochester and Buffalo have established specific, measurable goals related to these objectives. Rochester's goal is to increase employer participation in the Program by 10 percent each year, a goal it exceeded in the last two years; Buffalo's goal was to increase the sale of full fare passes by 3 to 5 percent in 2000, a goal which it exceeded by selling 9 percent more full fare passes in 2000 than in the prior year. However, none of the Authorities have established specific ridership growth goals for the Program, and only Buffalo surveyed Program participants (enrolled employees) to determine increased ridership. Employers' participation in these Programs is voluntary. Further, the Authorities were not required to develop specific goals for the Programs, to collect data from enrolled employers and participating employees about the Program's impact on their commute to work, or to measure and report how effective the Programs have been at increasing ridership. Authorities' management also stated that, since the Programs are only a small part of their overall efforts to increase ridership, it is difficult to isolate and quantify their impact. We examined the data that Authorities did have available to evaluate the Program, including annual ridership reports, Program enrollment and sales data and the results of Buffalo's survey. We also conducted our own survey of all 213 employers enrolled in the Programs in September 2000. However, the information we obtained from these sources provided only limited ridership and Program participation data that does not answer the key question of whether participating employees are using public transit more now than they were before they received the Program's transportation fringe benefit.  Ridership Reports  T  he Authorities maintain that ride their transit reported to the New York and the Federal Highway  data on the number of passengers systems each year. This data is State Department of Transportation Administration. The following table  10   shows the number of revenue passengers the Authorities reported for the four years ended March 31, 2001: Revenue Passengers Fiscal Year Ended 3-31-98 9,425,000 8,016,441 23,002,251 12,701,642 53,145,334 Revenue Passengers Fiscal Year Ended 3-31-99 9,368,084 8,486,805 23,784,594 11,982,189 (Note 1) 53,621,672 Revenue Passengers Fiscal Year Ended 3-31-00 9,516,345 8,077,792 25,256,686 12,346,047 55,196,870 Revenue Passengers Fiscal Year Ended 3-31-01 9,599,226 8,264,244 23,225,758 12,929,250 54,018,478  Authority Albany Syracuse Buffalo Rochester Totals  Change from 1998 to 2001 174,226 247,803 223,507 227,608 873,144  Percent Change from 1998 to 2001 1.85 3.09 .97 1.79 1.64  Note 1: According to Rochester officials, changes in high school start times during the 1997-98 school year  account for most of the decline in passengers in this fiscal year.  These reports show modest increases in ridership over the fouryear period, but they do not identify what, if any, role the Programs played in this ridership increase. Thus, they are not useful for Program performance measurement.  Program Enrollment and Sales Data  T  he Authorities maintain data on the number of employers enrolled in their Programs, and with the exception of Syracuse, maintain data on the monthly sales made to employers. However, Syracuse does maintain data about the number of participating employees, which they obtain from employers. We calculated the number of participating employees at the other three Authorities on the basis that the sale of each monthly pass, or its equivalent in weekly passes, equaled one participating employee. The following table shows the number of employers enrolled in the Authorities' Programs in September 2000 and September 2001, and the sales that were made to these employers during August 2000 and September 2001.  11   Authority and Program Albany: Swiper Corporate Syracuse: Fare Deal (Note 1) Rochester: Employer Support (Note 2) Buffalo: Greenback Plan Totals  Enrolled Employers in September 2000  Enrolled Employers in September 2001  Participating Employees in September 2000  Participating Employees in September 2001  Value of August 2000 Sales  Value of September 2001 Sales  68 35  81 16  2,074 168  2,458 237  $ 52,765 $ 3,120  $ 82,212 $ 3,923  34  41  1,467  1,467  $ 79,980  $ 30,000  76 213  84 222  782 4,491  1,222 5,384  $ 36,448 $172,313  $ 57,181 $173,316  Note 1: Syracuse has more sales than are represented by these numbers. This is because Syracuse tracks only credit sales to employers, and does not have a practical way of tracking sales by cash and check. Note 2: The sales data that Rochester provided for September 2001 inappropriately excluded sales for several large employers whom we had included in our September 2000 sales numbers. Therefore, we used the employee participation numbers we had calculated for September 2000 for 2001. This number may, however, be understated, because they now have more employers enrolled in the Program.  However, we found that some of this data was problematic for reliably assessing Program participation and Program growth. For example, not all sales made to employers are necessarily Program-related. During August 2000, 696 of the 1,625 sales for Albany's Program were to labor unions that provided them to their members at a reduced cost. Although these employees purchased the bus passes at a reduced cost, the passes do not represent transit benefits. Transit benefits are provided by employers as fringe benefits or purchased by employees with pre-tax dollars. Further, employers do not have to be enrolled in the Program to provide transit benefits to their employees. As discussed in the ""Marketing Efforts"" section of this audit report, our survey of a judgmental sample of 549 non-enrolled employers in the areas served by the four Authorities determined that 9 of the 86 employers that responded provided some form of transit benefits to their employees. However, employers must be enrolled to receive any incentive the Authority offers. For example, in Albany's Program, the employer can purchase monthly bus passes at a 2.5 percent to 7.5 percent discounts.  12   In Syracuse's Program, enrolled employers receive free monthly bus passes to distribute to newly hired employees. In Rochester, employers must be enrolled in the Authority Program for employees to be eligible to use the Authority's ""Guaranteed Ride Home Program."" Thus, the Authorities do not have complete and reliable data for basic Program information because they do not collect data on the number of participating employees. Further, Authorities do not distinguish between Program-related (transit benefits) and non-Program-related sales to enrolled employers. In addition, Authorities do not collect information about changes in employees' commuting practices, such as whether participating employees are new public transit riders, whether they have increased or continued their use of transit because of the Programs, or whether they were existing transit users. Without such data, the Authorities lack the ability to evaluate whether the Programs are achieving their goal of attracting and keeping customers. Buffalo has begun to collect data on whether participating employees are new riders and, if so, how often they are using the bus. However, Buffalo does not collect data on current riders, such as whether they use public transit more often or remain a transit user because of the Program. Albany and Syracuse officials stated they plan to develop mechanisms to identify increased ridership and commute mode changes in the future.  Buffalo Authority Survey n January 2001, Buffalo conducted a survey of employees participating in the Program. The surveys, which were distributed by enrolled employers, asked Program participants if they used public transit prior to receiving the monthly transit pass through the Program and how many one-way trips per week they now take on transit. Of the 114 employees who responded, 20 (17.5 percent) said they were new transit riders. These 20 respondents stated they make an average of 9.25 one-way bus trips per week. However, for those respondents who said they used transit before receiving the monthly pass through the Program, the survey did not collect sufficient data to evaluate whether Program participation resulted in their using transit more or in their remaining transit riders. The Niagara  I  13   Frontier Transportation Authority allocated money in its 2001 budget to conduct additional research on the Program.  Survey of Enrolled Employers  D  uring November 2000, we mailed a questionnaire to the 213 employers enrolled in the Authorities' Programs in September 2000. Our objective was to determine how employers provide transit benefits to their employees and whether they maintain data on whether participating employees increased their use of public transit as a result of the benefits. We received responses from 104 employers, who stated that they employed 20,531 full-time and 3,840 part-time employees, 880.5 of whom participate in the Authorities' Programs. By comparison, Authorities' records showed these same employers had 908 participating employees. Of the 104 employers who responded, 84 are providing bus fare as a fringe benefit or allowing employees to purchase bus fare with pre-tax payroll deductions. These employers are considered to be providing their employees with transit benefits. The remaining 20 employers do not provide transit benefits: 11 employers allow employees to purchase bus fare at the work location; 5 employers provide bus fare to clients and not to employees; and 4 employers stated they are no longer enrolled in the Authorities' Programs. For the 84 employers that offer bus fare as a fringe benefit or allow pre-tax payroll deductions, 77 have employees using the Programs. (Details of employers' responses to our survey are listed, by Authority, in Exhibit A.) Of these 77 employers, 49 stated they have data on whether participating employees started to commute by mass transit as a result of the Programs. These 49 employers reported the following information.    41 employers stated all participating employees were existing bus riders. 5 employers stated most employees were existing bus riders. 1 employer stated that, while most participants were existing riders, they had definitely seen an increase in ridership. This employer also stated the Program has helped to recruit employees.  14      1 employer stated that, except for two new riders, it has mostly existing riders participating in the Program. 1 employer stated that its two participating employees did not use mass transit before starting in the Program.  However, we do not know whether any of the existing riders increased the number of times they use the bus to commute to work because of the Programs or whether employees have continued to take mass transit because of the Programs.  Performance Measurement by Other Entities  T  o determine the extent to which other entities nationwide have measured the effectiveness of Commuter Choice Programs in increasing the use of mass transit, we contacted a variety of Federal agencies, public transit providers in other states, Commuter Choice administrators and transportation planning organizations. These entities are all located in areas with relatively high population density, which results in more dependence on mass transit than in the areas served by the four Authorities. Therefore, we report on these studies to demonstrate the methodology that can be used to measure performance, and not to compare the entities' Program results with those of the Authorities. We reviewed the results of nine studies conducted by these entities to identify both the methodology they used to measure program results and the results themselves. All nine studies used a survey of participating employers and/or employees in a Commuter Choice Program with the intent of measuring the extent to which the Commuter Choice Program had increased the use of mass transit. These studies found that the Commuter Choice Program increased employees' use of mass transit from 11 percent to 36 percent. Three of the surveys also indicated that some of this increase was accompanied by a reduction in personal vehicle use. We highlight the results of these studies below:  The Metropolitan Transportation Commission (San Francisco, 1994 survey) In 1994, the Commission conducted a survey of employees participating in the San Francisco Bay Area Commuter Check Program. Approximately  15   1,800 survey cards were completed and returned by employees from 149 employers. The survey concluded that about a third (31 percent) of the employees who receive Commuter Checks increased their use of transit. The survey also concluded that the Program resulted in about 17 million fewer vehicle miles in 1994, avoiding about 61 million tons of pollutants, and generating an estimated $1.6 million of new transit revenue.  The Metropolitan Transportation Commission (San Francisco, 1999 survey) In June 1999, the Commission and Commuter Check Services Corporation sent a survey to approximately 1,350 participating employers, from which they received 482 responses. Thirty-four percent of respondents said their employees increased their use of mass transit after receiving transit benefits. Respondents who measured this increase stated the average increase was about 41 percent. This is the third study.  Washington Metropolitan Area (Washington, D.C., 1999 survey) Transit Authority  This Authority conducted a 1999 survey of employees participating in their Metropool/Metrochek Program. More than one-third of the respondents indicated that they did not regularly use public transit prior to joining Metrochek, and three-quarters of these new transit riders had previously used their own vehicles to commute to work.  Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (Atlanta, 2000 survey) This Authority conducted a study in September 2000, which concluded that 36.3 percent of the respondents began riding public transportation after their employer offered a discounted fare.  Regional Transportation District (Denver, Colorado, 1997 survey)  16   This transportation planning organization's survey of employees who work in the Denver Business District concluded that the number of employees who use mass transit at least once a week increased 21 percent.  The New York City Transit Center (New York City, 1994 survey) This organization's 1994 survey of employees using the TransitChek showed that 11 percent the respondents claimed to use mass transit more often because of TransitChek, making 11.6 more trips, on average, per month. As a result of responses received, the Center estimated that TransitChek sales of $25.1 million in 1994 implied a total of about 1.7 million additional transit trips. The survey also concluded that the program's biggest effect may have been retaining mass transit customers.  General Accounting Office (Federal, 1993 survey) In 1993, the GAO surveyed the 59,000 Federal employees eligible to receive mass transit benefits of about $21 per month, and found that 31 percent of employees accepted these transit benefits. Of the employees who accepted benefits, 21 percent reported changing to mass transit as a result. Sixty of the new transit users had previously driven to work alone.  Office of Inspector General (Federal, 1994 audit) An audit of the Federal Election Commission's Transit Benefit Program in 1994 found that 25 percent of the Program's participants used public transportation as their primary means of commuting as a result of transit benefits.  Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission (Regional, 2000 survey) A Commission-hired consultant surveyed employers and employees participating in the TransitChek program in southeastern Pennsylvania, southern New  17   Jersey and northern Delaware and found that 35 percent of survey respondents indicated an increase in transit use due to TransitCheks. The survey concluded that 8.5 percent of respondents were new transit users, and 11.1 percent had increased the number of transit trips per week. Survey respondents reported that they increased their total number of trips on transit by 13.7 percent. As stated earlier, the Authorities need to establish specific measurable goals for their Programs and develop the means of measuring and reporting on how effective the Programs are in achieving these goals. We conclude that a review of the methodology and results of the above surveys could provide useful information for the development of Program performance measures.  Recommendations To the Albany, Syracuse, Rochester and Buffalo Authorities 1. Establish specific, measurable Program goals that are focused on increasing the number of participating employees and the number of transit commuting trips. Work with one another and with the New York State Department of Transportation to establish common Program goals, to develop consistent Program performance measures, and to share Program best practices that can enhance ridership.  2.  To the Buffalo Authority 3. Continue efforts to measure increased ridership attributable to the Buffalo program. Expand measurement efforts to include the identification of new transit users, a quantification of increased transit use, and a measurement of rider retention.  18   Recommendations (Cont'd) To the Albany, Syracuse and Rochester Authorities 4. Develop a formalized performance measurement and reporting system to evaluate Program effectiveness and to focus marketing resources. Consider the studies identified above to develop a mechanism for measuring performance.  19   20   MARKETING EFFORTS  L  ike any new initiative, Authority Programs must be marketed to promote interest in them and to gain participating employers and employees. However, we found that Authorities send out marketing material and then wait to be contacted rather than follow up with employers to actively solicit their enrollment. Further, Authorities do not document which employers have received materials and why some employers are not responsive. Our own survey of 549 non-enrolled employers in the counties where the Authorities are located found that 61 of 86 respondents had not heard of the Authorities' Programs. Although Authorities' marketing efforts may be hindered by the limited staff numbers and by upstate employers' resistance to offering transportation fringe benefits, we believe Authorities can enhance their marketing - and increase Program enrollment - by doing regular follow-up with employers and improving documentation.  Marketing Methods Used  T  he mix of marketing methods used by each of the four Authorities are as follows: Albany Syracuse X X Rochester X Buffalo X X X Indirect Indirect X X X X X X X Indirect Indirect X X X X X X  Mass mailing of brochure Ads in business publications Ads in newspaper Television ads Radio ads Advertising on buses Presentations to various groups Website Billboard Cards in token packs  X X  Note: Indirect advertising promotes mass transit in general and does not specifically target employers.  21   The amount of money and staff time dedicated to marketing the Program, also varied among the Authorities as shown in the following table: Hours Spent Per Month Marketing Program 141 12 40 32 225  Authority Albany Syracuse Buffalo Rochester Totals  Program Marketing Costs Other-Than Labor $10,000/year Minor printing costs $163,321 through 9/30/01 $22,495  Number of Staff 5 1 1 1 8  Officials at these Authorities told us that they have limited staff resources available to market these Programs to employers, and that the Programs are only a part of their overall marketing efforts to encourage people to use the bus. Once Authorities send marketing material to an employer, their staff generally wait to be contacted by the employer. They do not pro-actively contact the employers to promote the Programs or to answer employer questions. Officials also told us that employers' unwillingness to offer transportation fringe benefits or to allow for pre-tax purchase of bus fare is the most significant of many barriers that makes these Programs difficult to market. They noted that New York State, the largest employer in the Albany area, falls into this category. According to Authority officials, other barriers to marketing the Programs, which relate to mass transit use in general, are as follows:  Employees prefer to drive their own vehicles bus. Officials note that motorists often fail to total costs of commuting by car, including f the wear and tear on the automobile, and such as insurance. than ride the consider the uel, parking, other costs,    The upstate region has less traffic congestion and parking is not scarce conditions that make mass transit an attractive alternative to driving in large metropolitan areas. Many employers provide free or low-cost parking to employees. In addition, many employers are moving    22   from the downtown area to the suburbs where free parking is available.   Riding the bus generally takes longer than driving and may involve using more than one bus. Many people have a negative impression of those that ride the bus.  Documentation of Marketing Efforts  A  uthorities should maintain adequate records of their marketing efforts and the results of those efforts to determine where further promotion should be focused and what types of marketing succeed. However, we found out that none of the four Authorities had complete records of the employers that have been sent marketing material or contacted in any way. For example, Albany managers told us they did a mass mailing in April 2000 to 1,900 employers whose names appeared on a list purchased from an outside firm. However, the managers could not identify which employers got the brochure or how many of them subsequently enrolled in the Program. Starting May 2000, Albany requires that marketing staff maintain a log of meetings held with interested employers and indicate whether the employer was likely to enroll in the Program. Managers told us they sent out a mass mailing, but they could not tell us when the mailing was done, who received the brochure, how many brochures were mailed, or how many employers expressed an interest in their Program. Rochester management told us that a mass mailing to 3,672 employers was done in October 1999 using a rented proprietary mailing list. However, because the mailing list was rented, they do not have a list of the employers that received the material. Rochester does maintain a record of employers that expressed an interest in their Program and tracks the contacts that have been made with these employers. Buffalo did not maintain records of the 102-employer contacts managers state were made during the first three months of promoting their Program. In April 2001, Buffalo started to maintain a spreadsheet of the employers who were sent promotional material, when the material was sent, when the employer responded, when follow-up calls were made, and  23   when the employer enrolled in the Program. We found these records are generally incomplete with regard to employer responses and follow-up calls. Buffalo staff stated that they have not had enough time to update the records because they spend only part of their time marketing this Program. Officials at Albany and Syracuse stated that they plan to develop tracking systems for future mass mailings. Syracuse officials also told us they have begun to ask employers why they did not enroll in the Program or why they left the Program. While Rochester has developed a good system to document contacts with employers that have expressed an interest in the Program, their system could be improved by identifying all employers that have been sent promotional material and stating the reasons why employers chose not to enroll in the Program. Likewise, Buffalo has developed a good system to document the employers who were sent promotional material, but it does not always document contacts with employers that respond to the material or chose not to enroll.  Survey of Local Employers  B  ecause the Authorities did not have complete records of the employers that were sent promotional material, in March 2001 we sent a survey questionnaire to a total of 549 judgmentally selected non-participating employers within the counties where the Authorities are located. These were the largest employers within these four counties, excluding employers we had already contacted and State government employers. The intent of the survey was to determine whether the employers were aware of the Programs, whether the employers already offer transit or parking benefits to their employees, and whether the employers have staff who currently use mass transit to commute to work. We received responses from 86 of these 549 employers, as summarized below. (Details of employers' responses to our survey are listed, by Authority, in Exhibit B.)  61 of the 86 (71 percent) employers stated they had never heard of the Authority's Program. Of the remaining 25 employers, 24 had received a brochure or a sales call or had otherwise heard about the Programs. One employer did not answer the question.  24     50 of the 86 employers said they currently have employees using mass transit to commute to work, 29 employers said they either did not have a transit stop near their business location or they were not located on a mass transit route, 1 employer said no employees use the bus, and 6 employers did not answer the question. 9 of the 86 employers said they already provide mass transit fare as at least a partial fringe benefit or allow employees to deduct transit costs on a pre-tax basis. 74 of the 86 employers said they provide parking for all employees and 3 said they provide parking for some of their employees. Further, 72 of these 77 employers said they pay all or part of the cost of parking. Only 8 employers do not provide employee parking. One employer did not answer the question. Of the 86 employers, 40 stated that they were interested in receiving additional information about the Authority's Program, 32 of whom also indicated they currently have employees using mass transit to commute to work.        Managers at each Authority should also track the reasons why employers who hear about the Program do not enroll in it so they can adjust the Program, if possible, or refocus their marketing efforts. However, we found the Authorities do not maintain this information. Therefore, we contacted 40 randomly selected employers (10 in each city) that had been sent marketing brochures, but had not subsequently enrolled in the Programs. We found that none of the 40 employers subsidize the cost of bus passes or encourage their employees to use the bus to commute to work. Available parking also appeared to influence employers' interest in the Programs. Of the 40 employers contacted, 31 employers stated that most or all of their employees had access to free parking. Other reasons employers gave for not enrolling are listed below. However, for at least some of these employers, a follow-up call from Authority staff may have been able to answer questions and provide additional information that may have persuaded these employers to enroll in the Programs.  12 employers said they had few or no employees interested in the Program; 2 of these employers said the bus did not travel to all their work locations.  25        6 employers said they were still in the decision phase. 1 employer was waiting for approval from its insurance carrier. 5 employers stated that payroll deductions were too complex. 1 employer said the logistics of collecting money and distributing bus passes was not justified based on the number of employees interested. 5 employers said they did not have enough information about the Program to make a decision. 4 employers did not recall receiving the information and were unaware of the program. 1 employer said it had a diverse staff with varied transportation needs. 1 employer said a benefit to 4,000 employees would be too costly for the company. 1 employer stated that all employees own and use their own vehicles to commute to work. 1 employer was concerned about a possible conflict between the Program and a reimbursement program they have in place. 1 employer stated that the main reason for not participating was the limited benefit it would provide to a not-for-profit organization. 1 employer did not give a reason for not participating.             We believe the Authorities need comprehensive records regarding employer contacts and the results of those contacts to be able to evaluate the effectiveness of both their marketing staff and the marketing methods used. These records should include: a list of the employers that received marketing material and when they received it; a list of those employers that responded to the material; dates of subsequent meetings with interested employers; when the employers enrolled; dates of  26   follow-up contacts with employers that did not respond to the marketing material; and a description of why employers chose not to enroll in the Program.  Recommendations To the Albany, Syracuse, Rochester and Buffalo Authorities 5. 6. Require marketing staff to regularly follow up with prospective Program participants. Allocate sufficient staff to maintain complete records of all contacts made with employers, including when employers receive marketing material, when follow-up contacts are made, and whether the employers accept or reject enrollment in the Programs. Document why employers reject the Program and follow up with the employers to identify ways to improve the acceptability of the Programs.  7.  27   RESPONSE TO SURVEY OF ENROLLED EMPLOYERS Provide Only to Clients Number of Employers 4 1 0 0 5 No Longer Enrolled In Program Number of Employers 0 3 0 1 4  Authority  Albany Syracuse Buffalo Rochester Totals  Offer As Fringe Benefit No Number Staff Staff Of Staff Use Use Using 10 0 119 6 4 5 25 1 0 2 3 42 22 98 281  Allow Pre-Tax Payroll Deductions No Number Staff Staff of Staff Use Use Using 4 1 35 1 44 3 52 1 0 2 4 1 442.5 5 483.5  Sell Fare Media At Work Number Number of Of Staff Employers Using 8 89 2 1 0 11 1 26 0 116  Totals Number Number of of Staff Employers Using 27 243 15 49 13 104 44 490.5 103 880.5  Exhibit A   RESPONSE TO SURVEY OF NON-ENROLLED EMPLOYERS Response to Survey Number of Surveys Mailed Number of Responses Received Answers to Survey Questions Received Brochure or Sales Call Heard About Program By Other Method Did Not Answer Question Never Heard of Program Have Bus Riders No Bus Stop Near Location Not Located On Bus Route Provides At Least A Partial Fringe Benefit For Mass Transit Allows Employees To Use Pre-Tax Deductions for Mass Transit Provide Parking for All Employees Provide Parking for Some Employees Provide Parking for None of the Employees Not Answered Fully or Partially Subsidize Parking Costs Interested In Receiving Information About Program Interested In Receiving Information and Have Bus Riders Albany 132 11 Albany 1 5 0 5 6 2 2 0 1 8 2 1 0 9 4 3 Syracuse 142 26 Syracuse 0 1 0 25 12 4 8 0 1 22 0 3 1 20 12 9 Authority Buffalo 134 25 Buffalo 5 6 0 14 17 5 2 2 2 24 0 1 0 24 12 9 Rochester 141 24 Rochester 3 3 1 17 15 2 4 0 3 20 1 3 0 19 12 11 Total 549 86 Total 9 15 1 61 50 13 16 2 7 74 3 8 1 72 40 32  Exhibit B   MAJOR CONTRIBUTORS TO THIS REPORT Carmen Maldonado Gerald Tysiak Thomas A.

ACTION: Final regulation.  An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a valid control number assigned by the Office of Management and Budget. The estimated average annual recordkeeping burden per recordkeeper is 26.5 hours. The estimated annual reporting burden per respondent is .8 hours. Comments concerning the accuracy of this burden estimate and suggestions for reducing this burden should be sent to the Internal Revenue Service, Attn: IRS Reports Clearance Officer, W:CAR:MP:FP:S:O, Washington, DC 20224, and to the Office of Management and Budget, Attn: Desk Officer for the Department of the Treasury, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503. Books or records relating to a collection of information must be retained as long as their contents might become material in the administration of any internal revenue law. Generally, tax returns and tax return information are confidential, as required by 26 U.S.C. 6103. Background This document contains amendments to 26 CFR part 1 (Income Tax Regulations). On January 27, 2000, a proposed regulation (REG11357299) relating to qualified transportation fringes was published in the Federal Register (65 FR 4388). A public hearing was held on June 1, 2000. Written or electronic comments responding to the notice of proposed rulemaking were received. After consideration of all the comments, the proposed regulations are adopted as amended by this Treasury decision. The revisions are discussed below. Explanation of Provisions and Summary of Comments In general, comments received on the proposed regulations were favorable and, accordingly, the final regulations retain the general structure of the proposed regulations, including the question and answer format and a variety of examples illustrating the substance of the final regulations. However, commentators made a number of specific recommendations for modifications and clarifications of the regulations. In response to these comments, the final regulations incorporate the modifications and clarifications described below.  A. Whether Vouchers are Readily Available Section 132(f)(3) provides that qualified transportation fringes include cash reimbursement for transit passes ``only if a voucher or similar item which may be exchanged only for a transit pass is not readily available for direct distribution by the employer to the employee.'' Thus, if vouchers are readily available, the employer must use vouchers and cash reimbursement of a mass transit expense would not be a qualified transportation fringe. Most of the comments received addressed the issue of whether vouchers are ``readily available.'' Commentators representing employers generally favored rules permitting cash reimbursement. Commentators representing transit operators and voucher providers generally favored rules not permitting cash reimbursement. The following discusses three issues raised by commentators: first, whether the proposed regulations' 1 percent safe harbor should be retained; second, whether internal administrative costs should be considered in applying the 1 percent test; and third, whether other nonfinancial restrictions should be considered in determining whether vouchers are readily available. 1. The 1 Percent Safe Harbor Under Notice 943, 19941 C.B. 327, and the proposed regulations, a voucher is readily available if an employer can obtain it on terms no less favorable than those available to an individual employee and without incurring a significant administrative cost. Under the proposed regulations, administrative costs relate only to fees paid to fare media providers, and the determination of whether obtaining a voucher would result in a significant administrative cost is made with respect to each transit system voucher. The proposed regulations provide a rule under which administrative costs are treated as significant if the average monthly administrative costs incurred by the employer for a voucher (disregarding delivery charges imposed by the fare media provider to the extent not in excess of $15 per order) are more than 1 percent of the average monthly value of the vouchers for a system. Commentators, in particular those representing fare media providers and transit operators, suggested that the fare media provider fee percentage causing vouchers to not be readily available should be raised because many fare media providers charge fees in excess of the 1 percent limit and, thus, under this  This document contains final regulations relating to qualified transportation fringe benefits. These final regulations provide rules to ensure that transportation benefits provided to employees are excludable from gross income. These final regulations reflect changes to the law made by the Energy Policy Act of 1992, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, and the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century. These final regulations affect employers that offer qualified transportation fringes and employees who receive these benefits. DATES: Effective Date: These regulations are effective January 11, 2001. Applicability Date: For dates of applicability, see  1.1329(b), Q/A25. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John Richards, (202) 6226040 (not a toll-free number). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: SUMMARY:  Paperwork Reduction Act The collection of information contained in these final regulations has been reviewed and approved by the Office of Management and Budget in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3507) under control number 15451676. Responses to this collection of information are mandatory to obtain the benefit described under section 132(f).

In this regard, the proposed regulations provide that employers must implement reasonable procedures to ensure that an amount equal to the reimbursement was incurred for transit passes. For example, the final regulations clarify that in circumstances when employee certification is a reasonable reimbursement procedure, it must occur after the expense is incurred. The final regulations also clarify the application of the 1 percent rule if multiple vouchers for a transit system are available for distribution by an employer to employees, and if multiple transit system vouchers are required in an area to meet the transit needs of an employer's employees. The final regulations provide that if multiple transit system vouchers are available for direct distribution to employees, the employer must consider the lowest cost voucher for purposes of determining whether the voucher provider fees cause vouchers to not be readily available. However, if multiple vouchers are required in an area to meet the transit needs of the individual employees in that area, the employer has the option of averaging the costs applied to vouchers from each system for purposes of determining whether the voucher provider fees cause vouchers to not be readily available. 2. Internal Administrative Costs Several commentators representing employers recommended that, in addition to fare media provider fees, internal administrative costs, especially security and distribution costs, should be considered in determining whether vouchers are readily available. These commentators noted that administrative costs are increased when an employer must maintain both a voucher system and a reimbursement system to provide qualified transportation fringes. For example, the employer may maintain a cash reimbursement system for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and qualified parking, and also maintain a voucher system for transit passes. In addition, several commentators suggested that the increased costs and administrative burden for employers that maintain offices in multiple cities should also be considered in determining whether vouchers are readily available. The final regulations retain the test considering only fees paid to voucher providers in determining availability based on a plain reading of the terms of the statute. The language ``readily available for direct distribution by the employer to the employee'' under section 132(f)(3) in its plain, ordinary sense means that vouchers are easily obtainable for direct distribution to the employer's employees. The determination of availability bears no relationship with costs that may be incurred after vouchers have been obtained. The service fees charged by voucher providers and delivery costs can reasonably be viewed as affecting whether vouchers are easily obtainable; an employer's internal costs of subsequently administering a voucher program would not. Thus, based upon the plain language of section 132(f), internal administrative costs do not affect whether vouchers are readily available. Moreover, the test considering only voucher provider fees is a comparatively simple bright line test. A test that depends on the employer's internal administrative costs would necessarily be complex, requiring complex rules that would be difficult for employers to apply. 3. Other Nonfinancial Restrictions Commentators representing employers suggested that nonfinancial factors should be considered in determining whether vouchers are readily available. They suggested that factors such as whether there are reasonable advance purchase and minimum purchase requirements, and whether vouchers can be purchased in appropriate denominations, should be considered in determining availability. The final regulations adopt this suggestion because nonfinancial restrictions would reasonably affect whether vouchers are available for distribution by an employer to an employee. The final regulations provide guidance on the types of nonfinancial restrictions that cause vouchers to not be readily available. The final regulations provide that certain nonfinancial restrictions, such as a voucher provider not making vouchers available for purchase at reasonable intervals or failing to provide the vouchers within a reasonable period after receiving payment for the voucher, cause vouchers to not be readily available. In addition, if a voucher provider does not provide vouchers in reasonably appropriate quantities, or in reasonably appropriate denominations, vouchers may not be readily available. When and as the standards in these final regulations go into effect, they will supercede the current law standards in Notice 943.  test, transit vouchers would not be considered readily available in some large metropolitan areas. These commentators assert that the 1 percent test is therefore contrary to the intent of the statute. Commentators suggested that the 1 percent test, particularly if combined with inadequate cash reimbursement substantiation requirements, may result in taxpayer abuse, with the result that the benefit might not be used for the purpose for which it is intended, which is to increase the use of mass transit. In addition, commentators testified at the public hearing that the mandatory use of vouchers (with no ability to use cash reimbursement if vouchers are readily available) would increase the use of vouchers and promote the development of advanced technologies that minimize the burden on employers while ensuring that the benefit is used for mass transit. These new technologies might allow an employer to make payment directly to the transit operator, who in turn credits fare to the employee's magnetic media fare card, thus eliminating the need for employers to incur the expense of distributing vouchers. Other commentators, in particular groups representing employers, generally favored the 1 percent test, but suggested that internal costs be considered in applying the test (discussed below). These commentators took the position that an increase in the percentage might affect the market charge for such services. There was also a concern that a strict voucher-use requirement would result in fewer employers adopting transit pass programs, thus frustrating the purpose of section 132(f) to increase the use of mass transit. The final regulations retain the 1 percent test. The 1 percent test, applicable for years beginning after December 31, 2003, is appropriate in light of the rule (discussed below) that only voucher provider fees are considered in determining availability. It is intended that the delayed application of this rule would provide sufficient time for those affected by this rule to modify their systems and procedures appropriately. The 1 percent threshold, coupled with the exclusion of internal administrative costs from the readily available determination, represents a balanced approach that will promote the growth of voucher programs in most transportation areas. In addition, raising the percentage threshold could curtail the growth in transit benefit programs, which would be contrary to the goal of increasing the use of mass transit. Finally, in cases where cash reimbursement is allowed,  VerDate 11 2000  21:58 Jan 10, 2001  Jkt 194001  PO 00000  Frm 00048  Fmt 4700  Sfmt 4700  E:\FR\FM\11JAR1.SGM  pfrm01  PsN: 11JAR1   Federal Register / Vol. 66, No. 8 / Thursday, January 11, 2001 / Rules and Regulations B. Advance Transit Passes Commentators suggested that the administrability of transit pass programs would be improved if vouchers were permitted to be distributed in advance for more than one month. The final regulations adopt this suggestion. In October of this year, the IRS issued Announcement 200078 (200043 I.R.B. 428) to notify taxpayers that, when finalized, the regulations will clarify that transit passes may be distributed in advance for more than one month (such as for a calendar quarter) by taking into account the monthly limits for all months for which the transit passes are distributed. The announcement further provides, however, that if an employee receives advance transit passes, and the employee's employment terminates before the beginning of the last month of the period for which the transit passes were provided, the employer must include in the employee's wages, for income and for employment tax purposes (FICA, FUTA, and income tax withholding), the value of the passes provided for those month(s) beginning after the employee's employment terminates to the extent the employer does not recover those transit passes or the value of those passes. The announcement provides that pending the issuance of these final regulations, employers may rely on the announcement. The final regulations differ from the announcement in one respect. In any case in which transit passes are provided in advance for a period of no more than three months (such as for a calendar quarter), but the recipient ceases to be an employee before the beginning of the last month in that period, the final regulations provide that the value of a transit pass provided in advance for a month is excluded from wages for employment tax (FICA, FUTA, and income tax withholding) purposes (but not for income tax purposes) unless at the time the transit passes were distributed there was an established termination date that was before the beginning of the last month of that period and the employee does in fact terminate employment before the beginning of the last month of that period. C. Qualified Parking The final regulations address whether reimbursement paid to an employee for parking at a work location away from the employee's permanent work location is excludable from wages for income and employment tax purposes under section 132(f). Section 132(f)(5)(C) defines qualified parking, in part, as ``parking provided to an employee on or near the business premises of the employer * * * .'' The final regulations provide that qualified parking includes parking on or near a work location at which the employee performs services for the employer. However, qualified parking does not include reimbursement for parking that is otherwise excludable from gross income as a reimbursement treated as paid under an accountable plan under  1.622 of the Income Tax Regulations, or parking provided in kind to an employee that is excludable from the employee's gross income as a working condition fringe under section 132(a)(3). Thus, if the exclusion at  1.622 or section 132(a)(3) is available (even if not reimbursed by the employer), then section 132(f) does not apply. Whether a reimbursement for local transportation expenses, including parking at a work location away from the employee's permanent work location, is excludable from the employee's gross income under  1.62 2, or whether parking provided in kind to an employee is excludable from the employee's gross income under section 132(a)(3), is determined based upon whether the parking expenses would be deductible if paid or incurred by the employee under section 162(a) as an expense incurred in the employee's trade or business of being an employee for the employer.  1.622(d); 1.132 5(a)(2). Revenue Ruling 997 (19991 C.B. 361) addresses under what circumstances daily transportation expenses, including parking, incurred by a taxpayer in going between the taxpayer's residence and a work location are deductible by the taxpayer under section 162(a). The final regulations provide the minimum requirements to ensure that transportation benefits are qualified transportation fringes under section 132(f). An employer may have a transit benefit program that is more restrictive than a program meeting the minimum requirements under the regulations. In addition, these regulations do not affect the application of authorities outside the Internal Revenue Code which may restrict a transportation benefit program. Federal Government agencies, for example, may be required by other federal law to implement restrictions beyond those required under these regulations. D. Applicability Date The regulations are generally applicable for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2001. However, in order to provide a transition period for those affected by the 1 percent rule  2243  (described under ``The 1 percent safe harbor'' in this preamble), that rule is applicable for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2003. Effect on Other Documents The following document is obsolete as of January 11, 2001: Announcement 200078 (200043 I.R.B. 428). The following document is modified as of the date these regulations become applicable (see Q/A25): Notice 943 (19941 C.B. 327). Special Analyses It has been determined that this Treasury Decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) does not apply to these regulations. A final regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared for the collection of information in this Treasury decision under 5 U.S.C. 604. A summary of the analysis is set forth in this preamble under the heading ``Summary of Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis.'' Summary of Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis This analysis is required under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6). The collection of information under this rule is based upon the requirements under section 132(f). We estimate that approximately 265,000 employers that provide qualified transportation fringes to their employees will be affected by the recordkeeping requirements of this rule. None of the comments received in response to the notice of proposed rulemaking specifically addressed the initial regulatory flexibility analysis. Section 132(f)(3) provides that qualified transportation fringes may be provided in the form of cash reimbursement. The legislative history indicates that an employer providing cash reimbursement to the employer's employees for qualified transportation fringes must establish a bona fide reimbursement arrangement. As a condition to providing cash reimbursement for qualified transportation fringes, this rule provides that employers must receive substantiation from employees. The objective of this rule is to ensure that reimbursements are made for qualified transportation fringes. Whether an arrangement constitutes a bona fide reimbursement arrangement varies depending on the facts and circumstances, including the method or  VerDate 11 2000  21:58 Jan 10, 2001  Jkt 194001  PO 00000  Frm 00049  Fmt 4700  Sfmt 4700  E:\FR\FM\11JAR1.SGM  pfrm01  PsN: 11JAR1   2244  Federal Register / Vol. 66, No. 8 / Thursday, January 11, 2001 / Rules and Regulations voucher be distributed in-kind by the employer is satisfied if the voucher is distributed by the employer or by another person on behalf of the employer (for example, if a transit operator credits amounts to the employee's fare card as a result of payments made to the operator by the employer). Drafting Information The principal author of these regulations is John Richards, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel (Exempt Organizations/Employment Tax/ Government Entities). However, other personnel from the IRS and Treasury Department participated in their development. List of Subjects 26 CFR Part 1 Employment taxes, Income taxes, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. 26 CFR Part 602 Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Adoption of Amendments to the Regulations Accordingly, 26 CFR parts 1 and 602 are amended as follows: PART 1--INCOME TAXES Paragraph 1. The authority citation for part 1 continues to read in part as follows: Authority: 26 U.S.C. 7805 * * *  methods of payment utilized within a mass transit system. An employee certification in either written or electronic form may be sufficient depending upon the facts and circumstances. For example, if receipts are not provided in the ordinary course of business, such as with respect to metered parking or used transit passes that cannot be returned to the user, an employee certification that expenses have been incurred constitutes a reasonable reimbursement procedure. A certification that expenses will be incurred in the future, by itself, is not a reasonable reimbursement procedure. There are no particular professional skills required to maintain these records. In addition, section 132(f)(4) provides that an employee may choose between cash compensation and qualified transportation fringes. This rule provides that an employer may allow an employee the choice to receive either a fixed amount of cash compensation at a specified future date or a fixed amount of qualified transportation fringes to be provided for a specified future period (such as qualified parking to be used during a future calendar month). This rule provides that employers must keep records with respect to employee compensation reduction elections. An employee's election must be in writing or some other permanent and verifiable form, and include the date of the election, the amount of compensation to be reduced, and the period for which the qualified transportation fringes will be provided. The objective of this rule is to ensure against recharacterization of taxable compensation after it has been paid to the employee. There are no particular professional skills required to maintain these records. A less burdensome alternative for small organizations would be to exempt those entities from the recordkeeping requirements under this rule. However, it would be inconsistent with the statutory provisions and legislative history to exempt those entities from the recordkeeping requirements imposed under this rule. This rule provides several options which avoid more burdensome recordkeeping requirements for small entities. This rule provides that (1) there are no substantiation requirements if the employer distributes transit passes in kind; (2) a compensation reduction election may be made electronically; (3) an election to reduce compensation may be automatically renewed; (4) an employer may provide for deemed compensation reduction elections under its qualified transportation fringe benefit plan; and (5) a requirement that a  provided before January 1, 1993.

(a) The following benefits are qualified transportation fringe benefits: (1) Transportation in a commuter highway vehicle. (2) Transit passes. (3) Qualified parking. (b) An employer may simultaneously provide an employee with any one or more of these three benefits. Q2. What is transportation in a commuter highway vehicle? A2. Transportation in a commuter highway vehicle is transportation provided by an employer to an employee in connection with travel between the employee's residence and place of employment. A commuter highway vehicle is a highway vehicle with a seating capacity of at least 6 adults (excluding the driver) and with respect to which at least 80 percent of the vehicle's mileage for a year is reasonably expected to be-- (a) For transporting employees in connection with travel between their residences and their place of employment; and (b) On trips during which the number of employees transported for commuting is at least one-half of the adult seating capacity of the vehicle (excluding the driver). Q3. What are transit passes? A3. A transit pass is any pass, token, farecard, voucher, or similar item (including an item exchangeable for fare media) that entitles a person to transportation-- (a) On mass transit facilities (whether or not publicly owned); or (b) Provided by any person in the business of transporting persons for compensation or hire in a highway vehicle with a seating capacity of at least 6 adults (excluding the driver). Q4. What is qualified parking? A4. (a) Qualified parking is parking provided to an employee by an employer-- (1) On or near the employer's business premises; or (2) At a location from which the employee commutes to work (including  commuting by carpool, commuter highway vehicle, mass transit facilities, or transportation provided by any person in the business of transporting persons for compensation or hire). (b) For purposes of section 132(f), parking on or near the employer's business premises includes parking on or near a work location at which the employee provides services for the employer. However, qualified parking does not include-- (1) The value of parking provided to an employee that is excludable from gross income under section 132(a)(3) (as a working condition fringe), or (2) Reimbursement paid to an employee for parking costs that is excludable from gross income as an amount treated as paid under an accountable plan. See  1.622. (c) However, parking on or near property used by the employee for residential purposes is not qualified parking. (d) Parking is provided by an employer if-- (1) The parking is on property that the employer owns or leases; (2) The employer pays for the parking; or (3) The employer reimburses the employee for parking expenses (see Q/ A16 of this section for rules relating to cash reimbursements). Q5. May qualified transportation fringes be provided to individuals who are not employees? A5. An employer may provide qualified transportation fringes only to individuals who are currently employees of the employer at the time the qualified transportation fringe is provided. The term employee for purposes of qualified transportation fringes is defined in  1.1321(b)(2)(i). This term includes only common law employees and other statutory employees, such as officers of corporations. See Q/A24 of this section for rules regarding partners, 2-percent shareholders, and independent contractors. Q6. Must a qualified transportation fringe benefit plan be in writing? A6. No. Section 132(f) does not require that a qualified transportation fringe benefit plan be in writing. Q7. Is there a limit on the value of qualified transportation fringes that may be excluded from an employee's gross income? A7. (a) Transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and transit passes. Before January 1, 2002, up to $65 per month is excludable from the gross income of an employee for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and transit passes provided by  an employer. On January 1, 2002, this amount is increased to $100 per month. (b) Parking. Up to $175 per month is excludable from the gross income of an employee for qualified parking. (c) Combination. An employer may provide qualified parking benefits in addition to transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and transit passes. (d) Cost-of-living adjustments. The amounts in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Q/A7 are adjusted annually, beginning with 2000, to reflect cost-of-living. The adjusted figures are announced by the Service before the beginning of the year. Q8. What amount is includible in an employee's wages for income and employment tax purposes if the value of the qualified transportation fringe exceeds the applicable statutory monthly limit? A8. (a) Generally, an employee must include in gross income the amount by which the fair market value of the benefit exceeds the sum of the amount, if any, paid by the employee and any amount excluded from gross income under section 132(a)(5). Thus, assuming no other statutory exclusion applies, if an employer provides an employee with a qualified transportation fringe that exceeds the applicable statutory monthly limit and the employee does not make any payment, the value of the benefits provided in excess of the applicable statutory monthly limit is included in the employee's wages for income and employment tax purposes. See  1.6121(b)(1). (b) The following examples illustrate the principles of this Q/A8: Example 1. (i) For each month in a year in which the statutory monthly transit pass limit is $100 (i.e., a year after 2001), Employer M provides a transit pass valued at $110 to Employee D, who does not pay any amount to Employer M for the transit pass. (ii) In this Example 1, because the value of the monthly transit pass exceeds the statutory monthly limit by $10, $120 ($110-- $100, times 12 months) must be included in D's wages for income and employment tax purposes for the year with respect to the transit passes. Example 2. (i) For each month in a year in which the statutory monthly qualified parking limit is $175, Employer M provides qualified parking valued at $195 to Employee E, who does not pay any amount to M for the parking. (ii) In this Example 2, because the fair market value of the qualified parking exceeds the statutory monthly limit by $20, $240 ($195--$175, times 12 months) must be included in Employee E's wages for income and employment tax purposes for the year with respect to the qualified parking. Example 3. (i) For each month in a year in which the statutory monthly qualified parking limit is $175, Employer P provides  VerDate 11 2000  21:58 Jan 10, 2001  Jkt 194001  PO 00000  Frm 00051  Fmt 4700  Sfmt 4700  E:\FR\FM\11JAR1.SGM  pfrm01  PsN: 11JAR1   2246  Federal Register / Vol. 66, No. 8 / Thursday, January 11, 2001 / Rules and Regulations employee's wages for income tax purposes. (2) Reporting and employment tax treatment. Transit passes distributed in advance to an employee are excludable from wages for employment tax purposes under sections 3121, 3306, and 3401 (FICA, FUTA, and income tax withholding) if the employer distributes transit passes to the employee in advance for not more than three months and, at the time the transit passes are distributed, there is not an established date that the employee's employment will terminate (for example, if the employee has given notice of retirement) which will occur before the beginning of the last month of the period for which the transit passes are provided. If the employer distributes transit passes to an employee in advance for not more than three months and at the time the transit passes are distributed there is an established date that the employee's employment will terminate, and the employee's employment does terminate before the beginning of the last month of the period for which the transit passes are provided, the value of transit passes provided for months beginning after the date of termination during which the employee is not employed by the employer is included in the employee's wages for employment tax purposes. If transit passes are distributed in advance for more than three months, the value of transit passes provided for the months during which the employee is not employed by the employer is includible in the employee's wages for employment tax purposes regardless of whether at the time the transit passes were distributed there was an established date of termination of the employee's employment. (d) Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of this Q/A9: Example 1. (i) Employee E incurs $150 for qualified parking used during the month of June of a year in which the statutory monthly parking limit is $175, for which E is reimbursed $150 by Employer R. Employee E incurs $180 in expenses for qualified parking used during the month of July of that year, for which E is reimbursed $180 by Employer R. (ii) In this Example 1, because monthly exclusion amounts may not be combined to provide a benefit in any month greater than the applicable statutory limit, the amount by which the amount reimbursed for July exceeds the applicable statutory monthly limit ($180 minus $175 equals $5) is includible in Employee E's wages for income and employment tax purposes. Example 2. (i) Employee F receives transit passes from Employer G with a value of $195 in March of a year (for which the statutory monthly transit pass limit is $65) for January, February, and March of that year. F was hired during January and has not received any transit passes from G. (ii) In this Example 2, the value of the transit passes (three months times $65 equals $195) is excludable from F's wages for income and employment tax purposes. Example 3. (i) Employer S has a qualified transportation fringe benefit plan under which its employees receive transit passes near the beginning of each calendar quarter for that calendar quarter. All employees of Employer S receive transit passes from Employer S with a value of $195 on March 31 for the second calendar quarter covering the months April, May, and June (of a year in which the statutory monthly transit pass limit is $65). (ii) In this Example 3, because the value of the transit passes may be calculated by taking into account the monthly limits for all months for which the transit passes are distributed, the value of the transit passes (three months times $65 equals $195) is excludable from the employees' wages for income and employment tax purposes. Example 4. (i) Same facts as in Example 3, except that Employee T, an employee of Employer S, terminates employment with S on May 31. There was not an established date of termination for Employee T at the time the transit passes were distributed. (ii) In this Example 4, because at the time the transit passes were distributed there was not an established date of termination for Employee T, the value of the transit passes provided for June ($65) is excludable from T's wages for employment tax purposes. However, the value of the transit passes distributed to Employee T for June ($65) is not excludable from T's wages for income tax purposes. (iii) If Employee T's May 31 termination date was established at the time the transit passes were provided, the value of the transit passes provided for June ($65) is included in T's wages for both income and employment tax purposes. Example 5. (i) Employer F has a qualified transportation fringe benefit plan under which its employees receive transit passes semi-annually in advance of the months for which the transit passes are provided. All employees of Employer F, including Employee X, receive transit passes from F with a value of $390 on June 30 for the 6 months of July through December (of a year in which the statutory monthly transit pass limit is $65). Employee X's employment terminates and his last day of work is August 1. Employer F's other employees remain employed throughout the remainder of the year. (ii) In this Example 5, the value of the transit passes provided to Employee X for the months September, October, November, and December ($65 times 4 months equals $260) of the year is included in X's wages for income and employment tax purposes. The value of the transit passes provided to Employer F's other employees is excludable from the employees' wages for income and employment tax purposes. Example 6. (i) Each month during a year in which the statutory monthly transit pass limit is $65, Employer R distributes transit  qualified parking with a fair market value of $220 per month to its employees, but charges each employee $45 per month. (ii) In this Example 3, because the sum of the amount paid by an employee ($45) plus the amount excludable for qualified parking ($175) is not less than the fair market value of the monthly benefit, no amount is includible in the employee's wages for income and employment tax purposes with respect to the qualified parking.  Q9. Are excludable qualified transportation fringes calculated on a monthly basis? A9. (a) In general. Yes. The value of transportation in a commuter highway vehicle, transit passes, and qualified parking is calculated on a monthly basis to determine whether the value of the benefit has exceeded the applicable statutory monthly limit on qualified transportation fringes. Except in the case of a transit pass provided to an employee, the applicable statutory monthly limit applies to qualified transportation fringes used by the employee in a month. Monthly exclusion amounts are not combined to provide a qualified transportation fringe for any month exceeding the statutory limit. A month is a calendar month or a substantially equivalent period applied consistently. (b) Transit passes. In the case of transit passes provided to an employee, the applicable statutory monthly limit applies to the transit passes provided by the employer to the employee in a month for that month or for any previous month in the calendar year. In addition, transit passes distributed in advance for more than one month, but not for more than twelve months, are qualified transportation fringes if the requirements in paragraph (c) of this Q/ A9 are met (relating to the income tax and employment tax treatment of advance transit passes). The applicable statutory monthly limit under section 132(f)(2) on the combined amount of transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and transit passes may be calculated by taking into account the monthly limits for all months for which the transit passes are distributed. In the case of a pass that is valid for more than one month, such as an annual pass, the value of the pass may be divided by the number of months for which it is valid for purposes of determining whether the value of the pass exceeds the statutory monthly limit. (c) Rule if employee's employment terminates--(1) Income tax treatment. The value of transit passes provided in advance to an employee with respect to a month in which the individual is not an employee is included in the  VerDate 11 2000  21:58 Jan 10, 2001  Jkt 194001  PO 00000  Frm 00052  Fmt 4700  Sfmt 4700  E:\FR\FM\11JAR1.SGM  pfrm01  PsN: 11JAR1   Federal Register / Vol. 66, No. 8 / Thursday, January 11, 2001 / Rules and Regulations passes with a face amount of $70 to each of its employees. Transit passes with a face amount of $70 can be purchased from the transit system by any individual for $65. (ii) In this Example 6, because the value of the transit passes distributed by Employer R does not exceed the applicable statutory monthly limit ($65), no portion of the value of the transit passes is included as wages for income and employment tax purposes.  2247  Q10. May an employee receive qualified transportation fringes from more than one employer? A10. (a) General rule. Yes. The statutory monthly limits described in Q/ A7 of this section apply to benefits provided by an employer to its employees. For this purpose, all employees treated as employed by a single employer under section 414(b), (c), (m), or (o) are treated as employed by a single employer. See section 414(t) and  1.1321(c). Thus, qualified transportation fringes paid by entities under common control under section 414(b), (c), (m), or (o) are combined for purposes of applying the applicable statutory monthly limit. In addition, an individual who is treated as a leased employee of the employer under section 414(n) is treated as an employee of that employer for purposes of section 132. See section 414(n)(3)(C). (b) Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of this Q/A10: Example 1. (i) During a year in which the statutory monthly qualified parking limit is $175, Employee E works for Employers M and N, who are unrelated and not treated as a single employer under section 414(b), (c), (m), or (o). Each month, M and N each provide qualified parking benefits to E with a value of $100. (ii) In this Example 1, because M and N are unrelated employers, and the value of the monthly parking benefit provided by each is not more than the applicable statutory monthly limit, the parking benefits provided by each employer are excludable as qualified transportation fringes assuming that the other requirements of this section are satisfied. Example 2. (i) Same facts as in Example 1, except that Employers M and N are treated as a single employer under section 414(b). (ii) In this Example 2, because M and N are treated as a single employer, the value of the monthly parking benefit provided by M and N must be combined for purposes of determining whether the applicable statutory monthly limit has been exceeded. Thus, the amount by which the value of the parking benefit exceeds the monthly limit ($200 minus the monthly limit amount of $175 equals $25) for each month in the year is includible in E's wages for income and employment tax purposes.  Q11. May qualified transportation fringes be provided to employees pursuant to a compensation reduction agreement? A11. Yes. An employer may offer employees a choice between cash  compensation and any qualified transportation fringe. An employee who is offered this choice and who elects qualified transportation fringes is not required to include the cash compensation in income if-- (a) The election is pursuant to an arrangement described in Q/A12 of this section; (b) The amount of the reduction in cash compensation does not exceed the limitation in Q/A13 of this section; (c) The arrangement satisfies the timing and reimbursement rules in Q/ A14 and 16 of this section; and (d) The related fringe benefit arrangement otherwise satisfies the requirements set forth elsewhere in this section. Q12. What is a compensation reduction election for purposes of section 132(f)? A12. (a) Election requirements generally. A compensation reduction arrangement is an arrangement under which the employer provides the employee with the right to elect whether the employee will receive either a fixed amount of cash compensation at a specified future date or a fixed amount of qualified transportation fringes to be provided for a specified future period (such as qualified parking to be used during a future calendar month). The employee's election must be in writing or another form, such as electronic, that includes, in a permanent and verifiable form, the information required to be in the election. The election must contain the date of the election, the amount of the compensation to be reduced, and the period for which the benefit will be provided. The election must relate to a fixed dollar amount or fixed percentage of compensation reduction. An election to reduce compensation for a period by a set amount for such period may be automatically renewed for subsequent periods. (b) Automatic election permitted. An employer may provide under its qualified transportation fringe benefit plan that a compensation reduction election will be deemed to have been made if the employee does not elect to receive cash compensation in lieu of the qualified transportation fringe, provided that the employee receives adequate notice that a compensation reduction will be made and is given adequate opportunity to choose to receive the cash compensation instead of the qualified transportation fringe. Q13. Is there a limit to the amount of the compensation reduction? A13. Yes. Each month, the amount of the compensation reduction may not exceed the combined applicable statutory monthly limits for  transportation in a commuter highway vehicle, transit passes, and qualified parking. For example, for a year in which the statutory monthly limit is $65 for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and transit passes, and $175 for qualified parking, an employee could elect to reduce compensation for any month by no more than $240 ($65 plus $175) with respect to qualified transportation fringes. If an employee were to elect to reduce compensation by $250 for a month, the excess $10 ($250 minus $240) would be includible in the employee's wages for income and employment tax purposes. Q14. When must the employee have made a compensation reduction election and under what circumstances may the amount be paid in cash to the employee? A14. (a) The compensation reduction election must satisfy the requirements set forth under paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this Q/A14. (b) Timing of election. The compensation reduction election must be made before the employee is able currently to receive the cash or other taxable amount at the employee's discretion. The determination of whether the employee is able currently to receive the cash does not depend on whether it has been constructively received for purposes of section 451. The election must specify that the period (such as a calendar month) for which the qualified transportation fringe will be provided must not begin before the election is made. Thus, a compensation reduction election must relate to qualified transportation fringes to be provided after the election. For this purpose, the date a qualified transportation fringe is provided is-- (1) The date the employee receives a voucher or similar item; or (2) In any other case, the date the employee uses the qualified transportation fringe. (c) Revocability of elections. The employee may not revoke a compensation reduction election after the employee is able currently to receive the cash or other taxable amount at the employee's discretion. In addition, the election may not be revoked after the beginning of the period for which the qualified transportation fringe will be provided. (d) Compensation reduction amounts not refundable. Unless an election is revoked in a manner consistent with paragraph (c) of this Q/A14, an employee may not subsequently receive the compensation (in cash or any form other than by payment of a qualified transportation fringe under the employer's plan). Thus, an employer's  VerDate 11 2000  21:58 Jan 10, 2001  Jkt 194001  PO 00000  Frm 00053  Fmt 4700  Sfmt 4700  E:\FR\FM\11JAR1.SGM  pfrm01  PsN: 11JAR1   2248  Federal Register / Vol. 66, No. 8 / Thursday, January 11, 2001 / Rules and Regulations transportation fringes used by the employee on or after the payroll date up to the compensation reduction amount elected by the employee for that payroll date. Example 2. (i) Employee Q elects to reduce his compensation payable on March 1 of a year (for which the statutory monthly mass transit limit is $65) by $195 in exchange for a mass transit voucher to be provided in March. The election is made on the preceding February 27. Employee Q was hired in January of the year. On March 10 of the year, the employer of Employee Q delivers to Employee Q a mass transit voucher worth $195 for the months of January, February, and March. (ii) In this Example 2, $65 is included in Employee Q's wages for income and employment tax purposes because the compensation reduction election fails to satisfy the requirement in this Q/A14 and Q/A12 of this section that the period for which the qualified transportation fringe will be provided not begin before the election is made to the extent the election relates to $65 worth of transit passes for January of the year. The $65 for February is not taxable because the election was for a future period that includes at least one day in February. (iii) However, no amount would be included in Employee Q's wages as a result of the election if $195 worth of mass transit passes were instead provided to Q for the months of February, March, and April (because the compensation reduction would relate solely to fringes to be provided for a period not beginning before the date of the election and the amount provided does not exceed the aggregate limit for the period, i.e., the sum of $65 for each of February, March, and April). See Q/A9 of this section for rules governing transit passes distributed in advance for more than one month. Example 3. (i) Employee R elects to reduce his compensation payable on March 1 of a year (for which the statutory monthly parking limit is $175) by $185 in exchange for reimbursement by Employer T of parking expenses incurred by Employee R for parking on or near Employer T's business premises during the period beginning after the date of the election through March. The election is made on the preceding February 27. Employee R incurs $10 in parking expenses on February 28 of the year, and $175 in parking expenses during the month of March. On April 5 of the year, Employer T reimburses Employee R $185 for the parking expenses incurred on February 28, and during March, of the year. (ii) In this Example 3, no amount would be includible in Employee R's wages for income and employment tax purposes because the compensation reduction related solely to parking on or near Employer R's business premises used during a period not beginning before the date of the election and the amount reimbursed for parking used in any one month does not exceed the statutory monthly limitation.  qualified transportation fringe benefit plan may not provide that an employee who ceases to participate in the employer's qualified transportation fringe benefit plan (such as in the case of termination of employment) is entitled to receive a refund of the amount by which the employee's compensation reductions exceed the actual qualified transportation fringes provided to the employee by the employer. (e) Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of this Q/A14: Example 1. (i) Employer P maintains a qualified transportation fringe benefit arrangement during a year in which the statutory monthly limit is $100 for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and transit passes (2002 or later) and $180 for qualified parking. Employees of P are paid cash compensation twice per month, with the payroll dates being the first and the fifteenth day of the month. Under P's arrangement, an employee is permitted to elect at any time before the first day of a month to reduce his or her compensation payable during that month in an amount up to the applicable statutory monthly limit ($100 if the employee elects coverage for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle or a mass transit pass, or $180 if the employee chooses qualified parking) in return for the right to receive qualified transportation fringes up to the amount of the election. If such an election is made, P will provide a mass transit pass for that month with a value not exceeding the compensation reduction amount elected by the employee or will reimburse the cost of other qualified transportation fringes used by the employee on or after the first day of that month up to the compensation reduction amount elected by the employee. Any compensation reduction amount elected by the employee for the month that is not used for qualified transportation fringes is not refunded to the employee at any future date. (ii) In this Example 1, the arrangement satisfies the requirements of this Q/A14 because the election is made before the employee is able currently to receive the cash and the election specifies the future period for which the qualified transportation fringes will be provided. The arrangement would also satisfy the requirements of this Q/A14 and Q/A13 of this section if employees are allowed to elect to reduce compensation up to $280 per month ($100 plus $180). (iii) The arrangement would also satisfy the requirements of this Q/A14 (and Q/A13 of this section) if employees are allowed to make an election at any time before the first or the fifteenth day of the month to reduce their compensation payable on that payroll date by an amount not in excess of one-half of the applicable statutory monthly limit (depending on the type of qualified transportation fringe elected by the employee) and P provides a mass transit pass on or after the applicable payroll date for the compensation reduction amount elected by the employee for the payroll date or reimburses the cost of other qualified  A15. (a) Yes. An employee may carry over unused compensation reduction amounts to subsequent periods under the plan of the employee's employer. (b) The following example illustrates the principles of this Q/A15: Example. (i) By an election made before November 1 of a year for which the statutory monthly mass transit limit is $65, Employee E elects to reduce compensation in the amount of $65 for the month of November. E incurs $50 in employee-operated commuter highway vehicle expenses during November for which E is reimbursed $50 by Employer R, E's employer. By an election made before December, E elects to reduce compensation by $65 for the month of December. E incurs $65 in employee-operated commuter highway vehicle expenses during December for which E is reimbursed $65 by R. Before the following January, E elects to reduce compensation by $50 for the month of January. E incurs $65 in employee-operated commuter highway vehicle expenses during January for which E is reimbursed $65 by R because R allows E to carry over to the next year the $15 amount by which the compensation reductions for November and December exceeded the employee-operated commuter highway vehicle expenses incurred during those months. (ii) In this Example, because Employee E is reimbursed in an amount not exceeding the applicable statutory monthly limit, and the reimbursement does not exceed the amount of employee-operated commuter highway vehicle expenses incurred during the month of January, the amount reimbursed ($65) is excludable from E's wages for income and employment tax purposes.  Q15. May an employee whose qualified transportation fringe costs are less than the employee's compensation reduction carry over this excess amount to subsequent periods?  Q16. How does section 132(f) apply to expense reimbursements? A16. (a) In general. The term qualified transportation fringe includes cash reimbursement by an employer to an employee for expenses incurred or paid by an employee for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle or qualified parking. The term qualified transportation fringe also includes cash reimbursement for transit passes made under a bona fide reimbursement arrangement, but, in accordance with section 132(f)(3), only if permitted under paragraph (b) of this Q/A16. The reimbursement must be made under a bona fide reimbursement arrangement which meets the rules of paragraph (c) of this Q/A16. A payment made before the date an expense has been incurred or paid is not a reimbursement. In addition, a bona fide reimbursement arrangement does not include an arrangement that is dependent solely upon an employee certifying in advance that the employee will incur expenses at some future date. (b) Special rule for transit passes--(1) In general. The term qualified transportation fringe includes cash reimbursement for transit passes made  VerDate 11 2000  21:58 Jan 10, 2001  Jkt 194001  PO 00000  Frm 00054  Fmt 4700  Sfmt 4700  E:\FR\FM\11JAR1.SGM  pfrm01  PsN: 11JAR1   Federal Register / Vol. 66, No. 8 / Thursday, January 11, 2001 / Rules and Regulations under a bona fide reimbursement arrangement, but, in accordance with section 132(f)(3), only if no voucher or similar item that may be exchanged only for a transit pass is readily available for direct distribution by the employer to employees. If a voucher is readily available, the requirement that a voucher be distributed in-kind by the employer is satisfied if the voucher is distributed by the employer or by another person on behalf of the employer (for example, if a transit operator credits amounts to the employee's fare card as a result of payments made to the operator by the employer). (2) Voucher or similar item. For purposes of the special rule in paragraph (b) of this Q/A16, a transit system voucher is an instrument that may be purchased by employers from a voucher provider that is accepted by one or more mass transit operators (e.g., train, subway, and bus) in an area as fare media or in exchange for fare media. Thus, for example, a transit pass that may be purchased by employers directly from a voucher provider is a transit system voucher. (3) Voucher provider. The term voucher provider means any person in the trade or business of selling transit system vouchers to employers, or any transit system or transit operator that sells vouchers to employers for the purpose of direct distribution to employees. Thus, a transit operator might or might not be a voucher provider. A voucher provider is not, for example, a third-party employee benefits administrator that administers a transit pass benefit program for an employer using vouchers that the employer could obtain directly. (4) Readily available. For purposes of this paragraph (b), a voucher or similar item is readily available for direct distribution by the employer to employees if and only if an employer can obtain it from a voucher provider that-- (i) does not impose fare media charges that cause vouchers to not be readily available as described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section; and (ii) does not impose other restrictions that cause vouchers to not be readily available as described in paragraph (b)(6) of this section. (5) Fare media charges. For purposes of paragraph (b)(4) of this section, fare media charges relate only to fees paid by the employer to voucher providers for vouchers. The determination of whether obtaining a voucher would result in fare media charges that cause vouchers to not be readily available as described in this paragraph (b) is made with respect to each transit system voucher. If more than one transit system voucher is available for direct distribution to employees, the employer must consider the fees imposed for the lowest cost monthly voucher for purposes of determining whether the fees imposed by the voucher provider satisfy this paragraph. However, if transit system vouchers for multiple transit systems are required in an area to meet the transit needs of the individual employees in that area, the employer has the option of averaging the costs applied to each transit system voucher for purposes of determining whether the fare media charges for transit system vouchers satisfy this paragraph. Fare media charges are described in this paragraph (b)(5), and therefore cause vouchers to not be readily available, if and only if the average annual fare media charges that the employer reasonably expects to incur for transit system vouchers purchased from the voucher provider (disregarding reasonable and customary delivery charges imposed by the voucher provider, e.g., not in excess of $15) are more than 1 percent of the average annual value of the vouchers for a transit system. (6) Other restrictions. For purposes of paragraph (b)(4) of this section, restrictions that cause vouchers to not be readily available are restrictions imposed by the voucher provider other than fare media charges that effectively prevent the employer from obtaining vouchers appropriate for distribution to employees. Examples of such restrictions include-- (i) Advance purchase requirements. Advance purchase requirements cause vouchers to not be readily available only if the voucher provider does not offer vouchers at regular intervals or fails to provide the voucher within a reasonable period after receiving payment for the voucher. For example, a requirement that vouchers may be purchased only once per year may effectively prevent an employer from obtaining vouchers for distribution to employees. An advance purchase requirement that vouchers be purchased not more frequently than monthly does not effectively prevent the employer from obtaining vouchers for distribution to employees. (ii) Purchase quantity requirements. Purchase quantity requirements cause vouchers to not be readily available if the voucher provider does not offer vouchers in quantities that are reasonably appropriate to the number of the employer's employees who use mass transportation (for example, the voucher provider requires a $1,000 minimum  2249  purchase and the employer seeks to purchase only $200 of vouchers). (iii) Limitations on denominations of vouchers that are available. If the voucher provider does not offer vouchers in denominations appropriate for distribution to the employer's employees, vouchers are not readily available. For example, vouchers provided in $5 increments up to the monthly limit are appropriate for distribution to employees, while vouchers available only in a denomination equal to the monthly limit are not appropriate for distribution to employees if the amount of the benefit provided to the employer's employees each month is normally less than the monthly limit. (7) Example. The following example illustrates the principles of this paragraph (b): Example. (i) Company C in City X sells mass transit vouchers to employers in the metropolitan area of X in various denominations appropriate for distribution to employees. Employers can purchase vouchers monthly in reasonably appropriate quantities. Several different bus, rail, van pool, and ferry operators service X, and a number of the operators accept the vouchers either as fare media or in exchange for fare media. To cover its operating expenses, C imposes on each voucher a 50 cents charge, plus a reasonable and customary $15 charge for delivery of each order of vouchers. Employer M disburses vouchers purchased from C to its employees who use operators that accept the vouchers and M reasonably expects that $55 is the average value of the voucher it will purchase from C for the next calendar year. (ii) In this Example, vouchers for X are readily available for direct distribution by the employer to employees because the expected cost of the vouchers disbursed to M's employees for the next calendar year is not more than 1 percent of the value of the vouchers (50 cents divided by $55 equals 0.91 percent), the delivery charges are disregarded because they are reasonable and customary, and there are no other restrictions that cause the vouchers to not be readily available. Thus, any reimbursement of mass transportation costs in X would not be a qualified transportation fringe.  (c) Substantiation requirements. Employers that make cash reimbursements must establish a bona fide reimbursement arrangement to establish that their employees have, in fact, incurred expenses for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle, transit passes, or qualified parking. For purposes of section 132(f), whether cash reimbursements are made under a bona fide reimbursement arrangement may vary depending on the facts and circumstances, including the method or methods of payment utilized within the mass transit system.

See Q/A8 and 9 of this section if the limit for a month is exceeded. (b) Example. The following example illustrates the principles of this Q/A17: Example. (i) Employee R pays $100 per month for qualified parking used during the period from April 1 through June 30 of a year in which the statutory monthly qualified parking limit is $175. After receiving adequate substantiation from Employee R, R's employer reimburses R $300 in cash on June 30 of that year. (ii) In this Example, because the value of the reimbursed expenses for each month did not exceed the applicable statutory monthly limit, the $300 reimbursement is excludable from R's wages for income and employment tax purposes as a qualified transportation fringe.  employer must implement reasonable procedures to ensure that an amount equal to the reimbursement was incurred for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle, transit passes, or qualified parking. The expense must be substantiated within a reasonable period of time. An expense substantiated to the payor within 180 days after it has been paid will be treated as having been substantiated within a reasonable period of time. An employee certification at the time of reimbursement in either written or electronic form may be a reasonable reimbursement procedure depending on the facts and circumstances. Examples of reasonable reimbursement procedures are set forth in paragraph (d) of this Q/ A16. (d) Illustrations of reasonable reimbursement procedures. The following are examples of reasonable reimbursement procedures for purposes of paragraph (c) of this Q/A16. In each case, the reimbursement is made at or within a reasonable period after the end of the events described in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(3) of this section. (1) An employee presents to the employer a parking expense receipt for parking on or near the employer's business premises, the employee certifies that the parking was used by the employee, and the employer has no reason to doubt the employee's certification. (2) An employee either submits a used time-sensitive transit pass (such as a monthly pass) to the employer and certifies that he or she purchased it or presents an unused or used transit pass to the employer and certifies that he or she purchased it and the employee certifies that he or she has not previously been reimbursed for the transit pass. In both cases, the employer has no reason to doubt the employee's certification. (3) If a receipt is not provided in the ordinary course of business (e.g., if the employee uses metered parking or if used transit passes cannot be returned to the user), the employee certifies to the employer the type and the amount of expenses incurred, and the employer has no reason to doubt the employee's certification. Q17. May an employer provide nontaxable cash reimbursement under section 132(f) for periods longer than one month? A17. (a) General rule. Yes. Qualified transportation fringes include reimbursement to employees for costs incurred for transportation in more than one month, provided the reimbursement for each month in the period is calculated separately and does not  Q18. What are the substantiation requirements if an employer distributes transit passes? A18. There are no substantiation requirements if the employer distributes transit passes. Thus, an employer may distribute a transit pass for each month with a value not more than the statutory monthly limit without requiring any certification from the employee regarding the use of the transit pass. Q19. May an employer choose to impose substantiation requirements in addition to those described in this regulation? A19. Yes. Q20. How is the value of parking determined? A20. Section 1.6121(b)(2) applies for purposes of determining the value of parking. Q21. How do the qualified transportation fringe rules apply to van pools? A21. (a) Van pools generally. Employer and employee-operated van pools, as well as private or public transit-operated van pools, may qualify as qualified transportation fringes. The value of van pool benefits which are qualified transportation fringes may be excluded up to the applicable statutory monthly limit for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and transit passes, less the value of any transit passes provided by the employer for the month. (b) Employer-operated van pools. The value of van pool transportation provided by or for an employer to its employees is excludable as a qualified transportation fringe, provided the van qualifies as a commuter highway vehicle as defined in section 132(f)(5)(B) and Q/A2 of this section. A van pool is operated by or for the employer if the employer purchases or leases vans to enable employees to commute together  or the employer contracts with and pays a third party to provide the vans and some or all of the costs of operating the vans, including maintenance, liability insurance and other operating expenses. (c) Employee-operated van pools. Cash reimbursement by an employer to employees for expenses incurred for transportation in a van pool operated by employees independent of their employer are excludable as qualified transportation fringes, provided that the van qualifies as a commuter highway vehicle as defined in section 132(f)(5)(B) and Q/A2 of this section. See Q/A16 of this section for the rules governing cash reimbursements. (d) Private or public transit-operated van pool transit passes. The qualified transportation fringe exclusion for transit passes is available for travel in van pools owned and operated either by public transit authorities or by any person in the business of transporting persons for compensation or hire. In accordance with paragraph (b) of Q/A 3 of this section, the van must seat at least 6 adults (excluding the driver). See Q/A16(b) and (c) of this section for a special rule for cash reimbursement for transit passes and the substantiation requirements for cash reimbursement. (e) Value of van pool transportation benefits. Section 1.6121(b)(2) provides that the fair market value of a fringe benefit is based on all the facts and circumstances. Alternatively, transportation in an employer-provided commuter highway vehicle may be valued under the automobile lease valuation rule in  1.6121(d), the vehicle cents-per-mile rule in  1.61 21(e), or the commuting valuation rule in  1.6121(f). If one of these special valuation rules is used, the employer must use the same valuation rule to value the use of the commuter highway vehicle by each employee who share the use. See  1.6121(c)(2)(i)(B). (f) Qualified parking prime member. If an employee obtains a qualified parking space as a result of membership in a car or van pool, the applicable statutory monthly limit for qualified parking applies to the individual to whom the parking space is assigned. This individual is the prime member. In determining the tax consequences to the prime member, the statutory monthly limit amounts of each car pool member may not be combined. If the employer provides access to the space and the space is not assigned to a particular individual, then the employer must designate one of its employees as the prime member who will bear the tax consequences. The employer may not designate more than one prime member for a car or van pool during a month.

Q22. What are the reporting and employment tax requirements for qualified transportation fringes? A22. (a) Employment tax treatment generally. Qualified transportation fringes not exceeding the applicable statutory monthly limit described in Q/ A7 of this section are not wages for purposes of the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA), the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), and federal income tax withholding. Any amount by which an employee elects to reduce compensation as provided in Q/ A11 of this section is not subject to the FICA, the FUTA, and federal income tax withholding. Qualified transportation fringes exceeding the applicable statutory monthly limit described in Q/ A7 of this section are wages for purposes of the FICA, the FUTA, and federal income tax withholding and are reported on the employee's Form W2, Wage and Tax Statement. (b) Employment tax treatment of cash reimbursement exceeding monthly limits. Cash reimbursement to employees (for example, cash reimbursement for qualified parking) in excess of the applicable statutory monthly limit under section 132(f) is treated as paid for employment tax purposes when actually or constructively paid. See  31.3121(a) 2(a), 31.33014, 31.3402(a)1(b) of this chapter. Employers must report and deposit the amounts withheld in addition to reporting and depositing other employment taxes. See Q/A16 of this section for rules governing cash reimbursements. (c) Noncash fringe benefits exceeding monthly limits. If the value of noncash qualified transportation fringes exceeds the applicable statutory monthly limit, the employer may elect, for purposes of the FICA, the FUTA, and federal income tax withholding, to treat the noncash taxable fringe benefits as paid on a pay period, quarterly, semi-annual, annual, or other basis, provided that the benefits are treated as paid no less frequently than annually. Q23. How does section 132(f) interact with other fringe benefit rules? A23. For purposes of section 132, the terms working condition fringe and de minimis fringe do not include any qualified transportation fringe under section 132(f). If, however, an employer provides local transportation other than transit passes (without any direct or indirect compensation reduction election), the value of the benefit may be excludable, either totally or partially, under fringe benefit rules other than the qualified transportation fringe rules under section 132(f). See  1.132 6(d)(2)(i) (occasional local transportation fare), 1.1326(d)(2)(iii) (transportation provided under unusual circumstances), and 1.6121(k) (valuation of local transportation provided to qualified employees). See also Q/A4(b) of this section. Q24. May qualified transportation fringes be provided to individuals who are partners, 2-percent shareholders of S-corporations, or independent contractors? A24. (a) General rule. Section 132(f)(5)(E) states that self-employed individuals who are employees within the meaning of section 401(c)(1) are not employees for purposes of section 132(f). Therefore, individuals who are partners, sole proprietors, or other independent contractors are not employees for purposes of section 132(f). In addition, under section 1372(a), 2-percent shareholders of S corporations are treated as partners for fringe benefit purposes. Thus, an individual who is both a 2-percent shareholder of an S corporation and a common law employee of that S corporation is not considered an employee for purposes of section 132(f). However, while section 132(f) does not apply to individuals who are partners, 2-percent shareholders of S corporations, or independent contractors, other exclusions for working condition and de minimis fringes may be available as described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this Q/A24. See  1.1321(b)(2) and 1.1321(b)(4). (b) Transit passes. The working condition and de minimis fringe exclusions under section 132(a)(3) and (4) are available for transit passes provided to individuals who are partners, 2-percent shareholders, and independent contractors. For example, tokens or farecards provided by a partnership to an individual who is a partner that enable the partner to commute on a public transit system (not including privately-operated van pools) are excludable from the partner's gross income if the value of the tokens and farecards in any month does not exceed the dollar amount specified in  1.132 6(d)(1). However, if the value of a pass provided in a month exceeds the dollar amount specified in  1.1326(d)(1), the full value of the benefit provided (not merely the amount in excess of the dollar amount specified in  1.132 6(d)(1)) is includible in gross income. (c) Parking. The working condition fringe rules under section 132(d) do not  2251  apply to commuter parking. See  1.1325(a)(1). However, the de minimis fringe rules under section 132(e) are available for parking provided to individuals who are partners, 2percent shareholders, or independent contractors that qualifies under the de minimis rules. See  1.1326(a) and (b). (d) Example. The following example illustrates the principles of this Q/A24: Example. (i) Individual G is a partner in partnership P. Individual G commutes to and from G's office every day and parks free of charge in P's lot. (ii) In this Example, the value of the parking is not excluded under section 132(f), but may be excluded under section 132(e) if the parking is a de minimis fringe under  1.1326.  Q25. What is the effective date of this section? A25. (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this Q/A25, this section is applicable for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2001. (b) The last sentence of paragraph (b)(5) of Q/A16 of this section (relating to whether transit system vouchers for transit passes are readily available) is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2003.

GX229-76-12404513	"OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL  Cost Benefit Analysis of Employee Transportation Subsidies  Inspection Report OIG-IR-02-00  December 20, 1999   OIG-IR-02-00  Cost Benefit Analysis of Employee Transportation Subsidies I. INTRODUCTION A. Background  On December 2, 1993, PL 103-72, Federal Employees Clean Air Incentives Act, was enacted ""to improve air quality and to reduce traffic congestion by providing for the establishment of programs to encourage Federal employees to commute by means other than single-occupancy motor vehicles"". The act provided Federal agencies with the authority to establish their own programs for accomplishing this purpose. Options that an agency head might consider include: (1) transit passes (i.e. cash subsidy) in addition to salary, (2) furnishing space, facilities, or services to bicyclists; and (3) any non-monetary incentive which the agency head may otherwise offer under any other provision of law or other authority. B. Recent Developments  An additional option for mass transit subsidy programs was provided by the enactment of PL 105-78, the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), dated June 9, 1998. TEA-21 amended the Internal Revenue Code 1 to allow employees to receive mass transit or van pool benefits in lieu of current salary. This tax treatment had already been in effect for employee parking benefits. For Federal employees, this change to the Figure 2 G13(6) VA Employee with Pre-Tax Deduction tax code means that they can receive a PreTax deduction in the amount of qualifying Pay Rate Hours Standard Pay With Pre-Tax Deduction mass transit and van pool expenses. See 1 GS-13(6) 32.44 80 $2,595.20 $2,595.20 2 Pre-Tax Deduction $32.50 Fig. 1, Line 2.

TEA-21 also provides for indexing these limits for inflation after calendar year 1999. The TEA-21 limit on nontaxable parking benefits is currently $175 per month. This limit is also indexed for inflation after calendar year 1999. C. Commission's Current Program  Pursuant to the authority granted by PL 103-72, the Commission established a Mass Transit Subsidy program.2 The general requirement for participation in the program is that employees regularly commute via mass transit and are not named as car pool members at the Commission or any other Federal agency. The Director, Office of Facilities Management (OFM) is responsible for enrolling and checking eligibility of participants, determining the subsidy amount, and issuing fare cards. The Commission's program distributes a metro fare card each month with a face value of $33 to each of the employees in the program. As shown in Figure 2, the Commission spent $65,700 for the Mass Transit Subsidy Program in FY 1999 and distributed 2189 Metro fare cards at a cost of $30 each.3 Since the value of the transit benefit is less than $65 a month, the entire benefit is excluded from taxable income. Fare cards received by employees can be used directly on the Metrorail or can be exchanged for the purchase of fares on other providers of public transportation, including MARC, VRE, Metrobus, county and commuter buses and qualified van pool operators. Figure 2 Commission's FY 1998-1999 Mass Transit Subsidy Program Fiscal Year 1998 1999 Budget Costs $60k $72k Actual Costs $59.5k $65.7k Total # of Cards 1985 2189 Avg Users per month 165 182  II.  OBJECTIVE  The objective of this inspection is to define and evaluate alternatives for transportation subsidies that the Commission may consider implementing under the authority of PL 103-72 and in light of the amendments to the Internal Revenue Code made by TEA-21.  2 3  USITC Administrative Notice 3001, dated May 15, 1997.

SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY  OIG reviewed the following laws and regulations and other applicable documents:  PL 103-172, Federal Employees Clean Air Incentives Act, dated December 2, 1993, effective January 1, 1994.  PL 105-178, Transportation Equity Act for the 21 Century, dated June 9, 1998.  USITC Administrative Notice, USITC-N-3001, Mass Transit subsidy program, dated November 23, 1998.

Subject area information from the Web sites of the WMATA, U.S. Department of Transportation, State of Virginia, State of Maryland and District of Columbia.  OFM provided a list of 221 employees that were initially listed as receiving mass transit subsidies in October 1999. OIG conducted an e-mail survey of the 221 employees on November 4-17, 1999. Employees were requested to estimate their monthly mass transit related expenses (including parking) and provide the state in which they pay state taxes. OIG received responses from 209 employees.4 Additionally, OIG obtained from the Office of Personnel grade/step level and retirement plan type for each of the 221 employees. Using the survey and personnel data, a spread sheet analysis was conducted comparing the costs and benefits of five mass transit subsidy alternatives: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. No subsidy (base case) Current cash subsidy ( $33 fare card per month) Maximum cash subsidy alone (up to the current $65 per month limit) Maximum Pre-Tax deduction alone (up to the current $65 per month limit) Combination of current cash subsidy and Pre-Tax deduction ($33 fare card plus a Pre-Tax deduction up to the current $65 per month limit)  Yearly individual and total employee benefits and agency costs for each alternative were calculated and compared for the 209 employees. For calculation purposes, salary, tax rates and transportation costs were assumed to be those in effect as of October 1999. In addition, yearly employee benefits and agency costs for cash and pre-tax deduction parking subsidy alternatives were calculated for a typical employee. The parking subsidy alternatives considered were those that could be authorized under PL 103-72.  Four employees were removed from the list due to retirement, 2 due to hospitalization, and 3 who had previously withdrawn from the program. Additionally, the 3 OIG employees receiving benefits were excluded from this Inspection, to avoid the appearance of any conflict of interest.  4  3   OIG-IR-02-00 IV. FINDINGS A. Survey Data Figure 3 Distribution of Employees Monthly Mass Transit Expenses 90 80 Number of Employees 70 60 68 63 78  General characteristics of the population of survey respondents in terms of grade level and locality are provided in Appendix I.  Figure 3, shows the number of employees 50 with monthly transit expenses between $0- 40 $65, between $66-$100 and greater than 30 $100. These divisions correspond to the 20 current deductible limit ($65) on 10 0 transportation fringe benefits and the limit $0-$65 $65-$100 >$100 that becomes effective in 2002 ($100). If Ranges of Monthly Mass Transit Expenses the Commission were considering raising the fare card subsidy level to $65 or higher, this figure shows that a large number of employees would not qualify for the full benefit. The Commission would either have to provide these employees with lesser valued fare cards or the employees would have to return to the Commission used fare cards with more than $5.00 in remaining value at the end of the month. Either case would result in an increased administrative burden. Providing an additional Pre-Tax deduction on the other hand, would not result in a significant increase in the administrative burden because the benefit could be handled through payroll processing. More detail on the distribution of monthly mass transit expenses is shown in Figure 4.

The upward trend in mass transit usage since October 1998 would appear to indicate the Commission's mass transit subsidy program has been successful in meeting the goal of PL 103-72 of reducing the number of single occupancy vehicles being used to commute to work.

Analysis of Mass Transit Subsidy Alternatives  Figure 6 provides a summary of the costs and benefits for each of the five alternatives OIG analyzed. Figure 6 Commission Mass Transit Subsidy Alternatives Total Cash Equivalent Employee Benefits Per Year Commission 15% Tax Bracket 28% Tax Bracket 31% Tax Bracket Cost Per Year Alternatives No Subsidy $0.00 $0.00 $0.00 $0.00 Current (Partial Cash Subsidy) $82,764.00 $82,764.00 $82,764.00 $75,240.00 Maximum Cash Subsidy Alone $153,384.00 $153,384.00 $153,384.00 $153,384.00 Maximum Pre-Tax Subsidy Alone $40,424.24 $60,364.16 $64,965.68 ($6,250.78) Combination Cash/Pre-Tax $101,268.61 $110,449.21 $112,567.81 $70,189.30 Subsidy  1 2 3 4 5  -  Alternative 1 is to provide no mass transit subsidy. This alternative would save the Commission approximately $75, 240 5 that would be spent on transit subsidy plus the administrative costs of current program. However, this option does not advance the goals of PL 103-72 to reduce number of commuting single occupancy vehicles. Additionally, this option would likely have adverse effect on employee morale. This alternative should only be considered in the event Commission faces an extreme fiscal challenge.  the the the an the  Alternative 2 would maintain the Commission's current mass transit program at the current benefit level ($33 fare card per month). This alternative provides slightly more than half of the $65/mo. deductible benefit currently allowed under the tax code. As shown in Figure 5, the subsidy has provided an incentive for increased use of mass transit. This alternative also has relatively low administrative costs. However, this alternative does not maximize allowable transportation benefits and the Pre-Tax deduction allowed under TEA-21 allows the Commission to provide a larger benefit at less cost. Alternative 3 provides the maximum cash subsidy ($65/mo.) currently allowed as an excludable benefit. As shown in Figure 7, this alternative provides the greatest total benefit to the Commission mass transit users. As such, this is the highest incentive for employees to use mass transit. However, this alternative also is the most costly alternative from the Commission's standpoint. Additionally, this alternative is more difficult and more expensive to administer than the current program, because a significant number of employees would not qualify for the full benefit. This alternative would be preferred in a benign fiscal environment.  5  209 Current Users x $30 fare card per month x 12 months = $75,240  6   OIG-IR-02-00 Figure 7 Average Yearly Benefit Per Employee for Mass Transit Subsidy Alternatives(28% Tax Bracket) 800 $734.00  700  600 $528.00 500  $396.00 400  $289.00 300  200  100  $0.00 0 ALT 1 - No Subsidy ALT 2 - Current ALT 3 - Max Cash ALT 4 - Max Pre-Tax ALT 5 - Combination  Alternative 4 would replace the current cash subsidy with the maximum Pre-Tax deduction allowed by TEA-21. The employee benefits for this alternative would be about 27% less than the current cash subsidy and would be achieved entirely through reduced taxes. The amount of benefits would increase with higher tax brackets. There would be an actual net savings to the Commission from the base case (no subsidy) under this alternative due to a decrease in matching OADSI and Medicare contributions. Administrative expense for this alternative would also be low because this alternative can be implemented entirely through payroll processing. This alternative would be preferred in a stringent fiscal environment where funds are not available for a cash subsidy. Alternative 5 would supplement the current cash subsidy with a Pre-Tax deduction up to the allowable limit ($65/mo.). This alternative would provide about 33% more benefits than the current subsidy at about a 7% less cost to the Commission. Administrative costs would not be appreciably greater because the supplementary Pre-Tax deduction can be provided through payroll processing. The greatest advantage of this alternative is flexibility. The cash portion of the subsidy can be increased or decreased as required by the fiscal environment with a corresponding decrease or increase in the Pre-Tax deduction portion. If the cash portion of the subsidy had to be eliminated entirely because of fiscal constraints, employees would still have a benefit equivalent to Alternative 4. For this reason, Alternative 5 is the best alternative for implementation by the Commission.  7   OIG-IR-02-00 Appendix II provides detailed benefits levels for all employees surveyed. Figure 8, summarizes the benefits available to a typical Commission employee under each of the 5 subsidy alternatives. In this figure the current cash subsidy is assumed to be a monthly $33 fare card. Since the employee's actual mass transit expenses exceed the current deductible limit of $65 per month, the maximum subsidy, either cash or Pre-Tax deduction, is assumed to be $65 per month. The cash subsidy plus Pre-Tax deduction is assumed to be a monthly $33 fare card plus a Pre-Tax deduction of $32 per month.

As indicated by Figure 8, Alternative 3 - Maximum Cash Subsidy provides the greatest benefit to this typical employee followed in order by Alternative 5 - Cash plus Pre-Tax deduction, Alternative 2 Current Subsidy, Alternative 4 - Maximum Pre-Tax deduction and lastly, Alternative 1 - No Subsidy. C. Parking Subsidy  Section 132 (f) of the IRS Code allows an employer to provide an employee up to $175 per month in nontaxable benefits for qualified parking. As defined in this section, qualified parking means:  Parking on or near a location from which the employee commutes to work by mass transit, by commuter highway vehicle or by car pool.  Parking provided to an employee on or near the business premises. Based on this definition, the Commission has the authority under PL 103-72 to establish a program for providing a nontaxable benefit for all forms of qualified parking. This benefit can be provided either as cash or a Pre-Tax deduction.  8   OIG-IR-02-00 Figure 9, summarizes the benefits and costs of cash or Pre-Tax deduction alternatives for the qualified parking expense of a typical Commission employee at a mass transit facility. As shown, the cash alternative provides high benefits, but at a high cost. On the other hand, the Pre-Tax deduction alternative provides moderate benefits with an actual cost savings to the Commission. The Pre-Tax deduction alternative is also easier and less expensive to administer than the cash alternative. As in Figure 9 Typical Employee Benefits per Year for Alternative Parking Subsidies ALTERNATIVES Benefit Cash Subsidy FICA Savings Medicare Tax Savings Federal Tax Savings State/Local Tax Savings No Subsidy $0.00 $0.00 $0.00 $0.00 $0.00 Maximum Cash Subsidy $2,100.00 $0.00 $0.00 $0.00 $0.00 Max Pre-Tax Deduction $0.00 $130.20 $30.45 $588.00 $163.80  the mass transit analysis, the best alternative would be one which combines a cash subsidy with a PreTax deduction up to the allowable limit (currently $175). This would allow employees to receive some tax reduction benefits even if the Commission were unable to provide a cash benefit. The mass transit users in our e-mail survey were asked to list their expense for parking at mass transit facilities. The table in Appendix III shows the employee savings and the Commission costs if a Pre-Tax deduction were allowed for these parking expenses. As shown, the Commission would actually save approximately $1,138 per year if a Pre-Tax deduction were allowed. Under Administrative Notice 3702, Car Pool Program, dated April 19, 1999, the Commission has established a program for partial subsidization of employee car pools. If the Commission established a program for Pre-Tax deduction of qualified parking expenses, car pool participants could receive a Pre-Tax deduction for their share of parking expense.  9   OIG-IR-02-00 Figure 10, shows the savings that would have been available to typical car pool participants in 1999 with a Pre-Tax deduction. Their savings would have amounted to 41% of total car pool parking expense. In addition, the Commission's expenses would have been reduced by 2.4%. This would have resulted from a lower matching contribution for OADSI and Medicare taxes.

Administrative Costs  PL 103-72 contains a stipulation that agencies will provide any mass transit subsidy benefit in the form of vouchers where readily available. Subsequently, IRS Notice 94-3, dated January 18, 1994, indicated that employers do not have to provide a transportation fringe in the form of transit vouchers instead of cash, if doing so incurred ""significant administrative cost"". In the specific case of the Commission, providing the TEA-21 allowed transportation fringe in the form of fare cards would involve significant administrative cost to the Commission for the following reasons:    The Commission would have to customize the fare card order every month to meet the varying requirements of employees. The need to forecast on a month-to-month basis the revenue to be obtained from employee payroll deductions for the purchase of fare cards would be very difficult. A revolving capital fund would have to be set up and administered to receive funds from employees and disburse funds for fare cards.  Because of this administrative cost, IRS Notice 94-3 allows agencies like the Commission to provide a transportation cash benefit through payroll processing rather than through vouchers. Other agencies, including the General Accounting Office and the Department of the Interior (DOI) (our payroll processor), have also adopted this approach. Administrative costs for the Commission's current cash subsidy program are relatively low because the current program does not have to provide a varying subsidy for employees with varying levels of mass transit expenses. Under the current program, the Commission also does not have to collect payroll deductions from employees to pay for fare cards. Instead, the current program uses appropriated funds to make bulk purchases of fare cards, all of the same denomination, and hands  10   OIG-IR-02-00 them out on a monthly basis to employees who have completed an application form. According to OFM, approximately 15 employee-hours per month are utilized in administering the current program.6 Adding or substituting a Pre-Tax deduction would require employees to fill out a slightly different application form which identifies the amount of Pre-Tax deduction allowed. DOI, the Commission's payroll contractor, already has procedures in place for adding qualifying Pre-Tax deductions to employee payroll processing. The only administrative procedure required of the Commission would be for the Office of Finance and Budget accountant to enter the deduction amounts from the completed forms into the DOI system. This is estimated to require 1 hour for every 150 forms. III. CONCLUSIONS  Based on our analysis, the Commission should: 1. Modify the mass transit subsidy program to allow a Pre-Tax deduction transportation benefit up to the maximum allowable rate (presently $65/mo) less any cash subsidy the Commission may elect to provide in the form of fare cards. Establish a parking subsidy program to allow a Pre-Tax deduction transportation benefit for designated parking up to the maximum allowable rate (presently $175/mo) less any cash subsidy the Commission may elect to provide. Designate qualified parking to be subsidized under Number 2 as: a. Parking on or near a location from which an employee commutes to work via mass transit or a car pool b. Car pool parking on or near the Commission.  2.  3.  To participate in the current Mass Transit Subsidy program an employee completes and signs an Application for Transit Benefit form certifying eligibility to receive the benefit. Near the beginning of each month, enrolled employees are advised to pick up their fare cards from OFM. Before receiving their $33 fare card, they sign a form certifying their continuing eligibility to receive the transit subsidy.  6  11   Appendix I  OIG-IR-02-00  ORIGIN OF COMMISSION'S MASS TRANSIT USERS  WV 0% VA 39%  DC 23%  MD 38%  COMMISSION'S MASS TRANSIT USERS BY GRADE LEVEL  60  57  50 43 40  Number of Employees  30  29 25  20 15 13 10 5 1 0 GS-5 GS-6 GS-7 GS-8 GS-9 GS-10 2 0  17  2  GS-11  GS-12  GS-13  GS-14  GS-15  ES   Appendix II EMPLOYEE DATA Employee Grade Step Jurisdiction 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 14 9 13 12 14 13 15 12 14 12 13 7 9 15 15 9 11 12 9 11 13 12 8 15 14 14 15 9 12 14 15 11 11 7 13 12 13 13 14 13 13 13 12 7 13 13 7 12 13 14 13 13 14 7 15 11 9 14 13 15 13 12 14 15 15 12 12 14 14 9 13 12 13 13 15 14 12 9 14 14 8 10 7 4 8 7 7 9 10 1 10 10 8 10 6 6 1 9 1 10 7 4 10 5 7 4 6 9 8 10 10 10 11 7 1 1 1 1 9 8 1 9 10 8 8 8 10 5 3 9 7 3 3 10 8 6 10 6 1 6 4 1 10 6 10 1 2 10 2 1 1 1 5 5 0 10 1 7 4 3 MD MD MD DC DC VA VA MD VA MD MD DC MD MD DC VA MD DC VA MD MD VA MD VA MD DC VA DC DC VA VA VA MD MD VA VA MD DC DC MD DC MD DC VA VA VA DC DC VA MD VA DC MD MD MD DC MD VA VA MD VA VA MD MD VA MD MD MD DC NT VA VA DC VA VA DC VA DC DC MD  Estimated Individual Employee Savings for Five Mass Transit Alternatives  OIG-IR-02-00  Monthly Allowable Transit Transit Expense Deduction 87.00 88.00 173.00 70.00 51.00 117.00 46.00 95.00 134.00 85.00 90.00 46.00 52.00 70.00 48.00 73.00 143.00 44.00 46.00 171.00 106.00 200.00 73.00 88.00 69.00 88.00 188.00 82.00 60.00 122.00 100.00 125.00 50.00 71.00 94.00 45.00 75.00 51.00 48.00 65.00 44.00 90.00 62.00 128.00 163.00 46.00 102.00 89.00 169.00 106.00 80.00 40.00 110.00 62.00 174.00 46.00 160.00 186.00 57.00 100.00 145.00 48.00 135.00 150.00 61.00 88.00 100.00 86.00 53.00 52.00 75.00 117.00 50.00 94.00 132.00 50.00 60.00 47.00 50.00 80.00 65.00 65.00 65.00 65.00 51.00 65.00 46.00 65.00 65.00 65.00 65.00 46.00 52.00 65.00 48.00 65.00 65.00 44.00 46.00 65.00 65.00 65.00 65.00 65.00 65.00 65.00 65.00 65.00 60.00 65.00 65.00 65.00 50.00 65.00 65.00 45.00 65.00 51.00 48.00 65.00 44.00 65.00 62.00 65.00 65.00 46.00 65.00 65.00 65.00 65.00 65.00 40.00 65.00 62.00 65.00 46.00 65.00 65.00 57.00 65.00 65.00 48.00 65.00 65.00 61.00 65.00 65.00 65.00 53.00 52.00 65.00 65.00 50.00 65.00 65.00 50.00 60.00 47.00 50.00 65.00  ALT 1 NO Subsidy 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00  ALT 2 Current Subsidy 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00 396.00  ESTIMATED EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PER YEAR ($) ALT 3 ALT 4 -Max Pre-tax Deduction Alone ALT 5 -$33 Cash + Pre-Tax Ded.

Where do I get more of the Commuter Benefits Program reimbursement       request forms?               General Information     What is the Commuter Benefits Program?    The Commuter Benefits Program is a qualified transportation benefit program under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) § 132 which allows employees to pay for certain employment-related transportation expenses on a pre-tax basis.          What benefits are offered?      Mass Transit :  The Commuter Benefits program provides employees with the convenience of buying transit passes on-line and having them automatically delivered every month directly to their homes.       Parking :  Employees may elect to have their parking facility paid directly every month, or may choose to establish an account from which their parking expenses are reimbursed.      Van-Pool :  Employees may elect to have their van-pool provider paid directly every month, or establish an pre-tax account from which their van-pool expenses may be reimbursed.         Who is Eligible?    All State employees, including limited term employees, (LTEs) can participate in this pre-tax Commuter Benefits Program. Spouses and dependent children are not eligible. Any employee who regularly pays for mass transit, van-pool, or parking may take advantage of this program. NOTE: If you already have your parking or vanpool expenses deducted pre-tax from your paycheck, you do not need to sign up for this benefit. You are already enjoying a tax-free benefit.         Why should I use the Commuter Benefits Program?      You will save money - up to a 40 percent tax savings on what you spend on transit or parking up to the maximum pre-tax benefit limit. And we make it EASY for you!        Commuters get convenient home or office delivery of monthly passes from transit     providers.      You can use the Commuter Benefits Program Direct Pay option to make automatic payments     to your parking provider.      The costs for these services are automatically deducted from your paycheck.            Who is responsible for administering the program?    The Department of Employee Trust Funds (ETF) oversees the program. A third-party administrator, Fringe Benefits Management Company (FBMC), provides administrative services. FBMC is responsible for on-line enrollment, order and delivery of your transit passes, paying your parking facility or van-pool directly, and processing requests for reimbursement of eligible expenses. Eligibility of expenses is dictated by the IRS and FBMC uses those guidelines when reviewing claims.         Is my information on the Commuter Benefits Program system kept secure and private?      Yes. Fringe Benefits Management Company (FBMC), the program administrator, maintains physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards for protecting personal information. Access to personal information is restricted to representatives who need to know the information to provide quality service.          What are the dollar limits on tax-free transit and parking benefits?      Federal law limits the amount of gross wages you may spend each month on tax-free transit or parking. For 2002, the limits are $100 per month for transit or vanpool, $185 per month for parking or $285 for a combination of transit, vanpool, and parking.          Can I combine the dollar limits from month to month?      No. The specified limits for transit, parking and vanpool apply individually to each calendar month.          Will participation in the Commuter Benefits Program have an impact on my other benefits?    Participation in the Commuter Benefits Program will have no impact on the gross amount of earnings used to calculate retirement, life insurance, income continuation insurance, sick leave conversion credits, unemployment or Worker’s Compensation.    The plan will reduce salary used for calculating social security benefits at retirement. Your Commuter Benefits Program contribution will reduce the includable compensation used to compute the maximum amount deferred under a tax shelter annuity or deferred compensation plan.          Will I need to fill out any special tax forms to get my savings?      No. You will simply notice an increase in the amount of your spendable income since you save the tax money you normally spend on your commuting expenses.            Eligible Expenses       What commuting expenses are eligible?      Only actual amounts spent by you for the purpose of commuting to and from work are eligible and there are limits on the amount you can claim. Two types of commuting expenses are eligible under Federal law:            Mass transit fares , including tickets, passes, tokens, vouchers or other fares for     riding buses, trains, paratransit vans or other mass transportation vehicles. They     also include the cost of participating in an official vanpool. The cost of commuting     in a taxi or in your personal car or van is not included.          Parking fees  at or near your work place or parking at a location from which you     commute to your work place via mass transportation or a carpool (such as a park-and-ride     lot). Residential parking is not eligible.       Only parking and mass transit costs incurred by you in connection with travel between your residence and your work place are eligible.          What expenses are not eligible?      Only expenses for your workplace parking and mass transit are eligible on a pre-tax basis. Commuting expenses you cannot claim under the program include but are not limited to the following examples:        Tolls      Traffic tickets      Fuel      Mileage or other costs you incur in operating a vehicle      Taxis      Payments to a fellow participant in a carpool or to a friend who drives you to work      Expenses incurred for parking at your spouse's place of work      Parking at a mall or similar location where you stop on your drive to or from your place     of work     Costs that have been or will be paid by your employer, such as for a business trip.           I ride in a car pool with my neighbor. Can I take advantage of this program?    Only the Commuter Benefits Program participant who actually pays for the parking space may have the cost deducted from his or her paycheck on a pre-tax basis.           Is my vanpool eligible?      Under Federal law, arrangements where you and other commuters share the cost of renting a van for commuting to work are eligible for tax-free transit benefits. A van that you or one of the other riders owns or operates as your personal vehicle is not a vanpool. Also, the van must be primarily used for commuting, must have a seating capacity of at least six adults including the driver and must typically be at least half full.         I get free parking at work. Can I still use the Commuter Benefits Program?      You can't use the Commuter Benefits Program for the free parking provided at work. If you take transit instead, you may use the Commuter Benefits Program to buy transit passes.          Deadlines        What is the deadline to sign up, change or cancel my benefits?     The deadline for ordering transit and parking passes through the Commuter Benefits Program on-line is the 10 th  of the month to receive benefits on the first of the following benefit month. Tax rules require that you elect your benefit amount before the period of coverage begins. The deadline for reporting your out-of-pocket expenses will be the 10th of each month prior to the month that you will use the benefit. If you miss the 10 th  of the month deadline, you will not receive your pass by the first of the following month. For example, if you enroll on September 12, you will not receive your pass until November 1.         If I sign up now, can I make changes later?      Yes. You can change or discontinue your participation in the Commuter Benefits Program later.          If I don't sign up now, can I do so later?      Yes. The Commuter Benefits Program is a monthly program. You may make an election every month. Remember that you must enroll by the 10 th  of the month in order to receive your transit passes by the first of the following benefit month.         I missed the deadline for next month. What do I do?      Unfortunately, the deadline for signing up, changing or canceling benefits for any given month is not alterable. Be sure to contact FBMC immediately when you know that your parking or transit needs may be changing. All changes must be made by the 10 th  of the month.  Any benefits processed after the 10 th  of the month may not be refunded.             Benefit Elections--Transit        Why can't I just get a cash reimbursement, instead of ordering my transit passes on-line?    Government regulations prevent us from allowing cash reimbursement when a transit pass is readily available for purchase from the Commuter Benefits Program site. You can be reimbursed for transit passes if:        The transit pass is not available through the Commuter Benefits Program.      The transit pass is not available through the Commuter Benefits Program in the     denomination that you purchase from the transit agency.      You purchased your pass through the Commuter Benefits Program and had two occasions when     the pass was not delivered.       We monitor reimbursement claims and may deny your claim if the pass is available on the Commuter Benefits Program Internet site.          Can I sign up to get my transit pass automatically without having to come back to the Commuter Benefits Program every month?      Yes. By selecting ""Every Month"" when you configure your transit selection, you will automatically receive your transit pass and you will not need to come back to the Commuter Benefits Program unless you wish to make a change to the monthly frequency or to the type of pass.          I pay for parking at my park and ride lot, but pay for a bus pass separately. How do I use pre-tax dollars for both parking and transit?    You can use pre-tax dollars for parking and for transit by electing each commuter benefit separately. The bus fare would count toward the monthly $100 transit limit; the parking fee would count toward the $185 parking limit.          My transit plans can change from month to month. How accurate do I have to be when I predict my next month's expense?      If you are unsure about the total expense, you may wish to under-estimate how much to have withheld from your paycheck. Remember, the pre-tax limits are $100 per month for transit and $185 per month for parking or $285 per month for a combination of transit and parking.          Benefit Elections--Parking        What is the Direct Pay option for parking?      The Commuter Benefits Program will automatically pay your designated parking provider on a monthly basis using your pre-tax dollars. Because your provider is paid directly, you do not need to submit paper receipts for reimbursement.     Eligible parking is the cost of parking at or near your place of work, or at or near a place from which you commute to work via mass transit, such as a park-and-ride lot. However, the cost of parking at your place of residence is not included under any circumstances.          When will my parking provider be paid under the Direct Pay option?      Any payment instruction that you create by the 10th of each month is sent to your parking provider so that it arrives before the 1st of the subsequent month. For example, if on June 8th you instruct the Commuter Benefits Program to pay $100 to Ed's Garage, Ed's Garage will receive payment in time to post it to your account before July 1st.          Can I schedule payments to occur at some other time during the month?      No.          I pay for my parking every day or every week. Can I use the Direct Pay option?      Direct Pay can be used to make payments once a month. You cannot schedule daily or weekly payments. If you can convert your parking fees into a monthly payment, you can use Direct Pay. Otherwise, use the Pay Me Back feature from the Parking menu to be reimbursed for your daily or weekly out-of-pocket expenses.           Benefit Elections--General     What happens to my transit pass order or parking payment if I leave State service?      Be sure to contact FBMC immediately when you know that your parking or transit needs may be changing. All changes must be made before the 10 th  of the month.  Any benefits processed after the 10 th  of the month may not be refunded.         What if the transit or parking I use isn't available through the Commuter Benefits program system?    Not all transit and parking products are in the Commuter Benefits Program online catalog, but you can still enjoy tax savings on parking or transit items if you report them as out-of-pocket expenses. For parking expenses, simply enroll in the ""Pay Me Back"" option to have your expenses reimbursed directly to you. For transit expenses, click on the link ""If you cannot find your operator, let us know"" found at the bottom of the ""Select an operator"" page and click continue. You may then enter your usual monthly out-of-pocket expenditure for transit.          My monthly commuting costs vary.  How much should I enter for my monthly expense?      You should enter your usual expense in an ordinary month, ignoring special circumstances like sick days, short vacations and occasional overtime.          What happens to my Pay Me Back election if I do not use all the money deposited into my commuter benefit account for the current month?    There is no ""use it or lose it"" rule. Excess balances will be carried over to the subsequent month. You will have the ability to adjust future monthly Commuter Benefit elections to avoid having an excess balance.           Reimbursement        If I buy my transit pass or have my parking facility paid directly through the Commuter Benefits Program, do I need to submit a receipt?      No. You only need to submit receipts if your transit or parking is not yet available for purchase through the Commuter Benefits Program catalog or Commuter Benefits Program DirectPay and you instead report your out-of-pocket expenses.          With the Pay Me Back option how do I get reimbursed for my daily parking or transit expenses?    Submit your receipts for the month and a reimbursement claim form to FBMC. You may include both parking and transit expenses on the same reimbursement claim form. Please allow 10-15 days to receive your reimbursement check.          What kind of supporting documents need to be submitted so that I can be reimbursed?    An expense receipt from the parking facility or transit provider that shows: the name of the vendor, the date(s) the service was provided and the cost for the service must be provided with the claim. When proof that an eligible expense has occurred is not available, you must sign and submit a statement indicating the expense incurred. Canceled checks are acceptable as supporting documentation.    You can also create an electronic receipt on the Commuter Benefits site. Click the ""Submit Receipts"" button then click on the ""eReceipt"" button on the right side of the page following the instructions. If you use the ""eReceipt"" option you do not have to send a claim form.         I have the same out-of-pocket expense every month.  Do I still need to submit receipts?      Yes. Commuter Benefits will withhold your out-of-pocket expense automatically from your paycheck if you click ""Every Month,"" for your account, but you still need to submit receipts. Your commuting expenses will not be reimbursed until the Commuter Benefits Program has received your receipts.          My provider doesn't give receipts or ticket stubs. What should I do?      We understand that some transit and parking providers don't provide receipts. In some cases, no other form of paper documentation exists. No problem. You can submit an eReceipt online to certify your expense. You will not need to submit an envelope with the eReceipt function. Select ""Submit Receipt"" and click on your expense link. On the right side of the page is the eReceipt option.          What happens if I don't submit receipts or other documentation?      Your commute expenses will not be reimbursed until you submit your receipts.          Where do I get more of the Commuter Benefits Program reimbursement request forms?      Reimbursement forms will be available on the ETF internet site at http://etf.wi.gov. or call FBMC Customer Service to request forms by mail."

The Q&A provides information to taxpayers who need a taxpayer identification number for a child who has been placed in their home pending final adoption.    Questions and Answers:      What is an ATIN?    Who needs an ATIN?    Why do I need an ATIN?    How do I know if I should apply for an ATIN?    How can I find out if I qualify to claim the dependency exemption or child and dependent care credit for the child I am adopting?    Can I get an ATIN if I am adopting a child from another country?    I applied for an SSN using the documentation given to me by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) but my application was rejected. Now what do I do?    Is the ATIN something new; I have never heard of it before.    What did people do last year if they didn't have an ATIN?    What form do I use to apply for an ATIN?    What do I need to complete the Form W-7A?    What is placement documentation?    Should I send in my original documentation?    How long is the ATIN valid?    Why does the ATIN deactivate after two years?    What can I do if the ATIN expires before the adoption is finalized?    When should I apply for an ATIN?    How long does it take to get an ATIN?    Can I use an ATIN to claim the Earned Income Tax Credit?                            ATIN Questions and Answers       Q.1. What is an ATIN?    A.1. An ATIN is an Adoption Taxpayer Identification Number issued by the Internal Revenue Service as a temporary taxpayer identification number for the child in a domestic adoption where the adopting taxpayers do not have and/or are unable to obtain the child's Social Security Number (SSN). The ATIN is to be used by the adopting taxpayers on their Federal Income Tax return to identify the child while final domestic adoption is pending.    Return to Questions and Answers Index                        ATIN Questions and Answers       Q.2. Who needs an ATIN?    A.2. If you are in the process of adopting a child and are able to claim the child as your dependent or are able to claim a child care credit, you may need an ATIN for your adoptive child.    Return to Questions and Answers Index                        ATIN Questions and Answers       Q.3. Why do I need an ATIN?    A.3. Recent tax law changes require that when you list a person's name on your federal income tax return, you must provide a valid identifying number for that person. During the adoption process, you may not have been able to obtain an existing or a new Social Security Number (SSN) for the child who may already have been placed in your home. If you are eligible to claim the child as your dependent, and you don't have the child's SSN, then you will need to request an ATIN in order to claim the child as a dependent and ( if eligible) to claim the child care credit.    Return to Questions and Answers Index                        ATIN Questions and Answers       Q.4. How do I know if I should apply for an ATIN?    A.4. You should apply for an ATIN only if you are in the process of adopting a child and you meet all of the following qualifications:      The adoption is a domestic adoption.    The child is legally placed in your home for adoption by a authorized adoption agency/agent.    The adoption is not yet final, and you are unable to obtain the child's existing SSN or you are unable to apply for a new SSN for the child pending the finalization of the adoption.    You qualify to claim the child as a dependent.      Return to Questions and Answers Index                        ATIN Questions and Answers       Q.5. I am not sure if I qualify to claim the dependency exemption or child and dependent care credit for the child I am adopting, how can I find out?    A.5. To know whether you qualify to claim the child's exemption or child care credit for the child, see ""Exemptions"" and ""Credit for Child and Dependent Care Expenses"" in the Form 1040 instructions. For further information you may order Publication 501 (Exemptions, Standard Deductions and Filing Information) and Publication 503 (Child and Dependent Care Expenses), by calling 1-800-829-3676 (or 1-800-TAX-FORM).

Return to Questions and Answers Index                        ATIN Questions and Answers       Q.6. Can I get an ATIN if I am adopting a child from another country?    A.6. No! You should apply through the Social Security Administration (SSA) for a valid SSN. When you are adopting a foreign child, upon the child's entry into the United States you should receive enough documentation from the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to satisfy the Social Security Administration's requirements for a SSN.    Return to Questions and Answers Index                        ATIN Questions and Answers       Q.7. I applied for an SSN using the documentation given to me by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) but my application was rejected. Now what do I do?    A.7. If the SSA rejects your application because the documentation you received from the INS did not satisfy their requirements for an SSN, you may then apply to the IRS for an ITIN, Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, using Form W-7, Application for IRS Individual Taxpayer Identification Number. Order Publication 1915, Understanding Your ITIN, and review the requirements.    Return to Questions and Answers Index                        ATIN Questions and Answers       Q.8. Is the ATIN something new; I have never heard of it before.    A.8. Yes, this is new. In fact, this is the first year it is required. So, if you meet the requirements in  Question 4 , when you file your 1997 tax return you will need an ATIN if you intend to claim the exemption or (when eligible) take the child care credit for the child you are adopting.    Return to Questions and Answers Index                        ATIN Questions and Answers       Q.9. What did people do last year if they didn't have an ATIN?    A.9. Before the 1997 tax year, taxpayers who were adopting children and met the requirements to claim the child could use the phrase ""U.S. Adoption Pending"" in place of the SSN. If taxpayers amended their 1996 or 1995 tax returns claiming the child they were in the process of adopting, they could still use the phrase ""U.S. Adoption Pending"" in place of the SSN. It is only beginning with your 1997 tax return that the ATIN a required.    Return to Questions and Answers Index                        ATIN Questions and Answers       Q.10. I now know that I meet the requirements to apply for an ATIN. What form do I use to apply for an ATIN?    A.10. The Form W-7A, Application for Taxpayer Identification Number for Pending Adoptions, is used by qualifying taxpayers to obtain an ATIN. To get Form W-7A, you may go to any IRS walk-in site or call 1-800-829-3676. You may also download the form  here  in Adobe PDF format.

In general you need to know the child's name, the birth information, and the placement agency. This information is typically found in the placement documentation. In addition, this placement documentation must be attached to and submitted with the W-7A. The Form W-7A has more specific and detailed instructions.

Placement documentation is the signed documentation placing the child in your care for legal adoption. In general, one of the following documents will satisfy this requirement:      A placement agreement entered into between you and a public or private adoption agency.    A document signed by a hospital official authorizing the release of a newborn child to you for legal adoption.    A court order or other court document ordering or approving the placement of a child with you for legal adoption.    An affidavit signed by an attorney, a government official, etc., placing the child with you pursuant to the states' legal adoption laws.     The placement documentation is sometimes referred to as ""Placement Agreement""; ""Surrender Papers""; ""Temporary Placement Paperwork""; ""Placement Order"" etc. This documentation termed differently from state to state must clearly establish that the child was placed in your home for purposes of adoption by an authorized adoption agency (or agent), and must include the following information:    Adoptive Parent(s) full name  Child's full name  Name of the Placement Agency or Agent  The date the child was placed in the adoptive parents home.  The signature of the parent or parents (the adopting taxpayers) and that of an official representative of the authorized placing agency or agent.

A copy of the original documentation is all that is required to be sent with the W-7A. IRS will not return any submitted documentation.    Return to Questions and Answers Index                        ATIN Questions and Answers       Q.14. How long is the ATIN valid?    A.14. As soon as the adoption becomes final, the adopting parents should obtain an SSN for the child and notify the IRS of the new SSN. When the IRS is notified of a new SSN for the adopted child, it will deactivate the ATIN. If the adopting parents do not notify the IRS within two years, the ATIN will be automatically deactivated.    Return to Questions and Answers Index                        ATIN Questions and Answers       Q.15. Why does the ATIN deactivate after two years?    A.15. The automatic deactivation of the ATIN after a two year period is necessary because the ATIN is an identification number issued for temporary use until a valid SSN can be obtained for the adopted child. It is not a permanent valid identification number. A reminder notice will be sent eighteen months after the taxpayers receives the ATIN, informing the adopting parents, that the ATIN will expire in 6 months.    Return to Questions and Answers Index                        ATIN Questions and Answers       Q.16. What can I do if the ATIN expires before the adoption is finalized?    A.16. If the adoption is not finalized before the ATIN expires, you may apply for an extension. The eighteen month reminder notice will explain what you must do to apply for an extension.    Return to Questions and Answers Index                        ATIN Questions and Answers       Q.17. When should I apply for an ATIN?    A.17. You should apply as soon as the qualifying conditions listed in  question 4  are met, but at least 8 weeks before the due date of your individual federal income tax return, which is normally April 15. For tax year 1997, taxpayers meeting the conditions listed in question 4 should wait until December 15 to file Forms W-7A.

It will generally take 4 to 8 weeks to get an ATIN once the IRS receives a completed Form W-7A. After 8 weeks if you have not heard from the IRS about your application, you may call the Philadelphia Service Center at (215) 516-4846. This is not a toll-free call.

No. You can only use an SSN to claim the EITC. However, if you are entitled to the EITC without using the adoptive child as the qualifying child, you can still claim the EITC.    When the adoption is final and the child has an SSN, you may file an amended return for an earlier year if you find that you could have claimed EITC in the earlier year except for the fact that the child did not have an SSN. Use Form 1040X, Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax Return, and Schedule EIC. The Statute of Limitation for filing an amended tax return is normally three years from the due date of the individual income tax return.

GX256-31-8061040	"PROGRAM Great News! Now commuters have a real choice about how to get to work. Recent changes to the Internal Revenue Code make it easier for companies to offer public transportation benefits to their employees. U.S. employers spend $36 billion annually on employee parking.1 It is the most common commute benefit offered to employees and the most common fringe benefit of any kind. Nearly all those eligible for free parking drive to work alone and that is the problem.  OPTIONS  Driving to work alone contributes more air pollution, wastes energy and causes traffic congestion. These are some of the hidden costs that do not figure into the ""free parking"" equation. This country's tremendous investment in public transportation is not being fully used and that is a luxury that America cannot afford. To get more cars off the roads and commuters into efficient travel arrangements, the cost of commuting on U.S. Department of Transportation  public transportation is a ""tax-free"" employment benefit.  Federal Transit Administration 400 Seventh Street, SW Washington, DC 20590 (202) 366-1698 Fax: (202) 366-7116 www.fta.dot.gov   Commuter Choice=Tax Free The Commuter Choice Benefit It's called Commuter Choice because it gives employees an attractive alternative to driving to work alone  a real choice. Presently, an employer may give up to $65 a month or up to $780 a year, in actual eligible transportation costs tax-free to an employee. Participating employers lower their FICA and Federal income tax costs. In many areas, state and city income taxes are reduced as well. The maximum tax-free benefit may increase each year based on increases in the cost of living. The Internal Revenue Service* will announce any annual increase in the eligible tax-free amount. In 2002, the maximum taxfree benefit allowed will automatically increase to cover actual costs up to $100 per month or up to $1,200 per year. Commuter Choice may be used on public transit buses, trains, ferries and vanpools. Not every employer can afford to pay for the full transportation benefit so the Commuter Choice has built-in flexibility. Take a look at the options.  Employee-Paid Pre-tax Benefit Option Okay. You are just learning about Commuter Choice and your budget is already set for the year. You cannot cover the cost of the benefit this year. You may be asking yourself if there is a way to broker this opportunity for your employees. You bet there is! Consider the Employee-Paid Pre-tax Benefit program. Many smaller companies choose this option. By establishing a pre-tax deduction program, you permit your employees to exchange part of their gross income for an employer-provided transit or vanpool costs. Since your employees fund the benefit, they save Federal payroll and income taxes. The amount of the pre-tax deduction is no longer treated or reported as taxable salary. In many areas, this deduction may also be free of state or city income tax. This special transportation pre-tax benefit program is exempt from complex use restrictions common to cafeteria plans and flexible spending accounts (FSA). These ""qualified transportation fringe benefits"" are excluded from cafeteria plans under Section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code (Title 26). The company will not have to write a plan document or obtain IRS approval. So there is less paperwork. There are no irrevocable elections or forms. A pre-tax program can be started any time of the year, or enrollment can be limited to certain times of the year. While there is a great deal of flexibility in creating a pre-tax transit benefit program, it is advisable to consult with tax counsel to determine how your program may affect ceiling or cap limitations on employee-directed tax deferred retirement accounts, such as 401(k) plans.  ees could use pre-tax income that is exchanged for a pass for $30, for a total monthly benefit of $65. The company receives an equivalent deduction from business income taxes for the $35 expense, while employees save on Federal payroll and income taxes on the $30. The company would also save on payroll taxes for the $30.  only eligible for the vanpool benefit and not the parking benefit. Only one person can receive the parking benefit.  The Parking Connection Those who have to drive to make a connection to public transportation may be eligible for the parking connection benefit. In recent years, residential growth and expansion has occurred away from the downtown urban areas, making it difficult to rely solely on mass transit. Commuter Choice makes it possible for commuters to enjoy tax-free incentives for driving when the automobile is a part of the commute trip and mass transit is used for the remainder of the trip. For instance, the eligible parking benefit may be up to $175 per month to pay for parking at a location from which employees commute by public transportation, such as a park-and-ride lot, transit station or facility, or vanpool staging area. Employers can pay for the benefit and receive an equivalent deduction from business income taxes. Your employees will receive the benefit completely free of all Federal payroll and income taxes up to the $175 limit. Eligible parking costs may be provided as a direct benefit, a pre-tax deduction, or as a shared expense. The same tax savings, reduced payroll costs and program flexibility apply to eligible parking expenses.  free Commuter Choice transit or vanpool benefit and receive the balance in taxable salary. The employer will have to pay payroll taxes on the taxable portion of the cash out benefit provided. To offset that cost, simply lower the cash out amount by your share of the payroll taxes as follows: Cost of Parking Space Payroll Taxes Cash out Offer $150 (12) $138  Cash Reimbursement Restrictions Cash Reimbursement for transit expenses is permitted in very limited circumstances. These tax incentives are intended to boost transit ridership, so cash reimbursement for commuting expense is discouraged. In fact, the only time an employer can reimburse employees for cash outlay for transit is in areas where vouchers or bus/rail passes, tokens, farecards, tickets, etc. are not ""readily available"" to be exchanged for transit or vanpool services. See IRS rules governing section 132(f) benefits for a definition of ""readily available."" In most cases, the employer must provide vouchers or bus/rail passes, tokens, farecards, tickets, etc., instead of cash reimbursement. For purposes of illustration, if the employee commutes on Transit Agency A and the agency only accepts cash payments, cash reimbursement up to the $65 limit would be permitted. The reimbursement may be made from corporate funds or pre-tax employee salaries, or a combination of both.  A Program for Every Budget Employer-Paid Benefit Option Increasingly, employers, as a matter of company policy, are offering the full transit benefit to employees. Some employers do so to reward workers for their contributions and accomplishments. Others see it as an investment. When employers offer the benefit, it boosts employee morale and that can translate into more satisfied customers. When employers pick up the tab for their employees, the Commuter Choice transit benefit is equivalent to a low cost salary or wage enhancement. If the same amount were to be given as a pay increase, it would cost your organization more in FICA. That's not all. Your employees would pay more in income taxes. The chart below shows how the public transportation benefit stacks up against a cash salary increase. Actual savings and tax avoidance will vary based on the employee's income tax bracket and actual Federal and state income tax rates: Private Employer costs Annual Benefit Amount Employee FICA Paid @7.65% Fed Income Taxes Paid @ 28% State Income Tax Paid @ 6% Value to Employee Transportation Benefit $780.00 -0-0-0+$780.00 Salary Increase $780.00 ($59.67) ($234.00) ($46.80) +$439.53 Difference  The employee could apply the additional compensation towards costs associated with commuting modes that are not considered qualified transportation fringe benefits, such as walking, bicycling, carpooling, or rollerblading to work. Cash out provides an incentive for your employees to try other commuting alternatives. The tax status of employees who continue receiving the parking benefit would not be affected.  2 + 2 = More The Bottom Line Commuter Choice makes sense. It is a great way to provide employees with a cost-effective, value-added benefit. The changes in the Internal Revenue Code allow your company the greatest flexibility to create a program that works for you and your employees. Remember, satisfied employees means satisfied customers. Commuter Choice . . . It works for business. It works for the economy. It works for the environment. It works for the country. So what are you waiting for? Contact your local transit provider today to find out how you can take full advantage of the tax-free Commuter Choice transportation benefit. These options can provide real savings to your company and your employees.  What s Covered ? Buses, Trains, Ferries and . . . Vanpools. Also referred to as ""Commuter Highway Vehicles"" under IRS rules, vanpools are defined as any highway vehicle that has seating capacity of at least six adults excluding the driver and meets two requirements for mileage use. At least 80 percent of the vehicle mileage use must be reasonably expected to be (1) for transporting employees in connection with travel between their residences and their place of employment, and (2) on trips during which the number of employees transported for commuting is, on average, at least one-half of the adult seating capacity excluding the driver. The designated employee ""prime member"" (often the driver or the person assigned the parking space) who travels in a vanpool and uses commercial parking is eligible for the parking benefit (up to $175 per month). At the same time, the prime member is eligible to receive the vanpool benefit (up to $65 per month). All other employees commuting in a vanpool who are not the ""prime member"" are  But We Provide Parking Cash out and Convert Many employers provide free or subsidized parking for employees, making it more economical for the employee to commute by automobile. The goal of Commuter Choice is to make it as economical for employees to use mass transit. If you only provide parking and your employees want to take advantage of public transportation and other alternatives, establishing a parking ""cash out"" program may be the appropriate choice. Your employees may forego parking and cash out the value of the parking benefit. The value of the parking benefit will be subject to taxes. However, if up to $65 of the value is converted to Commuter Choice transit or eligible vanpool benefits, the amount converted will not be subject to taxes. There is no real cost to employers, if they are leasing parking spaces for employees. They may simply transfer the cost for the parking space to a direct payment to employees. Should an employee decide to accept the cash value rather than a tax-free Commuter Choice transit or vanpool benefit, the amount is treated as additional compensation and s/he also would incur payroll and income taxes. If the cash out value is greater than $65, employees could accept a tax-  -0($59.67) ($234.00) ($46.80) -$340.47  Fare Share Benefit Option The third option is for the employer and employee to share the costs. That's why this approach is called the Fare Share Commuter Choice Benefit. The employer could subsidize a part of the $65 benefit and allow your employees the option to fund the balance from pre-tax income. The employer's contribution will be in addition to salary or wages. Employers purchase the passes and vouchers, using the contributions from employer funds and employee salaries, and then distribute them to the employees. The best way for your employees to stretch the value of the amount they are paying, is to arrange for the funds to be taken out of their paychecks before taxes are applied, as a pre-tax benefit. For example, an employer could provide any member who elects to participate in the program a transit pass worth $35 in addition to his/her regular salary. The employ-  You do the math. If your employees were to receive an equivalent cash salary raise of $780 per year instead of the taxfree transit benefit, they would actually end up paying for it, reducing the value of the benefit by more than 50%. It would take almost $1,300 in taxable salary to yield $780 after taxes. As an employer, you would avoid the costs of the matching FICA. If you are a not-for-profit organization, you may not realize any tax savings, but you gain the upper hand attracting and retaining employees in a competitive labor market. When you consider the overall value to your employees, it may cost you more not to provide Commuter Choice.  1KPMG Peat Marwick Study *The information presented here does not constitute official tax guidance or a ruling by the United States Government.

The company will not have to write a plan document or obtain IRS approval. So there is         less paperwork. There are no irrevocable elections or forms. A pre-tax program can be         started any time of the year, or enrollment can be limited to certain times of the         year.            While there is a great deal of flexibility in         creating a pre-tax transit benefit program, it is advisable to consult with tax counsel to         determine how your program may affect ceiling or cap limitations on employee-directed tax         deferred retirement accounts, such as 401(k) plans.             Fare Share Benefit Option             The third option is for the employer and employee         to share the costs. That’s why this approach is called the  Fare Share  Commuter         Choice Benefit. The employer could subsidize a part of the $65 benefit and allow your         employees the option to fund the balance from pre-tax income. The employer’s         contribution will be in addition to salary or wages. Employers purchase the passes or         vouchers, using the contributions from employer funds and employee salaries, and then         distribute them to the employees.            The best way for your employees to stretch the         value of the amount they are paying, is to arrange for the funds to be taken out of their         paychecks before taxes are applied, as a pre-tax benefit. For example, an employer could         provide any employee who elects to participate in the program a transit pass worth $35 in         addition to his/her regular salary. The employees could use pre-tax income that is         exchanged for a pass for $30, for a total monthly benefit of $65. The company receives an         equivalent deduction from business income taxes for the $35 expense, while employees save         on Federal payroll and income taxes on the $30. The company would also save on payroll         taxes for the $30.            Cash Reimbursement         Restrictions            Cash Reimbursement for transit expenses is         permitted in very limited circumstances. These tax incentives are intended to boost         transit ridership, so cash reimbursement for commuting expense is discouraged. In fact,         the only time an employer can reimburse employees for cash outlay for transit is in areas         where vouchers or bus/rail passes, tokens, farecards, tickets, etc. are not ""readily         available"" to be exchanged for transit or vanpool services. See IRS rules governing         section 132(f) benefits for a definition of ""readily available."" In most cases,         the employer must provide vouchers or bus/rail passes, tokens, farecards, tickets, etc.,         instead of cash reimbursement.            For purposes of illustration, if the employee         commutes on Transit Agency A and the agency  only  accepts cash payments, cash         reimbursement up to the $65 limit would be permitted. The reimbursement may be made from         corporate funds or pre-tax employee salaries, or a combination of both.            What’s         Covered?            Buses, Trains Ferries and . . .             Vanpools. Also referred to as ""Commuter         Highway Vehicles"" under IRS rules, vanpools are defined as any highway vehicle that         has seating capacity of at least six adults excluding the driver and meets two         requirements for mileage use. At least 80 percent of the vehicle mileage use must be         reasonably expected to be (1) for transporting employees in connection with travel between         their residences and their place of employment, and (2) on trips during which the number         of employees transported for commuting is, on average, at least one-half of the adult         seating capacity excluding the driver.             The designated employee ""prime member""         (often the driver or the person assigned the parking space) who travels in a vanpool and         uses commercial parking is eligible for the parking benefit (up to $175 per month). At the         same time, the prime member is eligible to receive the vanpool benefit (up to $65 per         month). All other employees commuting in a vanpool who are not the ""prime         member"" are only eligible for the vanpool benefit and not the parking benefit. Only         one person can receive the parking benefit.            The Parking Connection            Those who have to drive to make a connection         to public transportation may be eligible for the parking connection benefit.   In         recent years, residential growth and expansion has occurred away from the downtown urban         areas, making it difficult to rely solely on mass transit.  Commuter Choice  makes it         possible for commuters to enjoy  tax-free  incentives for driving when the automobile         is a part of the commute trip and mass transit is used for the remainder of the trip. For         instance, the eligible parking benefit may be up to $175 per month to pay for parking at a         location from which employees commute by public transportation, such as a park-and-ride         lot, transit station or facility, or vanpool staging area. Employers can pay for the         benefit and receive an equivalent deduction from business income taxes. Your employees         will receive the benefit completely free of all Federal payroll and income taxes up to the         $175 limit.            Eligible parking costs may be provided as a         direct benefit, a pre-tax deduction, or as a shared expense. The same tax savings, reduced         payroll costs and program flexibility apply to eligible parking expenses.              But We Provide Parking            Cash out and Convert              Many employers provide free or subsidized parking         for employees, making it more economical for the employee to commute by automobile. The         goal of  Commuter Choice  is to make it as economical for employees to use mass         transit. If you only provide parking and your employees want to take advantage of public         transportation and other alternatives, establishing a parking "" cash out ""         program may be the appropriate choice. Your employees may forego parking and cash out the         value of the parking benefit. The value of the parking benefit will be subject to taxes.         However, if up to $65 of the value is converted to  Commuter Choice  transit or         eligible vanpool benefits, the amount converted will not be subject to taxes.            There is no real cost to employers, if they are         leasing parking spaces for employees. They may simply transfer the cost for the parking         space to a direct payment to employees. Should an employee decide to accept the cash value         rather than a  tax-free   Commuter Choice  transit or vanpool benefit, the         amount is treated as additional compensation and s/he also would incur payroll and income         taxes. If the cash out value is greater than $65, employees could accept a  tax-free           Commuter Choice  transit or vanpool benefit and receive the balance in taxable         salary. The employer will have to pay payroll taxes on the taxable portion of the cash out         benefit provided. To offset that cost, simply lower the cash out amount by your share of         the payroll taxes as follows:                                      Cost of Parking Space               $150                                       Payroll Taxes                  (12)                                       Cash out Offer               $138                                  The employee could apply the         additional compensation towards costs associated with commuting modes that are not         considered qualified transportation fringe benefits, such as walking, bicycling,         carpooling, or rollerblading to work.            Cash out provides an incentive for you employees         to try other commuting alternatives. The tax status of employees who continue receiving         the parking benefit would not be affected.             2 + 2 = More            The Bottom Line             Commuter Choice  makes sense. It is a great         way to provide employees with a cost-effective, value-added benefit. The changes in the         Internal Revenue Code allow your company the greatest flexibility to create a program that         works for you and your employees. Remember, satisfied employees means satisfied         customers.            Commuter Choice . . . It works for business. It         works for the economy. It works for the environment. It works for the country.            So what are you waiting for? Contact your local         transit provider today to find out how you can take full advantage of the  tax-free   Commuter         Choice  transportation benefit. These options can provide real savings to your company         and your employees.                      1 .

GX233-67-8181919	"""Gifting clubs"" and pyramid schemes                     Many Oregonians are being defrauded by unlawful pyramid schemes                      operating under the guise of so-called ""gifting clubs"" such                      as the Dinner Club or Women's Empowerment Network. These ""clubs""                      are elaborate scams designed to make money for a few at the                      expense of many.                     The promoters of the scheme claim that IRS regulations allow                      people to ""gift"" one another up to $10,000 per year tax free.                      For example, persons are asked to pay $5,000 to enter at the                      bottom of the pyramid or ""tree"" along with others. As these                      people encourage others to join the club, they rise on the                      tree to the top position, where the total amount collected                      from ""gifts"" is $40,000, a $35,000 profit. Often, people at                      the top re-invest another $5,000 and start the process anew.                     Each of the eight persons just entering the tree delivers                      his/her $5,000 ""gift"" directly to the person at the top of                      the pyramid. This also helps convince new players that they                      will eventually receive a $35,000 return on their ""gift.""                     These schemes are doomed to failure. Each ""tree"" involves                      8 persons who ""gift"" $5,000 each. The person at the top of                      the tree gets $40,000 and the other 7 people hope that enough                      players come on board to push them to the top. For each person                      at the top, there are 8 people who are likely to lose their                      investment and the chance of a big ""payoff."" Eventually,                      these schemes collapse because they run out of prospective                      participants.                                                                                                                                                          No matter what the promoters may tell you, gifting clubs                      are illegal. They are unlawful pyramid schemes. Gifting clubs                      and pyramids have not been approved by the Oregon Attorney                      General, local district attorneys, or the Division of Finance                      and Corporate Securities. Operating or participating in a                      pyramid scheme violates Oregon's Unlawful Trade Practices                      Act, which imposes civil penalties of up to $25,000 per violation.                     Gifting clubs and pyramid schemes may also violate Oregon                      securities laws by virtue of being investment contracts. Oregon                      law requires securities to be registered and licenses for                      persons engaged in transacting business in securities. A violation                      of the securities laws could subject a person to civil penalties                      of up to $20,000 per violation, or criminal prosecution as                      a class B felony.                     The IRS does not recognize gifting clubs or pyramid schemes                      and considers all money gained from these schemes to be reportable                      income. Failing to report income from pyramid schemes on your                      tax return, or attempting to hide such monies may subject                      you to severe federal civil and criminal penalties.                     What can you do?                                           Don't participate! If you have, ask for your money back.                        Warn others not to get taken in by these schemes.

Some of the more prevalent methods of evasion include pyramiding, employee leasing, paying employees in cash, filing false payroll tax returns or failing to file payroll tax returns.    Pyramiding    ""Pyramiding"" of employment taxes is a fraudulent practice where a business withholds taxes from its employees but intentionally fails to remit them to the IRS. Businesses involved in pyramiding frequently file for bankruptcy to discharge the liabilities accrued and then start a new business under a different name and begin a new scheme.    Employment Leasing    Employee leasing is another legal business practice, which is sometimes subject to abuse. Employee leasing is the practice of contracting with outside businesses to handle all administrative, personnel, and payroll concerns for employees. In some instances, employee-leasing companies fail to pay over to the IRS any portion of the collected employment taxes. These taxes are often spent by the owners on business or personal expenses. Often the company dissolves, leaving millions in employment taxes unpaid.    Paying Employees in Cash    Paying employees in whole or partially in cash is a common method of evading income and employment taxes resulting in lost tax revenue to the government and the loss or reduction of future social security or Medicare benefits for the employee.    Filing False Payroll Tax Returns or Failing to File Payroll Tax Returns    Preparing false payroll tax returns understating the amount of wages on which taxes are owed, or failing to file employment tax returns are methods commonly used to evade employment taxes.    Evasion of Employment Taxes Carries a Price    Evading employment taxes can have serious consequences for employers and the employees. Employers may be subject to criminal and civil sanctions for willfully failing to pay employment taxes. Employees suffer because they may not qualify for social security, Medicare, or unemployment benefits when employers do not report or pay employment and unemployment taxes.

GX018-57-0375036	"INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE   REVENUE PROTECTION STRATEGY         Introduction         Each year the Internal Revenue Service adjusts the Revenue Protection Strategy  (RPS) to focus on various problematic areas to protect the integrity of the tax system. As  part of an increased emphasis on customer service, the IRS is releasing the 1999 Revenue  Protection Strategy communications package at the beginning of the filing season. This  document communicates filing guidelines to taxpayers, practitioners, and other external  stakeholders. By following the guidelines, taxpayers may address problem areas before,  rather than after, the return is filed. Prevention of questionable or fraudulent returns  ensures consistency in application of the tax laws and fairness to all taxpayers.       This information is intended for both internal and external audiences. The  contents may be used in press releases, speeches, responses to media or Congressional  inquiries, practitioner newsletters, employee newsletters, or other methods of  communication intended for the education of employees, taxpayers and practitioners related  to the Revenue Protection Strategy (RPS).                  Contents           Priority Messages for 1999       1999 Revenue Protection Strategy Plans        1998 Revenue Protection Strategy Results        Questions and Answers for Taxpayers      Questions and Answers for Practitioners                   REVENUE PROTECTION STRATEGY         For the past five filing seasons, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has  continually increased its efforts to guard against problematic returns. The RPS is built  on a four-pronged approach to address the problems associated with fraudulent and  questionable returns:            Understanding--Research and analyze data in an ongoing effort to understand fraud    and the various methods of abuse, with a special emphasis on emerging trends.     Prevention--Validate return information up-front to prevent fraudulent or questionable    claims from entering the filing system.     Detection--Develop improved detection systems to identify multiple-return fraud schemes    and patterns of abuse among groups of taxpayers.     Enforcement-- Pursue criminal investigation and prosecution of fraudulent refund claims.    In addition, conduct pre-refund audits to determine eligibility for certain tax benefits.              PRIORITY MESSAGES FOR 1999      Social Security Numbers No Longer on Tax Package Labels      To protect taxpayers privacy, the social security numbers (SSNs) will no longer be  printed on the peel-off label included in the tax packages. It is all the more important  to clearly and accurately enter the SSNs in the spaces provided on page 1of the tax  return. Accurate entries will prevent delays in processing returns and also in issuing tax  refunds.       Earned Income Tax Credit Awareness Days      The IRS will sponsor six Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) Awareness Days to provide  assistance to EITC filers early in the filing season. These EITC Awareness Days are  scheduled for six consecutive Saturdays, starting January 16, 1999, in more than 250  locations nationwide. Times and locations will be announced through each IRS district  office.       Earned Income Tax Credit Recertification      For the first time, tax return filers will be prohibited from receiving EITC on  their 1998 tax returns if their 1997 tax returns were audited and they were not eligible  for the EITC. Before receiving the EITC again, these taxpayers must provide additional  information on Form 8862, Information To Claim Earned Income Tax Credit After  Disallowance, and attach it to their 1998 tax return. Letter 3094 was mailed to inform  taxpayers of the recertification requirements after the completion of the tax year 1997  audit. In some instances, the taxpayers will be requested to provide documents to verify  eligibility prior to receiving their refund. This process is known as Earned Income Tax  Credit ""recertification.""       In cases of a more serious nature as determined by auditing the tax year 1997  return, taxpayers may be prohibited from receiving EITC for two or ten years; negligence  and fraud penalties may also be applicable. If it is determined that the taxpayer is not  entitled to EITC due to reckless or intentional disregard of the rules, the credit cannot       be claimed by the taxpayer for the next two years. If the taxpayer fraudulently  claimed EITC, the taxpayer cannot claim EITC for the next ten years.       Due Diligence      Paid preparers of Federal income tax returns (both paper and electronically filed  returns) and claims for refund involving the EITC must now meet due diligence      requirements in determining if the taxpayer is eligible for the EITC and also in  determining the correct amount of EITC. Failure to do so could result in a $100 penalty  for each failure. Preparers will meet the due diligence requirements if they:            Complete Form 8867, Paid Preparer’s Earned Income Credit Checklist, or the      preparer’s own form provided it contains the same information as Form 8867,      Complete the EITC worksheet(s) in the Form 1040, 1040A or 1040EZ instructions, or      the preparer’s own worksheets if the same information is included,      Have no knowledge that any of the information used to determine EITC eligibility is      incorrect, and      Retain for three years Form 8867 (or their own form), the EITC worksheets(s) (or      their own worksheets), and a record of how, when, and from whom the information used to      prepare the form and worksheets was obtained.         For tax year 1998 returns and claims for refund, the preparer will satisfy the  first due diligence requirement by using Form 8867, or a modified version of the  eligibility checklist attached to Notice 97-65, 1997-51 I.R.B. 14 (December 22, 1997). The  modifications consist of replacing $9,770, $25,760, $29,290, and $2250 each time these  figures appear on the 1997 Eligibility Checklist with $10,030, $26,473, $30,095, and  $2,300, respectively.       Paid preparers may avoid imposition of the penalty with respect to a particular  return if the preparer can satisfactorily demonstrate that the preparer’s standard  office procedures are reasonable and routinely followed and that the particular failure  was isolated and inadvertent.       After a return preparer determines that all eligibility criteria* are met to claim  someone as a dependent or as an EITC qualifying child, carefully enter full names and  identifying numbers (SSNs [Social Security Numbers], ITINs [Individual Taxpayer  Identification Numbers], and ATINs [Adoption Taxpayer Identification Numbers]) on tax  forms. Be sure that all required information is present and that the numbers entered are  accurate. In the case of SSNs, copy the name (first, middle and last) and the SSN exactly  as shown on the social security card.  (For detailed information on the specific tests  and eligibility criteria, refer to the instructions included in the tax package,  Publication 17, Your Federal Income Tax, or Publication 596, Earned Income Credit.)          *EITC Note: Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers may not be used to claim  the earned income tax credit. Also, ""non-work"" SSNs--SSNs issued by the Social  Security Administration (SSA), with the phrase ""NOT VALID FOR EMPLOYMENT""  printed on the social security card--may not be used to claim EITC. This also applies to  non-work SSNs issued to children.        Emphasis on Research      For the 1999 filing season, increased emphasis will be placed on research. Ongoing  efforts, such as the 1998 study to measure EITC compliance levels, will continue. This  study, consisting of approximately 2,500 1997 tax returns, is nearing completion. Plans  call for a similar study of about 3,400 returns to be conducted during 1999. Other  research efforts will focus on various segments of non-compliant and problematic EITC  returns as well as the effectiveness of IRS programs. Earned Income Tax Credit  assistance/educational visits to return preparers will be conducted on a test basis. It  should be noted that the research component of RPS also includes developing and testing  alternative educational and outreach efforts to influence taxpayers’ behavior in lieu  of the traditional enforcement and compliance methods used to increase voluntary  compliance.            1999 Revenue Protection Strategy      As in past years, the Service will not disclose detailed information concerning  its plans for fraud control and revenue protection. However, there are broad pieces of the  strategy that we will disclose to help taxpayers and practitioners avoid unnecessary  problems in meeting their filing obligations.      During 1999, validation of SSNs and other tax identification numbers will continue  to be a very noticeable portion of our fraud and abuse prevention efforts. We are  expanding the validation of SSNs/TINs from virtually all forms and schedules requiring  identification numbers. We will identify dependent SSNs claimed on more than one return  and improper claiming of children for the dependency exemption and/or EITC. Taxpayers with  incomplete returns, invalid or duplicate SSNs, or returns evidencing patterns consistent  with suspicious claims or profiles can expect their refunds to be delayed or disallowed  pursuant to ""math error"" procedures or audits.       Starting in 1999, math error notices will be issued if EITC is claimed on the  return AND recertification is required, but Form 8862, Information To Claim Earned Income  Tax Credit After Disallowance, is not attached to the return. Recertification is required  if the tax year 1997 return was audited and EITC was not allowed. Letter 3094 was mailed  to inform taxpayers of the recertification requirements after conclusion of the tax year  1997 audit in 1998. The entire refund, or in some cases, only the EITC portion of the  refund will be held until the recertification form is reviewed, or until an audit is  conducted to verify entitlement. Both processes provide an opportunity for taxpayers to  furnish the necessary information or documents to prove EITC eligibility.       The Service will maintain the enforcement segment of the RPS by maintaining the  resource levels dedicated to the investigation and prosecution of taxpayers and tax return  preparers involved in fraudulent refund schemes. Resources remain available to       audit returns in specific problem categories as well as for those individuals  required to recertify entitlement to EITC. Monitoring visits to Electronic Return  Originators (EROs) will continue to ensure compliance.      The  EITC Communications Strategy  will be continued in 1999 and is composed  of:       Awareness - Taxpayers and practitioners need to understand the EITC eligibility  rules and the consequences of non-compliance.   Deterrence - Inform taxpayers and practitioners of planned compliance and the penalties  for intentional non-compliance efforts and penalties for non-compliance.   Prevention - Publicize availability of free return preparation assistance and electronic  filing provided on a pro-bono basis or through VITA and Tax Counseling for the Elderly.      A major component of the communications strategy, an in-depth review of EITC  related forms, schedules, worksheets, instructions and publications, is currently  underway. This process is a joint effort with IRS and an external consultant. The goals  are to revise and simplify the forms and instructions to increase understanding and  awareness of eligibility rules and to streamline the process to compute the EITC amount  accurately.            1998 Revenue Protection Strategy Results      The Service believes that the 1998 RPS was successful in reducing the tax  system’s vulnerability to fraud and abuse, particularly in the area of EITC, and in  preventing substantial dollars in erroneous refunds from being issued.       Although our efforts are currently focused on the EITC since additional funding  was provided to reduce the high levels of fraud, abuse and ineligibility, the RPS also  includes questionable motor fuel tax credits, and other credits based on valid  identification numbers. Future plans call for the expansion of the RPS to other areas.       Our prevention efforts for 1998 were most apparent to taxpayers with SSN problems  and their practitioners because of the continuing validation of SSNs. On the electronic  filing system, 3.4 million occurrences of missing, invalid or duplicate uses of SSNs  caused tax returns to be rejected back to the transmitter.       Another major prevention effort was implemented prior to the 1998 filing season  and consisted of sending several million ""advisory"" notices to taxpayers who  filed two types of problematic returns for the 1996 tax year. The first type of problem  return involved the use of an ""invalid"" SSN entered on the return for the  primary taxpayer. In this context, an ""invalid"" SSN occurs when the Social  Security Number and the individual’s name in SSA’s records do not match the name  and SSN shown on the tax return. The second type of problem return was caused by more than  one taxpayer filing a return and claiming the same individual as their dependent or as  their EITC-qualifying child. Although the data analysis is incomplete, the intent was to  reduce the potential for filing an incorrect return by providing advance notice and  avoiding the delays associated with the math error correction process.       Subsequent to the pre-filing season notification, approximately 1.7 million  returns were subjected to math error procedures as a result of missing, invalid or  ineligible TINs included on the return. Refunds were reduced until taxpayers could provide  the correct information. The net effect was to prevent the issuance of approximately $1.3  billion in erroneous refunds.       We continued our suitability requirements for practitioner entry into the  electronic filing system. Over 14,000 quality applicants were approved for admission under  suitability requirements. And just as importantly, we denied over 450 applicants  admittance because of problems with personal or business tax obligations, criminal  histories, serious financial difficulties, or failure to meet other requirements.      We performed over 1,600 compliance reviews of EROs during the filing season. As  expected, the vast majority of these practitioners were complying with the Revenue  Procedure governing electronic filing. However, we issued   174  warnings to participants for violations, and suspended 51 participants for serious  breaches of the requirements. These reviews have also proven to be an excellent  opportunity to provide assistance and answer practitioner questions.       For the fiscal year ending September 30,1998, Examination closed approximately  295,000 cases with recommended assessments of $454 million. Fewer resources were expended  to collect these assessments since many of the returns claimed refunds, which were not  issued until, or unless eligibility was verified. Also, at the end of the fiscal year,  approximately 500,000 returns identified during the 1998 filing season were still in the  audit process.       Through September 30, 1998, the Questionable Refund Detection Teams identified  over 2,800 fraudulent refund schemes involving multiple returns for paper and/or  electronically filed returns. We detected more than 26,000 fraudulent returns and  prevented the issuance of over $65 million in refunds. Furthermore, over 400,000  questionable returns that did not warrant criminal investigation were referred to  Examination.       The Compliance divisions were enlisted to pursue appropriate enforcement on  suspect returns. The Criminal Investigation Division initiated 239 criminal investigations  involving refund fraud schemes during the fiscal year ending September 30, 1998.  Prosecution recommendations were forwarded in 154 investigations, and we obtained  indictments on 169 individuals and convictions in 171 investigations.*      In addition, the Criminal Investigation Division initiated 118 criminal  investigations involving return preparers. Prosecution recommendations were forwarded in  119 investigations, and indictments obtained on 105 individuals, and convictions in 92       cases.*      *These totals include investigations initiated in prior fiscal years and some are  still pending.              Questions and Answers about Revenue  Protection in 1999           1. What is ""EITC Recertification"" and who is required    to recertify when claiming EITC in 1999?          EITC recertification is a new process designed to prevent tax return filers from  receiving EITC in 1999 if their 1997 tax returns were audited and they did not prove they  met all EITC eligibility requirements. Before receiving the EITC again, these taxpayers  must provide additional information on Form 8862, Information To Claim Earned Income Tax  Credit After Disallowance, when they file their 1998 tax return. In some instances,  taxpayers will be requested to provide documents to verify eligibility prior to receiving  their refund.       In cases of a more serious nature as determined by auditing the tax year 1997  return, taxpayers may be prohibited from receiving EITC for two or ten years; negligence  and fraud penalties may also be applicable. If it is determined that the taxpayer is not  entitled to EITC due to reckless or intentional disregard of the rules, the credit cannot  be claimed by the taxpayer for the next two years. If the taxpayer fraudulently claimed  EITC, the taxpayer cannot claim EITC for the next ten years.       After the 1997 audit was completed, Letter 3094 was mailed to inform taxpayers of  the EITC recertification requirements.       2. Is Revenue Protection expected to delay as many refunds in 1999 as it did in  1998?      The actual number of delayed refunds will depend upon taxpayers’ and return  preparers’ actions. Errors in identification numbers will cause delay or  disallowance, but many of these problems should have been resolved in prior years.  Resources are available to follow up on returns with missing and invalid TINs, multiple  use of individual SSNs for dependents and EITC qualifying children on more than one tax  return, returns where EITC eligibility is questionable, and returns claiming EITC  requiring recertification.       Prior to claiming someone as a dependent or as an EITC qualifying child on a  return, the taxpayer/return preparer must be certain that all of the required  ""tests"" are met for eligibility purposes.  (For detailed information on the  specific tests and eligibility criteria, refer to the instructions included in the tax  package, Publication 17, Your Federal Income Tax, or Publication 596, Earned Income  Credit.)        3. What is the main reason that Revenue Protection delays refunds?      The biggest reason for a refund delay is problems with SSNs listed on returns. The  criteria for a ""valid"" SSN are the combination of the SSN issued by the SSA, the  last name of the individual, and the date of birth for certain age-related tax benefits.  Social security numbers reported on tax returns are validated by comparing them to the  information provided by SSA.       Other reasons causing refund delays include more than one taxpayer claiming a  child as a dependent or as an EITC qualifying child, and improperly claiming children as  dependents or as EITC qualifying children. The impact of EITC recertification on refund  delays is unknown at this time.  Remember that only SSNs issued by SSA (without  employment restrictions) qualify for claiming EITC. Individual Taxpayer Identification  Numbers, ATINs, and SSNs ""Not Valid For Employment"" cannot be used to claim  EITC.      4. Is Revenue Protection more likely to delay my return if I file electronically?      No. Electronic filing confirms acceptance of your return within two workdays. If  there is a problem with the social security numbers on your return, in most cases, you  will be notified of the problem right away. This quick notice gives you more time to  correct the problem and re-file your return. Depending on the date you file, paper filing  can take several weeks to get notice of problems because so much of the work has to be  done by hand.      5. What new controls are in place for the 1999 filing season?      Although the Service will not disclose detailed information concerning plans for  fraud control or revenue protection, the EITC recertification process will probably be the  most visible enhancement. The intent of this legislation is to cost effectively prevent  ineligible filers from receiving EITC. Legislative changes require taxpayers to certify  that they are eligible for EITC for tax year 1998 and subsequent years before receiving  EITC if their 1997 tax return was audited and they did not or could not provide proof that  they qualified for EITC. Before receiving the EITC in the future, taxpayers must attach  Form 8862, Information To Claim Earned Income Tax Credit After Disallowance, to their 1998  tax return. In some instances, taxpayers will be required to provide documentation to  verify eligibility. In cases of a more serious nature, negligence and fraud penalties may  also be applied, in addition to not being able to claim EITC for two or ten years.       6. How can I be sure that the social security numbers being used on my return  won’t cause problems?      First, make sure that you have listed  all  SSNs and  full  names of  each individual. Verify that the names and numbers are accurate and agree with the  information on file with SSA by checking the information displayed on the social security  card. If you or someone else listed on your tax return does not have an SSN, apply for one  with SSA. Contact SSA to find out what information is required to obtain an SSN. The  Social Security Administration’s toll-free telephone number is 1-800-772-1213.           Second, make sure that all the numbers you enter are valid. A ""valid  SSN"" is the combination of the individual’s number, names, and date of birth for  certain age-related tax benefits. If you, your spouse, or any of your dependents have  changed your name, make sure to register this change with SSA prior to filing your 1998  tax return.       Third, if you had a problem with a number last year, find out if the problem was  caused by an error in recording or copying the number on your return. If the number was  recorded correctly, then the record at SSA may not have name changes or other identifying  information. Contact SSA to correct this problem  before  you file your return.      NOTE: To avoid one of the most common mistakes, make sure that when children file  their own tax return, especially their first tax return, that they do not take an  exemption for themselves if the parents (or someone else) can claim them as a dependent.       Before preparing the tax return, determine if all eligibility criteria are met to  claim someone as a dependent or as an EITC qualifying child.  (For detailed information  on the specific tests and eligibility criteria, refer to the instructions included in the  tax package, Publication 17, Your Federal Income Tax, or Publication 596, Earned Income  Credit.)          Then, carefully enter full names and identifying numbers (SSNs, ITINs and ATINs)  on tax forms. Be sure that all required information is present and that the numbers  entered are accurate. In the case of SSNs, copy the name (first, middle and last) and the  SSN exactly as shown on the social security card.       Reminder, since the pre-printed labels included with the tax packages no longer  reflect your social security number (and your spouse if you are filing a joint return), it  is essential that the numbers are entered accurately. This will prevent processing and  refund delays.      7. When should I contact Social Security with a social security number problem?      In order to avoid delays in filing your return, contact SSA before the filing  season:       If you don’t know or don’t have good records of your own, your  spouse’s, or your dependents’ numbers, contact SSA to apply for a replacement  social security card, which is the official verification of a person’s name and  number in SSA’s records.      If you, your spouse, or any of your dependents have changed names, make sure to  register this change with SSA prior to filing your 1998 tax return. Keep in mind that a  new application for a number or a name change in SSA’s records takes three weeks to  be updated in IRS’ records. This means that you should wait three weeks from the time  you contact SSA before filing or re-filing your tax return if you have applied or changed  your Social Security record.      If you are unable to obtain an SSN, you must apply for an Individual Taxpayer  Identification Number (ITIN) from IRS by filing Form W-7 (or Form W-7SP), Application for  IRS Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, with the necessary identification  documents. In the case of children being adopted and not yet eligible for an SSN, you must  apply for an Adoption Taxpayer Identification Number (ATIN) from IRS by filing Form W-7A,  Application for Taxpayer Identification Number for Pending U.S. Adoptions, with the  necessary documentation. You may file electronically with a valid ITIN or ATIN for 1998.  However, you cannot claim EITC if you, your spouse or the dependent you claim has an ITIN.  A child in the process of being adopted who has an ATIN does not qualify you for claiming  EITC; an amended return, Form 1040X can be filed to claim EITC after the adoption process  is complete and an SSN is obtained.       EITC Note: Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers and ATINs may not be used to  claim the earned income tax credit. Also, ""non-work"" SSNs--SSNs issued by the  Social Security Administration (SSA), with the phrase ""NOT VALID FOR EMPLOYMENT""  printed on the social security card--may not be used to claim EITC. This also applies to  non-work SSNs issued to children.      8. What is an ITIN and what is its purpose?      An ITIN, or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, is a tax processing number  that became available on July 1, 1996, for certain nonresident and resident aliens, their  spouses and dependents. The ITIN is only available from IRS for those individuals who  cannot obtain an SSN.      Individuals who must file a U.S. tax return or are listed on a tax return as a  spouse or dependent, and who do not have and cannot obtain a valid SSN must apply for an  ITIN. Each person on the return must have a valid number, either an SSN or an ITIN.      ITINs are only used to process U.S. federal income tax returns. The issuance of an  ITIN has no effect on an individual’s immigration status or authorization to work in  the U.S. When completing the tax return, the individual must enter the ITIN in the space  for the SSN. An ITIN cannot be used to obtain EITC benefits.      9. What if I file without the number?      A return submitted without a valid SSN or ITIN for the primary taxpayer and/or the  spouse will be delayed; any expected refund will not be issued until the identification  number is obtained. If a dependent on the return does not have an SSN or an ITIN, the  return will be processed; however, the exemption for the dependent will not be allowed and  that portion of the refund will not be allowed.       10. What if I already have an IRS temporary number?      Taxpayers who were previously assigned an IRS temporary identification number--  which begins with a ""9"" must now apply for an ITIN, only if they are unable to  obtain an SSN. The temporary number previously assigned by the IRS will no longer be  valid.       11. How can I apply for an ITIN?      To obtain an ITIN, you must complete IRS Form W-7,  Application for IRS  Individual Identification Number.  A Spanish version, Form W-7SP, is also available.  The W-7 is an application form and requires documentation substantiating foreign/alien  status as well as proof of identity of the individual. The original documentation, along  with the Form W-7 can either be presented at an IRS Customer Service office or mailed to  the Philadelphia Service Center. The mailing address is:      Internal Revenue Service -Philadelphia Service Center    PO Box 447 ATTENTION: Drop Point 426    Bensalem, PA 19020      In addition, the IRS has designated acceptance agents for ITIN applications. These  acceptance agents may also be tax return preparers who can verify that all of the required  documents were submitted by the taxpayer.      12. What is an ATIN and what is the purpose of an ATIN?      An ATIN, or Adoption Taxpayer Identification Number, is a tax processing number  issued by the IRS as a temporary taxpayer identification number for a child in the  domestic adoption process and who is not yet eligible for an SSN. An ATIN is not a  permanent identification number and is only intended for temporary use. Upon finalization  of the adoption process, an SSN for the child must be obtained. The individual(s) adopting  the child must use the ATIN to claim the child as a dependent and to claim the child and  dependent care credit. An ATIN can not be used to claim EITC for the child being adopted.  An amended return claiming EITC may be filed once the adoption is complete and an SSN is  assigned.      13. How can I obtain an ATIN for my child?      To obtain an ATIN, you must complete IRS Form W-7A,  Application for Taxpayer  Identification Number for Pending U.S. Adoptions.  The W-7A is an application form and  requires  copies  of documents validating the child’s identity, the fact that  the child was placed in your home for adoption, and the placing agency. The Form W-7A and  copies   of the original documentation, must be mailed to:      Internal Revenue Service-Philadelphia Service Center   ATIN Unit PO Box 447   Bensalem, PA 19020      14. How long does it take to get an ATIN or ITIN?      It will generally take six to eight weeks to get an ATIN or an ITIN once the IRS  receives a completed Form W-7 or Form W-7A, and the required documentation. After eight  weeks, if you have not heard from the IRS about your application, you may call the  Philadelphia Service Center at (215) 516-4846. (Not a toll-free call.)              Practitioner Questions and Answers  about Revenue Protection in 1999         1. What is ""EITC Recertification"" and how can I determine if my client  is required to recertify when claiming EITC in 1999?       EITC recertification is a new process designed to prevent tax return filers from  receiving EITC in 1999 if their 1997 tax returns were audited and they did not prove they  met all EITC eligibility requirements. Before receiving the EITC again, these taxpayers  must provide additional information on Form 8862, Information To Claim Earned Income Tax  Credit After Disallowance, when they file their 1998 tax return. After the tax year 1997  audit was completed, Letter 3094 was mailed to inform taxpayers of the EITC  recertification requirements.       In some instances, taxpayers will be requested to provide documents to verify  eligibility prior to receiving their refund. In cases of a more serious nature as  determined by auditing the tax year 1997 return, taxpayers may be prohibited from  receiving EITC for two or ten years; negligence and fraud penalties may also be  applicable. If it is determined that the taxpayer is not entitled to EITC due to reckless  or intentional disregard of the rules, the credit cannot be claimed by the taxpayer for  the next two years. If the taxpayer fraudulently claimed EITC, the taxpayer cannot claim  EITC for the next ten years.      2. What is necessary to meet the due diligence requirements when preparing a  return with Earned Income Tax Credit?       Preparers of EITC returns (both paper and electronically filed returns) are  expected to exercise due diligence in obtaining accurate information to determine  eligibility and correctly computing the EITC amount. Form 8867, Paid Preparer’s  Earned Income Credit Checklist, or an equivalent form, must be filled out and maintained  for three years. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in a $100 penalty  for each failure.      3. Will the Service conduct monitoring visits to electronic filing participants  during the upcoming filing season?      Yes. The Service will again visit the business locations of electronic filing  participants. During these visits, the Service personnel will provide assistance and  review the practitioner’s compliance with requirements of Revenue Procedure 98-50 and  other publications governing participation in the electronic filing system.      4. Why are these compliance visits considered necessary?      In the past, we identified electronic filing practitioners who were not complying  with the program’s requirements. We make compliance visits to ensure that  participants adhered to the program’s rules and to demonstrate to the participants  that we would actively identify and correct non-compliance.       5. What types of problems resulted in the suspension of electronic filing  participants?       Although the reasons for suspension covered a broad spectrum of non-compliance,  the following categories were most often cited as the basis for suspension:                   - employing currently suspended EROs;       - failing to retain copies of Form 8453 or retaining unsigned Forms 8453;       - redirecting refund checks to the ERO’s business address; and       - operating non-disclosed branch locations or accepting returns from businesses not in the      program.              6. How are businesses selected for compliance visits?      A large portion of businesses selected for compliance visits were identified by  patterns of questionable conduct. The Service Center personnel identified practitioners  with high return reject rates or late filed Forms 8453. We also identified unusual  patterns in returns filed from single or related preparer businesses. Internal Revenue  Service personnel may identify problems with advertising. We also receive complaints from  taxpayers or other tax practitioners concerning apparent problem practitioners.       7. Why can’t compliance visits be conducted after the filing season or at  least be scheduled in advance.       Visits must be conducted during the filing season because it is important to  identify non-compliant participants and correct their behavior as soon as possible.  Advance notification would allow non-compliant businesses to conceal certain types of  misconduct. However, some visits will be scheduled in advance. Personnel have been trained  and instructed to conduct the visitations as discreetly and quickly as possible in order  to minimize disruption of the business’ activities.       8. How can I assist my clients in avoiding delays in their refunds caused by the  Revenue Protection Strategy?      EITC Note: Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers and ATINs may not be used to  claim the earned income tax credit. Also, ""non-work"" SSNs--SSNs issued by the  Social Security Administration (SSA), with the phrase ""NOT VALID FOR EMPLOYMENT""  printed on the social security card--may not be used to claim EITC. This also applies to  non-work SSNs issued to children.      One key reason for a return to be rejected or delayed is a problem with an SSN  listed on the return. First, make sure that all required SSNs are provided on the return.      Check the accuracy of all SSNs, along with the full name by comparing it to the  information displayed on the social security card. If the taxpayer does not have a number  for themselves, their spouse or their dependents, they should apply for a number with the  SSA. If the taxpayer is unable to obtain an SSN, they must apply for an ITIN from IRS by  filing Form W-7 with the necessary identification documents. They can file electronically  with an ITIN for their tax year 1998 return, but must have a valid SSN or ITIN for the  primary and secondary taxpayers, as well as for all dependents claimed.      Secondly, only allow the taxpayer to claim the dependency exemption or EITC based  on  the children in their household that meet all of the ""tests."" (For  detailed information on the specific tests and eligibility criteria, refer to the  instructions included in the tax package, Publication 17, Your Federal Income Tax, or  Publication 596, Earned Income Credit.)          Verify that the SSN is valid. Check the accuracy of the SSN, along with the name  by comparing it to the information on the social security card. To make sure, also check  to determine if the taxpayer or dependents have registered a name change or other  information change with the SSA and update the return appropriately. Ask for social  security cards or other records to properly record the number. If a client had a problem  with a SSN last year, determine if the problem was due to an error in recording or  transcribing the number. If the number was correctly recorded, then the record at SSA may  not reflect name changes (due to divorce, marriage, adoption, etc.) or other identifying  information. The taxpayer should contact SSA to resolve this problem before filing the  return.       Lastly, do not automatically rollover the information from the prior year tax  return. Check that the address is still current, along with all names and identification  numbers by comparing it to the clients’ social security cards, driver’s  licenses, etc.  Enter the first, middle and last name for each dependent or EITC  qualifying child. Use caution with foreign or hyphenated surnames, check the name on the  social security card and enter the name exactly as shown.          Since the pre-printed labels will no longer display the taxpayer’s or  spouse’s SSN, it is very important to accurately enter the taxpayer’s SSN of the  taxpayer (and the spouse’s SSN if a joint return is being filed). Accurate entries  will prevent processing and refund delays.       9. Many of my SSN related rejects for electronically filed returns involved valid  SSNs with a mismatch on the name. I have heard of many mismatches caused by incorrect  middle initials, hyphenated surnames, etc. How can I avoid mismatches caused by these  types of problems?       To ensure that a valid SSN belongs to the person listed on a tax return, make sure  that the full name is correct as is shown on SSA records. Mismatches are likely to be  caused by an error in recording the name control part of the record. Most errors  identified in our reviews are caused by transpositions of letters or numbers. Other common  causes of mismatches include entering identifiers (like Jr., Sr., III) in the name field.  For hyphenated surnames, make sure the hyphenated name is the way the name is recorded  with SSA.      A detailed discussion of surname entry formats can be found in Publication 1346  (Electronic Return File Specifications and Record Layouts for Individual Income Tax  Returns). The specific references can be located in Part I, Validation--Form 1040 Required  Field Entries. If your software product ""interprets"" the name control from  entries in the full name field, entries in the full name field should also conform to the  name control format.      10. When should I refer a client to the Social Security Administration with an  apparent SSN problem?      The return should be prepared based on information and the personal records  readily available to the taxpayer (for example: the individual’s social security  number card; prior year tax returns; W-2s; birth certificates, employment, school and  medical records; etc.)      Individuals who do not know nor have any suitable record of their own, their  spouse’s, or their dependents’ SSNs, should be referred to SSA to request a  replacement social security card, prior to filing their return. The social security card  is the official verification of an individual’s name and SSN on SSA’s records.  Also, those who have recently changed their names and have not yet advised SSA should be  referred.      If the taxpayer provides Social Security cards (for the taxpayer, the  taxpayer’s spouse, or for a child) with the words ""Not Valid for  Employment,"" but states their employment status has changed, he or she can be  referred to SSA to update their information and request a new card.       If a return is rejected due to a mismatch of name, SSN, or age of the taxpayer or  dependent, the tax preparer should carefully review the transmitted return information and  reject codes and compare the problem entries with the taxpayer. Most of the problems  referred to SSA in previous years were in fact transcription/transposition errors made by  the taxpayer or tax preparer.  Most mismatches can be resolved directly with the  taxpayer, avoiding the inconvenience and delay of a referral to SSA.  The social  security card is the official verification of an individual’s SSN. If a tax preparer  needs proof of the SSN, but the individual has lost his or her card, refer the individual  to SSA for a replacement card. Replacement cards should be received within two weeks.       Tax preparers who experience a significant number of rejects should promptly  discuss the situation with the local IRS Electronic Filing representative to ensure that  any systemic problems are identified and quickly resolved.      11. Are my clients more likely to experience Revenue Protection delays if they  file electronically?      No. In fact, the electronic filing alternative offers a quick confirmation (within  two workdays) that the return has been accepted. And just as importantly, if there are  problems with the social security numbers listed on the return, you will usually receive a  quick identification of the problem number and the nature of the error. This permits a  prompt resolution and retransmission of recording or transcription based errors. If the  problem is a name control mismatch with SSA records, you should resolve the difference  with SSA and resubmit the return. Depending on the date filed, paper filing can take  several weeks to get notice of problems to the taxpayer.       12. Does the Service expect to delay as many taxpayer refunds in 1999 as it did in  1998?      The actual number of delayed refunds will be greatly influenced by the behavior of  taxpayers and return preparers. As noted previously, errors in SSNs/identification numbers  and corresponding names will cause delays for taxpayers, as well as the improper use of  children claimed as dependents or as an EITC qualifying child.       Based on current plans, the annual compliance study will consist of no more than  approximately 3,400 returns.       13. What should I do if I think a client or another return preparer is filing  fraudulent returns or participating in a fraud scheme?       The tax professional has a vested interest (both as a taxpayer and tax preparer)  in the protection of the filing system. Report your suspicions by calling 1-800-829-0433.      14. I have clients who need an ATIN or ITIN. How can I help them obtain the Form  W-7 or W-7A?            Call 1-800-TAX-FORM. Bulk quantities may be ordered through this number.       Form W-7 is the application for the ITIN and Form W-7A is the application for the    ATIN.         You may use a personal computer to download the proper Form W-7 from the IRS  Bulletin Board; for access, call 703-321-8020. Both Form W-7 and Form W-7A are also  available on the IRS World Wide Web site at   http://www.irs.treas.gov . These forms may also be obtained at the nearest IRS office.       15. How long will it take to get an ITIN or ATIN?      It takes about six to eight weeks to receive a number. Your clients should apply  at least 6-8 weeks before the tax return is due, or 6-8 weeks prior to when they plan to  file their tax return. Do NOT attach the Form W-7 or Form W-7A to the tax return at the  time of filing.       [ Treasury Home Page ]  [ site map ]  [ CID Home Page ]"

This has been supplemented with networking with examiners in other districts, and sports league information from public sources. Although this guide focuses on major league sports franchises, the examination techniques and issues addressed also have relevance to the examinations of minor league sports franchises.  EMERGING ISSUES AND SPORTS FRANCHISE ISP TEAM ISSUE ASSISTANCE Potential emerging sports franchise issues addressed in this guide are distinguished from established sports franchise issues. Any emerging sports franchise issues are addressed at the end of the applicable issue chapter. For some emerging sports franchise issues, a position is not taken. Promising emerging issues may receive additional consideration by the Sports Franchise Industry Specialization Program (ISP) team. Examiners are encouraged to contact the Sports Franchise ISP team, located in the South Florida District, for issue assistance on both established and emerging sports franchise issues addressed in this guide.  SPORTS LEAGUE ASSOCIATIONS Each of the major sports leagues is represented by a league association. The primary purpose of the league association is to promote the sport, negotiate national TV broadcast rights, negotiate national sponsorship agreements, and protect the interests of the sports franchise owners and the sports league as a whole. The individual sports franchises in the league are members of the league association. League associations are operated as tax exempt organizations under IRC section 501(c)(6).  1-1   LEAGUE REVENUE SHARING Each of the major sports leagues has revenue sharing. The leagues equally divide national television revenues regardless of the sports franchise's number of televised games, winning record, or drawing power among the sports franchises in the league. Merchandise licensed on a national level, such as team logos, are also shared by the sports franchises in the leagues. Sharing of gate receipts varies among the leagues. For instance, the National Football League (NFL), splits gate receipts 60-40 with the home team receiving the larger amount, whereas in the National Hockey League (NHL), the home team retains the entire gate. In the National Basketball Association (NBA), the home team retains 94 percent of the gate with the league receiving the other 6 percent. In Major League Baseball (MLB), the split with the American league is 80-20, and in the National League, the visiting team receives 42 cents per admission. Local media revenue is not shared, and the revenue from stadium box seats is generally not shared. There are significant differences in the relative amount of revenue shared in the different leagues. The NFL has the highest degree of revenue sharing with over 80 percent of league revenues shared. This is because the NFL derives most of its revenue from national media broadcasting contracts. On the other end of the scale, only 5.4 percent of league revenue is shared in the NHL. The NHL derives only a small portion of total revenue from its national media contracts, with the majority of its revenues obtained from gate receipts. The MLB and the NBA fall between these two extremes.  THE MAJOR SPORTS LEAGUE TEAMS The major sports league information furnished below is based on the status of these leagues in 1998. A separate sports franchise owns each of the major league teams listed.  1-2   The National Basketball Association The National Basketball Association (NBA) consists of 29 teams divided into the Eastern and Western Conferences. The teams are further divided into four divisions: Atlantic, Central, Midwest and Pacific. Eastern Conference Atlantic Division Boston Celtics Miami Heat New Jersey Nets New York Knicks Orlando Magic Philadelphia 76ers Washington Wizards Central Division Atlanta Hawks Charlotte Hornets Chicago Bulls Cleveland Cavaliers Detroit Pistons Indiana Pacers Milwaukee Bucks Toronto Raptors  Western Conference Midwest Division Dallas Mavericks Denver Nuggets Houston Rockets Minnesota Timberwolves San Antonio Spurs Utah Jazz Vancouver Grizzlies Pacific Division Golden State Warriors Los Angeles Clippers Los Angeles Lakers Phoenix Suns Portland Trail Blazers Sacramento Kings Seattle SuperSonics  Each team plays an 82 game regular season schedule with 41 home games and 41 away games. The winner in each division, plus the next six top finishing teams in the conference, play to determine the conference winner. The two conference winners play in the NBA playoffs to determine the overall NBA champion.  1-3   The National Football League The National Football League (NFL) consists of 31 teams divided into the American and National Conferences. Both the American and National Conferences further divide the teams into three divisions: Eastern, Central, and Western. American Conference Eastern Division Buffalo Bills Indianapolis Colts Miami Dolphins New England Patriots New York Jets Central Division Cincinnati Bengals Baltimore Ravens Tennessee Titans Pittsburgh Steelers Jacksonville Jaguars Cleveland Browns Western Division Denver Broncos Kansas City Chiefs Oakland Raiders San Diego Chargers Seattle Seahawks National Conference Eastern Division Arizona Cardinals Dallas Cowboys New York Giants Philadelphia Eagles Washington Redskins Central Division Chicago Bears Detroit Lions Green Bay Packers Minnesota Vikings Tampa Bay Buccaneers  Western Division St. Louis Rams Atlanta Falcons New Orleans Saints San Francisco 49ers Carolina Panthers  Each team plays a 16 game regular season schedule with 8 home games and 8 away games. The winner in each division, plus the next three top finishing teams in each conference, play to determine the conference champion for their respective conference. The two teams that win their respective conference play against each other for the overall league championship in the Super Bowl.  1-4   Major League Baseball Major League Baseball (MLB) includes 30 teams, with the American and National Leagues having 14 and 16 team circuits respectively. The American and National Leagues further divide the teams into three divisions: Eastern, Central, and Western. National League Eastern Division Atlanta Braves Montreal Expos Florida Marlins New York Mets Philadelphia Phillies Central Division St. Louis Cardinals Houston Astros Cincinnati Reds Chicago Cubs Pittsburgh Pirates Milwaukee Brewers Western Division San Diego Padres Los Angeles Dodgers Colorado Rockies San Francisco Giants Arizona Diamondbacks American League Eastern Division New York Yankees Baltimore Orioles Boston Red Sox Toronto Blue Jays Tampa Bay Devil Rays Central Division Cleveland Indians Chicago White Sox Detroit Tigers Minnesota Twins Kansas City Royals  Western Division Texas Rangers Seattle Mariners Oakland Athletics Anaheim Angels  Each team plays a 162 game regular season, with 81 home games and 81 away games. The top four teams in each league, with at least one from each division, play in the post season league championship games. The two teams that emerge as champions of their respective leagues play in the World Series. The winner of the World Series is the MLB champion.  1-5   The National Hockey League The National Hockey League (NHL) consists of 26 teams divided into the Eastern and Western Conferences. The teams are further divided into four divisions: Northeast, Atlantic, Central, and Pacific. Eastern Conference Northeast Division Boston Bruins Pittsburgh Penguins Montreal Canadiens Hartford Whalers Buffalo Sabres Ottawa Senators Atlantic Division Philadelphia Flyers New York Rangers Florida Panthers Washington Capitals Tampa Bay Lightning New Jersey Devils New York Islanders  Western Conference Central Division Chicago Blackhawks Dallas Stars Detroit Redwings St. Louis Blues Phoenix Coyotes Toronto Maple Leafs Colorado Avalanche Pacific Division Mighty Ducks of Anaheim Calgary Flames Edmonton Oilers Los Angeles Kings San Jose Sharks Vancouver Canucks  Each team plays an 82 game regular season schedule, with 41 home games and 41 away games. The top eight teams in each conference play to determine the conference winner. The two conference winners play in the Stanley Cup Playoffs to determine the overall NHL champion.  1-6   League Expansion The major sports leagues have added new teams throughout the course of their history, and each league is scheduled for further expansion. Expansion teams added in the major sports leagues in the 1990's are as follows: The National Basketball Association 1994 - Toronto Raptors (started playing in 1995-1996 season) 1994 - Vancouver Grizzlies (started playing in 1995-1996 season) The National Football League 1993 - Carolina Panthers (started playing in 1995 season) 1993 - Jacksonville Jaguars (started playing in 1995 season) 1998 - Cleveland Browns (started playing in 1999) Major League Baseball 1993 1993 1998 1998 Colorado Rockies (National League) Florida Marlins (National League) Arizona Diamondbacks (National League) Tampa Bay Devil Rays (American League)  The National Hockey League 1991 1992 1992 1993 1993 San Jose Sharks Ottawa Senators Tampa Bay Lightning Mighty Ducks of Anaheim Florida Panthers  1-7   This page intentionally left blank.  1-8   Chapter 2 GENERAL SPORTS FRANCHISE EXAMINATION TECHNIQUES  OVERVIEW This chapter addresses general sports franchise examination techniques. More detailed examination techniques and issue guidance are contained in the specific issue chapters of this guide. GENERAL ACCOUNTING CONSIDERATIONS Even among sports franchises in the same league, the financial statements for the sports franchise are generally unique. There are often significant differences in accounting for the acquisition of the sports franchise and in the accounting policies for major items such as player contracts and contingencies. There are also varying levels of vertical business integration. The financial statements often reflect significant related party transactions which are common for most sports franchises. The amortization of player contracts is almost always a material audit issue. Player contracts are typically structured to include signing bonuses and deferred compensation arrangements. For most sports franchises, ticket revenues and broadcasting rights constitute the majority of revenue. Many teams also have favorable lease arrangements in which the team receives revenue from parking, concessions, and stadium naming rights. Advance sales of upcoming season tickets are typically reflected as deferred revenue on the balance sheet. Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) require that gate revenues be recorded in the period in which the fans attend the games so that they are matched against period costs. As with other industries, the GAAP timing of income and expenses for sports franchises often differs from that for tax purposes. RETURN IDENTIFICATION AND ENTITY BACKGROUND INFORMATION There are usually a limited number of sports franchises located within a specific district. For purposes of an approved district compliance initiative, sports franchise returns can often best be identified through the examiner's personal knowledge of the sports teams located within their district. The main problem in identifying returns, however, is identifying the owner's entity name under which the tax return is filed, as opposed to the sports franchise's ""doing business as"" (DBA) name. This can be a difficult and time consuming task in situations in which the entity operates as a partnership. One way to identify the ownership entity is through the use of the incorporation library 2-1   (INCORP) on Lexis-Nexis. By accessing the XXBIZ file (where XX represents the state abbreviation; for example, FLBIZ for Florida) examiners can usually locate the records for the ownership entity by utilizing the DBA name as the search term. The BIZ file can provide a wealth of information about the entity, including the entity's registered name; the form of the entity, for example, corporation or partnership; the officers of record; and the federal employer's identification number (EIN). The INCORP records will also indicate whether or not the entity is still active, or if it has been dissolved (voluntary or involuntary). Additionally, historical data is provided which, if applicable, would include name changes or whether a merger had occurred. The BIZ file will often cross reference related entity records. PREPLAN AND ISSUE IDENTIFICATION The following information is presented to assist in assessing the audit potential of a sports franchise return. It should only be used as supplemental information during the preplanning stage of an examination. Since it is not all inclusive, in no way should it restrict the examiner from identifying other potential return issues that may be present. Intangible Assets The balance sheet is an integral part of any preplan. Aside from normal preplan audit considerations, a specific review of the allocation among amortizable and non-amortizable intangible assets is especially important in sports franchise examinations. A sports franchise's non-amortizable intangible assets may, upon examination, be determined to be significant. The ratio of non-amortizable intangible assets (TV broadcast rights, goodwill, going concern value, and franchise costs) to amortizable assets (primarily player contracts) will depend on how long the franchise has been in existence and the number of marque players employed by the team. Form 4562, Depreciation and Amortization, should be viewed to ascertain if amortization has been claimed on non-amortizable intangible assets. An inspection of Form 4562 might also indicate potential problems regarding the amount of the original franchise cost (whether by purchase or by expansion) allocated to player contracts, the useful life assigned to player contracts, and the placed in-service date for these contracts. Deferred Revenue and Deposits In order to identify deferred revenue and amounts that may have been improperly treated as non-taxable deposits, a detailed review of balance sheet current liabilities and long term liabilities is recommended. The detail attached to the return may identify the make up of any deferred revenue. For example, the detail may state that long term liabilities include deferred broadcast revenue and deferred sponsorship revenue. Look at long-term liabilities to determine if any deferred revenue is included. Sources of income 2-2   such as ticket revenue for games which may extend beyond more than one season are often inappropriately deferred. Amounts treated by the taxpayer as non-taxable deposits, which may in fact be taxable advance payments for services, may be included in long term liabilities or other liabilities. The deposit/advance payment amounts for multiple year season ticket holder agreements (regular season ticket holders, club seats, and skybox or executive suites) can be quite significant. This is especially the case for new sports franchises resulting from league expansion or team relocations and sports franchises that have or are trying to improve or expand the stadiums in which they play their home games. Accrued Expenses As part of the examination of the balance sheet, large accrued expense items should be considered. Accrued expenses may include such items as accrued bonuses or compensation to related parties to which IRC section 267 or IRC section 482 may apply. Additionally, accrued compensation costs will often fall under the purview of IRC section 404 (deductions for deferred compensation) or IRC section 419 (deductions for contributions to welfare benefit funds). Also, a large accrual of rent for a stadium or an arena should be reviewed to determine whether it qualifies as an IRC section 467 rental agreement, and if so, that the requirements of IRC section 467 are in compliance. Other Deductions As with any examination, excessive repair expenses claimed may indicate capital improvements are being improperly expensed. The same can be said for excessive professional fees claimed, which may represent fees connected with the acquisition of the sports franchise, a lease agreement, or similar capital asset. The audited financial statements should reflect any loans to related parties and the terms of the loans. A review of this information may indicate an IRC section 7872 issue involving related party debt having below market interest rates. Schedule M-1 Schedule M-1 should be inspected to determine the sports franchise's differences between taxable income and book income. As with other taxpayers, these differences warrant consideration. A taxpayer's tax accounting and book accounting are the same for items not reflected in Schedule M-1. Accordingly, awareness of the sports franchise accounting areas for which there are usually differences in tax accounting and book accounting (which raise questions by their absence from Schedule M-1) can assist the examiner in identifying areas of audit risk.  2-3   An example is the absence of a Schedule M-1 adjustment for amortization. Generally, a sports franchise's amortization will be less for tax purposes than for book purposes. This is especially the case for new franchises, whether through expansion or purchase. Related Party Transactions Related party transactions are common for sports franchises. Concession arrangements, local television contracts, and stadium lease arrangements to related entities are common in the industry. It is not uncommon for the owners of the sports franchise to have an interest in these and other businesses that have financial dealings with the sports franchise. The audited financial statements are a good source of information. Generally accepted accounting principles and more specifically Statement of Financial Accounting Standard 57, Related Party Disclosures, require disclosure of related party transactions in the notes to the financial statements. This includes information on: (1) their affect on the financial statements, (2) the dollar amount of each transaction, and (3) any amounts due to or from related parties along with the terms of the debt arrangement. Often, the underlying documents will be needed to determine the substance of related party transactions. ISSUE DEVELOPMENT Issue development is the key to any examination. This means the facts should be fully developed to support the underlying issue, and to the extent possible, the taxpayer should acknowledge agreement with the facts. Exhibit 2-1 is a sample Form 4564, Information Document Request, that can be tailored to fit the specific needs of the examination. Depending on the issue, the examiner may need to retain a copy of many of the documents and agreements inspected during the examination for the case file workpapers. Factual development starts with the initial interview. The interview should be conducted with the party having first-hand knowledge, usually the chief financial officer or comptroller. It is important to develop initial interview questions which fit the particular facts and circumstances of the sports franchise. Exhibit 2-2 is a sample interview questionnaire that can be tailored to the sports franchise's unique facts and circumstances. This sample interview questionnaire contains generic, initial interview questions, as well as questions specific to sports franchise examinations. The questionnaire is by no means all inclusive. Rather, it is meant to be used as only a guideline.  2-4   As with most examinations, a key to good issue development of how many stadiums or sports arenas the examiner has visit Moreover, visiting a stadium or sports arena as a spectator is facility as an examiner, where one has the opportunity to ask financing arrangements, and income producing activities.  is a tour of the business. Regardless ed, each is unique in its own way. quite different from touring the questions about the lives of assets,  It is preferable that the examination take place at the sports franchise's place of business. A dayto-day observation of the business operations can lead to a more thorough understanding of the facts, clear up potential misunderstandings, and facilitate obtaining information from the taxpayer in a timely manner. This usually minimizes the time expended on the examination and inconvenience to the taxpayer. Make specialist referrals as early as possible. Because a Computer Audit Specialist (CAS) referral is mandatory on all cases with Activity Code 219 and above, sports franchises typically require a CAS referral. Asset valuation issues are usually identified early in the examination. If asset valuation assistance is warranted, make the engineering referral early in the examination. REQUIRED FILING CHECKS There are usually related entity returns that should be inspected and perhaps examined. This often includes the tax returns of the owners of the sports franchise. The single largest expense of a professional sports franchise team is its salaries due to ever increasing player costs. It is, therefore, important for examiners to filing of all employment tax returns. In addition, the policies for issuing Forms reviewed in conjunction with a determination that all required Forms 1099 wer employees and subcontractors were properly classified. and wages. This is ensure the proper 1099 should be e issued and that  Among other things, examiners should ensure that any relocation expenses paid to new players, coaches, etc., are included in the employee's W-2. Additionally, examiners should determine if taxable fringe benefits have been properly handled. For example, if all employees are provided season tickets at no cost, the value of the tickets given should be included in the employee's W-2, and proper FICA and FUTA paid. If appropriate, the assistance of an Employment Tax Specialist should be requested. Player Personal Service Corporations A potential issue area is whether the sports franchise's players have formed personal service corporations (PSCs) through which their services are offered to the sports franchise. A PSC may have a tax impact on the individual player under IRC section 269A and IRC section 482. In addition, a PSC is likely to have a major employment tax impact on the sports franchise. 2-5   In the case of a sports franchise and a player employed through his PSC, there is no issue as to whether the player is an employee or independent contractor. The issue is whether the player is an employee of the sports franchise or the PSC for employment tax purposes. An analysis of the evidence generally establishes that a sports franchise controls its players not only as to the result, but also as to the means and methods of accomplishing the result. Under the player contracts, players may not offer their services to any other sports franchise in the league. Additionally, the sports franchise normally pays for the players' expenses when the team is on the road. Generally, a sports franchise will be determined to be the employer of its players. Accordingly, the sports franchise is usually responsible for FICA and FUTA taxes on the compensation paid for player services even if they are paid to a PSC. See Leavell v. Commissioner, 104 T.C. 140 (1995). COMPLIANCE STRATEGIES If you believe there may be a lack of compliance in your area for one or more of the issues covered in this ATG, you may want to recommend a district compliance initiative. In determining the appropriate compliance initiative strategy, consideration should also be given to taxpayer education, guidance, and assistance.  2-6   Exhibit 2-1 (1 of 3) Form 4564 Rev. 6/88 Department of the Treasury Internal Revenue Service INFORMATION DOCUMENT REQ UEST Request Number  TO: Name of Taxpayer and Co.

Most sports franchises solicit local sponsors that want to be associated with the sport franchise's team name. Most notably, a sports franchise may have an official team bank, an official team television station, an official team radio station, an official team healthcare provider, etc. Sponsors pay significant sums of money to enter into these contracts, which usually cover multiple years. Unlike other categories of revenue, local area sponsorship revenue is generally not shared with other sports franchises in the league. The sponsorship agreements entered into, for the most part, represent advertising contracts. The sponsors receive specified advertising spots in radio broadcasts, television broadcasts, and team print media. Additionally, the sponsors usually receive stadium signage. The sports franchise usually receives significant advance payments from the various sponsors upon signing the contract, with periodic payments to be made during the remainder of the contract term. Often the sports franchise's tax return will reflect less than the total amount received during the initial year as current income. The remaining amount received will usually be reflected as deferred revenue. Depending on the length of the contract and the nature of the advance payment, some portion may be designated as long-term deferred revenue. Instead of including advance payments on multiple year sponsorship contracts in gross income during the tax year received, sports franchises often report advance payments prorata over the term of the contracts. Some contracts designate a portion of the advance payment as ""exclusivity."" This term indicates the vendor is the exclusive sponsor in a particular business segment (such as banking, television, radio, healthcare, etc.). The payment made for exclusivity is usually reported by sports franchises as income over the life of the contract, with the currently recognized portion representing only the current year's prorata share. AUDIT ISSUE It should be determined whether the sports franchise has improperly deferred the reporting of sponsorship revenue. More specifically, whether the sports franchise is unable to rely on the income deferral provisions of Rev. Proc. 71-21, 1971-2 C.B. 549, because:  3-1   1.  The sponsorship agreement provides for the provision of services after the end of the sports franchise's tax year following the tax year in which the advance payments are received, and for sponsorship agreements conferring exclusivity rights. The advance payment is for property rights, rather than the provision of services by the sports franchise.  2.  TAX LAW Prepaid Income Under IRC section 451(a), ""General Rule. The amount of gross income shall be included in the gross income for the taxable year in which received by the taxpayer, unless, under the method of accounting used in computing taxable income, such amount is to be properly accounted for as from a different period."" Treas. Reg. section 1.4511(a) provides ""***Under an accrual method of accounting, income is includible in gross income when all the events have occurred which fix the right to receive such income and the amount thereof can be determined with reasonable accuracy.***"" A fixed right to receive income occurs when: (a) the taxpayer's required performance takes place; (b) payment is due; or (c) payment is received, whichever occurs first. Schlude v. Commissioner, 372 U.S. 128 (1963), and Rev. Rul. 79-195, 1979-1 C.B. 177. The history behind former IRC section 452 reflects Congressional intent to limit tax deferrals of prepaid income to just those narrow areas specifically provided by Congress (such as IRC sections 455 and 456). Former IRC section 452 permitted the deferral of prepaid income. The purpose of IRC section 452 was to bring tax accounting more in line with accepted business accounting for prepaid income. When IRC sections 452 and 462 (which allowed deductions for reserves for estimated expenses) were enacted with the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, the estimated revenue loss was $45 million. A year later, after the American Institute of Accountants estimated the tax revenue loss resulting from these provisions to be around $500 million, Congress retroactively repealed IRC sections 452 and 462. Revenue Procedure 71-21 Rev. Proc. 71-21 was published ""to implement an administrative decision, made by the Commissioner in the exercise of his discretion under section 446, to allow accrual method taxpayers in certain specified and limited circumstances to defer the inclusion in gross income for Federal income tax purposes of payments received (or amounts due and payable) in one taxable year for services to be performed by the end of the next succeeding taxable year."" [underlining added]  3-2   Per section 2 of Rev. Proc. 71-21: In general, tax accounting requires that payments received for services to be performed in the future must be included in gross income in the taxable year of receipt. *** The purpose of this Revenue Procedure is to reconcile the tax and financial accounting treatment of such payments in a large proportion of these cases without permitting extended deferral in the time of including such payments in gross income for Federal income tax purposes. Section 3.02 of Rev. Proc. 71-21 provides: An accrual method taxpayer who, pursuant to an agreement (written or otherwise), receives a payment in one taxable year for services, where all of the services under such agreement are required by the agreement as it exists at the end of the taxable year of receipt to be performed by him before the end of the next succeeding taxable year, may include such payments in gross income as earned through the performance of the services, subject to the limitations provided in sections 3.07, 3.08, and 3.11. However, if the inclusion in gross income of payments received is properly deferred under the preceding sentence and for any reason a portion of such services is not performed by the end of the next succeeding taxable year, the amount allocable to the services not performed must be included in gross income in such succeeding year, regardless of when (if ever) such services are performed. [underlining added] Section 3.03 provides: Except as provided in sections 3.04 and 3.05, a payment received by an accrual method taxpayer pursuant to an agreement for the performance by him of services must be included in his gross income in the taxable year of receipt if under the terms of the agreement as it exists at the end of such year: (a) Any portion of the services is to be performed by him after the end of the taxable year immediately succeeding the year of receipt; or (b) Any portion of the services is to be performed by him at an unspecified future date which may be after the end of the taxable year immediately succeeding the year of receipt. [underlining added] The Tax Court in T.F.H. Publications, Inc. v. Commissioner, 72 T.C. 623 (1979), determined that ""advertising is considered a service."" Thus, amounts received in advance for advertising are considered payments for future services to which Rev. Proc. 71-21 may apply. Advance payments under -- the right to publicize t of the advance payments section in Chapter 4 addr television contracts are not services, but are considered a property right he taxpayer's games. Accordingly, a taxpayer cannot defer the reporting received for television contracts under Rev. Proc. 71-21. The tax law esses the case law supporting this conclusion.  3-3   TAX LAW APPLICATION Advance payments received on most of a sports franchise's multiple year sponsorship contracts are unlikely to qualify for income deferral under the provisions of Rev. Proc. 71-21. As addressed above, per Rev. Proc. 71-21 sections 3.02 and 3.03, advance payment for services is deferred under Rev. Proc. 71-21 only if the services are to be provided by the close of the next taxable year. Accordingly, Rev. Proc. 71-21 only results in sponsorship income deferral if, under the specific sponsorship contract, the services are to be provided by the close of the sports franchise's tax year following the tax year during which the advance payment is received. This results in most advance payments for multiple year sponsorship contracts being ineligible for deferral under the provisions of Rev. Proc. 71-21. For advance payments that are not excluded from Rev. Proc. 71-21 deferral due to the requirement that the service be provided by the end of the tax year, following the tax year of receipt, only advance payments for services versus advance payments for property rights qualify for Rev. Proc. 71-21 deferral. In this guide, ""exclusivity rights"" are defined as a sponsor's payments to a sports franchise to promote the sponsor's association with the sports franchise as the exclusive sponsor for the specific market segment or industry (banking, television, radio, health provider, etc.). For advance payment issues on exclusivity rights, the primary argument is that Rev. Proc. 71-21 does not apply because it is an advance payment for property rights versus an advance payment for services, and then, if applicable, an alternative argument that Rev. Proc. 71-21 does not apply because the services are not provided by the end of the subsequent tax year. The distinction between property rights and services is further addressed in Chapter 4. When the examiner determines a sports franchise is unable to rely on Rev. Proc. 71-21 for income deferral, it is not uncommon for the sports franchise to argue that its sponsorship income is deferred based on the application of general case law on prepaid services. The case law on the taxation of fixed and definite prepaid services is addressed in Chapter 5. EXAMPLE XYZ, a professional sports franchise, entered into a sponsorship agreement with a local bank to be the official bank of the sport franchise. The contract provided the bank with a specified amount of advertising time during television broadcasts, radio broadcasts, as well as in the team magazine. Additionally, the sports franchise agreed to do all of its banking with the sponsor and would encourage its employees to do the same. The bank had the right to advertise itself as the official bank of the sports franchise. The contract is for 5 years beginning on January 1, 1994, for a total contract price of $6 million. The bank paid $4.2 million on execution of the contract, which represented a $3.75 3-4   million exclusivity rights fee and $450,000 for the first year's advertising. On each anniversary date, the bank is to pay $450,000 until the end of the contract. On its 1994 calendar year tax return, XYZ included in gross income $1.2 million on the bank sponsorship contract. This included $450,000 for the first year's advertising and $750,000 for the first year's pro rata share of the exclusivity rights fee (which is $3.75 million divided by 5 years equaling $750,000). XYZ's balance sheet on December 31, 1994, reflected $3 million of deferred revenue (the $3.75 million total exclusivity rights fee less the $750,000 amount reported in 1994). $750,000 of the $3 million was designated as a current liability, and $2.25 million was designated as long term liability. On its 1995 and 1996 calendar year tax returns, XYZ reported $450,000 for the advertising fee paid in January and $750,000 for the pro rata share of the exclusivity rights fee which had been pre-paid. At year end, XYZ's 1995 balance sheet reflected total deferred revenue of $2.25 million, and XYZ's 1996 balance sheet reflected total deferred revenue of $1.5 million. The sports franchise's tax reporting of the local bank sponsorship contract is summarized as follows: Tax Year 1994 1995 1996 Advertising Fee Reported $450,000 $450,000 $450,000 Pro Rata Exclusivity Fee Reported $750,000 $750,000 $750,000 Exclusivity Fee Account Balance $3,000,000 $2,250,000 $1,500,000  During an examination of the sports franchise's 1994-1996 tax returns, the examiner determined the exclusivity rights fee advance payment was an advance payment for property rights. The examiner's primary argument is Rev. Proc. 71-21 does not apply because it is an advance payment for property rights versus an advance payment for services, and, alternatively, that Rev. Proc. 71-21 does not apply because the services are not provided by the end of the tax year following the tax year in which the advance payment was received. The alternative argument applies, because under the agreement existing at the end of the tax year in which the advance payment was received (the January 1, 1994 contract constituted the terms of the agreement at December 31, 1994), the sports franchise's services (assuming not property rights) are to be provided after December 31, 1995 (the end of the year following the tax year in which the advance pavement is received). 3-5   The examiner's report adjustments are reflected as follows: 1994 IRC section 446 Adjustment Total Adjustment $3,000,000 $3,000,000 1995 ($750,000) ($750,000) 1996 ($750,000) ($750,000)  The 1994 IRC section 446 adjustment includes in income the revenue improperly deferred to future years in the amount of $3 million. The 1995 and 1996 IRC section 446 adjustments eliminate the $750,000 of income improperly deferred from 1994 that was erroneously reported in each of these years. Because the examiner's case was closed unagreed, the examiner prepared a Form 5346, Examination Information Report, for the sports franchise's subsequent tax years which were not yet filed or due to be filed when the examiner closed his case. EXAMINATION TECHNIQUES Documents and information that should be obtained in determining whether you have one or more deferred sponsorship revenue issues include: 1. All agreements, contracts, and other documents regarding corporate sponsors, such as official team bank, official team health care provider, etc., that remain in effect during the tax year under examination. This includes all concession agreements. A breakdown of current versus deferred revenue (both current and long-term deferred revenue) by contract.  2.  The breakdown of current versus deferred revenue should be tied to the income recognized during the current year, as well as the deferred revenue accounts on the return's balance sheet. The sponsorship contracts provide specific information on what the sports franchise is providing (advertising, game tickets, etc.), as well as the specific payment, length, renewal, and other contract terms. Additionally, the contracts sometimes call for other up-front fees and should define what the fees cover. Since a tax distinction is made for advance payments for services and advance payments for property rights, the nature of the advance payments in question needs to be determined. In the context of sports franchises, what is often referred to in contracts as exclusivity rights may, in fact, be property rights. The precise nature of the payments as advertising or exclusivity rights can be determined by 3-6   reference to the contracts themselves. Exclusivity rights contracts expressly provide for the sale of the rights to use team logos and name on letterhead, etc., to promote the association with the team. In some instances, the contracts refer to the transaction as a license. In such a circumstance, the contracts may not be in exchange for services, but in exchange for the taxpayer's property interest in the publicity of its enterprise. Proper application of the law for exclusivity rights would appear to require the examiner to first determine if the advance payment qualifies for Rev. Proc. 71-21 deferral (whether it is an advance payment for services or an advance payment for property rights) and then, only for advance payments for services, determine if the provisions of Rev. Proc. 71-21 are met. However, because the determination of the nature of the payment (services versus property rights) may be less clear and more time consuming than determining the timing of the services, the examiner may want to first determine if the subsequent year rule is met before addressing the nature of the advance payments. Because the sponsorship issue involves the timing of income, it constitutes a change in the sports franchise's method of accounting for sponsorship revenue. Accordingly, examiners need to follow the change in method of accounting issue procedures in raising sponsorship issues. The IRC section 481(a) adjustment amount is the deferred income balance at the beginning of the first tax year examined. The current year IRC section 446 adjustments are the yearly changes to the deferred income balances for each tax year beginning with the first year examined. This is illustrated in the issue example given earlier in this chapter.  3-7   This page intentionally left blank.   Chapter 4 BROADCAST REVENUE  INDUSTRY PRACTICE Broadcast revenue is one of the single largest revenue generators for a sports franchise. Generally, national broadcasting contracts are consummated at the league level, with each sports franchise receiving a pro rata share. Additionally, sports franchises usually negotiate and enter into local broadcasting agreements on an individual basis. The income generated by local broadcasting agreements is usually not shared with the other sports franchises in the league. National Broadcasting Contracts The leagues normally enter into multiple year contracts with various television networks for the sale of broadcasting rights to the games played among its sports franchises. The money received under these contracts is normally divided equally among each sports franchise in the league. Payments under the league contracts are generally made networks pay a fixed amount for the broadcasting rights contract. The payments for each season may be made in on the sports franchise's tax year period, one or more of year immediately preceding the year in which the season Local Broadcasting Contracts Individual sports teams usually enter into broadcasting agreements with both local television and radio stations for the sale of broadcasting rights to the games played at the home stadium. Similar to the national contracts, the local agreements are usually for multiple years. Additionally, the agreements may include other special programs; for example, a coach's show, pre-game show, post-game show, etc. The local agreements may also include team sponsorship; for example, an official team station. Generally, these contracts require a substantial payment upon contract execution, as well as periodic payments (normally annual) through the contract term. Again, depending on the tax year period, a sports franchise may receive a periodic payment in a tax year preceding the year to which the payment relates. AUDIT ISSUE It is important to determine whether the sports franchise has improperly deferred the reporting of broadcast revenue. More specifically, whether the sports franchise is unable to rely on the income 4-1 on a per-season basis; that is, the for each season covered under the installments, often quarterly. Depending the installments may be received in a tax takes place.   deferral provisions of Rev. Proc. 71-21 because the advance payment is for property rights, rather than for services provided by the sports franchise. TAX LAW Whether broadcast revenue is received for services or property rights is addressed in this chapter. The general prepaid income tax law and Rev. Proc. 71-21, 1971-2 C.B. 549, are addressed in Chapter 3. The case law on the taxation of fixed and definite prepaid services is addressed in Chapter 5. Services or Property Right? In Pittsburgh Athletic Co. v. KQV Broadcasting Co., addressed the issue of a baseball team's interest in the Employees of a radio station were standing on a hill o play-by-play description of the games. In granting an games, the court held: 24 F.Supp. 490 (W.D. Pa. 1938), the court broadcasting rights to its games. verlooking the stadium and broadcasting a injunction against the broadcast of the  It is perfectly clear that the exclusive right to broadcast play-by-play descriptions of the home games played by the 'Pirates' at their home field rests in the plaintiffs. *** That is a property right of the plaintiffs with which defendant is interfering when it broadcasts the play-by-play description of the ball games. *** The Pittsburgh Athletic Company by reason of its creation of the game, its control of the park, and its restriction of the dissemination of news therefrom, has a property right in such news. In Uhlaender v. Henrickson, 316 F.Supp. 1277 (D. Minn. 1970), the defendants marketed a baseball table game. The game employed the names, numbers, and statistics of the players in major league baseball. The players sued to enjoin the use of their names and statistics for profit. The court held: It is this court's view that a celebrity has a legitimate interest in his public personality. A celebrity must be considered to have invested his years of practice and compensation in a public personality which eventually may reach marketable status. That identity, embodied in his name, likeness, statistics and other personal characteristics, is the fruit of his labors and is a type of property. In Zacchini v. Scripps-Howard Broadcasting Co., 433 U.S. 562 (1977), the Supreme Court considered the interrelationship between a performer's right to publicity of his performance and the First Amendment. A television station had aired as a news clip the entire performance of a ""human cannonball."" The performer sued for compensation for the use of his professional property. The Court agreed that the First Amendment did not prohibit such a suit and described the plaintiff's interest as follows:  4-2   *** the State's interest in permitting a `right of publicity' is in protecting the proprietary interest of the individual in his act in part to encourage such entertainment. As we later note, the State's interest is closely analogous to the goals of patent and copyright law. In Board of Regent of the University of Oklahoma v. National Collegiate Athletic Association, Civil No. 81-1209 (W.D. Okl. 1982), the court considered television contracts entered into by the NCAA for the broadcast of its member schools' football games. The plaintiffs, the Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma and the University of Georgia Athletic Association, claimed that the contracts violated the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. sections 1 and 2. In holding the contracts violated antitrust laws, the court held: The right to telecast college football games is the property of the institutions participating in the games, and that right may be sold or assigned by those institutions to any entity at their discretion. TAX LAW APPLICATION Regardless of whether the payments received by a sports franchise are from a national broadcasting contract or from a local broadcasting contract, the tax treatment is the same. In the case of a sports franchise, the right to receive the advance broadcast income is fixed for the tax year in which the amounts are received. Based on the court cases cited above, the payments received under television and radio broadcasting contracts are made not in exchange for services but in exchange for property rights (the sports franchise's proprietary rights in the publicity of its enterprise). The networks, local television stations, and local radio stations are not paying for services but rather for the right to exploit the sports franchise's property right. Accordingly, the Rev. Proc. 71-21 provisions that allow the deferral of income from services do not apply to the broadcast revenue of a sports franchise. EXAMPLE Sports franchise ABC receives a pro rata share of the league's national television broadcasting revenue. The contract entered into by the sports league and the national television broadcaster for the 1994 through 1997 seasons was entered into on April 15, 1993. The national broadcasting contract provides for quarterly payments of the annual amount, payable the first day of each quarter. The first payment was to be paid October 1, 1993, with the last payment due July 1, 1997. The sports franchise received $7.5 million on October 1, 1993 applicable to the 1994 season. The sports franchise did not include the $7.5 million in gross income on its 1993 tax return. Instead, the $7.5 million was reflected in the balance sheet as a current liability. A supporting statement characterized it as deferred revenue. 4-3   The sports franchise received $7.5 million on January 1, 1994, April 1, 1994, and July 1, 1994, applicable to the 1994 season. Additionally, ABC received $10 million on October 1, 1994, applicable to the 1995 season. On its 1994 tax return, ABC reported $30 million of broadcast revenue (the four $7.5 million payments received on October 1, 1993, January 1, 1994, April 1, 1994, and July 1, 1994). The $10 million received on October 1, 1994 was treated as deferred revenue. The sports franchise received $10 million on January 1, 1995, April 1, 1995, and July 1, 1995, applicable to the 1995 season. Additionally, ABC received $12 million on October 1, 1995, applicable to the 1996 season. On its 1995 tax return, ABC reported $40 million of broadcast revenue (the four $10 million payments received on October 1, 1994, January 1, 1995, April 1, 1995, and July 1, 1995). The $12 million received on October 1, 1995, was treated as deferred revenue. In summary, the sports franchise's tax return deferred broadcast revenue balances attributable to the league's national television broadcast contract as follows:  December 31, 1993 December 31, 1994 December 31, 1995  $ 7.5 million $10 million $12 million  During an examination of the sports franchise's 1994 calendar year tax return, the examiner determined sports franchise ABC was not entitled to defer the reporting of its broadcast revenue under Rev. Proc. 71-21. The examiner's report adjustments are as follows: 1994 IRC section 481(a) Adjustment IRC section 446 Adjustment Total Adjustment $7,500,000 $2,500,000 $10,000,000 1995 -- $2,000,000 $2,000,000  The IRC section 481(a) adjustment is the deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the year of change (1994) of $7.5 million. The 1994 IRC section 446 adjustment is the $2.5 million increase in the deferred liability account balance from $7.5 million at the beginning of 1994 to $10 million at the end of 1994. The 1995 IRC section 446 adjustment is the $2 million increase in the deferred liability balance from $10 million at the beginning of 1995 to $12 million at the end of 1995.

The current year IRC section 446 adjustments are the yearly changes to the deferred income balances for each tax year beginning with the first year examined. This is illustrated in the example given in this chapter.  4-5   This page intentionally left blank.   Chapter 5 SEASON TICKET REVENUE  INDUSTRY PRACTICE Categories of Seating A major revenue source for a sports franchise is its ticket receipts. There are normally three categories of seats: regular or general admission seats, club seats, and luxury or skybox suites. A regular seat ticket entitles a sports fan admittance to the stadium for a specific game or a specific season of games. Generally, this category of seat contains no added benefits and the cost of the ticket is normally determined by seat location. Regular seat tickets can be sold on a game-by-game basis, although the majority are sold on a season ticket basis. Regular season seat tickets can be sold for a single season or for multiple seasons. For the sports franchise, the sale of season tickets ensures a stream of income for a specified time frame, as well as fan turn-out which can impact ancillary income; for example, parking revenue, concession revenue, etc. Normally, club seat tickets cost more than regular seat tickets, and in some cases as much as double. This additional cost is primarily due to the club seat location in the stadium, offering patrons a better view of the action; however, the increased cost is also due to the added benefits usually afforded these patrons. Club seat tickets entitle the ticket holders to admittance to the game, usually through a separate entrance from the general public; moreover, usually these sports fans also have access to a club facility at which they may purchase concessions in climate controlled surroundings before, during, or after the game. Additionally, the club area may include a lounge area in which the sports fans may socialize before, during, or after the game. Closed circuit television coverage allowing the patrons continued coverage of the field action while away from their seats is not uncommon in these facilities. Club seat ticket holders are often offered the right to acquire parking privileges close to the stadium. In the skybox category, the patron, normally a corporation, purchases a box of seats rather than a single seat. The number of seats in each box can vary within a particular stadium, depending on the stadium design and configuration. Similarly, the number of skyboxes varies from stadium to stadium. Skyboxes are the most expensive category of seats. This is not only due to the number of seats acquired, but also due to the facility and benefits provided as part of the skybox package. 5-1   Usually, skyboxes are elaborate facilities, containing climate control, comfort seating, closed circuit television equipment, as well as kitchen and bar facilities. It is not uncommon for skybox patrons to also receive a preferred parking location either adjacent to the stadium or in close proximity. Club seat tickets and skyboxes are normally sold on a multiple season basis. This ensures the sports franchise a steady income stream for a specific number of years. Accounting for Season Tickets Accounting for revenue from the sale of regular single season ticket sales is straight forward. For both generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) purposes and for tax purposes, the revenue is recorded as the games are played. This is true even if the playing season begins in one tax year and ends in the next tax year. Usually, the sale of multiple year season tickets requires a commitment from the sports fan to purchase season tickets for a specified number of years. Regardless of the seat category, the sports franchise normally issues terms and conditions, outlining the rights and obligations of both the ticket holder and the sports franchise. The terms and conditions usually specify the number of years for which the sports fan is obligated to purchase tickets, the cost of tickets per season (including any potential price increases), consequences to the ticket holder in the event of default, and other miscellaneous provisions. Multiple year season ticket sales, regardless of seat category, often require a security deposit. The terms and conditions usually contain provisions regarding the security deposit, including cancellation, application, and refund provisions. AUDIT ISSUES 1. Whether the reporting of advance payments on multiple season ticket sales can be deferred, or instead can be included in gross income in the tax year received; and Whether amounts treated by the sports franchise as non-taxable security deposits are, instead, taxable advance payments.  2.  TAX LAW Fixed & Definite Services Generally, payments received in advance are income to both accrual and cash basis taxpayers in the year of receipt, provided there is no restriction on the use of such payments. This income recognition rule holds true even though the advance payments are returnable upon the happening of some specified event. For accrual basis taxpayers, deferral of prepayments for future services 5-2   is permitted, provided the services do not extend after the tax year following the year of receipt. Chapter 3 addresses the general year of income inclusion rules and Rev. Proc. 71-21, 1971-2 C.B. 549. While the general rule for tax purposes is that payments received for services to be performed in the future must be included in gross income in the taxable year of receipt, several courts have allowed deferral of prepaid income when the contract obligations to perform the services are fixed and determinable. Artnell Co. v. Commissioner, 400 F.2d 981 (7th Cir. 1968), Boise Cascade Corp. v. United States, 530 F.2d 1367 (Ct. Cl. 1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 867 (1976). In Artnell the court allowed the deferral of prepaid single season baseball tickets because unlike American Automobile Association v. United States, 367 U.S. 687 (1961), and Schlude v. Commissioner, 572 U.S. 128 (1963), the time and extent of future services was certain (except for rained out games, the baseball games were played on a fixed schedule). The court in Boise Cascade Corp. also allowed the deferral of prepaid engineering services until the year the services were performed because performance was required on fixed dates or as expeditiously as possible. These courts reasoned ""there were situations when deferral so clearly reflected income that it must be permitted."" In the action on decision on Boise Cascade Corp., dated February 19, 1986, the Service stated: We believe that the reasoning of the Court of Claims is incorrect. The so-called 'fixed and definite' or 'certainty of performance' test, which suggests that income deferral might be possible if certain standards are met for the matching of deferred income with future services and expenses, (see Artnell v. Commissioner, 400 F.2d 981 (7th Cir. 1968)) is premised on a misinterpretation of the Supreme Court's holdings in Schlude and A.A.A. In those cases, the Supreme Court cited as an 'additional ground' (Schlude, at 135) for disallowing income deferral the fact that the advance payments related to services which were to be performed without relation to fixed dates in the future. From this holding, it is argued that the Supreme Court 'left an opening' (Artnell at 984) allowing for deferral if the extent and time of future performance are 'certain'. However, there is no implication that the Supreme Court, in disallowing deferral of income in Schlude, A.A.A. and Michigan, intended expressly or impliedly to state a positive rule allowing for income deferral. To the contrary, advance payments for services to be rendered in future years and received without restriction as to use, are income in the year received by an accrual basis taxpayer. RCA Corp. v. United States, 664 F.2d 881 (2d Cir. 1981); Simplified Tax Records, Inc. v. Commissioner, 41 T.C. 75 (1963); Popular Library, Inc. v. Commissioner, 39 T.C. 1092 (1963). Moreover, the fixed-and-definite theory, which argues by implication from the 'additional ground' in Schlude and A.A.A., overlooks the primary ground upon which the Supreme Court relied in refusing income deferral: the 'long-standing' (at 134) principle that 'accounting systems Schlude deferring prepaid income could be rejected by the Commissioner' (Id.) pursuant to the broad discretion given him by I.R.C. section 5-3   446. With certain limited exceptions, Service position is that all the events that fix the right to receive income occur when (1) the required performance takes place, (2) payment is due, or (3) payment is made, whichever happens first. See: Rev. Rul. 80-308, 1980-2 C.B. 162; Rev. Rul. 79-292, 1979-2 C.B. 287; Rev. Rul. 79-195, 1979-1 C.B. 177. The Service disagreed with both the Artnell and Boise Cascade decisions, and in response to the Artnell decision published Rev. Proc. 7121. In the Action on Decision on Artnell, dated July 27, 1971, Chief Counsel stated ""the Service will not follow Artnell to the extent the rules for deferral could be deemed to be broader than those contained in Rev. Proc. 71-21."" Advance Payment Versus Deposit A distinction between a deposit in the nature of a loan and an advance payment turns on the nature of the rights and obligations that are assumed when the deposit is made. The leading case addressing the taxability of customer deposits is the Supreme Court's opinion in Commissioner v. Indianapolis Power & Light Co., 493 U.S. 203 (1990). In this case, the Supreme Court applied what has become known as the ""complete dominion test"" to determine whether customer deposits should be included in taxable income when received. In Indianapolis Power & Light, customers with poor credit (about 5 percent of all customers) had to make deposits to a utility to ensure prompt payment of future electric bills. The deposits were collected pursuant to terms established by a public utilities regulatory authority. The deposits would accrue interest if held for more than 12 months. The utility would refund the deposits upon termination of service or earlier if the customer demonstrated acceptable credit (by making timely payments for a certain period). The customer could receive a cash refund or could elect to apply the deposit as payment of his electric bill. The utility did not segregate the deposits, and the deposits were subject to its use and control. One of the major factors considered by the Supreme Court was the fact that the customers in this case could cancel at any time. The Court stated: Here in contrast, a customer submitting a deposit made no commitment to purchase a specified quantity of electricity, or indeed to purchase any electricity at all. [Footnote 6] IPL's right to keep the money depends upon the customer's purchase of electricity, and upon his later decision to have the deposit applied to future bills, not merely upon the utility's adherence to its contractual duties.  5-4   The Supreme Court stated in Footnote 6: A customer, for example, might terminate service the day after making the deposit. Also, IPL's dominion over a deposit remains incomplete even after the customer begins buying electricity. As has been noted, the deposit typically is set at twice the customer's estimated monthly bill. So long as the customer pays his bills in a timely fashion, the money he owes the utility (for electricity used but not yet paid for) almost always will be less than the amount of the deposit. If this were not the case, the deposit would provide inadequate protection. Thus, through the period the deposit is held, at least a portion is likely to be money that IPL has no real assurance of ever retaining. The Supreme Court held that control over the deposits, unrestricted use of the funds, and nonpayment of interest were not controlling factors in determining whether a taxpayer exercised complete dominion over deposits received or is obligated to repay the deposits. The controlling factor was that, at the time deposits were made, the utility had no guarantee that it would be allowed to retain them. The utility acquired the deposits subject to an express obligation to repay at some future date (at the time of termination of service or earlier, if the customer established good credit). The Supreme Court noted: The individual who makes an advance payment retains no right to insist upon the return of the funds. On the other hand, a customer submitting a deposit retains the right to insist upon repayment in cash, even though he may choose to apply the deposit to purchase goods. *** An advance payment, like the deposits at issue here, concededly protects the seller against the risk that it would be able to collect money owed it after it has furnished goods or services. But an advance payment does much more; it protects against the risk that the purchaser will back out of the deal before the seller performs. *** Here, in contrast, a customer submitting a deposit made no commitment. In section 3.03 of Rev. Proc. 91-31, 1991-1 C.B. 566, the Service stated: Change in treatment of deposits. If a utility company consistently includes customer deposits in gross income in the year of receipt and those deposits are not taxed upon receipt under the decision in Indianapolis Power, a change in the treatment of those deposits is a change in method of accounting.  5-5   TAX LAW APPLICATION Except perhaps for multiple season ticket contracts covering just two regular seasons, most multiple season contracts will not meet the requirement under Rev. Proc. 71-21 that the services be provided by the end of the tax year following the year of receipt. This Rev. Proc. 71-21 requirement is addressed in Chapter 3. There are significant differences between Indianapolis Power & Light and a professional sports franchise. First, the deposits in Indianapolis Power & Light were typically set at twice the estimated monthly bill. Advance payments/deposits required by sports franchises normally are exactly equal to the cost of one year's season ticket. Second, the customers in Indianapolis Power & Light were not obligated to purchase any electricity and could terminate the service at any time, requiring an immediate refund (either in cash or in credit). Multiple year season ticket holders, on the other hand, are usually obligated to purchase tickets for a specified number of years, which may range from 3 to 10 years, depending on the sports franchise and the seat category. The customers in Indianapolis Power & Light were assured of a complete refund upon termination. Thus, the customers controlled both the timing and the method of their refunds. In contrast, multiple year season ticket contracts often do not contain a cancellation provision whereby the ticket holder will receive an unconditional refund. Sports franchise multiple year season ticket contracts that do provide for ""early"" refunds often contain restrictions on the timing of the refund or the amount of the refund. For example, the contract may specify a refund will only be made if the ticket is resold and that the refund will be reduced by a reselling charge or cancellation charge. As a regulated utility, the taxpayer in Indianapolis Power & Light was required by the State to treat the amounts in question as deposits. Additionally, unclaimed deposits were required to be transferred to the State. While sports franchises are members of their respective leagues, they are not regulated entities. Thus, there are no industry regulations governing the accounting of a sports franchise's season ticket advance payments/deposits. Moreover, any unclaimed advance payments/deposits remain with the sports franchise. Another factor is the rights the sports franchise possesses with respect to the advance payments/deposits and the season ticket contracts. In a number of sports franchise cases, the sports franchise pledged the advance payments/deposits and season ticket contracts as security for third party financing. As stated earlier, control over the deposits and unrestricted use of funds are not the controlling factors in determining whether a taxpayer has complete dominion over the deposits and is obligated to repay deposits. Substance versus form is controlling for tax purposes. The Supreme Court noted in Indianapolis Power & Light: 5-6   When the Commissioner examines privately structured transactions, the true understanding of the parties, of course, may not be apparent. It may be that a transfer of funds, though nominally a loan, may conceal an unstated agreement that the money is to be applied to the purchase of goods or services. Generally, a sports franchise advance payment/deposit issue is not going to be a black and white issue. Each sports franchise's potential advance payment/deposit issue must be evaluated based on the sports franchise's unique facts and circumstances. EXAMINATION TECHNIQUES Documents and information that should be obtained in developing a sports franchise advance payment/deposit issue include: 1. The season ticket application packages. This may consist of the actual application submitted by a prospective season ticket holder, along with any attachments such as seating selections, payment options, etc. If different applications are used for different categories of seats, each type should be secured. The applications should provide basic information such as application fee required, cost of ticket (per season), location of seating, etc. Sample copy of season ticket agreements (original, as well as any later amendments, or terms in any form) for each category of seat, including club seats. In some cases, the terms and conditions are significantly different for regular season tickets, club seats, and skyboxes. A breakdown of the total number of seats in each seat category. A listing of season ticket holders, including name, purchase date of ticket, total purchase price, date and amount of the advance payment/deposit, subsequent payments (if any), and remaining amount due. The payment plan agreement for each category of seat, which outlines the various payment options available to the season ticket holders. Sometimes sports franchises will offer the ticket holder the option to pay annually or pay monthly. The various payment plan agreements will specify the amount of each periodic payment, how many payments are due, when the payments are due, etc. Sample cover letter to ticket holders transmitting coupon books for those who opted to pay by monthly check, and if available, a sample coupon book. Similarly, a sample confirmation letter or signature authorization, if any, sent to those who opted for an automatic monthly withdrawal to pay for their tickets. A copy of the sports franchise's policy regarding liquidating damages, cancellation fees, resale fees, etc., when the multiple year season ticket agreements were entered into. If the sports franchise has a written policy, retain a copy for the case file workpapers. If the agreements or policies have changed over time, secure a copy of all agreement and policy 5-7  2.  3.  4.  5.  6.   changes through the date the examination is closed. Some policy changes may apply retroactively. 7. Listing of ticket holders who requested refunds of their deposits. The list should reflect the date the refund was requested, the date the refund was made, as well as the amount of the refund. Sample packages of cancellation requests for each seat category. This would include the request from the ticket holder, the response from the team, any default letters sent, etc. Sample renewal letters sent to ticket holders whose contracts were due to expire. Examiners need to analyze these letters to determine the disposition of any advance payment/deposit which may have been paid up front by the ticket holder.  8.  9.  10. Media packages for the marketing of skyboxes. These often have separate marketing campaigns which are targeted to the larger local businesses. The contracts utilized for multiple season tickets, regardless of seat category, should be carefully analyzed. Additionally, it may be helpful to use a look-back approach. Securing refund packages may give some insight as to any unstated agreements. These packages may consist of refund requests from the ticket holder and response letters from the sports franchise, as well as the final letter transmitting or denying the refund. Depending on the length of time the sports franchise has been in existence, it may be helpful to trace the disposition of advance payments/deposits for those ticket holders who do not renew their seats. The invoice and correspondence sent for the final season should be inspected to ascertain if the sports franchise automatically applies the advance payment/deposit against the final season's ticket price. In developing a potential advance payment versus deposit issue, the examiner needs to look beyond the form of the sports franchise's privately structured contracts and agreements, and to focus on the substance of the rights and obligations of parties under the season ticket agreements. This includes consideration of unstated agreements and understandings among the parties. Substance versus form is controlling for tax purposes. Because the multiple year season ticket revenue issues addressed in this chapter involve the timing of the sports franchise's reporting of season ticket revenue, they constitute a change in the sports franchise's method of accounting for multiple year season contract revenue. Accordingly, examiners need to follow the change in method of accounting issue procedures in raising season ticket revenue issues.  5-8   POTENTIAL EMERGING ISSUE Some districts have raised the question of whether advance payments on season contracts are advance payments for property rights versus advance payments for services. Rev. Proc. 71-21 only applies to advance payments for services. Chapter 4 addresses the case law in this area and a similar issue for broadcasting rights. Chapter 3 addresses a similar issue for sponsorship agreements that convey exclusivity rights to the sponsor. This issue is currently under review by the Sports Franchise ISP Team and should be discussed with the ISP before proposing an adjustment to the taxpayer.  5-9   This page intentionally left blank.   Chapter 6 RELOCATION INCENTIVES  INDUSTRY PRACTICE The number of major league sports franchises has increased over the last several years. For example, in 1991 there were 102 professional teams in the National Football League (NFL), National Basketball Association (NBA), National Hockey League (NHL), and Major League Baseball (MLB). In 1995 there were a total of 111 teams in these four major sports leagues. In addition, there has been a significant number of sports franchise teams relocating from one city to another. Cities and states may offer significant incentives to lure a sports franchise's team to a certain area, whether through expansion or through relocation. One incentive offered may be in the form of lease inducements for the use of a municipal stadium or arena. As with other commercial real estate leases, inducements to sports franchises may be in the form of cash advances, loans, and free or substantially reduced rental rates. City and state relocation incentives structured in the form of a cash advance or loan transaction may be income to the sports franchise. AUDIT ISSUE It is necessary to determine whether sports franchise relocation incentives structured in the form of a cash advance or a loan are income to the sports franchise in the tax year received. TAX LAW Under IRC section 61, gross income includes all income from whatever source derived. Gross income includes ""accessions to wealth, clearly realized and over which the taxpayer has complete dominion."" Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass Co., 348 U.S. 426 (1955). Generally, loan proceeds do not constitute income to the borrower because the benefit is offset by the obligation to repay. United States v. Rochelle, 384 F.2d 748 (5th Cir. 1967); Arlen v. Commissioner, 48 T.C. 640 (1967); Vaughan v. Commissioner, 67 CCH Tax Ct. Mem. 1936 (1994). Whether a specific transaction actually constitutes a loan, however, must be determined based on all the facts and circumstances. Fisher v. Commissioner, 54 T.C. 905 (1970). In Milenbach v. Commissioner, 106 T.C. 184 (1996), the Tax Court held that municipal funds received by a football sports franchise, repayable only from specific sources of revenue, were not loans and had to be included in gross income, because the obligation to repay the funds was not unconditional.  6-1   The Tax Court in Milenbach found that the Raiders sports franchise announced in 1980 that it was moving from Oakland to Los Angeles. Under the terms of the agreement with the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission (LAMCC), the LAMCC loaned the sports franchise $6.7 million under a promissory note to be repaid with 12 percent of the net receipts from operations of suites, or skyboxes, to be constructed by the sports franchise at the Los Angeles Coliseum. The agreement further provided that construction of the suites would begin as soon as practical as determined by the sports franchise. The sports franchise was to begin repayment of the loan 3 years after the completion of construction of the suites. The loan was non-recourse against the sports franchise, secured solely by the improvements to be made. The $6.7 million loan was funded with a $4 million advance in 1984, and by credits against rent due from the sports franchise during the years 1982 through 1986 in the total amount of $2.7 million. The construction of the suites began in early 1987, but was halted shortly thereafter. Construction was stopped due to a dispute between the sports franchise and the LAMCC to perform certain improvements to the Los Angeles Coliseum. The sports franchise made no payments on the LAMCC loan and did not complete construction of the suites. The sports franchise relied on Commissioner v. Indianapolis Power & Light Co., 493 U.S. 203 (1990), to support its argument that the $6.7 million represented a valid debt not includible in its taxable income. The Tax Court in Milenbach determined ""The Supreme Court's reasoning does not support petitioner's position. *** The Raiders, unlike the power company, were not subject to an express obligation to repay within the lender's control."" The Tax Court concluded: The Raiders had the discretion to determine if and when the suites would be constructed, *** Although both documents limited the Raiders discretion by a standard of reasonableness, the agreements gave the Raiders great latitude in the timing of construction. *** Repayment of the $6.7 million was to commence 3 years after the construction of the suites, and repayment was to be solely from the net revenues from suite operations. If the Raiders did not construct the suites, which was the case, there would be no suite revenues to use for repayment. No default or alternative payment provision was included in the 1982 MOA [memorandum of understanding], the 1984 lease, or the promissory note. The nonrecourse promissory note was secured only by the improvements, i.e., the suites. When the Raiders did not construct the suites, the LAMCC was without a source for repayment. The Tax Court determined an unconditional, enforceable debt did not exist for tax purposes due to the contingent nature of the sports franchise's obligation. The court sustained the government's determination that the sports franchise had income in the years 1982 through 1986 equal to the 6-2   amount of rental credits, and in 1984 the sports franchise had income from the additional $4 million cash advance.  TAX LAW APPLICATION Relocation incentives which appear to be structured in the form of a cash advance or loan transaction may be income to the sports franchise. In the case of a cash advance or loan, the tax treatment will depend largely upon the terms under which the money is advanced. If the terms of the cash advance or loan do not establish an unconditional obligation to repay, the cash advance or loan may constitute taxable income to the sports franchise in the tax year received. EXAMINATION TECHNIQUES Examiners should consider the transactions that the sports franchise may have with state or local government. Contracts, agreements, and related documents should be carefully inspected for relocation incentives that constitute income to the sports franchise. The substance of relocation provisions should be considered to determine if they conform with the form of amounts characterized as cash advances or loans.  6-3   This page intentionally left blank.   Chapter 7 STRIKE FUND PAYMENTS  INDUSTRY PRACTICE A sports league owners' association may maintain a strike fund to loan funds to the league's sports franchises, as needed, during player strikes. At least one major sports league (National Football League) is known to have a strike fund. This chapter addresses the taxation of strike fund payments made by a sports franchise to the sports league owners' association. A sports league owners' association may establish a strike fund to provide a source of funds during player strikes. Typically, the strike fund is funded by pro rata assessments to the sports franchises in the league. The league's rules and the strike fund provisions usually determine the circumstances and categories of expenditures for which disbursements may be made from the strike fund. These provisions, however, are likely to be subject to suspension or modification by a vote of a specified number of league owners. AUDIT ISSUE The issue to be determined is whether strike fund payments made by a sports franchise to the league association are deductible in the tax year in which they are paid or incurred, or whether they are instead nondeductible capital expenditures. TAX LAW Under IRC section 162, ordinary and necessary expenses incurred in carrying on a trade or business are deductible in the tax year paid or incurred. IRC section 263(a) provides for the capitalization of capital expenditures. Treas. Reg. section 1.263(a)-2(a) requires the capitalization of costs having a useful life, extending beyond the close of the tax year in which the expenditure is paid or incurred. An expenditure that is otherwise an ordinary and necessary expense under IRC section 162 must be capitalized if it constitutes a capital expenditure under IRC section 263. The determination must be made of whether an expenditure is currently deductible or a capital expenditure is fact specific, and no one factor can control this determination. National Starch & Chemical Corp. v. Commissioner, 918 F.2d 426 (3d Cir. 1990). There is no readily available formula for determining in every context whether a particular expenditure is currently deductible or a capital expenditure. In Welch v. Helvering, 290 U.S. 111 (1933), the Supreme Court observed, ""the decisive distinctions are those of degree and not of kind."" Courts, however, have employed a variety of standards in making this determination.  7-1   Capital expenditures are expenditures that result in a benefit to the taxpayer which could be expected to produce returns for many years in the future. E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. v. United States, 432 F.2d 1052 (3d Cir. 1970). Capital expenditures are expenditures with the purpose of betterment for the indefinite future or, for a time, somewhat longer than the current taxable year, in contrast to being devoted to the income production or other needs of the more immediate present. General Bancshares Corp. v. Commissioner, 326 F.2d 712 (8th Cir. 1964), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 832 (1964). See also, Commissioner v. Idaho Power Co., 418 U.S. 1 (1974), Indopco Inc. v. Commissioner, 503 U.S. 79 (1992), and National Starch & Chemical. Notwithstanding the fact that there is no bright line test for determining, in all cases, whether an expenditure is currently deductible or a capital expenditure, the expenditures that create or enhance a capital asset are generally required to be capitalized. See Commissioner v. Idaho Power Co., 418 U.S. 1 (1974), and the cases cited therein. In Commissioner v. Lincoln Savings & Loan Ass'n, 403 U.S. 345 (1971), the savings and loan association was required to pay premiums to a secondary reserve maintained by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC). Each insured association had a pro rata shared interest in the secondary reserve. Each association received an annual credit from the FSLIC for the earnings on its share of the secondary reserve. An association's share in the reserve was transferable for FSLIC approved situations of merger, consolidation, transfer of bulk assets, and similar transactions. An insured association could obtain a cash refund of its pro rata share if its status as an insured was terminated. Based on these factors, the Supreme Court found that each insured association had a distinct and separate property interest in the secondary reserve, even though there was a possibility that the secondary reserve might be consumed by FSLIC's losses and never refunded to the association. The Supreme Court concluded the association's premium payments to the secondary reserve constituted capital expenditures. In contrast, in Rev. Rul. 82-15, 1982-1 C.B. 29, the taxpayer was required to pay its trade association increased dues earmarked for a loan fund to be used by any member of the association which was experiencing a strike and needed a loan to continue in business, and to continue to participate in collective bargaining with the labor union. There was no relationship between eligibility for, or the size of the loans and the dues payment uniformly required of members. The loans would be made only to the trade association's members during strikes, and then only under circumstances establishing that a member would not be able to continue in business and to bargain in good faith without a loan. Loan applications would be evaluated by using criteria similar to those used by lending institutions. Default on repayment would result in the initiation of collection procedures and suspension of the borrower's membership in the association. If the fund was terminated, any remaining amounts would be used to further the trade association's exempt purposes.  7-2   The ruling held the increased dues did not result in the acquisition by the taxpayer of a permanent interest in property. The taxpayer's additional payments entitled the taxpayer only to the benefits of continued membership in the association, which included the use of the loan fund. Accordingly, the Service concluded the increased dues were current period expenses, not capital expenditures. TAX LAW APPLICATION If a sports franchise is determined to have a separate and distinct property interest in a sports league's strike fund, then the strike fund payments may constitute a capital expenditure in the tax year paid or incurred; however, as addressed above, consideration of whether strike fund payments are currently deductible or capital expenditures is not limited to whether the sports franchise may have some continuing property interest in the strike fund. All relevant facts and circumstances need to be developed and considered. In addition, whether a sports franchise has separate and distinct property interest in the strike fund is a factual and legal question requiring detailed analysis. Relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether a sports franchise has a separate and distinct property interest in a league's strike fund include, but are not limited, to the following questions: 1. Are strike fund payments required payments of each sports franchise in the league or optional? If strike fund payments are required, how is each franchise's required payment determined (pro rata, team player salaries, team revenue, etc.)? If strike fund payments are required, what are the provisions for delinquent payments? Does the league keep track of each individual sports franchise's accumulated payments to the strike fund? For recordkeeping purposes, are earnings on strike funds allocated to the individual sports franchises based on their respective accumulated payments to the strike fund? Does the league periodically provide an accounting to the league members of each member's accumulated strike fund payments and earnings? Does the sports franchise reflect its share of the strike fund as an asset in its financial statements or tax returns? Is the use of strike funds restricted to certain types of expenditures under specified circumstances? 7-3  2.  3. 4.  5.  6.  7.  8.   9.  Do strike funds specifically benefit a specific sports franchise to the extent of its accumulated strike fund payments and earnings?  10. Is there any relationship between a sports franchise's accumulated strike fund payments and its eligibility for strike fund loans or payments? 11. Are loans from the strike fund to be repaid and, if so, under what terms and conditions? 12. If a sports franchise is sold, how are prior strike fund payments accounted for by the sports league, the seller, and the buyer? 13. What are the provisions if the strike fund is terminated or a decision is made to reduce the amount of the strike fund? 14. What are the procedures for modifying the operating or distribution provisions of the strike fund (majority vote of owners, etc.)? 15. Does the sports franchise have a continuing economic or property interest in the strike fund? 16. Does the form of the strike fund provisions reflect the substance of the strike fund? To the extent that the sports franchise and sports league do not furnish documents and information to address the above and other relevant questions, it may be appropriate to take the position that the sports franchise has not established that strike fund payments are currently deductible. EXAMINATION TECHNIQUES Initial documents and information that should be obtained in developing a sports franchise strike fund issue include: 1. 2. The strike fund agreement, The resolutions and minutes of league meetings in which the strike fund agreement and funding were discussed, Financial statements or supplementary financial information of the sports league association which address the league strike fund, and  3.  Workpapers and schedules reconciling the amount deducted in the sports franchise's tax return to the amount in its books and financial statements. This includes reconciliation of accruals at the beginning and end of each year under examination. The above documents and information should be requested early in the examination.

The increasing significance of revenue generated by club seats and luxury suites, which offer an advantage to new and renovated stadiums, is a major impetus for stadium expansion. Expansion sports franchises and relocated sports franchises generally have new or renovated stadiums. In addition, established sports franchises are commonly pursuing stadium expansion or, in some instances, new stadiums. A major factor in a sports franchise's financial success includes having a favorable stadium deal. Numerous cities have proven their willingness to mortgage their futures through taxes and the sale of bonds to attract or keep a sports franchise. As a result of new stadium construction and city concessions, sports franchises in larger markets, once thought to have an insurmountable economic advantage over franchises in smaller markets, have, in many instances, been surpassed in profits and value by their smaller market counterparts. The willingness of cities to build stadiums and the large increases in revenues related to the new stadiums creates an environment where it appears that in many leagues a sports franchise will need new stadiums and favorable concessions packages to remain competitive in their league. The sports franchise will either own its stadium or lease it from another party. The stadium owner may be an entity related to the sports franchise, a public entity, or an unrelated third party. The sports franchise's stadium interests, leased or owned, are a strong component of the sports franchise's overall value; accordingly, the agreements between the sports franchise and the local sports authority tend to be heavily negotiated, lengthy, and complex. It is not uncommon for the owner of a sports franchise to also own other entities related to the sports franchise. For instance, one entity may own the actual sports franchise, while another separate entity may own the sport facility or hold the long-term lease to the facility. Additionally, another related entity could hold the concession contract, while yet another can provide the parking. The ways in which ancillary services can be segregated into separate entities is almost limitless. Moreover, most sports franchise owners also own other businesses which, while unrelated to sports franchise operations (such as a television or radio station), may be enhanced by the ownership of a professional sports team.  8-1   Examiners should consider whether the agreements among an owner's businesses are entered into on an arms-length basis. Since these related party transactions will, in all likelihood, be unique, a thorough analysis is required to determine the true nature of the transactions. When related party transactions are determined to be at less than arms length, IRC section 482 may be used to reallocate income and expenses in order to reflect the proper taxable income. The applicability of IRC section 267 should also be considered for transactions among related parties. Because there are different audit issues and audit risk for a sports franchise which owns its stadium and a sports franchise which leases its stadium, the ownership and lease of a sports stadium are addressed separately in this chapter. STADIUM OWNERSHIP Overview As with all real estate owned, there are burdens and benefits that go with a sports franchise's ownership of its stadium. The sports franchise that owns its stadium will have a large capital asset on its balance sheet, and significant depreciation will be claimed. Rental expense will be drastically reduced in comparison to a sport franchise that leases its stadium. Unless the city has made concessions (which is not unlikely), the sports franchise will probably have significant property taxes. A sports franchise that owns its stadium is also likely to have a higher payroll than a sports franchise that leases its stadium. Stadium ownership by a sports franchise or an entity related to the sports franchise is generally achieved through construction or acquisition. In both instances, the basis of the asset will be the costs directly and indirectly chargeable to the stadium and related facility assets. In computing depreciation, the value of the land is excluded from the depreciable assets. With new construction, the determination of land value is generally provided in a separate acquisition closing statement; however, when an existing stadium is acquired, the determination of land value is more problematic. The contract on the acquisition of an existing stadium should allocate the acquisition price as negotiated by buyers and sellers among the various assets acquired. Even though the buyer and seller have agreed on the purchase/sale price allocations, the examiner is not prevented from challenging allocations to reflect their actual fair market values. AUDIT ISSUES 1. This issue relates to whether the allocation to land versus buildings and other depreciable assets is proper. As with any other purchase of real estate, the value allocated to land should be reviewed to determine its reasonableness. Whether the depreciable assets have been assigned proper recovery periods is a further issue. 8-2  2.   There are various structural components which are considered to be part of the stadium structure. Some components, such as stadium seats, the score board and message board have a considerably shorter life than the stadium structure. Therefore, it is important to determine that assets have been appropriately classified and the correct recovery period is applied in calculating depreciation. 3. For stadiums constructed using tax exempt bonds, another issue is whether the sports franchise properly used the alternative depreciation system versus the regular depreciation system.  Recovery Periods A sports stadium is a single purpose str of sports and other events. It is limited more general business use or activities. Accordingly, the stadium structure and of 39 years. uct to A its ure in that it provides spectator space for the viewing this functional use and is not readily adaptable to other sports stadium is nonresidential real property. structural components normally have a recovery period  The term ""structural components"" includes parts of the building such as: walls; partitions; floors; ceilings; permanent coverings such as paneling or tiling; windows and doors; all components (whether in, on, or adjacent to the building) of a central air conditioning or heating system, including motors, compressors, pipes and ducts; plumbing and plumbing fixtures, such as sinks and bathtubs; electric wiring and lighting fixtures; chimneys; escalators and elevators, including all components thereof; sprinkler systems; fire escapes; and other components relating to the operation or maintenance of a building. There are certain stadium-related assets which are considered personal property in nature and are, therefore, entitled to a shorter recovery period than the stadium structure and its structural components. Rev. Rul. 69-170, 1969-1 C.B. 28, addresses whether stadium seats and other miscellaneous items associated with a sports stadium qualify as IRC section 38 property for purposes of investment credit. This ruling indirectly provides guidance on what assets, associated with a sports stadium, qualify for recovery periods separate from (and thereby qualifying for shorter recovery periods) the stadium building and its structural components. The taxpayer in Rev. Rul. 69-170 operated a concrete and steel baseball stadium. The items of property in question were the stadium seats, score boards and message board (including equipment and circuitry), field lights, backstop, batter's eye screen, foul and flag poles, and signs. The stadium seats were wooden with metal frames and were attached to the stadium with bolts that were embedded in the concrete floor. The backstop was located behind home plate and was made of wire mesh attached by cables to the stadium structure. The batter's eye screen was located in center field and consisted of a 8-3   metallic screen across steel poles that were attached to concrete foundations with steel bolts. The foul and flag poles were four steel poles embedded in concrete and were separate from the stadium structure. The score boards and message board were in the nature of electrical signs. Both were mounted on large steel poles, attached to concrete foundations with steel bolts. These boards were separate and apart from the stadium structure. The field lights consisted of eight clusters of lights, each cluster having approximately 200 bulbs. Each cluster of lights was supported by steel poles that were attached to concrete foundations with steel bolts. Six of these steel poles were attached to foundations that were part of the stadium structure while the other two had foundations set apart from the structure. The signs consisted of numerous directional and traffic signs located in the parking lots and traffic lanes adjacent to the stadium. The Service ruled the stadium seats, the backstop, the flagpoles mounted on the stadium, and the equipment and circuitry contained in or attached to the score boards, and the message board were tangible personal property. In contrast, the Service ruled the score boards and message board (excluding equipment and circuitry), field lights (including those mounted on the stadium), batter's eye screen, foul line poles, flagpoles (excluding those mounted on the stadium), and sign structures (including the basic signs) were other tangible property. A change in the useful life of property under IRC section 167 is not a change in method of accounting. Treas. Reg. section 1.446-1(e)(2)(ii)(b). The allowed or allowable depreciation provisions apply to IRC section 167, useful life changes. A change in the recovery period of a class of assets under IRC section 168 is a change in method of accounting. Accordingly, the allowed or allowable depreciation provisions do not apply to recovery period changes under IRC section 168. Instead, the IRC section 481(a) and IRC section 446 change in accounting method provisions apply. Tax Exempt Bond Financing IRC section 168(g) requires the use of the alternative depreciation system for tax exempt bondfinanced property. Under the alternative depreciation method, the straight line method is used and the applicable recovery periods are:  8-4   Recovery Period 1. 2. 3. Property not described in 2 or 3 Personal property with no class life Nonresidential real and residential rental property the class life 12 years 40 years  EXAMINATION TECHNIQUES Documents and information that should be obtained for sports franchises that own their sports stadium include: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. stadium agreement(s), purchase/sale contract(s), appraisals, real property tax assessments, tangible tax returns, and depreciation schedules and workpapers.  Inspection of real property tax assessments and tangible tax returns filed is often a quick and easy way to determine the examination potential of allocation issues. Chapter 10 addresses purchase/sale price allocations in more detail. Consider whether the sports franchise is improperly treating categories of assets as being separate from the stadium building and its structural components. The sports franchise's recovery period characterizations of tangible personal property should be reviewed. Apply the allowed or allowable depreciation provisions to IRC section 167 useful life changes. Apply the IRC section 481(a) and IRC section 446 change in accounting method adjustment computation provisions and change in accounting method examination procedures for a change in the recovery period of a class of assets under IRC section 168.  8-5   STADIUM LEASES Overview If the stadium is being leased by the sports franchise, then leasehold improvements are a potential issue area. The general rule is that depreciation of improvements to real property, subject to a lease, is calculated in the same manner as the depreciation deduction for the underlying property would have been calculated had the property been placed in service at the same time as the addition or improvement, without regard to the lease term. The IRC section 467 rental agreement provisions may apply to a sports franchise's lease arrangements. AUDIT ISSUES 1. Whether amounts claimed as repair and maintenance expenses are lease improvements that should be capitalized under IRC section 263. Whether depreciation is being properly computed on leasehold improvements. Whether IRC section 267 or IRC section 482 apply to lease payments to related parties. Whether IRC section 467 is properly applied to rental arrangements.  2. 3. 4.  Leasehold Improvements Since a stadium lease is generally long term in nature, the examiner should consider whether amounts classified by the sports franchise as repair and maintenance expenditures are instead leasehold improvements that should be capitalized. The right to claim depreciation is not predicated on ownership of property, but on an investment in the property. The cost of improvements made by a lessee are generally depreciable. IRC section 168(i)(8)(A). Under IRC section 168, the depreciation of a capital asset is computed without regard to the lease term; thus, the cost of the improvement is recovered over the applicable recovery period. If, upon termination of the lease, the lessee does not retain the improvements, gain or loss is computed by reference to the adjusted basis in the improvements. IRC section 168(i)(8)(B). If the leasehold improvements are financed with tax exempt proceeds, under IRC section 168(g)(3)(A) the recovery period used for purposes of the alternative depreciation system is not less than 125 percent of the lease term.  8-6   IRC Section 467 Rental Agreements IRC section 467 rental agreements include leases in which the sum of the lease payments are in excess of $250,000, and either (1) at least one amount, allocable to the use of the property in one calendar year, is payable after the close of the subsequent calendar year, or (2) there are periodic increases in the rent. IRC section 467 requires both the lessor and lessee to report rental income and expense (and interest on rent) using an accrual method of accounting. Under IRC section 467, one of three different accrual methods may apply depending on the circumstances: 1. 2. 3. constant rental accrual; accrual in accordance with the allocation of rents provided in the rental agreement, or accrual in accordance with the allocation of rents provided in the rental agreement, adjusted to take into account present value concepts.  The proper IRC section 467 accrual method must be determined on a lease-by-lease basis. The constant rental method of IRC section 467(b)(2) applies when: (1) the rental agreement contains no allocation of rents, or (2) the rental agreement contains an allocation with stepped rents, a principal purpose for providing the stepped rents is avoidance of tax, and the agreement is either a leaseback or long-term agreement. If a rental agreement does not specify how much rent is allocable to the periods under the lease, the rent payment schedule should be treated as the rent allocation schedule. Because almost all rental agreements contain rent payment schedules, rarely will a rental agreement be subject to the constant rental accrual method because of a failure to allocate rent. If the constant rental method applies, the agreement of the parties concerning the allocation of rent will be totally disregarded, and the rent leveling provisions of IRC section 467(b)(2) will determine the income and expenses for each taxable year during the rental period. The constant rental amount is defined in IRC section 467(e)(1) as the amount which, if paid as of the close of each lease period under the agreement, would result in an aggregate present value equal to the present value of the aggregate payments required under the agreement. Section 1.467-3 of the proposed IRC section 467 regulations provides a formula for determining the constant rental method. For an IRC section 467 rental rents are generally recognized report the rent allocable to the accounting; thus, there will be agreement for which the constant rental method does not apply, as specified in the rental agreement. The parties will be required to period on the accrual basis regardless of their method of ""matching"" on an accrual basis by both lessors and lessees.  8-7   If the payment of rent is deferred and adequate interest is not charged on the deferred rent, the amount of rent allocated to a period must be discounted to its present value, and interest on the unpaid rent must be taken into account as it accrues. One reasonable method for discounting rent to present value is contained in section 1.467-2 of the proposed regulations. The section 467 regulations also apply IRC section 467 rules to rental agreements prepaid rent and/or decreasing rents. In some cases a sports franchise may lease a tax-exempt entity. In such cases, if the rental agreement has decreasing rents, and to the final section 467 regulations, application of the constant rental method shou considered. providing for stadium from a if it is subject ld be  The above constitutes just an overview of the detailed IRC section 467 provisions. More detailed guidance on IRC section 467 can be found in the Construction ISP team's coordinated issue papers entitled: -- Section 467 Rental Agreements -- The Constant Rate Method, and -- Section 467 Rental Agreements -- The Economic Accrual Method. EXAMINATION TECHNIQUES Documents and information that should be obtained in developing the sports franchise stadium lease include: 1. 2. 3. lease agreements, concession agreements, audited financial statements (the terms of the lease agreements and related party transactions should be disclosed in the footnotes), workpapers and schedules on the application of IRC section 467, copies of the returns of any related entity returns involved, and workpapers and schedules reconciling the amount deducted on the return with the amounts per the books (Schedule M-1). This should include year end accruals.  4. 5. 6.  Large repair and maintenance costs should be reviewed to determine if they are in the nature of a capital improvement. If the lease payments are to a related party, then IRC section 267 or IRC section 482 may apply. Generally, under IRC section 267, related entities are required to use the same method of 8-8   accounting so that there is no mismatching of income and expense between the two parties. To clearly reflect income and prevent the evasion of taxes, IRC section 482 enables examiners to re-allocate income and expense among entities when the transactions are not at arms length. With respect to IRC section 467, the first step is to determine if you have an IRC section 467 rental agreement. The second step is to determine whether the constant rental method or the economic accrual method applies. The third step is to determine whether the constant rental method or the economic accrual method provisions were properly applied by the sports franchise. Because the application of IRC section 467 involves the timing of the sports franchise's lease expenses, IRC section 467 issues constitute a change in the sports franchise's method of accounting for leases. Accordingly, examiners need to follow the change in method of accounting issue procedures in raising an IRC section 467 issue.  8-9   This page intentionally left blank.   Chapter 9 AMORTIZATION  OVERVIEW Amortization issues are likely to have more examination potential for sports franchises than for most other categories of taxpayers. There are two reasons for this. The first is the significance of player contracts to a sports franchise. Player contracts are likely to represent the most significant asset category of a sports franchise. Because player contracts are amortized over the useful lives of the individual player contracts, which typically range from 3 to 6 years, this is likely to represent the greatest expense category of the sports franchise. With respect to player contracts not acquired in connection with the acquisition of the sports franchise, issues arise on the tax treatment of player signing bonuses, performance bonuses, and other contract contingencies. In addition to determining the amount subject to amortization, issues arise in the determination of the useful lives of the individual player contracts and the dates the contracts are placed in service. The second reason amortization has greater audit potential for most sports franchises than taxpayers in other market segments is the fact that IRC section 197(e)(6) provides that if a franchise is engaged in professional sports, any item acquired in connection with such a franchise is excluded from IRC section 197 amortization. Because a sports franchise does not have a determinable useful life, the franchise intangible asset is not eligible for amortization under IRC section 197. Issues exist on whether items treated as separate intangible assets are, instead, part of the franchise intangible asset. For items determined to be separate from the franchise intangible asset, the question then becomes whether the intangible asset has an ascertainable value and a determinable useful life. Although the government has not always been successful in arguing that an intangible asset does not have an ascertainable value separate from goodwill, going concern value, and the franchise intangible asset, the government has been successful in arguing most separate intangible assets do not have determinable useful lives. For example, as addressed in this chapter, the government has successfully established in court that broadcasting rights are not subject to amortization because they do not have determinable useful lives. The following summarizes the likely intangible asset categories of a sports franchise and their general amortization periods:  9-1   Intangible Asset Category Organizational expenses  General Amortization Period Amortized over 60 months if an IRC section 248 or 709 election is made Amortized over the useful lives of the specific player contracts (which average between 3 to 6 years) No amortization, not an IRC section 197 intangible, has an indefinite useful life Not an IRC section 197 intangible, only eligible for amortization if it has: (1) an ascertainable value separate from goodwill, going concern value, and the franchise intangible asset, and (2) has a determinable useful life; this usually results in not being amortizable Amortized over 60 months if IRC section 195 is elected Amortized over the life of the lease or loan  Player contracts  The franchise  Other intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of the sports franchise  Start-up expenses  Lease and loan costs  PLAYER CONTRACTS AUDIT ISSUES 1. Whether the cost basis of player contracts not acquired in the acquisition of the sports franchise have been properly computed. Whether the useful lives used for the individual player contracts are proper.  2.  Tax Law Application A player contract is an intangible asset to the sports franchise. Player contracts are likely to represent the most significant costs incurred in the operation of a sports franchise. A player contract is a contract for the services of an athlete employed by the sports franchise. A player contract is likely to obligate the player to: (1) play the sport solely for the sports franchise, 9-2   (2) not participate in certain other sports, (3) attend team practices, meetings, and perhaps promotional events, and (4) keep himself in top physical condition. Player signing bonuses have become common. Some player contracts may contain performance bonuses. More than the specified period of the player contract, most player contracts contain renewal and team option provisions which extend the useful life of the contract. The provisions of IRC section 461 are applied in determining a sports franchise's cost basis for player contract amortization. Under Treas. Reg. section 1.446-1(c)(1)(ii)(A), a liability is incurred, and generally is taken into account for federal income tax purposes in the taxable year in which all events have occurred that establish the fact of the liability, and the amount of the liability can be determined with reasonable accuracy. Under IRC section 461(h)(2)(A), economic performance for services provided to a taxpayer occurs as the services are provided. The cost of a player contract to a sports franchise is the total amount incurred by the sports franchise on the player contract under IRC section 461. Signing bonuses are included in the cost of the player contract. Performance bonuses and other contingent payments are not taken into account until the sports franchise's obligation to pay becomes certain. While the contractual terms of player contracts vary with contract will provide employment for more than one year for one year, the employer usually has a unilateral option or more at a specified percentage of the player's previous the type of sport involved, the typical . Even when the player contract is just to renew the contract an additional year salary.  Generally, an accrual basis taxpayer is entitled to deduct unpaid expenses for the taxable year in which all the events have occurred which determine the fact of liability and in which the amount can be determined with reasonable accuracy. Under this general rule, accrued salaries would ordinarily be deductible expenses for the taxable year in which the salaries are earned by the employees, even if paid in the following taxable year. Any expenditure, however, that results in the acquisition of an asset having a useful life which extends beyond the close of the taxable year may not be deductible for the taxable year in which the liability for the expenditure was incurred. Treas. Reg. section 1.263(a)-2. The cost of a player contract having a useful life of more than a year must be capitalized and amortized over the useful life of the contract. The sports franchise's player contracts are amortized under IRC section 167. Amortization is computed on each individual player contract based on the useful life of the individual player contract. Treas. Reg. section 1.167(a)-1(b) provides the estimated useful life of an asset is the period over which it may reasonably be expected to be useful to the taxpayer. In general, the period over which the cost of a player contract is amortizable includes periods in which the club controls the player through options to renew the contract or restrictions on the ability of the player to contract with other clubs. In Rev. Rul. 67-379, 1967-2 C.B. 127, the 9-3   Service ruled that due to reserve clauses, a player contract often has a useful life extending beyond the taxable year in which the contract was acquired. The Service ruled the same for option clauses or any other clause which gives the sport franchise the opportunity to unilaterally extend the existing contract. Although the useful life varies from sport to sport and player to player, the sports franchise's player contracts typically have useful lives averaging from 3 to 6 years. The placed-in-service date of the player's signing bonus is the date all required signatures are affixed to the contract. Accordingly, a sports franchise begins claiming amortization on the player contract, including the signing bonus, when the necessary signatures are affixed to the player contract. General guidance on the amortization of the sports franchise's player contracts can be found in: 1. 2. 3. Rev. Rul. 67-379, 1967-2 C.B. 127, Rev. Rul. 70-318, 1970-1 C.B. 113, and Rul. Rul. 71-137, 1971-1 C.B. 104.  In amortizing player contracts, care must be taken to distinguish payments made to third parties to acquire a player contract, as opposed to payments made to a player pursuant to the underlying contract. Payments made to acquire a player contract are to be amortized over the life of the contract. Payments made to a player pursuant to the contract may constitute straight salary which is deducted as economic performance occurs. On the other hand, such payments may constitute disguised payments for other contract rights (for example, options to extend the contract, exclusivity agreements extending beyond the ""salary"" payment period, etc.). In such cases, the ostensible salary payments should be divided into two portions; amounts allocable to services and amounts allocable to other contract rights. Amounts allocated to payments for services should be deducted as economic performance occurs. Amounts allocated to other contract rights should be amortized over the life of the contract. EXAMPLE -- PLAYER CONTRACT AMORTIZATION BCD sports franchise, a calendar year taxpayer, and STAR athlete agree to a player contract for STAR. The player contract is signed by all parties on July 1, 1994. The player contract is for 3 years from the signing date and includes 2 renewal periods. BCD sports franchise has the option to extend STAR's contract to a fourth and fifth year. Under the contract, STAR can request salary renegotiation at the end of the third year. If STAR chooses salary renegotiation, and STAR and the BCD sports franchise do not agree on the renegotiated contract terms, then BCD sports franchise has the right to sell or trade STAR's player contract to another sports franchise in the league.  9-4   Under the player contract, STAR receives a $200,000 signing bonus. STAR's base salary (payable monthly) is $150,000 the first year, $120,000 the second year, and $150,000 for the third year, and each season runs from July 1 to June 30. The base salary for the fourth and fifth years (renewal option years) is $150,000 each year. The examiner makes a factual determination that $50,000 of the first year's ""salary"" is actually a disguised payment for the option to extend the contract for the fourth and fifth years. The contract also provides for both team and player performance bonuses. In any season in which the sports franchise's team meets a specified team goal, STAR is paid a team performance bonus. In any season in which the team plays in the league conference championship game, STAR receives a $30,000 team performance bonus. In any season in which the team wins the league's championship game, STAR is paid an additional team bonus of $50,000. In any season in which STAR is named to the league's all star team, STAR receives a $20,000 performance bonus. In any season in which STAR is voted the league's most valuable player, STAR is to receive an additional $50,000 player performance bonus. In year two, STAR made the league's all star team ($20,000 player performance bonus). In year three, the sports franchise made it to the league's championship game ($30,000 team performance bonus). The useful life of the player contract is 5 years (the 3 year contract period plus the two 1year renewal option years). Amortization begins on July 1, 1994, the date all parties signed the player contract. The amortized player contract tax basis does not include performance bonuses since these are contingencies. Accordingly, the amortized tax basis in the player contract consists of the $200,000 player signing bonus and the $50,000 disguised first year payment for options. BCD's amortized tax basis in the STAR player contract is computed as follows: $200,000 $ 50,000 $250,000 Player Signing Bonus Disguised First Year Payment for Options Amount to be Amortized  9-5   BCD's yearly amortization on its STAR player contract is: First Tax Year Second Tax Year Third Tax Year Fourth Tax Year Fifth Tax Year Total Amortization $ $ $ $ $ 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 000 000 000 000 000  $250,000  Additionally, salary amounts are to be deducted as economic performance occurs. Because ratable amortization is allowed as STAR furnishes the services to the BCD sports franchise, economic performance occurs under the provisions of IRC section 461(h) as the ratable amortization is allowed. BCD is also entitled to additional deductions for the second year player performance bonus ($20,000) and the third year team performance player bonus ($30,000). The tax year in which BCD deducts these bonuses is the year in which these are allowed under BCD's overall method of accounting (which is usually the cash method or the accrual method of accounting). EXAMINATION TECHNIQUES Documents and information that should be obtained in developing sports franchise player contract amortization issues include: 1. For the prior, current, and subsequent tax years: a. the sports franchise's schedules and workpapers reflecting: 1) the player contracts owned by the sports franchise, 2) the sports franchise's tax basis in each player contract, and 3) the useful life used by the sports franchise for each player contract. b. to the extent not included in ""a,"" copies of the schedules and workpapers used to compute player contract amortization. This should include any schedules and workpapers necessary to reconcile this with the total player contract amortization amount reflected on return Form 4562.  2.  Depending on the number of player contracts owned by the sports franchise, copies of all or a sampling of the player contracts. 9-6   To reduce taxpayer burden and sharpen your examination focus, you may want to address the sports franchise's player contract business practices before deciding which player contract to request. For sports franchises with a large number of player contracts, you should consider conducting a skewed sampling of player contracts based on their likely issue potential. For example, consider first focusing on: 1. the sports franchise's marque player contracts (likely to be higher dollar contract amounts and more likely to have bonuses, options, and contingencies), player contracts that have certain characteristics (such as bonus provisions, options, or contingencies), and player contracts with short useful lives.  2.  3.  A common examination technique many examiners use for taxpayers claiming significant amounts of depreciation or amortization is to analyze the taxpayer's prior and subsequent years' depreciation and amortization schedules. Due to the significance of player contract amortization, this is likely to be a good examination technique for most sport franchise examinations. Check to ensure the cost basis and useful lives used are consistent from year to year. Player contracts on the prior or current year's schedule that are omitted from the current or subsequent year's schedule should be reconciled to the sports franchise's player contract gain and loss return schedules. The following player contract issues constitute a change in the sports franchise's method of accounting for player contracts: 1. a change from expensing to capitalizing all player contracts or categories of player contracts, and a change in the sports franchise's method or policies in determining its tax basis in player contracts under IRC section 461.  2.  The IRC section 481(a) and IRC section 446 change in accounting method adjustment computation procedures (versus the allowed or allowable depreciation rule) apply to player contract change in method of accounting issues. Because the change is a change in the useful life under IRC section 167 versus a change in recovery period under IRC section 168, a change in the useful lives of individual player contracts is not a change in the method of accounting. Accordingly, the allowed or allowable depreciation rule applies to player contract useful life changes.  9-7   INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED IN THE ACQUISITION OF A SPORTS FRANCHISE Audit Issues 1. Whether in the acquisition of a sports franchise, the allocation of the purchase price among player contracts, the franchise, other intangible assets, and other assets is proper. This is addressed in Chapter 10. Whether intangible assets other than player contracts acquired in connection with the acquisition of a sports franchise have an ascertainable value and determinable useful life: A major issue area is broadcasting rights, which the government has successfully argued do not have a determinable useful life.  2.  Tax Law Application The franchise intangible assets and other intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of a sports franchise are specifically excluded from the definition of an IRC section 197 intangible. Accordingly, unlike most other taxpayers, a sports franchise is not entitled to 15 year amortization on the intangible assets acquired with the acquisition of the sports franchise. This includes goodwill, going concern value, the franchise intangible asset, and other intangible assets such as broadcasting rights. This means that pre-IRC section 197 law applies in determining whether the intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of sports franchises are eligible for amortization. To be subject to amortization, the sports franchise's intangible asset must have: (1) an ascertainable value separate and apart from goodwill, going concern value, and the franchise intangible asset, and (2) a determinable useful life. IRC section 197(f)(4)(A) uses the definition in IRC section 1253(b)(1) for the definition of a franchise under IRC section 197. IRC section 1253(b)(1) states ""the term 'franchise' includes an agreement which gives one of the parties to the agreement the right to distribute, sell, or provide goods, services, or facilities, within a specified area."" IRC section 197(e)(6) excludes from the definition of an IRC section 197 intangible, ""A franchise to engage in professional football, basketball, baseball, or other professional sport, and any item acquired in connection with such a franchise."" After stating the above IRC section 197(e)(6) statement, H.R. Rep. No. 103-213, 103rd Cong., 1st Sess. (1993), 1993-3 C.B. 560, states: ""Consequently, the cost of acquiring a professional sports franchise and related assets (including any goodwill, going concern value, or other section 197 intangibles) is to be allocated among the assets acquired as provided under present law (see, for example, section 1056 of the Code) and is to be taken into account under the provisions of 9-8   present law."" To be subject to amortization, the intangible asset must have: (1) an ascertainable value separate and apart from goodwill and going concern value, and (2) a determinable useful life. Because the franchise intangible asset acquired with the acquisition of a sports franchise has an indefinite useful life, it is not subject to amortization. Player contracts acquired in the acquisition of a sports franchise do have an ascertainable value separate and apart from goodwill, going concern value, and the franchise intangible asset. Player contracts also have determinable useful lives. Therefore, the non-IRC section 197 intangible issue centers on whether intangible assets other than the franchise intangible asset and player contracts acquired in connection with the acquisition of a sports franchise have: (1) an ascertainable value separate and apart from goodwill, going concern value, and the franchise intangible asset, and (2) have a determinable useful life. This is addressed further by covering the tax treatment given to broadcasting rights. Broadcasting Rights One of the intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of a sports franchise is the right to share in the income from national broadcasting rights along with the other sports franchises in the league. The national broadcasting contracts are between the commissioner of the respective league, on behalf of the league's sports franchises, and the networks. A sports franchise in a particular league confers a right to receive a pro rata share of this revenue as long as the sports franchise is a member of the league. National broadcasting rights acquired with the acquisition of a sports franchise are not subject to amortization under IRC section 197. Thus, to be depreciable or amortizable as a ""wasting asset,"" intangible property must have (1) an ascertainable value separate from goodwill, and (2) a limited useful life ascertainable with reasonable accuracy. See Newark Morning Ledger Co. v. United States, 507 U.S. 546, 113 S. Ct. 1670 (1993). The burden of proving that an intangible asset has these characteristics is on the taxpayer. In Laird v. United States, 556 F.2d 1224 (5th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1014 (1978), one of the issues addressed by the Fifth Circuit was whether amortization was allowable on the national broadcast intangible asset acquired on the taxpayer's acquisition of a National Football League (NFL) sports franchise. The Commissioner of the NFL had executed a 4-year contract on behalf of the league's sports franchises with the CBS Television Network under which CBS received the right to televise the NFL's games. The NFL sports franchises ratably shared the revenue generated under the national broadcasting contract.  9-9   The taxpayer argued the broadcast intangible asset was a wasting asset, and therefore amortizable, because it had a proven value (present value of the guaranteed future income under the contract) and a limited useful life (the 4-year term of the contract). Although the Court rejected the government's argument that the broadcasting rights did not have an ascertainable value separate from goodwill, going concern value, and the sports franchise intangible asset, it noted the television rights were to continue as long as the sports franchise remained a member of the NFL. The court adopted the government's ""link in a perpetual chain"" analogy and stated: ""As the government correctly points out, the rights under the CBS contract were only a 'four year link' in a 'perpetual chain' of television income. Though the existing contract provided a measure of [the purchaser's] television rights over a particular four year period, nevertheless the rights were to continue indefinitely. *** Because the rights pursuant to the CBS contract were only a link in a chain of revenue which would continue as long as the Atlanta Club chain holds an NFL franchise, they did not constitute a wasting asset."" The tax court reached the same conclusion, in First Northwest Industries v. Commissioner, 70 T.C. 817 (1978), rev'd on other grounds, 649 F.2d 707 (9th Cir. 1981). This case involved the purchase of a National Basketball Association (NBA) sports franchise. Included among the rights acquired in the purchase was the right to an equal share of all revenues from national broadcasting of NBA games. In response to the claim that the current broadcasting contract was a wasting asset, the Tax Court held the contract was not amortizable because it merely represented a ""link in a continuing chain of national television income"" which would continue as long as the sports franchise remained a member of the NBA. The Sixth Circuit also reached this conclusion in McCarthy v. United States, 807 F.2d 1306 (6th Cir. 1986). This case involved the purchase of a Major League Baseball (MLB) sports franchise. Included among the inherent rights acquired in the purchase of the sports franchise was the right to broadcast the sports franchise's games. The three broadcasting contracts at the time of purchase were: (1) a network contract among the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) and the Commissioner of MLB, (2) a local television broadcasting contract with the sports franchise, and (3) a local radio broadcasting contract with the sports franchise. In deciding the broadcast intangible assets were not amortizable because they did not have limited useful lives, the Sixth Circuit stated ""the current broadcasting contracts likewise are merely links in a perpetual chain of broadcasting revenues"" which the sports franchise will have the rights to as long as it remains in the MLB. Although the government has not yet been successful in arguing that a broadcasting right intangible asset is not separable from goodwill, going concern value, and the franchise intangible asset, the government has been successful in arguing the broadcasting rights acquired on the acquisition of a sports franchise do not have a determinable useful life. Accordingly, like the 9-10   franchise intangible asset, broadcasting rights are not subject to amortization.  ORGANIZATIONAL EXPENDITURES AND START-UP EXPENSES Audit Issues 1. Whether expenses treated as organizational expenses and start-up expenses are qualifying expenditures under IRC sections 248, 709, and 195. More specifically, whether expenses directly connected with the acquisition of a sports franchise are improperly amortized under these IRC sections. Whether organizational expenses and start-up costs are improperly characterized by the sports franchise as current period deductions.  2.  Tax Law Application IRC section 248 for corporations and IRC section 709 for partnerships prescribe that organizational expenditures be treated as deferred expenses amortizable over a period of not less than 60 months. Both sections define ""organizational expenditures"" as any expenditure which: 1. 2. 3. is incident to the creation of the corporation or partnership, is chargeable to a capital account, and is of a character which, if expended incident to the creation of a corporation or partnership having a limited life, would be amortizable over such life.  Costs of issuing stock in a corporation, syndication fees in the case of a partnership, and expenditures connected with the transfer of assets are examples of costs that are not organizational expenditures. Under IRC section 195, start up costs are defined as any amount paid or incurred in connection with investigating the creation or acquisition of an active trade or business, creating an active trade or business, or any activity engaged in for profit or production of income before the day on which the activity begins, and which, if paid or incurred in connection with the operation of an existing active trade or business, would be allowable as a deduction for the tax year in which it was paid or incurred. Start up costs are amortizable over a period of not less than 60 months. Potential Emerging Issue For Start-up Expenses For a league expansion sports franchise there may be a potential emerging issue of whether amortization of qualifying IRC section 195 start-up expenses begins when: 1. the sports franchise first solicits ticket subscriptions, 9-11   2. 3.  the league awards the sports franchise, or the sports franchise plays its first league game.  9-12   Chapter 10 PURCHASE AND SALE OF A SPORTS FRANCHISE  OVERVIEW This chapter furnishes general guidance on the tax issues associated with the purchase and sale of a sports franchise. Because the tax issues (including numerous asset acquisition elections) are often quite complex, the guidance given is not a substitute for examiner tax law research and analysis based on the specifics of the particular sports franchise acquired or sold. This chapter addresses the purchase and sale of an existing sports franchise. The acquisition of a league expansion franchise and league expansion revenue are addressed in Chapter 11. The sales and exchanges of player contracts not associated with the purchase, and sale of an entire sports franchise are addressed in Chapter 12. There are two unique aspects to the purchase/sale of a sports franchise from the purchase/sale of other types of businesses. The most significant distinction is the allocation and tax treatment with respect to player contracts. Special rules apply to the purchase/sale price allocations to a sports franchise's total amount of player contracts along with rules on the allocations among individual player contracts because: (1) this is likely to be the most significant asset category of the sports franchise, (2) the buyer and seller are required to make consistent allocations, and (3) the buyer and seller often have competing tax consequences on player contract allocations. This is an area warranting significant consideration during the examination of the purchaser or seller of a sports franchise. Another unique aspect on the purchase and sale of a sports franchise is that, unlike most all other categories of taxpayers, there are no IRC section 197 intangibles. As addressed in Chapter 9, to claim amortization, the buyer has to apply pre-IRC section 197 law to establish: (1) the intangible has an ascertainable value separate from goodwill, going concern value, and the franchise intangible asset, and (2) a determinable useful life. The inapplicability of IRC section 197 to the intangibles acquired on the purchase of a sports franchise, is likely to result in valuation and life studies on intangibles that are no longer relevant for most other categories of taxpayers. In addition, the inapplicability of IRC section 197 may impact the buyer's negotiating posture with the seller on the amounts allocated to intangible assets other than player contracts. The purchaser and seller of a sports franchise are required to use the same allocation of the purchase/sale price to the assets acquired/sold. This chapter addresses both the purchase and sale of a sports franchise. Whether you are initially assigned the purchaser's or the seller's return for examination, adequate issue consideration requires full consideration of the other party's 10-1   allocations and tax treatment. In addition, if a purchase/sale price allocation issue is raised during the examination of either the buyer or seller, then the issue is almost always a ""whipsaw"" issue requiring a related case pick-up or collateral examination request of the other party to the transaction. AUDIT ISSUES 1. Whether the buy/sell agreement allocations among the sport franchise's assets properly reflect the relative fair market values of the asset categories. Specific consideration of the IRC section 1056 player contract allocation provisions are warranted. Whether the residual allocation method of IRC section 1060 is properly applied in the buy/sell agreement allocations. Whether both the buyer and the seller used the buy/sell agreement allocations in their respective tax returns. Whether the buyer under examination properly computed its basis in the franchise assets acquired. Specific consideration of IRC section 1056 is warranted. Whether the seller under examination properly computed its gain on the sale of its sports franchise.  2.  3.  4.  5.  VALUATION OF THE SPORTS FRANCHISE As with other businesses, the valuation of a sports franchise generally involves professional studies of the sports franchise and the arms-length negotiations among the parties. Generally, the resulting purchase/sale price reflected in the executed buy/sell agreement constitutes the total fair market value of the sport franchise's assets for tax purposes. In arriving at the total fair market value of the sports franchise, the fair market values of individual asset categories are often addressed. The fair market values given in the studies to specific asset categories are relevant because they are likely to be the basis for, or at least influence, the buy/sell agreement allocations among asset categories. Like most business valuations, the valuation of a sports franchise is generally determined utilizing a combination of: 1. 2. 3. a valuation of the entire sports franchise, a valuation of the specific assets acquired, an analysis of historical and future income streams. 10-2   The market method of valuing the entire sports franchise is based on the premise that the value of an asset can be estimated by analyzing the publicly known and verifiable prices paid for similar assets or property. For many sports leagues, the market values of the sports franchises in the league have skyrocketed over the last decade. The potential resale value may have a greater impact on the resulting purchase/sale price than the valuation of specific assets or the estimated future revenue/costs of operating the sports franchise. A sports franchise includes the assets common to most other businesses, plus player contracts, exclusive territorial rights, sponsorship rights, and participation in shared league revenue such as national broadcasting revenue. The asset categories involved in the purchase/sale of a sports franchise are likely to include: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. cash equivalents season ticket advance payments/deposits various receivables long-term ticket subscriptions player contracts lease agreements fixed assets (perhaps including a stadium or sports arena) goodwill, going concern value, and the franchise intangible asset, and other non-IRC section 197 intangible assets.  In valuing individual asset categories and individual assets, the appraiser may rely on a combination of replacement value, market value, and the income method. Fair market value is generally used for valuing player contracts. The amounts allocated to player contracts are addressed later in this chapter. Allocations to intangible assets that the buyer asserts have an ascertainable value separate from goodwill, going concern value, and the franchise intangible asset may be a significant issue area. Amortization of a sports franchise's intangible assets is addressed in Chapter 9. In some cases, determination of the actual purchase/sale price in the buy/sell agreement may be complicated by contingencies. Contingent payments may be provided for contingencies involving future league expansion, stadium agreements, food and beverage concessions, and relocation of the sports franchise contingency provisions. These are just some of the contingencies that may be 10-3   included in a sports franchise buy/sell agreement. The cutoff date used in determining the valuation of the sports franchise can have relevant consequences for accrued and deferred items of revenue and expense. The cutoff date used can also significantly impact the valuation of benefits the sports franchise is entitled to such as season ticket revenues, sponsorship revenues, broadcasting rights, and expansion revenue. Accordingly, consideration should be given to time span accounting and valuation differences from the cutoff date used in valuation studies and the actual purchase/sale date in the buy/sell agreement. As with other businesses, the valuation of a sports franchise and its component assets often involves complex methodologies, approaches, and computations. A complete valuation of the entire sports franchise may be necessary for the best approach. Obtaining the formal assistance of an IRS engineer or economist may be necessary or advisable. THE RESIDUAL ALLOCATION METHOD As provided in IRC section 1060 and the regulations, both the buyer and seller in asset acquisitions are required to allocate the purchase/sale price in the buy/sell agreement among the component asset categories using the residual method. The residual method is set forth in Temp. Tres. Reg. section 1.1060-1T, 1997-12 I.R.B. 35 (March 24, 1997), which generally applies to asset acquisitions after February 14, 1997. Under Treas. Reg. section 1.1060-1T, assets are divided into five categories or ""classes."" They are: Class I assets (consisting of cash and cash equivalents, like bank accounts), Class II assets (liquid assets, like certificates of deposit, government securities, and readily marketable stock or securities), Class III assets (all assets other than Class I, II, IV, and V assets), Class IV assets (all IRC section 197 intangibles except intangibles in the nature of goodwill and going concern value), and Class V assets (intangibles in the nature of goodwill and going concern value). The purchase price is allocated first to the Class I assets (on a dollar for dollar basis), then to Class II assets to the extent of their fair market value, to the Class III assets to the extent of their fair market value, to the Class IV assets to the extent of their fair market value, and finally, any residual is allocated to the Class V assets. The differing tax treatment of the assets in each class, for example, the extent to which depreciation or amortization is available, provides an incentive to manipulate the valuation or character of the assets in order to affect the purchase price allocation. With regard to asset acquisitions made prior to February 14, 1997, Treas. Reg. 1.1060-1T provides that the previous regulations apply. The previous regulations provide that the assets are divided into four, rather than five, categories or ""classes."" Under this provision, Class III assets are all assets other than Class I, II, and IV assets. Class IV assets are intangible assets in the nature of goodwill and going concern value. There is no Class V asset category. These allocations are subject to other applicable limitations under the Code. For example, in the context of a sports franchise, the allocation provisions of IRC section 1056(a) for player contracts 10-4   have to be taken into account in applying the residual allocation method rules. Often high values are placed on player contracts, so that under the residual method as little as 10 percent is allocated to franchise rights. The Service has the authority to value the franchise rights to determine the reasonableness of the player contracts valuations. The mandatory use of the residual method does not restrict the Service's ability to challenge the taxpayer's determination of any asset's fair market value. Treas. Reg. section 1.1060-1T(e)(4) specifically provides: ""In connection with the examination of a return, the Internal Revenue Service may challenge the taxpayer's determination of the fair market value of any asset by any appropriate method and take into account all factors, including any lack of adverse tax interests between the parties. For example, in certain cases the Internal Revenue Service may make an independent showing of the value of goodwill and going concern value as a means of calling into question the validity of the taxpayer's valuation of other assets."" PLAYER CONTRACTS IRC section 1056, Basic limitation for player contracts transferred in connection with the sale of a franchise, reads as follows: (a) General Rule If a franchise conducting any sports enterprise is sold or exchanged, and if, in connection with such sale or exchange, there is a transfer of a contract for the services of an athlete, the basis of such contract in the hands of the transferee shall not exceed the sum of-- (1) the adjusted basis of such contract in the hands of the transferor immediately before the transfer, plus (2) the gain (if any) recognized by the transferor on the transfer of such contract. ******* Accordingly, under IRC section 1056 the purchaser's basis in a player contract is the seller's adjusted basis in the player contract plus the seller's recognized gain on the player contract. This provision is explained in S. Rep. No. 94-938, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 90 (1976), 1976-3 Vol. 3 C.B. 128, which reflects: ""The committee amendment provides that in the case of the sale or exchange of a sports franchise (or the creation of a new franchise) the amount of consideration 10-5   allocated to a player contract by the transferee shall not exceed the sum of the adjusted basis of the contract in the hands of the transferor immediately before the transfer and gain (if any) recognized by the transferor on the transfer of the player contract. In this way, the committee believes that a more appropriate allocation will be achieved since, to a substantial extent the buyer and seller will be adverse parties with respect to the allocation (i.e., to the extent that the amount of gain attributable to player contracts will be fully recaptured as ordinary income, the buyer and seller will be operating at arms-length with respect to the allocation)."" IRC section 1056(d), Presumption as to amount allowable to player contracts provides: ""In the case of any sale or exchange described in subsection (a), it shall be presumed that not more than 50 percent of the consideration is allocable to contracts for the services of athletes unless it is established to the satisfaction of the Secretary that a specified amount in excess of 50 percent is properly allocable to such contracts. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall give rise to a presumption that an allocation of less than 50 percent of the consideration to contracts for the services of athletes is a proper allocation."" The legislative history to IRC section 1056(d) indicates that Congress intended only to provide a rebuttal upper limit to the amount allocable to player contracts. H. R. Rep. No. 94-658, 94th Cong. 1st Sess. 117-118, 1976-3 Vol. 2 C.B. 809 - 810, reflects: ""The bill also provides that in the case of the sale or exchange of a sports franchise, it is presumed that not more than 50 percent of the consideration is allocable to player contracts unless the taxpayer can satisfy the Secretary of the Treasury that under the facts and circumstances of the particular case, it is proper to allocate an amount in excess of 50 percent. However, your committee's bill makes it clear that the presumption does not mean that an allocation of less than 50 percent of the consideration to player contracts is proper. The proper allocation is to depend upon the facts and circumstances of each particular case. Factors to be taken into account by the Secretary are to include the amount of gate receipts received by the past owner of the franchise (as well as the amount to be received in the future), the amount of radio and television receipts that were received by the past owner of the franchise (as well as the amount to be received in the future), etc. Your committee recognizes that there are differences among the various sports which are relevant to the proper allocation and, therefore intends that factors peculiar to each sport (and to each team) be taken into account."" Thus, the legislative history indicates that IRC section 1056(d) does not provide that 50 percent of the purchase price of a sports franchise should be allocated to IRC section 1056(d) merely provides a presumed upper limit on the amount allo contracts. The exact amount to be allocated depends on the particular facts and 10-6 a presumption player contracts. cable to player circumstances of   each case. See Laird v. United States, 556 F.2d 1224 (5th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1014 (1978). In First Northwest Industries v. Commissioner, 70 T.C. 817 (1978), rev'd on other grounds, 649 F.2d 707 (9th Cir. 1981), an opinion issued after the enactment of IRC section 1056 but dealing with taxable years before its effective date, the Tax Court rejected the Service's assertion that player contracts should be treated as a mass asset. In reaching this conclusion the Tax Court noted that IRC section 1056 also envisions an allocation among player contracts. IRC section be allocated on the other period that t 1056 provides a basis limitation as to the percent of the total purchase price that can to player contracts. The portion of the purchase price allocated to player contracts, hand, is further allocated to the individual players' contracts and amortized over the he club is expected to have control over each respective player.  With respect to the seller of a sports franchise, the player contract amalgamation rule of IRC section 1245(a)(4) applies. Under the player contract amalgamation rule, player contracts are treated as a consolidated asset (or mass or pooled asset) to the seller on the sale of a sports franchise. IRC section 1245(a)(4)(D) defines a player contract as ""any contract for the services of an athlete which, in the hands of the taxpayer, is of a character subject to the allowance for depreciation provided in section 167."" Under the player contract amalgamation rule, the seller's IRC section 1245 recapture is based on the IRC section 167 amortization claimed on all player contracts. If the total amount allocated to player contracts in the buy/sell agreement exceeds the seller's adjusted basis in all of its player contracts and also exceeds the total amortization previously claimed by the seller on its player contracts, then, to the extent gain is recognized, the seller has IRC section 1245 ordinary income equal to the amortization previously claimed. If, however, the amount allocated to player contracts in the buy/sell agreement is less than the seller's original cost basis in all its player contracts then the seller's IRC section 1245 recapture is limited to the gain recognized. As addressed earlier, the buyer's basis in the player contracts under IRC section 1056 is the seller's adjusted basis in the player contracts plus the gain reported by the seller on the player contracts. Whether the seller's gain on the player contract is an IRC section 1231 gain or IRC section 1245 ordinary gain has no impact on the buyer's basis. Both an IRC section 1231 gain and an IRC section 1245 ordinary gain increase the buyer's basis by an equal amount. Extract IRC section 1056(c) (c) Transferor required to furnish certain information. Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, the transfer[or] shall, at the time and in the manner provided in such regulations, furnish to the Secretary and the transferee the 10-7   following information: (1) the amount which the transferor believes to be the adjusted basis referred to in paragraph (1) of subsection (a), (2) the amount which the transferor believes to be the gain referred to in paragraph (2) of subsection (a), and (3) any subsequent modification of either such amount. To the extent provided in such regulations, the amounts furnished pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be binding on the transferor and the transferee. The Treasury has not promulgated regulations under IRC section 1056.  TAX PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS In addition to the usual tax planning considerations given to buy/sell agreements on the purchase/sale of the assets of a trade or business, in the context of sports franchises, additional tax planning considerations involve the amounts allocated to player contracts and other intangible assets. Generally relevant to both the buyer and the seller is the amount allocated in the buy/sell agreement to player contracts. The amount allocated in the buy/sell agreement to player contracts determines the seller's gain on the player contracts and the buyer's basis in the player contracts. Due to IRC section 1245 recapture, the amounts allocated to player contracts is likely to increase the amount of the seller's ordinary gain versus IRC section 1231 gain on the sale. Accordingly, the seller may have a tax incentive to minimize the purchase/sale price allocation to player contracts. Because player contracts lead to amortization (with useful lives of player contracts averaging 3 to 6 years), buyers have a tax incentive to maximize the amount allocated to player contracts. Unlike most other categories of taxpayers, the intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of a sports franchise are not IRC section 197 intangibles, the amounts the buyer wants allocated to intangible assets may be subjected to tax planning. Because they are not amortizable, the buyer has a tax incentive to minimize the amounts allocated to goodwill, going concern value, and the franchise intangible asset. Buyers taking aggressive tax positions, may negotiate for buy/sell agreement allocations to what they believe are intangible assets with short useful lives (such as 3 to 4 years). An example of this is broadcasting rights which are addressed in Chapter 9. Clearly, a 3 to 4 year amortization period beats the 15 year amortization period under IRC section 197 that is mandated for buyers of most other categories of businesses. This creates tax planning opportunities on the acquisition of 10-8   a sports franchise. ECONOMIC REALITY, STRONG PROOF DOCTRINE, AND THE DANIELSON RULE As with the purchase/sale of other types of businesses, the Service is not bound by the buy/sell agreement allocations of the purchase/sale amount to the component assets in the purchase/sale of a sport franchise. Upon examination, the Service can re-allocate the purchase/sale amount to reflect the economic reality of the transaction and the relative fair market value of asset components. In this regard, substance versus form is controlling for tax purposes. In First Northwest Industries v. Commissioner, 70 T.C. 817, 843 (1978), rev'd on other grounds, 649 F.2d 707 (9th Cir. 1981) the Tax Court found the IRS was not bound by the allocation of costs by the NBA and the expansion team. Although there is no bar on the Service to challenge the buy/sell agreement allocations, taxpayers (either the buyer, the seller, or both) have significant hurdles to overcome if they attempt to disregard the buy/sell agreement allocations for tax purposes. As noted earlier, IRC section 1060(a) provides that the allocation of the purchase/sale amount among component assets in the buy/sell agreement ""shall be binding on both the transferor and the transferee unless the Secretary determines that such allocation (or fair market value) is not appropriate."" In addition, IRC section 1056(a) provides that the adjusted basis and gain amounts on player contracts the seller furnishes to the buyer, as required by IRC section 1056(c) ""shall be binding on the transferor and on the transferee."" Under general case law, allocations in a written buy/sell agreement are usually binding upon the parties to the agreement. Where the parties clearly and unequivocally allocated amounts to asset components, the courts have refused to allow one of the parties subsequently to alter the tax consequences of the expressed amount unless he/she can overcome the contract terms by strong proof that the agreement does not reflect the parties' true intentions. This is known as the strong proof doctrine. Major v. Commissioner, 76 T.C. 239 (1981); Sonnleitner v. Commissioner, 598 F.2d 464 (5th Cir. 1979). The Service and some appellate courts, relying on Commissioner v. Danielson, 389 U.S. 858 (1967), require an even stronger degree of proof before one party will be permitted to alter the allocation for tax purposes. Under the Danielson rule, a party may contradict an unambiguous contractual term, for tax purposes, only by offering proof which would be admissible in an action between the parties to alter that construction or to show its unenforceability because of mistake, undue influence, fraud, or duress. Although the Tax Court has rejected the Danielson rule, preferring the less stringent strong proof rule, under the rule given in Golsen v. Commissioner, 54 T.C. 742 (1970), aff'd, 445 F.2d 985 (10th Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 940 (1971), the Tax Court will follow a United States 10-9   Court of Appeals opinion which is squarely on point where appeal of the Tax Court decision would lie in that circuit. The Danielson rule has been adopted by the Third, Fifth, Sixth, and Eleventh Circuits. See Danielson; Spector v. Commissioner, 641 F.2d 376 (5th Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 868 (1981); Schatten v. United States, 746 F.2d 319 (6th Cir. 1984); and Bradley v. United States, 730 F.2d 718 (11th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 882 (1984). In addition, H.R. Rep. No. 101-964, 101 st Cong., 2nd Sess. (1990), reflects that taxpayers are bound by their IRC 1060 asset acquisition allocations unless they are able to refute the allocation or valuation under the standard set forth in Danielson. EXAMINATION TECHNIQUES The examiner should determine in the early stage of the examination whether valuation assistance from an IRS engineer or economist is warranted. If so, submit Form 5202 to request the assistance of an IRS engineer or follow local procedures to request the assistance of an IRS economist. The national sports franchise ISP team, which is working with the engineering group in South Florida on sports franchise valuation issues, is another sports franchise valuation guidance resource. Documents and information that should be obtained in developing sports franchise purchase/sale issues include: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. the buy/sell agreement, all buyer and seller correspondence on the buy/sell negotiations, understandings, etc., all valuation studies conducted by or for either the buyer or seller, the sports franchise agreement, the required information previously furnished by the seller to the buyer and the Service in accordance with IRC section 1060(b), and IRC section 1056(c), and the regulations, and your taxpayer's tax return schedules and workpapers on the purchase/sale.  6.  Whether you are initially assigned the purchaser's or the seller's return for examination, adequate issue consideration requires full consideration of the other party's allocations and tax treatment. If the other party did not follow the buy/sell agreement component asset allocations, this may indicate the allocations have no economic substance or are not at fair market value. In addition, if a purchase/sale price allocation issue is in fact raised during the examination of either the buyer or seller, then the issue is almost always a ""whipsaw"" issue requiring a related case pick-up or collateral examination request of the other party to the transaction.  10-10   If you are assigned the buyer's return, obtain a copy of the seller's return, and if you are assigned the seller's return, obtain a copy of the buyer's return. First, check AIMS to see if the other party is under examination and verify the service center and district with which the other party files. If the other party is an out of district taxpayer, consider pursuing collateral examination procedures in the early stages of your examination. The IRC section 1056 player contract provisions and IRC section 1060 are based on an assumed adversity of tax interests among the buyer and the seller. To the extent this is not the case, the buy/sell agreement allocations may warrant additional consideration. Consider determining to what extent the buyer and seller have adverse tax interests in the various asset component allocations. Because the assumed tax adversity may not exist for the seller, this is especially the case if you are assigned the buyer's tax return. Factors impacting the seller's tax posture include the tax differential between the ordinary income tax rate and the capital gains tax rate and whether the seller has unused net operating losses or capital losses. Since a CCorporation's capital gains are taxed at the regular corporate tax rate, whether the seller is a CCorporation, S-Corporation, or a partnership can be relevant. Determine if the total amount allocated to player contracts in the buy/sell agreement reflects the fair market value of the sports franchise's player contracts. Consider whether the player contract terms, contract periods, and the athletes' fair market trade values on the buy/sell agreement date are in line with the amount allocated to player contracts. The buyer has a tax incentive to allocate more to player contracts with shorter useful lives than player contracts with longer useful lives. If you are assigned the buyer's tax return, consider the buyer's allocation of the total amount allocated to player contracts in the buy/sell agreement to the individual player contracts. Compare the seller's adjusted basis in the individual player contracts and the gains reported with the buyer's individual player contract purchase/sale price allocations. If you are assigned the seller's tax return and there is a tax consequence in whether gains are ordinary versus capital, verify the seller's IRC section 1245 recapture amount on the player contracts.  10-11   This page intentionally left blank.   Chapter 11 LEAGUE EXPANSION  OVERVIEW Over the last decade, many sports leagues have added new sports franchises to their leagues through league expansion. League expansion results in a significant payment by the expansion sports franchise ownership group to the league, which is then usually divided among the established sports franchises in the league. The expansion sports franchise grants the new franchisee the exclusive right to hold league games in a specified geographical area. Ancillary assets and rights are also transferred to the expansion sports franchise. As part of its sports franchise, the expansion sports franchise generally has an equal right to share in future league revenue. A major source of league revenue is revenue from national broadcasting rights and league sponsorship rights. In most instances, the expansion sports franchise obtains the same rights and obligations as the already established sports franchises in the league. This includes participation in league voting. An expansion draft is often included, in which the expansion sports franchise is able to obtain the rights to player contracts held by the established sports franchises in the league. In addition, league expansion often grants the new sports franchise additional draft picks in future player drafts. The two major asset categories transferred for tax purposes to the expansion sports franchise are: (1) the sports franchise intangible asset, and (2) the right to acquire player contracts from the established sports franchises in the sports league. Potential issues exist concerning whether additional intangible assets that are separable from the franchise intangible asset are also transferred from the league and the established sports franchises to the expansion sports franchise. There will typically be an expansion agreement between the league and the expansion sports franchise. As a general rule, both the expansion sports franchise and the established sports franchises are bound by the allocation of the expansion price among the asset components reflected in the expansion agreement. However, the Service is not bound by the expansion price allocation among the asset components reflected in the expansion agreement. In First Northwest Industries v. Commissioner, 70 T.C. 817, 843 (1978), rev'd on other grounds, 649 F.2d 707 (9th Cir. 1981) the Tax Court held the Service was not bound by the allocation of costs by the sports league and the expansion sports franchise.  11-1   Generally, what is addressed in Chapter 10 on the purchase and sale of a sports franchise also applies to new sports franchises created in a sports league expansion. Instead of reiterating what is addressed in Chapter 10, this chapter focuses on aspects unique to league expansion. AUDIT ISSUES 1. Whether the expansion agreement allocations among the assets transferred properly reflect the relative fair market values of the asset categories. Specific consideration of the IRC section 1056 player contract allocation provisions are warranted. Whether the residual allocation method of IRC section 1060 is properly applied in the expansion agreement allocations. Whether the existing sports franchises in the league and the expansion sports franchise used the expansion agreement purchase/sale price allocations in their respective tax returns. Whether the expansion sports franchise properly computed its basis in the assets acquired. Specific consideration of IRC section 1056 is warranted. Whether the established sports franchises properly computed their gains on the league expansion.  2.  3.  4.  5.  TAX LAW APPLICATION Established Sports Franchises Rev. Rul. 71-123, 1971-1 C.B. 227, addresses a professional football league expansion. The expansion agreement granting the new sports franchise provided that the expansion sports franchise was to pay a stated amount to the sports league. A portion of the payment was to be retained by the league, with the balance distributed among the league's established sports franchises. Under the expansion agreement, the new sports franchise made the payments in question as consideration for the assignment of three player contracts by each of the established sports franchises to the expansion sports franchise. The amount distributed to each of the established sports franchises exceeded the value of the three player contracts transferred. The Service concluded that the amount received by the established player contracts transferred to the expansion sports franchise were given in Rev. Rul. 67-380, 1967-2 C.B. 291. This resulted in IRC section 1245 ordinary income recapture to the established sports fr player contracts. sports franchises for their three taxed based on the guidance section 1231 gains and IRC anchises on the sale of their  11-2   The player contract amalgamation rule of IRC section 1245(a)(4), which is addressed in Chapter 10, does not apply in computing an existing sports franchise's IRC section 1245 gains on player contracts transferred to the expansion sports franchise. This is based on the legislative history behind IRC section 1245(a)(4), which indicates the player amalgamation rule only applies if a sports franchise, together with substantially all of its player contracts, is sold. S. Rep. No. 94-938, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 90 (1976), 1976-3 Vol. 3 C.B. 128, reflects ""The special recapture rules [IRC section 1245(a)(4)] would only apply in the case of the sale or exchange of the entire sports franchise and not in the case of the sale or exchange of individual player contracts.""2 Footnote 2 reflects ""The sale of an individual player contract will continue to be governed by the general recapture rule of sec. 1245."" Refer to Chapter 12 for additional guidance on the sale of individual player contracts. In Rev. Rul, 71-123, the Service also concluded that the amounts received by the existing sports franchises in excess of the amounts allocable to player contracts was received by them for their franchise property right. The Service held ""the new franchise is a valuable property right that was created by the old teams *** the grant of the franchise was the sale of a capital asset by the old teams to the new team."" Therefore, the gain attributable to the franchise property rights was held to be capital gain under IRC section 1222. In Rev. Rul. 71-583, 1971-2 C.B. 312, the Service addressed a similar situation. In conjunction with the league's expansion, an expansion team was established in the same geographical area as an existing league franchise. Because of this, the existing franchise was awarded a greater share of the expansion payment from the new sports franchise. This was due to the existing franchise's relinquishment of part of its exclusive right to host games within its geographical area. The Service concluded that even though the existing sports franchise received more than the league's other franchises (due to its greater relinquishment of property rights), the Service's ruling in Rev. Rul. 71-123 applies. The Service held that ""the amount received by the instant taxpayer for the relinquishment of its exclusive territorial rights is an amount received for the sale of a capital asset and resulted in a capital gain to the extent of the amount received."" [underlining added.] ""To the extent of the amount received"" is significant in that it reflects the established sports franchise has no tax basis in the relinquishment of part of its exclusive territorial rights which is part of the franchise intangible asset. This reflects the Service's position that the established sports franchises do not have a determinable tax basis in the portion of their franchise property rights transferred in a league expansion. Since they do not have a determinable tax basis in the portion of their franchise property rights transferred to the new sports franchise, the full amount allocated to their franchise property rights constitutes capital gains to the established sports franchises.  11-3   However, in First Northwest Industries v. Commissioner, 649 F.2d 707 (9th Cir. 1981), remanding 70 T.C. 817, 843 (1978), the Tax Court rejected the government's argument that the taxpayer did not have a tax basis in the franchise property rights transferred to an expansion sports franchise. In its April 26, 1979 Action on Decision, the Service stated ""The court [Tax Court] erred in holding that an existing team may offset expansion proceeds by a ratable portion of its franchise acquisition costs."" Whether the taxpayer was entitled to claim a tax basis in the franchise property rights was appealed to the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit concluded: ""A portion of the remaining 'basic nonterminable rights' was transferred.9 The Tax Court made no attempt, however, to determine the cost of these rights. Only if their cost can be satisfactorily ascertained may taxpayer subtract its basis in the portion transferred.10 See United States v. Laird, 556 F.2d 1224 (5th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1014, 98 S.Ct. 729, 54 L. Ed. 2d 758 (1978) (permitting amortization of player contracts because they had ascertainable value and limited useful life); Ralph W. Fullerton Co. v. United States, 550 F.2d 548 (9th Cir. 1977) (refusing to permit loss deduction for lost accounts where cost of individual accounts could not be satisfactorily ascertained). All of the 'basic nonterminable rights' acquired by taxpayer derive value from the league's goodwill, and sale of new teams is a 'portioning out' of NBA goodwill. See Rev. Rul. 71-583. The critical question on remand will be whether there is sufficient evidence to allocate the $1,000,000 cost between those rights which were and those which were not transferred. Recognizing that they all are related to goodwill does not resolve the question. On remand, the Tax Court will determine whether there is sufficient evidence to ascertain the cost of the rights which were transferred. If there is, taxpayer may subtract its basis."" Footnote number 9 reflects the rights in question, to ""include the right to share in national broadcasting revenues, all-star and playoff game proceeds, expansion proceeds, and proceeds of NBA promotional and advertising activities."" As addressed above in Rev. Rul. 71-123 and Rev. Rul. 71-583, the Service's position remains that the franchise property rights transferred in a league expansion (1) do not have an ascertainable value separate from the retained franchise property rights, and (2) do not have a determinable useful life.  Expansion Sports Franchises 11-4   The same general tax provisions that apply to the purchase of an existing sports franchise also apply to the purchase of an expansion sports franchise. Refer to Chapter 10 for additional guidance on the tax treatment given to the acquisition of a sports franchise through league expansion. It has been asserted that IRC section 1056 does not apply to the creation of a new sports franchise via league expansion, because it does not constitute the sale or exchange of an existing sports franchise. The government's position is that IRC section 1056 applies to the creation of a new sports franchise as part of a league expansion. The above coverage of Rev. Rul. 71-123 and 71-583 reflects how the Service treats the creation of a new sports franchise in a league expansion as the sale or exchange of player contracts and relinquishment of part of each of the established teams' franchise property rights. In addition, S. Rep. No. 94-938, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 90 (1976), 1976-3 C. B. 128, in addressing IRC section 1056 specifically states: "" The committee amendment provides that in the case of the sale or exchange of a sports franchise (or the creation of a new franchise) the amount of consideration allocated to a player contract by the transferee shall not exceed the sum of the adjusted basis of the contract in the hands of the transferor immediately before the transfer and gain (if any recognized by the transferor on the transfer of the player contract. [underlining added]"" Accordingly, just as the provisions of IRC section 1056 apply to the purchase/sale of an existing sports franchise, the provisions of IRC section 1056 also apply to the creation of a new sports franchise via league expansion. The IRC section 1056 provisions are addressed in detail in Chapter 10. EXAMPLE -- LEAGUE EXPANSION The successful sports league decides to expand by one sports franchise. The expansion sports franchise purchase/sale price is established to be $100 million. In addition to the numerous sports franchise property rights transferred on the awarding of the expansion franchise, the expansion franchise is entitled to acquire 3 player contracts from each of the 10 established sports franchises in the Successful sports league. A Successful sports league committee is to negotiate with the expansion sports franchise's representatives on the fair market value of each of 30 player contracts to be transferred to the expansion sports franchise.  11-5   Each of the 10 established sports franchises is to receive an amount equal to the agreed on fair market value of its 3 player contracts transferred to the expansion franchise. Since the total fair market value of all 30 player contracts is anticipated to be substantially less than $100 million, the expansion agreement provides that the balance of the $100 million ($100 million less the agreed on fair market value of the 30 player contracts transferred) is to be distributed equally among the ten established sports franchises. The expansion agreement provides that $10 million of the balance of the $100 million not allocated to player contracts is allocated to XYZ intangible asset. The remaining balance of the $100 million is to then be allocated to the sports franchise property right. The sports league committee and expansion sports franchise subsequently agree that the fair market value of the 30 player contracts transferred to the expansion sports franchise is $50 million. Accordingly, under the expansion agreement: --$50 million is allocated to player contracts, --$10 million is allocated to the XYZ intangible, and --$40 million is allocated to the sports franchise property rights. ABC, one of the 10 established Successful sports league franchises, had its 3 player contracts transferred to the expansion sports franchise valued under the agreement at $6 million ($6 million of the total $50 million fair market value of the 30 player contracts is attributable to ABC's 3 player contracts). Accordingly, under the expansion agreement, ABC received $6 million for its player contracts, $1 million (1/10 of $10 million) for its share of the XYZ intangible, and $4 million (1/10 of $40 million) for its sports franchise property rights. ABC's tax consequences include a likely $1 million capital gain on the XYZ intangible and a $4 million capital gain on the franchise property rights. If ABC claimed a tax basis in either the XYZ intangible or its franchise property rights, then this would appear to be an examination issue. Because the player amalgamation rule of IRC section 1245(a)(4) does not apply, the computation of ABC's IRC section 1245 recapture gains on the 3 player contracts is computed individually for each player contract. The following summarizes for each of ABC's 3 player contracts (1) the sales price (fair market value) under the expansion agreement, (2) ABC's adjusted basis, (3) ABC's total gain, and (4) ABC's prior player contract amortization.  11-6   Fair Market Value  ABC's Adjusted Basis  ABC's Gain  ABC's Prior Year Amortization  Strong Player Contract Fast Player Contract Big Player Contract Totals  $3 M $2 M $1 M $6 M  $1 M $1 M $1 M $3 M  $2 M $1 M 0 $3 M  $1 M $2 M $1 M $4 M  $1 million of ABC's Strong Player Contract gain of $2 million is IRC section 1245 recapture income, and the $1 million balance is an IRC section 1231 gain. ABC's Fast Player Contract gain of $1 million is all IRC section 1245 recapture income. ABC has no gain on its Big player contract. Accordingly, ABC's player contract gains are summarized as follows: IRC Sec. 1245 Recapture Strong Player Contract Fast Player Contract Big Player Contract Totals $1 M $1 M 0 $2 M IRC Sec. 1231 Gain $1 M 0 0 $1 M ABC's Total Gain $2 M $1 M 0 $3 M  If the player contract amalgamation rule was improperly used, the entire $3 million gain on player contracts would all be IRC section 1245 recapture income since the prior year amortization on all 3 player contracts exceeded the $3 million total gain. Under IRC section 1056, the new sports franchise's tax basis in the 3 player contracts acquired from ABC is $6 million. This consists of ABC's adjusted basis in the 3 contracts of $3 million plus ABC's gain on the 3 player contracts of $3 million. Based on the expansion agreement and the application of IRC section 1056, the expansion sports franchise's tax basis is: Player Contracts $ XX million (see comment below) The XYZ intangible asset $ 10 million The franchise intangible asset $ 40 million Total Basis $ 50 million plus $ XX million The expansion sports franchise's tax basis includes its player contract basis amount of $6 11-7   million from ABC's 3 player contracts plus its player contract basis amounts (under IRC section 1056) from each of the 9 other established sports franchises in the Successful sports league. The IRC section 1056 basis amount in the 3 contracts transferred from ABC equal the fair market value assigned to ABC's player contracts because ABC reported (recognized) the realized gain on each of its 3 player contracts. This is not necessarily the case for the player contracts received from the 9 other established sports franchises. This will not be the case to the extent that the other established sports franchises have a tax loss, or realized but unrecognized gains on any of their player contracts transferred to the expansion sports franchise. If the expansion sports franchise claims amortization on the XYZ intangible, this would appear to be an examination issue. EXAMINATION TECHNIQUES Documents and information that should be obtained in developing sports league expansion purchase/sale issues include: 1. 2. the expansion agreement, all league and expansion sports franchise correspondence on the expansion agreement negotiations, understandings, etc., all valuation studies conducted, the expansion sports franchise agreement, the required information previously furnished by the established league sports franchises to the expansion sports franchise and the Service in accordance with IRC section 1060(b), and IRC section 1056(c) and the regulations, and your taxpayer's tax return schedules and workpapers on the league expansion purchase/sale.  3. 4. 5.  6.  Refer to Chapter 10 for coverage of examination techniques common to both a purchase/sale of an existing sports franchise and the purchase/sale of an expansion sports franchise. As noted in Chapter 10, examination changes to the purchase/sale agreement are usually ""whipsaw"" adjustments that have tax consequences to both parties in the purchase/sale of an established sports franchise. The ""whipsaw"" issue tax consequences of a reallocation in a sports league expansion agreement can be significant.  11-8   For example, consider the NFL which had 28 sports franchises prior to its expansion in 1993. An examination issue on one of the NFL's 31 sports franchises, in which the expansion agreement allocation is changed, has ""whipsaw"" issue potential for the other 30 teams in the sports league. Accordingly, the national ISP sports team is considering a requirement that before a sports franchise league expansion agreement allocation is challenged during an examination, the examiner must first coordinate the potential reallocation issue with the ISP sports team.  11-9   This page intentionally left blank.   Chapter 12 SALES AND EXCHANGES OF INDIVIDUAL PLAYER CONTRACTS  INDUSTRY PRACTICE Occasionally, a sports franchise will sell a player contract. However, more frequently, a sports franchise will trade one or more player contracts for player contracts owned by another sports franchise in the league. Future draft picks are often included in these trades. The special provisions under IRC section 1245(a)(4) and IRC section 1056 for the transfer of player contracts on the purchase/sale of a sports franchise are addressed in Chapter 10. Transfers of player contracts in a sports league expansion are addressed in Chapter 11. This chapter addresses the tax treatment of player contract trades among established sports franchises in a sports league not associated with the purchase/sale of an established or expansion sports franchise. AUDIT ISSUES Potential audit issues for purchases, sales, or trades of player contracts not connected with the purchase/sale of an established or expansion sports franchise include: 1. Whether the seller or transferor (player trades) properly reported the amount of IRC section 1245 and IRC section 1231 gains. Whether the purchaser or transferee (player trades) properly computed its tax basis under IRC section 1012 and IRC section 1031in the player contracts acquired.  2.  TAX LAW APPLICATION Gains and Losses on Player Contracts Given Up Player contracts constitute intangible personal property. As addressed in Chapter 9, if the player contract has a useful life of more than a year, it must be capitalized and amortized over the life of the player contract under IRC section 167. Gains and losses on the sale or exchange of player contracts held by the sports franchise for more than a year constitute IRC section 1231 gains and losses. However, to the extent of amortization claimed under IRC section 167, player contract gains are subject to IRC section 1245 ordinary income recapture.  12-1   In general, player contract trades qualify for IRC section 1031 nonrecognition treatment for like kind exchanges. Gains recognized on player contract trades are limited to the amount of boot and, if applicable, non-qualifying property received by the transferor. Rev. Rul. 67-380, 1967-2 C.B. 291 and Rev. Rul. 71-137, 1971-1 C.B. 104, specifically address these general provisions for sports franchise player contracts. IRC section 1031(a) provides that no gain or loss is recognized if property used in a trade or business is exchanged solely for like kind property. Under IRC section 1031(b), any realized gain is recognized to the extent money or property that is not like kind is received in the exchange. Treas. Reg. section 1.1031(b)-1(c) provides: Consideration received in the form of an assumption of liabilities (or a transfer subject to a liability) is to be treated as ""other property or money"" for the purposes of section 1031(b). Where, on an exchange described in section 1031(b), each party to the exchange either assumes a liability of the other party or acquires property subject to a liability; then, in determining the amount of ""other property or money"" for purposes of section 1031(b), consideration given in the form of an assumption of liabilities (or a receipt of property subject to a liability) shall be offset against consideration received in the form of an assumption of liabilities (or a transfer subject to a liability). See section 1.1031(d)-2, examples (1) and (2). To the extent of IRC section 1245 recapture, gains recognized on player trades are ordinary gains. The IRC section 1245(a)(4) amalgamation rule for player contracts (addressed in chapter 10) only applies to player contracts transferred in connection with the purchase/sale of an entire sports franchise. Accordingly, the IRC section 1245(a)(4) amalgamation rule does not apply to the sale or trade of two or more player contracts by a sports franchise to another sports franchise. This means the IRC section 1245 recapture provisions are applied on an individual player contract basis versus an aggregate player contract basis. Accordingly, the tax treatment to the transferor on the sale or exchange of a player contract is the same as the tax treatment given the sale or exchange of tangible personal property, such as machinery, used in any trade or business. In the sports franchise's tax year in which a player is cut, the sports franchise is entitled to an ordinary deduction under IRC section 165 for its adjusted basis in the player contract. Generally, a sports franchise does not have an ascertainable tax basis in future draft picks given up in a player trade (treated as an inseparable part of the franchise intangible asset). Accordingly, in determining the sports franchise's basis in player contracts acquired in trades, a zero adjusted basis should be used for future draft picks given up in the trade. To the extent a gain on a future draft pick given up in a trade is recognized under IRC section 1031, the gain is an IRC section 1231 gain. 12-2   A potential emerging issue, that future draft picks and existing player contracts do not constitute like kind property for purposes of IRC section 1031, is addressed at the end of this chapter. Tax Basis in Acquired Player Contracts If a sports franchise purchases a player contract, the cost basis provisions of IRC Section 1012 apply. If a sports franchise acquires a player contract in a player trade, the basis provisions of IRC section 1031 apply. In a player trade the sports franchise's basis in the player contract(s) acquired is: 1. 2. 3. 4. its adjusted basis in the player contracts given up in the trade, less the player contract liabilities transferred, plus player contract liabilities assumed in the exchange, plus any gain recognized due to the receipt of boot.  IRC section 1056, which is addressed in Chapter 10, only applies to player contracts transferred in connection with the purchase/sale of an entire sports franchise. Accordingly, the IRC section 1056 sports franchise buyer basis rules do not apply to the sale or trade of two or more player contracts among sports franchises. A sports franchise acquiring future draft picks in a player trade will have a tax basis in the draft picks acquired based on the application of IRC section 1031. The sports franchise's tax basis in the future draft pick becomes part of the sports franchise's capitalized cost basis in the player contract signed as a result of the draft pick. Accordingly, except for the future draft pick basis ""wrinkle"" addressed above, the tax basis rules on the acquisition of player contracts is the same as the tax basis rules on the purchase or exchange of tangible personal property, such as machinery, used in any trade or business.  EXAMPLE -- PLAYER CONTRACT TRADE Sports franchise A and sports franchise B are unrelated calendar year TEFRA partnerships. Sports franchise A trades the player contract of athlete Strong (Strong player contract) for sports franchise's B player contract of athlete Fast (Fast player contract) on January 1, 1996.  12-3   Sport franchise A's Strong player contract was entered into on January 1, 1994. On January 1, 1996, there are 2 years remaining on the original 4 year contract. A's original amortizable basis in the Strong player contract was $800,000, and A claimed $200,000 of amortization for the year 1994 and $200,000 for the year 1995. Accordingly, A's adjusted basis in the Strong player contract on January 1, 1996, is $400,000. The payments remaining on the Strong Player contract on January 1, 1996, are $300,000. Sports franchise B's Fast player contract was entered into on January 1, 1995. On January 1, 1996, there are 3 years remaining on the original 4-year contract. B's original amortizable basis in the Fast player contract was $600,000, and B claimed $150,000 of amortization for the year 1995. Accordingly, B's adjusted basis in the Fast player contract is $450,000 on January 1, 1996. The payments remaining on the Fast Player contract on January 1, 1996, are $400,000. Due to the team needs of market values of the two performance) on January other property considerat Fast player. both sports franchises, and taking into account the player contracts (based on Strong's and Fast's prior 1, 1996, sports franchise A agrees to an even trade ion by either A or B) of its Strong player for sports relative fair season (no cash or franchises B's  Sports franchise A and sports franchise B agree that on January 1, 1996, the fair market value of the Strong player contract is $500,000, and the fair market value of the Fast player contract is $600,000. The gain computed by sports franchise A and sports franchise B is determined as follows: Sports Franchise A Consideration Received: FMV of Fast Player Contract Strong Contract Liability Transferred FMV of Strong Player Contract Fast Contract Liability Transferred Total Consideration Received Less Adjusted Basis In Contract Transferred Gain Realized Gain Recognized $900,000 $600,000 Sports Franchise B  $300,000 $500,000  $400,000 $900,000  $400,000 $500,000 $ 0  $450,000 $450,000 $100,000  12-4   Sports franchise A does not have a gain recognized because it received no boot. It received no boot because the player contract liability assumed of $400,000 exceeded its player contract liability transferred of $300,000. Sports franchise B has a recognized gain of $100,000 since this is the amount of boot received. Sports franchise B received $100,000 of boot in the exchange because the player contract liability it transferred of $400,000 exceeded the player contract liability it assumed of $300,000. Due to the $150,000 amortization claimed in 1995, all of B's recognized gain of $100,000 is IRC section 1245 recapture ordinary income. Sport franchise A's and sports franchise B's tax basis in the player contracts acquired in the trade are computed as follows: Sports Franchise A Adjusted Basis In Contract Given Up Less liability Transferred Plus Liability Assumed Plus Gain Recognized Tax Basis in Contract Acquired Sports Franchise B  $400,000 (300,000) 400,000 0 $500,000  $450,000 (400,000) 300,000 100,000 $450,000  Sport franchise A's tax basis in its newly acquired Fast player contract is $500,000 as computed above. This is comprised of its $400,000 adjusted basis in the Strong player contract it traded to B plus the additional $100,000 player contract liability A assumed in the trade. A amortizes its $500,000 adjusted basis in its newly acquired Fast player contract over the three years remaining on the Fast player contract. Sport franchise B's tax basis in its newly acquired Strong Player contract is $450,000 as computed above. This is comprised of its $450,000 adjusted basis in the Fast player contract it traded to sports franchise A less the net $100,000 contract liability relieved of on the trade plus the $100,000 gain it recognized on the trade. Sports franchise B amortizes its $450,000 adjusted basis in its newly acquired Strong player contract over the two years remaining on the Strong player contract. EXAMINATION TECHNIQUES Documents and information that should be obtained include: 1. A copy of all player contract sale or trade agreements for the tax year under examination.  12-5   2.  The sports franchise's workpapers and schedules on the computations of gains and losses for the tax year under examination. This includes workpapers and schedules which reconcile with the return Form 4797 amounts. For the prior, current, and subsequent tax years: a. the sports franchise's schedules and workpapers reflecting: 1) the player contracts owned by the sports franchise, 2) the sports franchise's tax basis in each player contract, and 3) the useful life used by the sports franchise for each player contract, b. to the extent not included in (a), copies of the schedules and workpapers used to compute player contract amortization. This should include any schedules and workpapers necessary to reconcile this with the total player contract amortization amount reflected on return Form 4562.  3.  Gains and Losses on Player Contracts Given Up For player trades, focus on the player trades in which your sports franchise received cash or other taxable boot (such as player contract liabilities given up in excess of player contract liabilities assumed) in the IRC section 1031 exchange. Detailed guidance on the computation of the IRC section 1231 and 1245 gains on player contracts is not addressed in this guide because it is the same as for sales and exchanges of tangible personal property by any business taxpayer. For general guidance, refer to the coverage given earlier in this chapter under tax law application. IRC section 165 abandonment losses on players cut shortly after the player's contract was acquired may warrant consideration. If the player contract was acquired in connection with the acquisition of the sports franchise (either the purchase of an existing sports franchise or an expansion sports franchise), consider the basis allocated to player contract in the acquisition. To obtain IRC section 165 loss deductions, a new sports franchise may allocate more of the purchase price than warranted to players contracts of players it plans on cutting. A common examination technique is to analyze the taxpayer's prior and subsequent year's player contract listings, depreciation, and amortization schedules. Player contracts on the prior or current year's schedule that are omitted from the current or subsequent year's schedule should be reconciled to the sports franchise's player contract gain and loss return schedules  12-6   Tax Basis in Acquired Player Contracts Detailed guidance on the computation of the tax basis under IRC section 1012 and 1031 on player contracts is the same as for tangible personal property of other business taxpayers. For general guidance, refer to the coverage given earlier in this chapter under tax law application. In player contracts acquired in a multiple player contract trade, you may want to ascertain that more basis than warranted is not allocated to the player contracts acquired with the shortest useful lives. POTENTIAL EMERGING ISSUE ON FUTURE DRAFT PICKS The coverage given above on IRC section 1031 exchanges assumes that a player contract and a future draft pick are like kind property. There may be a potential emerging issue on whether this is, in fact, the case. This potential emerging issue impacts whether the trade of a single future draft pick for a single existing player contract can qualify for IRC section 1031 nonrecognition. For multiple future draft and player contract trades, it impacts whether other property (nonlike kind) is received in the exchange. Treas. Reg. section 1.1031(a)-2(c)(1) provides the general rule that exchanges of intangible personal property qualify under IRC section 103 *** only if the exchanges of properties are of a like kind. No like classes are provided for these properties. Whether intangible personal property is of a like kind to other intangible personal property generally depends on the nature or character of the rights involved (e.g., a patent or a copyright) and also on the nature or character of the underlying property to which the intangible personal property relates. Treas. Reg. section 1.1031(a)-2(c)(2) provides ""The goodwill or going concern value of a business is not of a like kind to the goodwill or going concern value of another business."" The underlying property for both a future draft pick and a current player contract is the future or current contractual services of a professional athlete. However, while a sports franchise has a separable ascertainable value and basis in player contracts (separable from goodwill, going concern value, and the franchise intangible asset), this does not appear to be the case for future draft picks. It appears that future draft picks of a sports franchise are inseparable from its franchise intangible asset. Accordingly, it appears that future draft picks and existing player contracts do not constitute like kind property for purposes of IRC section 1031.

In baseball, the box seats are behind home plate, whereas in football, the box seats are around the 50 yard line. Draft system for sports franchises to bid on college players. In general, the teams with the worst records select earlier than teams with better records. The rules for drafting players among the leagues vary, in some leagues the number of players drafted are limited, whereas in the baseball there is no limitation. Draft system whereby expansion sports franchises obtain players from the existing sports franchises in their league.  College Draft  Expansion Draft  Expansion Sports Franchise  The addition of a new sports franchise to the league through league expansion (increase in the number of sports franchises in the league). A farm team is where the big league clubs ""grow"" players. Skills are refined and worked on, and then as a player develops, he moves up through the system until he reaches the major league level. Most big league teams have at least 4 minor league farm teams: AAA being the highest, followed by AA, then at least one, and sometimes two A clubs. If there are two A clubs, one is usually high and one is low. There are also various short season, winter leagues, etc., where players can go to retain their skill level year round. Free agency in its purest form, is a status in which the rights to a player's athletic services are not owned by a sports franchise and may be shopped around by the player in a quest for the most attractive bid. Before 1970, many player contracts contained a reserve clause which bound a player to a team for life unless a team chose to sell the contract.  Farm Team  Free Agency  Salary Cap System A salary cap system establishes an overall wage framework that provides both a maximum amount of payroll allowed for each sports franchise and a minimum payroll floor that each sports franchise must pay. Salary caps are generally expressed as a percentage of gross average sports franchise revenues for the league.  G-1   Sports Franchise  A sports franchise in a professional sports league generally includes the right to: 1. be the sports league's sole provider of the professional sport within a given geographical area, be protected by league rules and regulations from intra-league business competition, share in the proceeds of future league expansion, share equally with other sports franchises in the league in the revenue from all single network television contracts negotiated on a league-wide basis, sell local broadcast rights for preseason television and for both preseason and regular season radio, share with other sports franchises in the league in revenue from national merchandising, sell programs and advertising space therein at home games, participate in the college draft and the expansion draft (for expansion sports franchises), and share in the league's goodwill.  2.  3. 4.  5.  6.  7. 8.  9.  Right of First Refusal  A right of first refusal permits a sports franchise to match any offer made to one of its current players by another sports franchise and thus retain the player's services. The right of first refusal generally applies only to restricted free agents, that is; for example players having a specified amount of limited experience.  Uniform Player Contract  The major sports leagues require that all players sign a uniform player contract that contains provisions prescribed by the league.  G-2"

The Subcommittee was chaired by Daniel H. Garnick, Bureau of Economic Analysis, Department of Commerce.  The members of the subcommittee are the authors of this report, their names are listed below.        The first portion of this report provides a review of major administrative report files pertaining to individuals and to businesses.  Major statistical uses of administrative records are outlined, including: (1) direct use of the records to obtain statistics and to supplement existing data via expanding coverage or content; and (2) technical uses of the data for constructing sampling frames, quality control, improving on procedures, and data evaluation.  New developments in data from business establishment reporting and a number of potential uses of administrative records for data linkage are described.  Technical problems in the statistical use of administrative records, including coverage, comparability, error and timing of data are discussed.  the final section of the report covers various in accessing administrative records for statistical purposes.       While much statistical use of administrative records is currently made in Federal agencies, this report is intended to inform managerial and technical staffs of the vast potential as well as difficulties entailed in augmenting current uses of administrative records for statistical purposes.  The Office of    Statistical Policy and Standards hopes to organize, with the help of Subcommittee members, seminars with Federal employers to disseminate the findings of this report. The implementation of the recommendations in report will be explored by the Office of Statistical Policy and Standards.                         Members of the Subcommittee on Statistical                   Uses Of Administrative Records.

administrative records grew rapidly during  the 1970's, in large part as a response to legislative requirements  for timely data to use in the distribution of Federal funds to  State and local governments.  The principal reason for increasing  reliance on administrative records for statistical data is the  availability of administrative records which can be used to obtain  small area data at minimal cost and without increasing respondent  burden.  And cost is likely to be an increasingly important factor  in the statistical use of administrative records in the 1980's.  Although statistical use of administrative records is growing, many  unanswered questions remain concerning the quality of statistics  derived from administrative records.  From a statistical point of  view, the standards of quality and consistency in administrative  data collection and processing programs are frequently inadequate.   Difficulties in accessing administrative records, moreover, often  inhibit the efficient joint use of particular administrative record  sets with other administrative and statistical records in meeting  statistical needs.  Improved statistics from administrative records  will require modification in data collection and processing  procedures, modification of laws and administrative procedures  relating to access to records, and increased resources for  evaluating and upgrading the quality of administrative records for  statistical use.  While the costs of improving administrative  records for statistical applications can be significant, they will  often be substantially less than alternatives requiring expanded  censuses and surveys.  And in many instances both administrative  and statistical programs could benefit from reduced respondent  burdens and data processing costs obtainable by applying more  efficient statistical tools in the collection and use of  administrative records.       To solve problem impeding efficient statistical use of  administrative records, coordinated treatment of a variety of  interagency issues is needed to serve as a counterweight to the  decentralized operations of Federal information collection  programs.  In addressing these issues, the Subcommittee on  Statistical Uses of Administrative Records has divided its  recommendations into dim sections concerned with:       A.   Identifying and formulating solutions for common problems            related to statistical standards for administrative            information programs.       B.   Identifying and meeting various problems related to            access to administrative record systems.       C.   Identifying collection programs and research activities            requiring government-wide coordination and support.       Individual recommendations are in some cases accompanied by  examples of subcommittee findings which illustrate the need for the  recommendation.                             A. Statistical Standards          There is a need for greater standardization in the procedures  for collecting and presenting data based on administrative records  in order to provide a basis for reducing duplicate collection  efforts and improving the quality and consistency of the  information that is collected.     Recommendation 1.   Common identifiers should be used whenever  possible in collecting information Pertaining to the sow  individuals or organizations.       The capability for linking information from a variety of  sources is central in making efficient statistical use of  administrative records.  This capability depends on both  appropriate access to administrative records (see Section B) and  consistency among administrative and statistical agencies in  procedures for identifying respondents or reporting units.  The  subcommittee noted, for example, that household surveys could be  used more effectively in conjunction with administrative records if  social security numbers and related identifying information were  collected in selected surveys.  This would permit linking detailed  socioeconomic information from surveys with longitudinal records  from administrative sources concerned, for example, with employment  or medical histories.  Such linkages are performed in various areas  of social research including specialized fields such as  epidemiology.  In business data collection programs, employer  identification numbers should be supplemented with a common set of  identifiers for the individual establishments of large businesses.   Selected administrative record data for multi-establishment  businesses could then be linked more readily to economic census and  survey data for purposes of improving geographical and industrial  analysis of economic activity                                      1                 Recommendation 2.   The quality of administrative records to be  used for statistical purposes should be evaluated systematically to  determine the appropriateness of the records for the proposed use.       The quality of administrative record files, including such  factors as the type and quality of identification on the file and  the completeness, definitional suitability, and quality of  individual or organizational characteristics on the file. will  determine the appropriateness of the use of the files for  particular statistical applications.  For example, in matching  applications the completeness of the coverage of the administrative  record files and the accuracy of identifiers will determine whether  a high match rate will be achieved.  Similarly, in such  applications as the distribution of Federal funds to State and  local governments. completeness and accuracy of administrative  records, will determine the extent to which estimates derived from  these records may serve as complements as well as substitutes for  census and survey data.  Recommendation 3.   Consistent procedures should be used in  administrative and statistical data collection efforts for defining  reporting units, identifying and coding reporting unit  characteristics, and developing standards  for data tabulation.       When common reporting units are not appropriate there should  still be efforts to ensure that the more detailed reporting unit  breakdowns of one program can be readily combined into more  aggregative units used in other programs.  The subcommittee noted,  for example, a lack of congruity in the definition of companies  filing corporate income tax returns and companies reporting for  statistical Purposes to the Census Bureau.  The subcommittee also  found a particularly serious problem of inconsistency between  ""establishment"" reporting plans associated with administrative  programs and the definitions of establishments of multiunit  companies used in the Census Bureau's Standard Statistical  Establishment List.  The Social Security payroll tax program, for  example, involves a voluntary establishment reporting plan with  company self-identification of reporting units on a basis differing  from SSEL definitions.  The need for consistent reporting  requirements that eliminate duplicate and other unnecessary  reporting is highlighted by the fact that the compliance of large  companies with the SSA establishment reporting plan and other  voluntary statistical programs has been deteriorating in recent  years.       Problems of inadequate procedures for coding reporting unit  characteristics have been emphasized by the subcommittee in such  areas as geographic coding and the industrial coding of business  establishments.  Reliable and detailed geographic coding in  administrative record systems, in particular. has become  increasingly important as administrative records have received  wider application in preparing statistics for use in distributing  Federal funds to State and local governments.  For many purposes  geographic coding is required at the municipal level, but substate  coding in administrative record systems tends to be restricted to  county identifiers.  The lack of current economic information by  municipality has hindered effective planning and economic policy  making at the Federal as well as State and local level.  For  business reporting systems, the SSEL coding system can provide a  basis for obtaining consistency in both geographic and industrial  coding.       The need for consistent standards for data tabulation have  recently been highlighted by efforts to assemble a data base for  analyzing small business policy issues.  These efforts have been  hampered by inconsistencies among various administrative and  statistical programs in the ways in which data are identified and  tabulated by size of business.                                  B. Access          A central issue related to meeting the differing requirements  of data for administrative vs. statistical applications efficiently  involves the problem of obtaining an appropriate balance between  the need to access individual records and the right to privacy as  well as consideration of confidentiality of responding persons and  businesses.  Resolution of this issue requires that distinctions be  made both in terms of the uses to be made of records and the types  of reporting units and information involved.  Recommendation 4.   Natural persons should be distinguished from  organizations and other entities when developing standards and  practices of record confidentiality.       The need for confidentiality is not the same for businesses  and other organizations as for natural persons.  Often,, the need  for access to selected information pertaining to businesses  requires interagency transfer of information about organizations.   The subcommittee has found, for example, instances in which Federal  a#coca purchase privately produced lists of businesses containing  generally available information, such as name and address of the  businesses, because access to more complete and reliable lists such  as the Census Bureau's SSEL has been excessively restricted.  The  subcommittee is not persuaded that these restrictions are  reasonable or necessary.  Recommendation 5.   Legislation and administrative procedures  should be modified to make comprehensive Federal lists of  businesses and organizations, such as the                                      2                 Census Bureau's Standard Statistical Establishment List and SSA's  employer listing, more readily available for statistical uses.       Legislation has been drafted to make the SSEL available to  Federal agencies for statistical purposes.  Passage of the proposed  legislation could aid in reducing the duplication and costs, and  the attendant differences in definition and coverage resulting when  independently developed lists are maintained.  SSA's listing of  employers is compiled from the applications for employer numbers  required of employers of workers covered by Social Security, now  virtually the entire workforce.  Availability of this list as a  statistical sampling frame has been closed by application of the  Tax Reform Act of 1976.  Recommendation 6.   For natural persons. the principles of  ""functional separation"" developed by the Privacy Protection Study  Commission, the White House Privacy Initiative, and the President's  Statistical Reorganization Project should be applied in  distinguishing records to be used for administrative (and  enforcement) purposes from records to be used for statistical  purposes.       Functional separation will establish two discrete categories  of information according to the statistical or administrative and  enforcement functions to which the information is assigned.  The  separate category of statistical information- can be freely used  and transferred with individual identifiers intact for statistical  purposes.  Between the two categories, information that can be  uniquely associated with subject individuals flows only one way,  into the statistical category.  The flow from the statistical  category into other uses must be in a form or under conditions that  prevent unique association.  When administrative records are the  initial information source, the resultant copies or extracts which  have been incorporated into statistical files may not be  subsequently used in individually identifiable form for  administrative or enforcement purposes.'  Recommendation 7.   Particular legal and administrative barriers to  access to administrative records for statistical use should be  identified and eliminated for records pertaining to both natural  persons and organizations.       The subcommittee, for example. has found limitations on access  to IRS data imposed under Section 6103 of the Tax Reform Act of  1976 to be excessively restrictive to statistical uses of the data.   In this connection it can be noted that the Internal Revenue  Service has denied other Federal agencies access to Taxpayer  Compliance Measurement Program data files for 1976 and subsequent  years.  In addition, the Tax Reform Act has prevented the Social  Security Administration from supplying the Bureau of Economic  Analysis with post- 1975 Continuous Work History Sample Files  needed to continue a long-standing cooperative program to use and  improve this important statistical data base.             C. Other Government-Wide Program Coordination and Support             In order to maximize the usefulness of administrative record  systems, it will be necessary to identify on a government-wide  basis those data collection programs, as well as research  initiatives, which need interagency support.  Further the needs of  data users should be considered in designing statistical series  based on administrative records.  Recommendation 8.   Procedures for planning and setting budget  priorities should be developed to ensure that agency and program-  specific budget allocations are responsive to those interagency  data needs that are met most effectively through the specific  programs under review.       Many administrative programs are not explicitly budgeted for  supplying those general-purpose statistical needs which could be  met efficiently through statistical use of administrative records.   The subcommittee has found, for example, that geographic and  industrial data quality in the Social Security Administration's  Continuous Work History Sample has been declining because the data  have few applications for internal SSA programs and therefore  receive low priority in the agency budgeting process.  Geographic  and industrial data from the CWHS, however, are very important for  outside data users.  And they will become even more important if  administrative records are called on to play a central role in  providing intercensal estimates.  In planning alternatives to a  mid-decade census there should be careful cost-benefit analysis of  different approaches involving various combinations of survey and  administrative record data sources.  Recommendation 9.   As recommended by the President's Statistical  Reorganization Project, efficient statistical tools should be  applied in information collection programs extending well beyond  the confines of the principal statistical agencies.       Statistics can contribute techniques for improving design of  forms. both to improve quality of response on administrative forms,  and to improve the multi-purpose utility of the information  provided.  Development and extension of such statistical techniques  as scientific sampling. record matching, and synthetic estimation  can be used effectively to economize on the amount of information  that needs to be collected, thereby reducing paperwork burdens and  budgetary costs associated with administrative as well as  statistical data collection programs.                                      3                 Many administrative record data collection  programs have lagged  well behind the ""state of the art"" in the application of  statistical tools, and modernization of programs is badly needed.  Recommendation 10.  To obtain statistical data. increased use  should be made of matches between sample surveys and administrative  files.  Samples based on linkageS among administrative record  systems also should be encouraged for statistical purposes.       The subcommittee has investigated the statistical uses of  linking of administrative record files with sample survey data. as  well as with samples from other administrative records.  The  subcommittee endorses the use of matching to obtain statistical  data based on the combination of administrative records and sample  surveys.  The analytic potential of obtaining expanded. more  detailed data bases through successful matching is sufficiently  great that complicated procedures are often worth the effort.   However, for each specific program proposing to use linkage s to  obtain statistical data. it is necessary to examine the costs and  benefits to the program to determine whether the match should be  performed.       The case studies in Chapter VI illustrate potential uses of  administrative records for important statistical programs'. each  case study has specific goals, applications, and advantages.  Mc  combined use of administrative record files and sample survey data  for linkage programs may be effective for a variety of masons.  including that: (1) respondent burden may be reduced while  estimates of subpopulation characteristics are improved and data  accuracy is assessed (see SIPP case study), (2) data which are  difficult for a survey respondent to provide may be obtained from  administrative record files (see LASS case study). (3) improved  counts of population from the 1980 Census may be obtained in a  cost-effective manner (see Nonhousehold Sources Program case  study), and (4) estimates of coverage of population for States and  selected subgroups of the population based on the 1980 Census my be  obtained (see case study on IRS/SSA/HCFA matched with CPS and  Census).  Recommendation 11.  The provision o  f services to users should be  recognized as a statistical program function to optimize the  availability of statistical information in Federal.  State and  local government and in the private sector, and to give the Federal  system the benefit of feedback from users in planning statistical  programs based on administrative records.       A major obstacle to encouraging statistical use of ad-  ministrative records is the lack of knowledge (both inside and  outside the Federal Government) about the information in these  records and their coverage and quality.  The American Statistics  Index provides a comprehensive list of published statistics from  administrative and survey sources, but information on the quality  and availability of unpublished data, particularly from  administrative records, is seriously deficient.  Centralized  information is needed to make existing data more readily accessible  to potential users and to help in identifying unnecessary  duplication in data collection programs.  Promising recent  initiatives in this area include a Small Business Administration  program to document all Federal reporting requirements placed on  businesses and a National Center for Health Statistics program to  establish a clearinghouse for data relating to environmental health  hazards.  In addition, the proposed Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980  (H.R. 6410) provides for establishing a Federal Information Locator  System, as recommended by the Commission of Federal Paperwork.                                      4                                                                          CHAPTER II                       Introduction and Summary        A. Introduction          The Federal Statistical System is under pressure to respond  simultaneously to a growing demand for statistical data and a  growing demand for reductions in the ""paper blizzard"" generated by  Government requests for information from individuals and  businesses.  These demands will necessarily conflict unless the  efficiency of current programs can be improved.  Responsiveness to  both demands will require reduced duplication among Government  information collection programs combined with more intensive  utilization of existing administrative information sources in  meeting statistical data needs.  The latter requirement will  involve bringing together information collected in numerous  different Government administrative programs in ways that make  possible their combined use for statistical analysis.  As stated by  Edgar Dunn (1965, P. 5) in a review of the Ruggles' Committee  proposal for a national data center.       The central problem of data use is one of associating  numerical records.  No number conveys any information by itself.   It acquires meaning and significance only when compared with other  numbers.  The greatest deficiency of the existing Federal  Statistical System is its failure to provide access to data in a  way that permits the association of the elements of data sets in  order to identify and measure the interrelationship among  interdependent activities.       As Dunn further notes (1965, Summary, p. 2) problems of access  and record association are particularly serious in the case of  statistical use of administrative records because: ""Many of the  most useful records are produced as a by-product of administrative  or regulatory procedures by agencies that do not recognize a  general-purpose statistical service function as an important part  of their mission.""       The association or merger of administrative records from a  variety of sources is important for statistical applications  because: (1) populations of statistical interest do not always  correspond closely to populations covered in individual  administrative record systems; and (2) individual administrative  record files often identify relatively few of those characteristics  and attributes of the members of a population that social  scientists and policy analysts consider to be important in meeting  their statistical needs.  Merging individual administrative record  sets with other administrative and statistical data sources can  help to alleviate the deficiencies of many individual administra-  tive sources; but record merging is often difficult--particularly  when the records are collected and maintained by separate agencies.   Provisions for protecting the confidentiality of records pertaining  to identifiable individuals or businesses often preclude  interagency transfer of such records for statistical applications.   And even when access to the records needed for merging can be  arranged, differences in the ways different agencies identify  individual reporting units, and/or inconsistencies in the ways  agencies collect, process, and maintain information about reporting  units, can preclude successful data matching and merging operations  (see Chapter VI).       Although difficult problems remain to be solved, statistical  uses of administrative records have been increasing and will  continue to increase because of high data collection costs and  heavy respondent burdens associated with censuses and surveys.   Many important statistical needs cannot be adequately met by a  system involving censuses, carried out every 5 or 10 years,  combined with intercensal surveys which provide national data.  And  the extra costs of moving to more frequent censuses and/or larger  sample surveys which might provide small area data are high both in  terms of direct government expenditure and response burden.  The  projected high cost to the government was an important factor in  the recent decision to disallow further planning funds for the 1985  mid-decade census.       The most striking illustrations of the need to make improved  statistical use of administrative records arise in cases involving  the use of socioeconomic data to distribute Federal funds to State  and local areas.  For example, in reviewing alternatives for  meeting the legislative mandate to produce current local-area  unemployment estimates for use in allocating funds under the  Comprehensive Employment and Training Act, the National Commission  on Employment and Unemployment Statistics ( 1 979, p. 253) has  estimated that it would cost about $2.3 billion annually to expand  the Current Population Survey to provide monthly unemployment  estimates for the over 4,000 geographic areas potentially eligible  for CETA funding.  As important as the high money costs involved in  obtain-                                      5                 ing frequent small-area data by survey techniques is the  substantial increase in response burdens associated with greatly  expanded data collection efforts.       For example, another alternative considered by the NCEUS was  improving the handbook method (called 70-step method) based on  unemployment insurance records.       Not only is them pressure for statisticians to increase their  use of administrative records in developing general-purpose  statistics, but statisticians also have a strong interest in  supporting efforts to reduce the duplication and improve the  efficiency of administrative as well as statistical information  collection efforts.  Direct reporting for statistical purposes  accounts for a very small proportion of the overall Federal  reporting burden; major reductions in overall paperwork burdens  must be achieved through improvements in nonstatistical arm.  At  the same time; however, statistical programs could be more  adversely affected than other programs because statistical programs  tend to be more often viewed as optional than administrative record  systems and, therefore. more dependent on the voluntary cooperation  of the public in obtaining responses to information requests.  As the following statement from the President's Statistical  Reorganization Project's ""Issues and Options"" paper (1978, p. 7-1)  indicates, there is a growing recognition of the importance of  applying statistical tools to more general problems of information  collection in order to reduce reporting burdens:       The tools used by statistical agencies (sampling, quality       control, intensive analysis of existing data, etc.) are near       the roots of reporting requirements, and the use of       appropriate tools reduces reporting burden.  It is in this       sense that. from the point of view of response burden, the use       of appropriate statistical techniques is of major importance       and should extend well beyond any formal definition of the       Federal Statistical System.  The statistical system, however, cannot hope to dominate Government  information collection activities; There must be a genuine effort  to cooperate with administrators in nonstatistical programs in  order to achieve mutual goals of efficient information collection.   Statisticians must attempt to understand the needs and constraints  facing program administrator and statistical budgets should bear a  fair share of the costs of collecting and processing administrative  records in ways that permit efficient use for statistical purposes.  Much must be learned and many difficult problems confronted if  progress is to be made in the statistical use of administrative  records and in improving the overall efficiency of Government  information collection and use, With the hope of contributing to  progress in this area, this report attempts to: (1) identify major  administrative data files with significant potential for general-  purpose statistical applications; (2) indicate various kinds of  statistical uses of administrative records which are being made or  considered; (3) identify major technical and institutional or legal  problems which are impeding effective statistical use of  administrative records; and (4) suggest possible approaches to  improving information collection and statistical use of  administrative records.       The Subcommittee on Statistical Uses of Administrative Records  has not attempted to provide comprehensive documentation of  administrative record systems and their uses.  The report instead  reflects largely the areas of interest and expertise of  Subcommittee members.  Important areas such as energy and  environmental statistics are not covered at all, and very little  attention is given to records generated by the complex array of  Government regulatory agencies.  There is, however, relatively  intensive coverage of administrative data from programs of the  internal Revenue Service and Social Security Administration, and  from related administrative programs that collect important social  and economic information from individuals and businesses.                                    B. Summary          Chapter III of the report presents the results of a survey  conducted by the Subcommittee to obtain documentation of major  administrative record data files maintained by selected Federal  agencies.  Chapter IV presents a description of statistical  applications of administrative records in selected agencies.  The  following three chapters (V-VII) illustrate, largely by means of  case studies, specific approaches to statistical use of  administrative records and problems encountered in such approaches.   Chapter VIII reviews legal considerations, particularly those  related to restricted access to records, that influence the  statistical use of administrative records.     1.   Chapter III-Major Administrative Files          This chapter summarizes the characteristics of major  computerized administrative record files that are maintained or  mandated by the Federal Government and contain statistically useful  information pertaining to (I) individuals or (2) businesses.  The  information contained in the administrative files for individuals  is compared to the information on individuals collected in  decennial censuses; and the information contained in the  administrative files for businesses is compared to the information  contained on the Census Bureau's Standard Statistical Establishment  List (which is itself assembled from a combination of  administrative and survey data sources).  The chap-                                      6                 ter also contains a description of the Social Security  Administration's Continuous Work History Sample which is a set of  statistical files of individual worker records assembled using  several SSA business and individual administrative record files.       Compared with the decennial census, most administrative record  files for individuals contain relatively little information on  population characteristics and/or cover only a limited segment of  the population.  In addition, the, census usually provides more  reliable and detailed geographic information than administrative  files; and at best, administrative records can provide only tough  approximations to such census reporting units as the family and  household.  On the other hand, many administrative files provide  data at much more frequent intervals than the decennial census, and  the presence of social security numbers on most administrative  files opens the possibility of linking files over time  (longitudinally) or merging information from more than one  administrative file in order to increase the cove rage of  individuals and/or the number of characteristics identified for  particular individuals.  The absence of SSN's in census records  generally makes it difficult to integrate information from censuses  with information from administrative records.       Administrative record coverage of businesses is complete than  is true for individuals.  In fact, administrative lists of  businesses provide the basis for conducting statistical censuses  and surveys.  For the most part, however, administrative records do  not maintain separate information for the different establishments  of a single legal business entity, even though the business may  operate in several different geographic areas and/or industrial  categories.  The Census Bureau does collect information for  individual establishments; and the SSEL, therefore, contains a  larger list of reporting units than most administrative files.   While most administrative business files do not contain the  establishment detail necessary for developing reliable geographic  and industrial data, the SSA and Unemployment Insurance payroll tax  programs do involve reports breaking out county level ""establish-  ment"" detail.  Unfortunately, however, the reporting units in these  programs are not consistent with the establishment concept used in  the SSEL, and there is currently no satisfactory basis for  coordinating the reporting of similar information (or resolving  data discrepancies) among the three systems.       CWHS data files provide information on the demographic  characteristics (sex, age, and race) of. workers along with  longitudinal information on their employment and earnings patterns.   The CWHS program illustrates the potential statistical advantages  of administrative records for longitudinal analysis and for linking  together information about individuals and businesses.     2.   Chapter IV-Major Statistical Uses of Administrative Records          This chapter illustrates statistical uses of administrative  records with reference to the programs of selected Federal  agencies, particularly programs of the Social Security  Administration, the Internal Revenue Service, the Bureau of  Economic Analysis, the Census Bureau, and the Small Business  Administration.  The SSA and IRS programs involve the development  of general-purpose statistics by statistical divisions of agencies  that collect large amounts of information from individuals and  businesses in the course of their administrative responsibilities.   The programs illustrate the large quantity and variety of adminis-  trative data collected as well as the limitations of incomplete  population coverage and lack of information on important population  characteristics that plague statistical use of administrative  records.       The BEA programs illustrate the use of a wide variety of  administrative data (obtained from many agencies) for estimating  data series within the context of a systematic economic accounting  framework.  Administrative data are used in conjunction with census  and survey data (also generally obtained from other agencies); and  there are substantial variations among the administrative data  series in the extent to which they involve concepts and measurement  procedures that ""fit"" well with the concepts involved in the design  of the accounting framework and with concepts underlying the census  and survey data used.       Census Bureau programs illustrate a wide variety of  applications of administrative records for both individuals and  businesses.  For example, records obtained from administrative  agencies are used in developing intercensal population and related  estimates, as a substitute for censuses in the collection of  economic data from many small businesses, in the development and  maintenance of sampling frames for surveys, and in the evaluation  of the completeness and, reliability of information collected in  censuses and surveys.  Again there are substantial variations in  the extent to which administrative record concepts match desired  statistical concepts.  A few census programs. primarily in the area  of economic statistics. art discussed in more detail than other  programs covered in Chapter IV.  These more detailed examples  illustrate the substantial cost savings as well as limitations  associated with the statistical use of administrative records.       The SBA involvement in the statistical use of administrative  records stems largely from a recently initiated project to develop  a small business data base in conjunction with the 1980 White House  Conference on Small Business.  In part because of concerns over  reporting burdens, small businesses have been exempted from or                                      7                 covered on a very small sample basis, in most economic censuses and  surveys.  Therefore. a small business data base must rely heavily  on administrative records.  SBA efforts to develop such a data base  illustrate many of the problems that are often encountered in  gaining access to administrative records and adapting them for  statistical analysis.     3.   Chapter V-Developments in Data from Business Establishment       Reporting     This chapter contains case studies of three important and related  statistical programs that are currently evolving based in large  part on developments in administrative record systems-(1) the  Census Bureau's SSEL program; (2) SSA's program for adapting its  CWHS data program to a new system of annual employer reports of  worker wages on forms W-2 and W-3; and (3) the Bureau of Labor  Statistics' program for developing work force statistics in  connection with the UI payroll tax program.  These programs produce  both complementary and overlapping statistical products in the area  of work force statistics; and they illustrate not only the  importance and potential of administrative records for developing  work force data, but they also illustrate some important problems  in the area of establishment reporting by multiestablishment  businesses and in the area of coordinating similar data collection  efforts in different agencies.  The Census Bureau program employs  the most satisfactory concept of establishment from a statistical  point of view, but the Census work force data assembled in  connection with the SSEL cannot match the frequency and timeliness  of BLS data based on the UI system, nor can the SSEL-based data  provide the information on demographic characteristics of workers  available from the SSA system.  And the different establishment  reporting plans of the three data systems combined with  difficulties of interagency transfers of records (for example, the  current restrictions on access to the SSEL) have severely limited  the scope for coordinating data collection and development efforts  in the three programs.     4.   Chapter VI--Potential Uses of Administrative Records for Data       Linkages: Selected Case Studies          This chapter involves four case studies that illustrate the  potential and the problems associated with record linkages as a  means of improving and extending the use of. administrative records  in developing primary data and in evaluating census and survey  data--(1) the ""Linked Administrative Statistical Sample Project""  (2) the ""Use of Administrative Records in the Survey of Income and  Program Participation,"" (3) the ""Use of IRS/SSA/HCFA Administrative  Files for 1980 Census Coverage Evaluation,"" and (4) ""Record Linkage  in the Nonhousehold Sources Program."" In contrast to Chapter V,  where the difficulties of coordinating and linking business  establishment records among programs was highlighted, Chapter VI is  concerned with linkages involving records for individuals.  The LASS project involves efforts to link records from a variety of  administrative record sources in order to develop a general-purpose  statistical sample file that will be suited for mortality research.   The sampling procedures will conform closely to those involved in  the CWHS in order to facilitate longitudinal data analysis, but  CWHS records will be supplemented with records from IRS and the  National Center for Health Statistics.  The project illustrates the  substantial potential for combining complementary data through  interagency linkage of administrative record files.  But the  project also illustrates significant technical problems and  problems of access restriction that need to be resolved in linking  data files prepared in different agencies.       The SIPP case study illustrates the importance of  administrative records in efforts to alleviate substantial survey  biases in coverage and income reporting for low-income groups  (participating in various income maintenance programs) and  administrative record importance as a source of income data to  evaluate the reliability with which selected types of income are  reported in surveys.       The third and fourth case studies are both associated with  efforts to evaluate and improve the 1980 Census of Population and  Housing.  The IRS/SSA/HCFA files will be used primarily in efforts  to evaluate the extent of Census undercoverage, while the  Nonhousehold Sources Program will be concerned with improving  population coverage in selected areas of anticipated high  undercount.  The latter program involves, in addition lo the use of  Federal agency records, the use of such State and local  administrative records as drivers' license records.  Both projects  demonstrate the potential of administrative records to identify  individuals who are missed in censuses and surveys.  The projects  also illustrate; however, the difficulties and high costs of  linking administrative records to census records (which contain no  social security number) and the difficulty of determining the  extent to which particular groups are not covered in either census  or administrative record sources.     5.   Chapter VII-Technical Problems in the Statistical Use of       Administrative Records          This chapter illustrates technical problems encountered in  making statistical use of administrative records that arise or are  exacerbated because of limited statistical control in  administrative record systems over such factors as population  coverage,, definitions and comparability of information concepts  among programs, and reporting and                                      8                 processing procedures.  The CWHS data program is used as the  principal source of illustrations, in part because the CWHS program  involves the use of files containing information about businesses  as well as individuals, and perhaps more importantly because it  illustrates well the problems that can arise when important  statistical aspects of the reporting and processing of records we  largely outside the control of statisticians responsible for making  statistical use of the records.  In particular them is evidence of  significant and increasing numbers of geograPhic coding errors in  the CWHS that have resulted from low priority attached by SSA  administrators to the statistical problem of obtaining reliable  geographic reports and ensuring accurate coding and processing of  geographic information in employer payroll reports to SSA.     6.   Chapter VIII: Legal Issues in the Statistical Use of       Administrative Records.          This chapter illustrates legal and related institutional  barriers which inhibit the interagency access to records that is  needed for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of  statistical use of administrative records.  Emphasis is placed on  problems which arise because of a failure of existing  confidentiality laws to make an adequate functional distinction  between statistical and administrative processes which use records  about individuals.       The basis for interagency transfer of administrative records  is often found in a logic that imposes regular Procedures or  conditions for expanding the scope 'of administrative actions or  decisions which can be based on the. particular content of records  about an individual.  Such a logic is generally irrelevant with  respect to legitimate statistical processes which, in contrast to  administrative uses, merely produce relationships and summaries of  data, and do not involve any direct Government action against (or  in favor of) the individual as a consequence of information in  records pertaining to that individual.       Clearly not all statistical performance is functionally  divorced from administrative processes: program integrity and  quality assurance are functions which may explicitly---and quite  properly-rely on applied statistical techniques to identify  individual cases for administrative action.  Such functions are  within the reasonable expectations of program participants, and do  not rely, moreover, on collection of information from volunteers,  with assurances of confidential treatment.  In contrast, there are  particular statistical activities or collections of data whose  existence and rationale for compiling and making interagency  transfer Of data is limited by the degree to which statisticians  can fulfill a legal or ethical duty to protect the confidentiality  of individual information.       Statistical uses in this latter category need to be separated  out as discrete functional uses, and be governed by different rules  and standards from those which govern administrative and compliance  uses.  Proposals for functional separation"" of statistical from  administrative uses argue for separating these statistical records  about identifiable individuals from the decision/action stream, and  permitting the statistical results to be available to adminis-  trators only in summary or other unidentifiable form.  Functional  separation would allow summaries, of course, to be used  administratively in ways which my result indirectly in consequences  affecting all members of the group in uniform ways. However,  functional separation would not permit the direct use of individual  records as the basis for individual actions.  Alternative  legislative proposals for implementing the concept of functional  separation are reviewed in the chapter.                                      9                                                                                  CHAPTER III                       Major Administrative Data Files             This chapter describes the general properties of most of the  major Federal administrative record files containing statistically  useful information pertaining to individuals or businesses.  The  discussion is based largely on a survey of selected Federal  agencies conducted by the SUAR Subcommittee.  An attempt is made to  lay the groundwork and indeed begin the discussion, continued in  Chapter IV. of the statistical uses of administrative record  systems.       Organizationally, the chapter is divided into four sections  and two appendices.  The first section indicates the scope of the  administrative record files covered and describes the survey  instrument used to obtain file documentation.  In the second  section there is a brief summary of the survey results.  In the  third section there is a brief description of the Social Security  Administration's Continuous Work History Sample files.  The CWHS  files illustrate the process of extracting and merging information  from basic administrative files to obtain files useful for  statistical analysis.  In the final section there is a discussion  of selected factors associated with the historical evolution of the  statistical use of administrative files covered in the chapter.   The survey questionnaire is reproduced in the first appendix, and a  more detailed description of the CWHS program and data files is  contained in the second appendix.                   A. Scope of Study and Survey Conducted     1. Scope of Study          In compiling a list of ""administrative"" record files that  would be of greatest statistical interest, three criteria were  employed:          1.   Does the file have extensive coverage of a Population            (either individuals or businesses)?       2.   Is the population covered by the administrative record            set of statistical interest?       3.   Is the file maintained by computer?  The systems chosen for examination under these criteria are shown  in Figure III.1. Information relating to individuals was sought  from ten Federal agencies; some twenty-four administrative record  files were involved in all.        Figure III.1   Major Administrative Record Files Surveyed by the                 Subcommittee on the Statistical Uses of                 Administrative Records  ______________________________________________________________  Agency                        Administrative Record File  ______________________________________________________________                   Part I-Information on individuals  Bureau of the Census          1970 Census of Population                                1980 Census of Population  Office of Personnel Man-      Central Personnel Data File  agement                       Civil Service Annuity Roll  Department of Defense         Active Military Personnel Data File                                (Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines)                                Military Retirement Compensation File                                (Army.

It should be noted that although the Subcommittee does, not  Classify the decennial censuses of population as administrative  data files. since their main purpose is statistical, they are  nonetheless. included to provide a basis for comparison with the  other files on individuals.  The Census Bureau's Standard  Statistical Establishment List was also treated as ""in scope"" for  comparison purposes. this time with business administrative record  files.        2.   Survey Conducted          In late 1978. the Subcommittee conducted a survey of  the administrative files listed in Figure II.1. This survey was  entitled ""Statistical Use Survey of Records Pertaining to  Individuals.  Individual Firms, and Employers Maintained and/or  Mandated by the Federal Government.       A questionnaire was mailed to each agency maintaining one of  the selected files.  The principal purpose of the questionnaire was  to document the data elements on each file that might be of  statistical interest. it was not the intent of the survey to be  comprehensive, but simply to provide a starting point for  structuring inquiries about the files.  This survey collected data on both individual and business files by  providing optional sections to completed depending on the type of  file being considered.       The survey consisted of only fifteen questions, but a number  of the questions contained several parts.  Respondents were asked  to report the availability of documentation concerning the file,  the information carried on the file, and the history of the file  development and maintenance.  For the most part, each agency made a  serious effort to provide detailed responses to the questions.                              B. Survey Results          This section briefly summarizes the survey results.  First.  the files pertaining to individuals are considered. then those  pertaining to businesses.  Detailed tabulations from the survey are  included in Tables II.1.1 and III.2.     1.   Files Pertaining Mainly to Individuals          Not unexpectedly, there are extensive differences  among the administrative record files on individuals.  some of  those which deserve special mention are the differences in coverage  (or ""universes"") among the files, the degree of coded geographic  information; the demographic item included and the reporting units  used:          a. Universe          In terms of coverage of individuals in the U.S. population.  the decennial Census files are the most complete, followed by  Social Security's Summary Earnings Files and the IRS Individual  Master Fide.  No other files have the same breadth of coverage as  these.  However, several other files do provide comprehensive  coverage of important segments of the population.  For example, the  Health insurance Master File for the ""65 + "" population, the                                      12    Central Personnel Data File-for Federal government workers; and the  Military Personnel Data Files-for present and former Armed Forces  members.          b. Geographic information          Administrative files tend to have limited coded geographic  information.  Some contain a State code, but this was usually  derived from the mailing address.  The only exceptions appear to be  SSA's Master Beneficiary Record file, and the related HCFA Health  Insurance Master File, which contain a county code obtained by  clerically coding the mailing address.  By way of contrast, the  Census geographic data are collected on a residence basis and we  available to the block level.       This lack of detailed ""residence geography"" is a major problem  in using administrative records to prepare small area statistics.   By using the mailing address, subcounty geography may be assigned  with a Geographic Base File developed for use in the 1970 or 1980  census.  However, this presents a number of problems.  First, the  mailing addresses are not always the usual place of residence.   Second, GBF's do not exist for areas located outside the built up  portion of SMSA's.  Third, people living outside the city limits  tend to report themselves as living in the city if they have a city  post office address.  Fourth, post office delivery or zip code  areas do not conform with political boundaries.  Also, the cost of  assigning geography with a GBF system is high.       Another approach is to add a residence geographic code to the  administrative file.  This was done for the 1972 and 1975  Individual Master Files so that IRS data could be used in preparing  population and per capita total money income estimates for use in  distributing General Revenue Sharing funds.  The cost of this  straightforward approach makes it unlikely that it will be widely  implemented on other files.          c.   Demographic information          By   comparison with the Census data, all administrative  files contain very limited demographic information.  The Numerical  Identification (SS-5) file does contain sex, date of birth, and  race which have been transferred to the Summary Earnings Record and  the Master Beneficiary Record.  The personnel files also have some  race information.  However, other than this, there is very little  demographic data present.          d. Reporting unit          The Census data are the only data organized into households  and families.  Tax returns, and Social Security claims, however,  can for some purposes be treated as approximations to family units.   For the most part, however, the units are just individuals with no  potential for structuring them into households.       One final point.  The survey showed that all the  administrative files for individuals are organized by social                                     13     security number.  This is distinct from the decennial census files  which do not-have the SSN recorded- BY and large, the SSN is the  major administrative identifier. Obviously, then, it is this  variable which would have to be employed for linkages among the  files-whether for statistical or operational purposes.     2.   Files pertaining Mainly to Businesses          The employer identification number is a major identifier on  most of the administrative record files- including even the Census'  Standard Statistical Establishment List. Some other similarities  and differences in the files are:          a. Universe          The file with the largest coverage is the Master Employer Name  Directory with about 27 million records' However, this file is not  current and contains inactive businesses.  The SSEL is the most  comprehensive current list of businesses with the exception of the  very small businesses.  For these businesses, the IRS Business Mas-  ter File is more complete.  The Department Of Agriculture's  Producer name and Address Master File, and their Economics,  Statistics, and Cooperative Service List Sampling Frame have  extensive coverage of the farming sector.          b. Geographic information          As with the individual record systems, them is no subcounty  geography data,present on any of the business files with the  exception of the SSEL.  For businesses, location may have different  meanings.  Most of the geography reported on these files is in  terms of company headquarters and may not refer to the individual  establishment.  Consequently, a reporting of a major geographically  dispersed company at its headquarter's location can introduce a  significant error into the data.          c. Economic data          Number of employees, total payroll, and gross sales seem to be  the most common economic items present on the files.          d. Reporting Unit          The reporting unit of these files is mainly the Employer  Identification Number with the exception of the SSEL.  This creates  a problem in any statistical use of these files because some EIN's  represent only part of a company but an EIN may cover many  establishments.                      C. Continuous Work History Sample Files          The survey results in the previous section indicate  clearly that individual administrative record files usually do not  contain the comprehensive population coverage and detailed  identification of population characteristics desired for most  statistical analysis.  The results also indicate, however, that it  is often technically possible to overcome some of the limitations  of single administrative files by linking several files and merging  the information contained in these files.  With files pertaining to  individuals the SSN provides the principal basis for linkage and  with business files the EIN is usually the basis for linkage.  Both  the problems and the potential benefits of file linkage we  increased significantly when interagency linkages are considered  (see, for example, the discussion of the Linked Administrative  Statistical Sample in Chapter VI); but highly valuable statistical  files can be developed through intra-agency linkages of  administrative files in such large agencies as IRS and SSA.  The  Continuous Work History Sample program of SSA illustrates well the  problems and potential of such intra-agency file linkages.       The CWHS program involves the construction of several  statistical sample files from information contained in the SSA  administrative files documented in Tables III.1 and III.2., The 1  percent 1937-to-date CWHS file, for example, involves primarily the  extraction and merger of information from the Summary Earnings  Record and Master Beneficiary Record files documented in Table III.  1. Annual and longitudinal employee-employer CWHS files are  constructed largely by merging detailed earnings items which are  input to the Summary Earnings Record File with industrial and  geographic information obtained from the SSA employer files  documented in Table III.2.       CWHS files do not contain occupational information for  workers, nor do they contain the detailed socioeconomic  characteristics available in census sample files.  CWHS files do,  however, contain information on worker sex, age, and race; and they  can provide much greater longitudinal detail relating to the  earnings history of workers than is available from any survey  source.  The CWHS program, moreover, has a considerable advantage  over household surveys in obtaining employer information because of  the possibility of direct links between employer and employee  administrative files.  The advantage of direct links between  employer and employee information; however, is offset somewhat by  quality problems associated with the geographic and industrial  coding in SSA employer files (sec Chapter VII).       Because the CWHS program illustrates well both the potential  and the problems associated with the statistical use of  administrative records. examples of CWHS applications and  deficiencies are presented throughout the report.  Some of the more  detailed references to the CWHS program are included in: (1) the  discussion in                                     14           Chapter V of the new joint IRS-SSA system of annual employer  reporting (on Form W-2) of individual worker wages; (2) the  discussion in Chapter VI of the development of the new Linked  Administrative Statistical Sample program; and (3) the discussion  in Chapter VII of technical problems encountered in the statistical  use of administrative records.  To permit the reader to better  follow the references to the CWHS made throughout the report, a  detailed description of the CWHS program and CWHS files is  presented in the second appendix to this chapter.           D. The Evolution of Statistical Use of Administrative Records          Chapter IV contains a detailed discussion of statistical uses  of administrative records from the perspective of selected Federal  agencies that make extensive use of administrative records in their  statistical and research programs.  Chapters V and VI then follow  with detailed case studies of selected projects and programs  involving intensive statistical use of administrative records.  To  provide additional background for the chapters on uses, this  section reviews some of the circumstances surrounding t he  evolution of statistical uses of administrative record files  covered in Tables III.1 and III.2.       The use of administrative records as a source of statistical  information is not a new idea, but the last decade's extensive  computerization of these files has fostered an increasing interest  in the topic.  In fact, there seems to have been a progression in  the employment of administrative records for statistical purposes.   Initially, with the establishment of an administrative records  system, an agency prepared summaries of the data for guiding their  operations and for policy decisions.  This may be done with the  full data set or a sample.  Its purpose is primarily  administrative, not statistical.  Perhaps IRS is the best example.  What started out as a mainly administrative effort has evolved into  the current Statistics of Income program (see Chapter IV).  While  administrative considerations are still important, the Statistics  of Income sample is used extensively by researchers to study issues  of general statistical and economic interest.       Administrative records systems were used very early in  evaluation projects such as the evaluation of the 1950 Census  income results using IRS and SSA data (NBER, 1958).  After each  decennial population census since then, there have been attempts to  understand and quantify any error in the results by matching a  small sample of census records to various administrative record  sets such as IRS data (Schneider and Knott. 1973), Medicare data  (U.S. Bureau of the Census 1973c), birth records (U.S. Bureau of  the Census, 1963 and 1973a), death records (Kitagawa and Hauser,  1973), and employment records (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1965).  These evaluation efforts may be characterized by the relatively  small number of cases involved.  This limit on size is the result  of the objective of the project as well as cost considerations.   Most evaluation projects involving these Federal files are aimed at  National results only and do not attempt to measure differences at  the State or even regional level. (This is changing, however, for  the 1980 Census Evaluation, the matching will attempt to produce  estimates at the State level-see Chapter VI.)       With the extensive computerization of administrative files in  the 1960's, the possibilities for expanded statistical uses became  obvious.  For example, IRS completed the computerization of the  Individual Master File with the 1967 file.  Also, over this same  period, there was a great reduction in the cost of computer data  processing and an increase in understanding how to process and  control large data files, thus making the use of these administra-  tive files feasible for statistical purposes.       These developments and potential uses of administrative  records were understood and debated (Hansen, 1974).  While that  debate cannot be reviewed here, the outcome has been that no  centralization of administrative records has taken place in the  Federal government, but statistical uses of administrative records  have continued.  Some transfer of administrative records between  agencies has been permitted, but each transfer has been justified  and approved on a case-by-case basis (Kilss and Scheuren, 1979).   Some people feel that this case-by-case approach has retarded the  use of administrative records in developing useful statistical  data, but this has never been fully documented.       In one sense, survey- and census-based data may be blamed for  the slow development of administrative records-based data.  Up  until recently (and perhaps still), survey- and census-based data  have had a real edge on administrative records in several areas.   For example, if small area data are needed, the Census of  Population and Housing provides small area data defined completely  and in the ""correct"" geography (i.e., by residence).  Adminis-  trative records-based data may be able to approximate the needed  data, but not at the same level of accuracy.  It is a question of  trading-off accuracy for currency.  If the need is for national.  regional, or even State data, surveys may be a more efficient way  to obtain needed data than the development of an administrative  records-based system.       However, with the need for small area data on a regular basis,  the currency and small area advantages of administrative records  may now outweigh the disadvantages of definitional problems and  less accuracy.  For example, with the passage of the State and  Local Fiscal Assistance Act of 1972, the Bureau of the Census was  asked to                                     15       provide population and per capita total money income data for  38,500 governmental units.  The Bureau accomplished this by using  an extract from the 1969 and 1972 entire IRS Individual Master  File.  This required IRS to collect and clerically code the  residence address of all taxpayers on the 1972 IMF.  The cost of  the first set of estimates. including the IRS coding, was in excess  of $5 million.  This was the first administrative records-based  project of this magnitude and demonstrated the expense and benefit  of administrative records.  It should also be noted that this  successful application of administrative records used  administrative records to measure change since the 1970 census (Fay  and Herriot, 1979).  In this way. the definitional problems were  minimized.       With the expanded interest in administrative records, them is  now taking place the needed experimentation and research to  understand the particular idiosyncracies of these files.  This  will, hopefully, come to fruition in the 1980's with useful data in  several areas.  For example, migration rates by race can be  computed by linking race from the SSA Summary Earnings File to the  IRS data.  This has been done on a sample basis and State estimates  prepared (Word 1978).  It is expected that this work will continue.       By using tax returns (or W-2's) to establish a current  residence, and the Form 941 to link an employer to an employee, and  the Master Employer Name Directory (mainly SS-4) to define an  employer's location, current journey-to-work estimates are  possible.  The Bureau of the Census and the Bureau of Economic  Analysis have done some work in this area, so far, however, without  great success.  The problems of multi-establishment employers, low  quality geography coding of employers, etc.. are major obstacles  when trying to estimate the change in a particular journey-to-work  flow. (Chapter VII contains a more detailed discussion of the  problems encountered in the BEA journey-to-work study.)  Currently, the Census Bureau uses IRS adjusted gross income and  wages and salary data to update the 1970 census per capita income  estimates.  By using the age, race, and sex data from the Social  Security Administration, the IRS information could be adjusted for  differential reporting by age, race, and sex.  Updating income size  distribution estimates with IRS data has long been considered  desirable.  The inability to group IRS returns directly into  families or households makes such updating difficult, but synthetic  estimation procedures involving IRS data are being used in the  development of family personal income size distribution estimates  at BEA (see Chapter IV).       The need for targeted surveys and more sampling efficiency for  small populations will continue to make administrative records  important as a sampling frame.  In the business files, the use of  the business lists as sampling francs may be their single most  important function, either to complete or to stratify a universe  for sampling.       In summary. the statistical use of administrative records will  continue to grow, but not easily.  The use of administrative  records data in preparing statistics must be preceded by a period  of analysis and experimentation in order to understand the  particular problems inherent in each administrative record system.                             E.

Appendix III.2                            The CWHS Data System          The Continuous Work History Sample is a system of general  multipurpose statistical data files designed primarily for  socioeconomic research.  The system consists of samples of records  of individuals with employment covered by social security.   Earnings, employment and benefit data for the individual along with  personal characteristics and employer characteristics are  maintained at varying degrees among five basic data files and two  special files that are produced in the CWHS system.       This appendix describes: (1) the data sources for the CWHS  system; (2) the procedures used to construct the administrative  data files underlying the system; (3) the procedures used to create  statistical files from the records in the administrative files; (4)  the sample design used for the system; and (5) the principal data  elements in each of the five basic CWHS files.  The discussion  refers to data and procedures predating the start of annual wage  reporting in 1979 (for calendar year 1978).  A discussion of the  new annual reporting system is presented in Chapter V. And Chapter  VII contains considerable discussion of the limitations of CWHS  data.     1. Data Sources          Data for the CWHS are obtained from records derived from  reporting and informational forms and applications used in  administering the retirement, survivors and disability programs of  the Social Security Administration.  The date of birth. sex and  race of the person is obtained from the Application for a Social  Security Number (Form SS-5).  Geographic and industry information  is obtained from the employer's Application for an Identification  Number (Form SS-4) and other related forms that are used  periodically to update this information (Form OAA-100, OAA-103 and  SSA-5019).  Initially, employers are assigned geographical and  industry classifications based on the location and nature of  business information sup. plied on the Form SS-4.  Information that  is not satisfactorily reported on the SS-4 is obtained through the  supplemental forms OAA-100 and OAA-103.       Employers who operate more than one place of business and have  a total of 50 employees with at least six in a separate location  are asked to use the Establishment Reporting Plan.  Under this plan  the employer gives SSA- a list showing the location. industrial  activity and approximate number of employees of each establishment.   On subsequent wage reports the employer groups his employees by  establishment, identifying each group with a  preassigned  establishment number.  The arrangement allows SSA to properly  classify the employees according to geography and industry.       Data on earnings and employment are derived from various  reporting forms submitted by employers and self-employed persons.   Prior to 1978, with the advent of annual wage reporting, taxable  wages of employees were reported quarterly by regular employers on  Form 941, household employers on Form 942, and State and local  government employers on Form OAR-S3.  Farm employers report  annually on Form 943 and self-employed persons use Schedule SE of  Form 1040 to report annually. (Refer to Chapter V for a discussion  of the new annual reporting system).       Claims and benefits information is obtained from applications  and forms that are completed in the process of filing for and  determining entitlement to benefits.     2.   Processing Procedures--Administrative Records          The demographic information (date of birth, sex and race)  furnished by the applicant on the Form SS-5 is extracted after the  social security number has been issued.  This information is  maintained on magnetic tape in a master file called the Summary  Earnings Record (see Table III.1).  This is the record in which the  lifetime earnings and quarters of coverage of the individual is  recorded for use in determining entitlement to benefits and  calculating benefit amounts at the time a claim for benefits is  made.       The information supplied by the employer on the Form SS-4,  relating to the location and nature of his business, is manually  coded with geographic and industry codes.  This information is key  punched and maintained on magnetic tape in a master file of  employers called the Employer Identification file (see Table  III.2). Additionally, the information supplied on Form SSA-5019 by  multi-unit employers using the Establishment Reporting Plan per-  taining to the location and nature of business of each separate  reporting unit, is also manually coded with geographic and industry  codes and maintained in the EI file.       The earnings data that are reported by employers are received  and processed at SSA in a variety of ways.  Hand filled paper forms  that meet certain criteria are optically scanned to produce a  machine-readable record, while others are keypunched.  Some  employers, usually having a large number of employees, report  directly on magnetic tape.  The reports of self-employed persons  are received directly from the Internal Revenue Service on magnetic  tape.  After all of the earnings data is in machine-readable form  with appropriate identifying information, the tapes enter a  computer balancing operation in which each page of each report is  checked to see that the wage items balance to the page totals  provided by the employer.  Out                                     23                 of balance items are investigated and corrective action taken.   Balanced items are passed on to an operation where individual items  are sorted in social security number sequence and then matched to  the Summary Earnings Record on number and the first six letters of  the surname.  Earnings amounts are added to the summary records  where complete matches occur.  Unmatched records are rejected for  further investigation and processing.       Prior to annual reporting, this processing occurred at regular  intervals four times during the year.  It generally takes about 9  months after the end of reference period to receive, process and  update the summary earnings records with virtually all of the items  for that period.       Claims for social security benefits are filed in local social  security district offices.  Requests for earnings records and  benefit computations are made by the district offices to SSA  headquarters.  After the earnings record is located, benefit  computations are made and documentation of the claim is prepared  and forwarded to the requesting office where the claim is developed  and forwarded to program service centers for benefit authorization.   Upon authorization of benefits, the program service center sends a  notification of award to headquarters where a new beneficiary  record is established in the Master Beneficiary Record file (see  Table III.1).  Changes to records in the beneficiary file are made  through reports by the district office or program center.  The  Master Beneficiary Record file is used in the preparation of  monthly social security benefit check records which are forwarded  to the Treasury Department for payment.     3. Processing Procedures-Statistical Records           Once a year after the Summary Earnings Record has been  updated with virtually all of the prior year's earnings, a 1  percent sample (based on specified digits of the social security  number) is extracted.  This file becomes the foundation for  producing the 1 percent 1937-to-date CWHS.  It is used along with  the prior year's CWHS, a 1 percent sample extracted from the Master  Beneficiary Record file, and miscellaneous correction files to  generate the required data elements for the current year's 1  percent CWHS.       At the same time that earnings data for the current processing  period are posted to the Summary Earnings Record, the 1 percent  sample of earnings items records are written off separately on  magnetic tape.  The items are accumulated until all four quarters  of the year have been processed.  They are then summarized into one  record for each employee-employer-establishment combination with  quarterly earnings amounts maintained separately.  The resulting  records are matched to the Employer Identification file and  geographic and industry codes are inserted.  They are then  resummarized to an employee-employer level.  Cases having  employment with more than one establishment of the same employer  are assigned to the unit having the most activity in terms of  quarters of employment.  A match is the n made to a special extract  from the 1 percent sample 1937-to-date CWHS containing date of  birth, sex and race codes.  These personal characteristics are  inserted into the record to form the final 1 percent Sample Annual  Employee-Employer file.       Another file of the earnings items that are posted to the  Summary Earnings Record, previously referred to, is written off  separately for another type of processing.  This is a 0.1 percent  sample and is a subset of the 1 percent sample.  These records are  accumulated over the same time period as the 1 percent sample  records and are processed along with the prior year's 0.1 percent  basic file and a special 0.1 percent write off of certain data  items from the current year's 1 percent CWHS file to create the  current year's 0.1 percent 1937-to-date CWHS.       Information for self-employed persons. coming from the  Schedule SE of the Form 1040, is submitted to SSA from IRS directly  on magnetic tape.  After initial processing of these records in  order to properly credit and post earnings to the Summary Earnings  Record, the 1 percent sample records in this file are written off  for statistical processing.  In subsequent computer operations IRS  industry codes that are in the original record are converted to SSA  industry codes and addresses are converted to geographic codes  through a special coding file that utilizes Zip code and place  names.  Correspondence is generated for cases with missing and/or  incomplete information asking for the required data.  The final  resulting file from these operations is the 1 percent Sample Annual  Self Employed file.       In addition to the regular statistical processing described  above, in recent years special processing has been done to generate  two additional files; the First Quarter Employee-Employer-  Establishment files for the 1 percent sample and a special 10  percent Sample First Quarter Employee-Employer-Establishment file.   Processing for these files is similar to processing for the Annual  Employee-Employer files except that it is done after all first  quarter receipts have been received and posted to the summary  earnings record.  Record contents are virtually the same as the  annual except that only first quarter data are included.  The 1  percent first quarter files have been prepared for the years 1970-  76, while the 10 percent first quarter files have been produced for  the years 1971, 1973, and 1975.     4. Sample Design          The population from which the CWHS is selected consists of the  one billion possible nine-digit social security                                     24                 numbers.  These numbers have the following digital arrangement:      Area in which      number     assigned          Group number       Serial number  (three digits)       (two digits)       (four digits)       XXX                XX                   XXXX     In the issuance of social security numbers, each State is assigned  one or more area numbers with the exception of a special block of  numbers assigned prior to August 1963 to persons covered under the  Railroad Retirement Act.  Each State number, in combination with a  given group number defines a stratum.  The population assigned  social security numbers is thus stratified geographically (by place  of application for social security number) and chronologically (by  the process of assigning these numbers).  Each number is an element  of a given stratum, and the population represented by the possible  one billion elements constitutes the sampling frame.       The CWHS is a longitudinal sample of persons with covered  employment.  The sample consists of all persons who have social  security numbers with specified digits in certain of the serial-  number positions and who have covered employment during any defined  reference period.  The digital selection pattern remains constant.   The employment and earnings histories for persons in the sample are  available from 1957 forward, with limited additional earnings data  going back to 1937.       The 1 percent CWHS may be described as a stratified cluster  probability sample of all possible social security numbers.  A  stratum consists of all social security numbers with the same area-  group number.  In a stratum for which all numbers have been issued,  the 1 percent sample consists of 100 of the 9,999 social security  numbers issued. (Numbers ending in 0000 are not assigned.)       The clustering within a stratum arises from the particular  digital selection procedure used, in combination with past methods  of assigning social security numbers.  Because of the clustering,  sampling errors of estimates from the 1 percent CWHS are slightly  larger than those that would result from a stratified random sample  of the same size.       The present design of the 1 percent sample evolved from  earlier sample designs--an initial 20 percent sample and a later 4  percent sample.  All past designs have used the same stratification  modes as are used in the present design.       The 10 percent CWHS is a stratified systematic sample.  The  strata are the same as those used for the 1 percent sample, and the  digital selection procedure within strata is such that them is no  clustering effect.  Therefore, sampling errors of estimates from  the 10 percent CWHS are presumed to be about the same as or  slightly smaller than those that would result from a simple random  sample of the same size.     5.   Data Files             A brief description of the files produced in the CWHS  system is shown below, including a listing of the major data  elements.  These files had been made available on a cost  reimbursable basis with precautions taken to preserve the  confidentiality of information relating to specific individuals or  reporting units.  These precautions included limiting the data  elements to those needed by the researcher for the purposes stated  and transformation of identifying numbers to unique case numbers  which still permit linking of common records among various files.   Additionally, a conditions-of-release agreement was signed by the  requestor.  At present, however,  SSA is not releasing CWHS files  to the public pending legal clarification of restrictions on  release imposed by the Tax Reform Act of 1976.     a.   One percent sample annual Employee-Employer (Ee-Er) File          A 1 percent sample of social security numbers for which wage  and salary employment was reported in the reference year.  There is  one record for each employee-employer combination.  Basic data  elements: (1) personal characteristics--year of birth, sex, race;  (2) wages-annual taxable, quarterly taxable, and total estimated  wages; (3) employer-State and county, industry. coverage group  (farm, household, Federal civilian, etc.); (4) insurance status;  (5) benefit status.     b.   One percent sample annual Self-Employed (SE) file          A 1 percent sample of social security numbers for which self-  employment earnings subject to social security coverage were  reported in the reference year.  Basic data elements: (1) personal  characteristics-year of birth. sex, race; (2) self-employment--  taxable income, net comings, State and county, industry; (3)  taxable earnings (including wages, if any); (4) type of work-farm  or nonfarm self-employment (and wage indication. if any); (5)      insurance status; (6) benefit status.     c.   One percent sample Longitudinal Employee-Employer Data (LEED)       file          Assembled from the 1 percent sample annual Ee-Er records which  art prepared yearly.  In the annual files. one record is created  for each employee-employer combination during the year.  In the  longitudinal file, the original records from the various annual  files have been skeletonized, resequenced, and merged so that all  records associated with an employee over the time span of the file  appear                                     25                 together.  Basic data elements are the same as in the 1 percent  sample Ee-Er.     d.   One percent 1937 to date CWHS file,          A 1 percent sample of social security numbers issued  through cut-off date of file reflecting entire work experience in  covered employment.  Basic data elements: (1) personal  characteristics- year of birth, sex, race; (2) employment-number  and pattern of years employed, first and last years employed,  pattern of quarters employed (last 2 years), number of quarters of  coverage 1937 to date, pattern of quarters of coverage 1957 to  date; (3) type of work-farm or nonfarm, wage or self-employment;  (4) taxable earnings each year 1951 to date; (5) self-employment--  taxable income each year 1951 to year prior to current year, net  earnings, for year prior to current year; (6) insurance status; (7)  benefit status.     e.   One-tenth of 1 percent 1937 to date CWHS file          A 0.1 percent sample of social security numbers issued through  cutoff date of file reflecting entire work experience in covered  employment.  Basic data elements are generally the same as for the  1 percent CWHS except for more detailed earnings information, e.g.,  taxable wages each year 1937 to date, taxable farm wages each yew  1955 to date, quarterly wages each quarter of each year 1951 to  date, net earnings from self-employment each year 1956 to date.  In addition to the files described above, two others have been  created at the request of the Bureau of the Census and the Bureau  of Economic Analysis-the 1 percent sample and 10 percent sample  First Quarter Employee-Employer-Establishment file.  Microdata has  been made available from the 1 percent sample first quarter file;  however, only summary files and tabulations from the 10 percent  sample are available.                                     26                                                                          CHAPTER IV              Major Statistical Uses of Administrative Records             Most of this chapter is devoted to review of statistical uses  of administrative records in five selected Federal agencies.  These  agencies include: (1) the Internal Revenue Service and (2) the  Social Security Administration, which represent two of the largest  primary collectors of administrative data pertaining to individuals  and businesses. (3) the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which uses  administrative record data extensively in making estimates for the  national economic accounts and related statistical series; (4) the  Bureau of the Census, which uses a wide variety of administrative  records in developing sampling frames and evaluating survey data as  well as directly in estimating statistical-series; and (5) the  Small Business Administration, which is in the process of using  data from a variety of administrative sources in the development of  a general-purpose small business data base for use in research and  policy analysis.  Although them is no review of administrative  record use of the Bureau of Labor Statistics in this chapter,  Chapter V contains a major case study involving BLS use of  administrative records from the Unemployment insurance payroll tax  system.       The discussion of uses in this chapter is not intended to be  comprehensive.  Brief overviews of uses by agency are supplemented  by a few more detailed discussions of uses in specific programs.   The more detailed discussions involve primarily Census Bureau  programs in the area of economic statistics.  A number of Census  Bureau uses of administrative records in population statistics  programs are covered in some detail in other chapters (especially  Chapter VI).The overviews of IRS and SSA programs are brief, but  examples of uses of IRS and SSA administrative records appear  repeatedly in other chapters.  The narrative discussion of BEA uses  is brief, in part because many of the uses of administrative  records in economic accounts can be conveniently summarized in  tabular form.  The SBA discussion involves a new program still  under development and is intended primarily to illustrate problems  facing the development effort.       Chapter III has already provided some selected examples  illustrating the historical development of statistical use of  administrative records.  As with the examples cited in Chapter III,  most of the examples considered in this and subsequent chapters  involve direct or indirect use of primary administrative files such  as those documented in Chapter III. The distinction between  administrative and statistical data files, however, has not always  been made clear.  Therefore, to provide some additional perspective  on the process of making statistical uses of administrative  records, the first section of this chapter discusses some of the  general considerations involved in defining administrative record  files and in creating and using statistical files derived from  administrative records.  Following the first section, the remaining  five sections of the chapter discuss uses of administrative-based  statistical data on an agency-by-agency basis.  An appendix  contains selected tabular materials relating to the agency  discussions.                  A.  Defining Administrative Record Files                     and Using Them statistically          In statistical uses of records pertaining to persons or  businesses, the interest is generally in studying the  characteristics and attributes of groups of individual entities as  opposed to identifying specific entities and taking actions based  on their individual characteristics as in administrative uses.   Indeed, in censuses and surveys involving direct collection of  information for statistical use, it is usually felt to be important  to provide assurances to participating respondents that information  they supply will not be used as a direct basis for administrative  actions against (or for) them specifically.  Therefore, in this  report statistical (as opposed to administrative) record files will  generally be considered to be files which are not made available  for taking administrative action with respect to individual legal  entities (persons or businesses); i.e., files which are not used to  determine an individual reporting entity's legal obligations or  benefit entitlements.       Given the distinction between statistical and administrative  files just suggested, it should be acceptable to create statistical  files from administrative files, but not vice versa.  This concept  of ""functional separation"" of records is being considered in  proposed legislation (see Chapter VIII), and is applied in SSA's  Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to revise its Regulation No. 1, but  is not yet well established in either the regulations or the  procedural policies followed in many Federal agencies.  The result  is                                     27                 considerable variation and confusion in the extent to which  administrative records can be made available for statistical uses.   Problems related to limitations and confusion surrounding access to  administrative records for statistical use will be discussed in  connection with examples covered throughout the report; and the  legal aspects of the access issue will be reviewed in detail in  Chapter VIII.  The remainder of this section provides a brief, but  somewhat more general overview of considerations associated with  using administrative records for statistical purposes.       The primary distinction between administrative records and  statistical records is the ultimate use to which they are intended  to be put.  This usually means a parallel distinction in the degree  to which the statistician is in control of the design and  collection of the records.  Survey records and their collection  procedures are designed, documented and controlled to yield the  desired statistical characteristics.  When administrative records  are used statistically, the statistician must locate existing  records and determine their conceptual suitability for the intended  use.  And the statistician must also devise methods for overcoming  technical problems frequently encountered in making new uses of  existing records.       As noted in Chapter III, most statistical uses of admin-  istrative records have developed on an ad hoc basis.  With the  exception of uses by the collecting agency to generate statistics  needed for program administration, there are few examples of  administrative record systems that have been designed with  statistical uses in mind.  In most instances the statistician,  faced with the problem of generating statistics for a particular  policy analysis, fund distribution, or program evaluation purpose,  has approached an administrative record system from the standpoint  of what is available for the current application. in some instances  these ad hoc uses have become regularized and institutionalized,  but only rarely have statisticians specified changes in the design  or procedures of an administrative record system necessary to yield  more reliable statistics.  This is true even when the statistical  analysis provides essential feedback for the operation of the  administrative system.       Statistical uses of the various administrative record sets  have generally been uncoordinated.  A body of uses and users have  developed independently for each record set.  For this reason, and  because the records are collected by different agencies with  differing legislation governing their collection and use, there is  very little standardization of the accessibility, documentation,  format, and quality of information available from the various  record systems.       Statistical uses of administrative records, moreover, are  often met with some resistance from the operating personnel of the  collecting agency.  This is partially due to diffusion of  responsibilities.  Organizations which have responsibilities for  assembling statistics are usually no the same as those which have  responsibilities for maintaining administrative records and  consequently producing and using agencies have differing  priorities.  Even the statistical units of administrative agencies  are primarily responsible for meeting the statistical needs of that  program and only secondarily for meeting the statistical needs of  other Federal agencies, State and local governments, and other  public and private concerns.  Statistical uses are often viewed by  administrative personnel as an annoying addition to their already  overburdened work schedules.       Other reasons for this resistance are related to confiden-  tiality restrictions and the massive nature of the record sets.   Many of the record sets are collected with either formal or  informal assurances of confidentiality to the participating  entities.  Administrative personnel are therefore either unable or  reluctant to make the records available for statistical use.  Many  of the record sets are so large, amounting to many millions of  records, that even a seemingly minor change in the information to  be collected or the collection and processing procedures could have  far reaching cost and timing repercussions.                            B. Internal Revenue Service          The Internal Revenue Service, in its role as tax collector,  acquires millions of records from nearly all units of the economy:  individuals, proprietorships, corporations, and nonprofit  institutions.  These records are collected for tax-administration  rather than statistical purposes.  They are, however, used to  generate a wide variety of statistics.  The Statistics Division of  the IRS has responsibility for assembling statistics from tax  records.  These statistics are used for program planning and many  are also published for general use.       The program planning uses range from analyses of simple  operating statistics, such as the number of returns processed and  taxes paid, to analyses of alternative tax policies, including the  assessment of revenues that would be raised under alternative  policies and the impact of those policies on the economy.       The publications for general use include the Statistics of  Income reports (annual) based on individual, corporate and other  business tax returns; occasional reports based on information  obtained from fiduciary, estate, foreign and other tax returns and  schedules; and first-time reports (in preparation) on finances of  tax-exempt organizations and pensions plans.  Supplemental reports  are prepared biannually which classify information from individual  returns by SMSA and by county.  These reports are used to provide  basic information for tax studies by Congress and                                     28                 its committees, for administrative use by the Secretary of the  Treasury and the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and by other  Federal agencies, as for example, in BEA's construction of national  and regional economic accounts.  They are also used for general  economic research in the areas of income and wealth.  Many of the IRS statistical series are produced from samples of tax  returns.  The sample files, devoid of identifying information, are  made available to bona fide researchers on a cost reimbursable  basis.  The appendix includes a description of the major  administrative record files maintained by IRS. as well as a list of  Statistics of Income publications.       The extensive statistical use of IRS records is indicated not  only by the diversity of IRS publications and internal programs,  but also by the prominent role of IRS records and tabulations in  the uses to be discussed later in this chapter for the Bureau of  Economic Analysis, the Census Bureau, and the Small Business  Administration.  In addition, IRS data play prominent roles in many  of the case studies examined in Chapters V and VI.                         C. Social Security Administration          The Continuous Work History Sample statistical program of SSA  has already been discussed in Chapter III.  But the CWHS program  emphasizes work-related data from its payroll tax program much more  than data connected directly with SSA disbursement of benefits  under its various programs.  In addition to regular Old Age,  Survivors, and Disability Insurance benefit programs, SSA also  administers the Supplemental Security Income program for the needy,  aged, blind, and disabled and the Aid to Families with Dependent  Children program which provides financial assistance to certain  qualified needy children; and until a reorganization within the  Department of Health, Education, and Welfare in March 1977, admi-  nistered the health insurance program under Medicare.  The Medicare  program is now administered by the Health Care Financing  Administration, but SSA continues to provide selected data  processing services for HCFA.  And SSA is also continuing to  administer the distribution of certain black lung benefits to coal  miners and their families.  In this case SSA responsibility covers  some new claims as well as those claims that were filed before the  basic black lung program was transferred to the Department of  Labor.       In administering these varied and complex programs, a great  many records are maintained from which statistics are regularly  generated.  These statistics relate to general and specific aspects  of the various SSA programs, dealing with number of claims, number  and amount of benefit payments, post entitlement actions,  administrative costs, etc.       Throughout the development of the social security system,  research has been important to policy formulation and program  administration.  The Office of Research and Statistics is the chief  research resource of SSA and has the responsibility for all program  statistics and for analyses required by the Administration and by  Congress.  In carrying out its mission, ORS disseminates a large  volume of statistics in the monthly Social Security Bulletin and  its Annual Statistical Supplement as well as in other reports,  papers, and statistical releases.  The appendix (section G.2) gives  an illustration of the great variety of statistics that are  produced by ORS.  The tables listed there were taken from the table  of contents of the 1976 Annual Statistical Supplement to the Social  Security Bulletin.                          D. Bureau of Economic Analysis          BEA relies heavily on administrative records in the  preparation of national economic accounts and related measures.   BEA's estimates of current economic activity are based, with few  exceptions, on analysis of primary data obtained from other  agencies.  This use of available materials is economical because it  does not require extensive primary data collection activities.  It  has the further advantage of not adding to the reporting burdens of  businesses and individuals.  The process does, however, place a  burden on analysts in terms of adapting data designed for other  uses, remaining alert to changes. in source data-, and researching  potential new data sources.  In this dual role as an intensive user  and producer of government statistics, BEA accumulates more  experience than most other agencies with the systematic use of a  wide variety of administrative records.  The lack of consistent  definitions and procedures, uncoordinated formats and presentation  techniques, and inadequate timing are familiar to the BEA analyst  who must be aware of and make adjustments for deficiencies in  primary data.       The list of administrative record tabulations which are used  directly to estimate components of the national income and product  accounts, the national input-output tables, and the international  accounts is extensive and includes various types of tax records,  regulatory records, financial records of the Federal Reserve System  and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, custom reports, and  budget documents.  Tables IV.1, IV.2, and IV.3 list the components  of the NIPA, input-output accounts and international accounts which  are based on administrative records.  The tables also indicate the  source of the records used.  In addition, Table IV.4 lists  components of the NIPA that are based on data from current surveys  for                                     29                 which the sampling frames have been developed from administrative  record sources. (The development of such sampling frames is  discussed in the Census Bureau section).       BEA's estimates of State and local area personal income  involve the use of many of the same administrative record sets  indicated for components of national personal income in Table IV.  1. In fact, since most current statistical surveys have sample  sizes that we too small to provide reliable State and local data,  administrative records play a relatively more important role in  State and local than in national personal income estimates.  Tax  records and budget documents are the most important sources.  The  Unemployment Insurance payroll tax program (see the case study in  Chapter V) is the principal source of wage and salary data, IRS tax  returns are the principal basis for estimating most components of  property income and nonfarm proprietors' income; and government  disbursement and related records are the basis for estimating the  bulk of transfer payments to individuals.       For most of its work, BEA uses tabulations of records  maintained by other agencies rather than using microdata files  directly.  In a program to develop estimates of family personal  income size distribution, however,  BEA is working cooperatively  with SSA in the use of statistical matching techniques to merge  information from administrative-based microdata files with Current  Population Survey records.  The administrative data include SSA's  summary earnings and benefit records and IRS records from the  Individual Master File, Statistics of Income File, and Taxpayer  Compliance Measurement Program File.  An additional administrative-  based microdata file used extensively by BEA, particularly in  regional analysis, is SSA's employee-employer Continuous Work  History Sample (see Chapter III).  In each of these microdata files  used at BEA. individual identifiers have been removed or scrambled""  to protect confidentiality.  Even so, BEA access to several key  flies including the CWHS and TCMP files has been at least  temporarily halted by the Tax Reform Act of 1976.                 Table IV.1 National Income and Product Account              Components Based on Administrative Records     NIPA Component                                  Administrative Record     Personal consumption expenditures:     Tobacco and alcohol ...........

Census Bureau          The Bureau of the Census is the largest primary data  collection agency in the Nation.  It conducts the decennial  censuses of population and housing, economic censuses, agricultural  censuses, censuses of governments, special censuses and numerous  sample surveys.  In addition to these vast data collection  activities, the Bureau is also a major user of administrative  records.  It uses them directly to tabulate time-series information  and indirectly in a variety of ways including: design and  evaluation of censuses and surveys; identification of sampling  universe; estimates for non-surveyed portions of the universe; and  imputations for missing cells.       The distinctions between administrative and statistical  records become particularly blurred with the Census Bureau  applications because so many of the records which we generally  consider as statistical are derived from censuses or surveys which  utilize administrative records in many important ways.  Even the  decennial censuses have in the past, utilized administrative  records in design and evaluation phases.       Chapter III has already noted a major Census Bureau  administrative records program for developing intercensal  population and per capita income estimates for use in distributing  General Revenue Sharing funds to State and local areas.  Chapter  III also mentioned the importance of administrative records in  evaluation programs for the decennial censuses.  And Chapter VI  contains three detailed case studies illustrating administrative  record use in evaluation and improvement projects for the 1980  Census and in development plans for the proposed Survey of Income  and Program Participation household survey.  The examples of  administrative record uses cited in the remainder of this section  will be drawn primarily from areas of Census Bureau responsibility  for developing business and economic statistics.     1. Economic Censuses          Under Title 13 of the United States Code, the Bureau of the  Census is required to conduct a group of economic censuses at five-  year intervals in the years ending in ""2"" and ""7"", the latest one  covering 1977.  This group includes the Census of Manufactures  (initiated in the year 1810), Mineral Industries (1840), Retail and  Wholesale Trade and Construction Industries (1929), Selected  Service industries(1933), Public Warehouses(1935), Transportation  (1963), and beginning in 1977 the remaining Service Industries  (Medical, Educational and Non-Profit Areas).       In order to minimize the cost of the censuses and relieve the  business community of reporting burden, the Census Bureau makes  extensive use, under strict confidentiality restrictions, of  selected information derived from tax records.  These records form  an integral part of the preparatory and collection phases of the  economic censuses.  The universe of business firms is based on  selected information extracted from tax records for a tax year  period encompassing the census year.  This information. received on  computer tape includes (1) firm name and address; (2)  identification number, (3) legal form of organization. (4) business  activity code; (5) number of employees; and (6) payroll by quarter.       For the 1977 economic censuses, the above basic information  was integrated with the Standard Statistical Establishment List  (see Chapter V) and other sources.  This process provided an almost  complete list of approximately 12,000,000 business firms engaged in  economic activity in the United States (including social and  professional services) classified by kind of business and  approximate size with employers and nonemployers separately  identified.  For this universe. the following subgroups were  identified:          1.   Those 5,200,000 businesses that could be excused from            filing any questionnaire because their kind of business            as determined from tax records was not in scope of the            economic censuses;       2.   Those 3,800,000 in-scope small businesses that could be            excused from filing any questionnaire since limited data            (receipts, payroll) extracted from tax records could be            used to develop equivalent census-type data;       3.   Those 3,000,000 larger businesses that were engaged in            activities in-scope of the Censuses.  Direct reporting            was required for these firms in order to obtain all the            information needed for the census results.     Therefore data for approximately 56% of the total business  establishments covered in the economic censuses are extracted from  administrative records.  Data for companies that were not canvassed  are obtained from the following additional items of information  extracted from tax records:          1.   Employment       2.   Payroll       3.   Sales or receipts       4.   Physical location (not available if left blank on tax            forms)       5.   Business status at end-of-year       6.   Number of months in business     The cost of obtaining these extracts of tax records was less than  $2 million out of the total economic census budget.  The equivalent  cost to the Government of obtaining census reports from the excused  group of about 8.500,000 businesses would have been at least 10  times                                     32                 that amount given the availability of a complete mailing list of  the excused businesses.       The quality of statistics produced by this meshing of tax  records with reports to the Census Bureau would likely result in  more complete coverage than that obtained by full field enumeration  or combinations of field and mail enumeration techniques.  For  example, the field-enumerated 1948 Census of Business undercounted  the number of standard retail establishments by at least 150,000.   The undercount of nonstore business (e.g., mail order. house-to-  house, vending machine, and service businesses) was also  substantial but could not be determined using standard post  enumeration surveys.  In fact, the latter group in many cases can  only be identified from tax records.  In addition to identifying  the universe, data from IRS tax records are also used for companies  which fail to report and for editing the reported data provided by  the respondent. (See Chapter VII for a discussion of quality  problems with administrative-based statistics.)     2.   Census of Agriculture          The Census of Agriculture, started in 1840 and taken at  5-year intervals beginning in the 1920's, is the only source of  statistics on agriculture that are comparable, county by county, on  a nation-wide basis for farms classified by size, tenure, type of  organization, market value of farm Products sold, and type of farm  enterprise.  The census data are widely used by Federal, State and  local governments in a variety of ways in the administration of  various farm programs, as benchmarks for the current crop NW  livestock estimates issued by the Department of Agriculture, and in  the preparation of overall measures of the economy such as the  input-output ut tables for the national economic accounts.  Prior to the 1969 census, data collection was by personal  interview.  Information copies were distributed by mail to all  households on rural routes and to post office boxes in rural  communities in the effort to locate all farm operators and have  them complete the report prior to its pickup by the enumerator.   Correlated with the burgeoning increase in the size of farms, there  has been continuing rise in the number of farmers who do not live  on the farm they operate--that is, a growing number of operators  for whom door-to-door enumeration is not a practical possibility.   Furthermore, the availability of capable people willing to accept  short-term employment as census enumerators has steadily declined,  making it more and more difficult to recruit an acceptable field  staff in all areas.  Fortunately, the availability of farm-related  mailing lists from administrative records had increased corres-  pondingly and this factor was instrumental in redesign of the dam  collection procedures.       In planning for the 1969 Census of Agriculture, it became  evident that the method of data collection should be changed from  personal interview to a mail enumeration procedure based on  administrative records.  The size measure contained in the  administrative tax records was the controlling factor that enabled  the Bureau to send abbreviated report forms to small farmers and  thereby reduce the reporting burden for nearly one-half of the  nation's farm operators.  This resulted in an obvious reduction in  costs for collecting and processing the census data.  Subsequent  censuses, including the 1978 Census of Agriculture, which is  underway, have benefitted from the experiences and results obtained  from the 1969 undertaking where under-enumeration of small farms  was a severe problem.     3.   Survey of Minority-Owned Businesses (SMOBE)          In 1969, SMOBE was conducted as a special project  and funded by various government agencies to determine the extent  of business ownership by minorities.  Beginning in 1972, SMOBE  became a part of the economic censuses that are required by law  every five years.  SMOBE is issued in a four part series covering  businesses owned by Blacks, persons of Spanish Origin, Asian  Americans, American Indians and Other Minorities.  Data published cover number of firms, gross receipts, and number of  paid employees.  Tax records are used extensively in developing the  statistics.  For example, minority ownership is measured for the  segments of the business population using HRS corporation,  partnership and sole proprietorship tax forms and Social Security  Administration race codes to identify businesses for ""Whites"",  ""Negroes"" and ""Other Minorities."" A mail survey is required to  determine businesses owned by persons of Spanish Origin and the  specific minority groups included in the ""Other"" minority category.   However, the mail survey is minimal compared to the effort and  costs that would be involved if tax records were not available.  (See Chapter VII for a further note on limitations of SSA race  codes.)     4.   Current Economic Indicators          In addition to the quinquennial economic censuses and  the 5-year census of agriculture, the Census Bureau conducts a  broad series of weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual sample  surveys in the industrial, distributive trades and service areas.   Some of these surveys have been in existence for several decades  and have been converted from a design based primarily on use of  area samples.i.e., an enumerator canvass of businesses located in a  sample of land area segments--to a mail canvass of sample of  businesses selected from the comprehensive tax file of firms  classified by size and industry.       The samples used to collect information concerning the  distributive and service mules are primarily drawn from a                                     33                 list of employer firms obtained from administrative tax records and  updated through reconciliation to the economic census results.  The  volatility of changes in the business universe, however, requires  that the sampling be updated often, if possible every quarter, to  include new business establishments and to delete those no longer  in operation.  This updating process is based on information  received from IRS on additions to and deletions from its list of  active businesses.  The total list of businesses obtained from IRS  source&serves; as a control to assure that the data compiled in fact  fully cover the sectors surveyed.       In the current industrial statistics program, similar updating  procedures from administrative records we followed but on a less  frequent basis. This includes the annual survey of manufactures,  the monthly survey of manufacturers shipments, inventories, and  orders and the more than 100 other current industrial reports  relate to specific commodity areas such as fats and oils, paper and  paperboard, and steel. The availability of updated complete tax  files has made it possible for the Bureau to undertake on very  short notice special surveys designed to meet policy-makers' needs.  Recently, for example, the Bureau undertook, at the request of the  Federal Reserve, a survey of industrial capacity to improve the  statistics relating to current business conditions.  Surveys  involving energy-related industries have also recently been  instituted.  In general, the availability of lists of businesses  classified by industrial category provides the Bureau with great  flexibility in meeting new or changed objectives.     5.   The Standard Statistical Establishment List Program          The SSEL program is discussed in detail in Chapter V; but it  should be noted here that the SSEL provides an important mechanism  for coordinating most of the economic censuses and surveys  discussed above.  In addition, County Business Pattern publications  of employment and payroll data for State and local areas are now  based directly on the SSEL.                         F. Small Business Administration          Federal economic and business statistics have generally not  been well designed for the analysis of small business.  Many  agencies do not prepare tabulations by size of business and them  have been no standard guidelines for preparing size class data so  that data available by size frequently cannot be readily compared  or integrated across agency sources.  Size class data, moreover,  are often not available for comparable reporting units or on the  basis of comparable size indicators.  IRS corporate tax return  data, for example, are available for tax paying units which differ  from the establishment concept used in the preparation of most  Census Bureau business data.  Moreover, Census size class  statistics usually do not distinguish between establishments that  are separate business entities and establishments that are a part  of larger multi-unit companies, and most Census size class data use  employment as the indicator of establishment size, whereas IRS  business income tax returns collect no employment data and are  traditionally tabulated by size using such alternative indicators  as level of assets or business reports       To address the problem of inadequate data relating to small  business, an interagency committee has recently been formed with a  mandate from the President to establish a small business data base.   SBA has been charged with the principal responsibility for  assembling the data base.  And because of the high paperwork costs  to small businesses of detailed Federal business reporting  requirements, emphasis in developing the new data base will be  placed on utilizing existing primary data sources and particularly  on more efficient statistical use of administrative records.  The  initial focus of the interagency committee has been placed on  developing proposed standards for tabulation of data by business  size and on developing approaches to resolving such problems as the  difficulty of obtaining size data based on comparable reporting  units and comparable indicators of business size.       Some promising approaches to improving small business data are  being tried.  IRS, for example, is currently linking payroll tax  reports to corporate income tax returns in order to add employment  and payroll measures to its corporate tax data base.  And plans are  underway to use various tax records to develop a longitudinal data  base for a sample of business units.  Nevertheless, the problems  associated with improving the utilization of existing record  collection mechanisms are formidable.  One critical problem is the  lack of adequate access to a systematic business list, such as the  SSEL, which can be used to identify the various kinds of business  reporting units and link together business reports in ways that  desired variables can be tabulated on the basis of common size  classifications and reporting unit concepts.  Indeed, the SSEL  would appear to be a central factor in efforts to solve a variety  of data problems extending well beyond the need for small business  data per se, and even involving a variety of problems relating to  developing data files pertaining to individual workers.  Because of  its wide-ranging importance, the SSEL program is described in some  detail in the next chapter.  Issues of access to the SSEL are  covered in Chapter VIII.                                     34                               G. Appendix IV.1.

The potential for major new uses of  administrative records may in fact be quite limited because of  these problems and other Problems such as incomplete establishment  reporting, poor timing, and confidentiality restrictions.  there  are, however, some new developments which present opportunities for  improving the coordination and statistical use of key  administrative record sets.       This chapter examines three evolving programs which illustrate  the potential and problems associated with efforts to improve the  statistical utilization of business reports obtained in connection  with tax-related administrative data collection.  The programs are  the Census Bureau's development of the Standard Statistical Estab-  lishment List, the Social Security Administration's effort to  adjust its data programs to new administrative procedures calling  for annual (forms W-2 and W-3) rather than quarterly (form 941)  employer reports of individual worker wages, and the Bureau of  Labor Statistics' cooperative program with State Employment  Security Agencies to make statistical use of records collected in  connection with Unemployment Insurance payroll taxes.       The SSEL program represents an explicit attempt to identify  the most useful definition of business establishment units for  statistical analysis purposes, and to build ""bridges,"" when  necessary, between these statistical units and legal entities for  which tax and other administrative reports are available.  The SSEL  not only is intended to facilitate more efficient direct use of  administrative records for statistical purposes, but it also has  been planned as a vehicle for coordinating statistical data  collection efforts so that data collected from business in  different programs can more easily be compared and integrated.  In  this connection the SSA and UI payroll tax programs represent  particularly important administrative data collection programs,  because both payroll tax programs have statistical components which  involve requests for multiestablishment businesses to provide  supplemental ""establishment"" information with their tax reports in  order to permit tabulation of employment and payroll data by  industry and geographic areas.  A number of important advantages  could be derived from better coordination of the SSA and UI  establishment reporting plans with each other and the SSEL; but  there are also a number of legal, institutional, and technical  obstacles to improved coordination.  The discussion in this chapter  and much of the remainder of the report (especially chapters VII  and VIII) illustrates these potential advantages and the barriers  to improvement in addition to describing applications of the data  collected through current business establishment reporting  procedures.       While the emphasis in this chapter is on information collected  from businesses, both the SSA and UI payroll tax programs involve  the collection of data (from businesses) pertaining to individual  workers.  In fact, the focus of SSA statistical use of payroll tax  data has been the Continuous Work History Sample program which is  organized explicitly around individual worker records.  The UI  program has been directed primarily toward utilizing aggregate  establishment reports of employment and payroll, but a program to  develop a Continuous Wage Benefit History sample is underway using  individual worker records collected in connection with the UI prog-  ram.  Just as a general coordination of the SSA and UI  establishment reporting plans with the SSEL program would provide  important statistical advantages. so would coordination and linkage  of the CWHS and CWBH individual record systems.  This chapter does  not deal with such individual record linkage efforts, but Chapter  VI provides several case studies illustrating the advantages and  problems associated with efforts to link data from various  individual record systems.                    A. Standard Statistical Establishment List          There has been a long history of endorsement of the general  principle that a centrally compiled list of firms and their  establishments should be available for multiagency use in the  conduct of statistical samples.  Presently, each government  statistical agency is responsible for compiling and maintaining the  business register needed                                     43                 for their particular statistical applications.  The use of  independently developed lists. with attendant differences in  definition and coverage. seriously affects the comparability of the  economic data provided by the various agencies. and also results in  considerable duplication of effort and costs and increases in  respondent reporting burden.  Concerns such a-, these constitute a  substantial part of the criticism of government statistical  programs.       The Office of Federal Statistical Policy and Standards of the  Department of Commerce (formerly Division of Statistical Policy of  the Office of Management and Budget) has been a consistent advocate  of a central list concept.  Towards this end. in 1968. the Bureau  of the Census was designated by OMB as the focal agency for the  development. establishment and operation of such a directory (known  as the Standard Statistical Establishment List--SSEL) on behalf of  Federal statistical agencies.  Funding for the project started in  fiscal year 1972 with an operational Directory available covering  data year 1974.       Construction of the SSEL was known to be technically feasible  since the methodology had been followed previously in assembling  the economic censuses mailing list and in utilizing administrative  data.  Since the linkage among the principal source agencies. i.e..  Census, IRS., and SSA is the common usage of the Employer  Identification Number by all three agencies. and using the estab-  lishment as the basic ""building block"" of the SSEL, it is possible  to link together and identify the affiliation of parent companies.  subsidiary firms, and their establishments throughout all phases of  economic activity.     1. File Construction          The SSEL now consists of a central multi-purpose computerized  name and address file of all known multiestablishment and single  establishment employer firms in the United States.  The systems  design for computer processing is predicated on variable word-  length record which permits additional information to be added as  desired.     2.   Multiestablishment Firms          Information for multiestablishment firms was initially derived  from Census Bureau records.  From the 1972 Economic Censuses, the  necessary basic information had been assembled for the  organizational units of all firms included in the economic  censuses.  All establishments of these firms were linked to the  enterprise level and were identified by their individual SIC codes,  physical locations. employment size codes, etc.; and all known  domestic establishments of these multiunit firms were identified  regardless of activity.  This practice represented a departure from  that of previous censuses where records were maintained only for  establishments engaged in activities defined as within the scope of  the economic censuses.  Multiestablishment companies not covered by  the economic censuses were identified in a two-stage survey.  In  November 1972, as part of the Economic Census processing. all legal  entities with 50 or more employees were canvassed to determine  their enterprise structure.  Each legal entity was requested to  list all companies it owned or controlled and the name and EI  number of its controlling company, if any.  Information was also  requested on employment, kind of industrial activity, and number of  business locations operated under that EI number.  Detailed  listings of establishments were not requested in this survey since  the major emphasis was to consolidate those legal entities into  their correct enterprise structure.  This operation was coordinated  with the regular Economic Census processing to produce an  integrated file.  A similar survey was conducted in January 1974  covering calendar year 1973 to canvass smaller entities with 20-49  employees.  In addition, 175,000 small out-of-scope companies (less  than 20 employees) were canvassed in 1974 if classified in an  activity changed by the 1972 SIC revision.     3.   Single Establishment Firms          Approximately 80% of the universe of business establishments  with one or more employees are single establishment firms  represented by one EI number.  For these establishments. the  enterprise, legal entity and establishment are identical.  For this  reason, information for single establishment firms was derived from  the administrative records of other government agencies since it  would be difficult to justify the government and respondent cost  involved in duplicating this information by direct survey contact.       The Business Master File of IRS served as the basic universe  file from which the single unit company listing was derived.  This  source provided company name. address, EI number and legal form of  organization for all firms with one or more paid employees.       March 12 employment and the Standard Industrial Classification  Code were obtained from the records of the Social Security  Administration.  The four quarters of payroll were obtained from  IRS records.       In constructing the multiestablishment company file. the  Census Bureau recorded the EI number of the entity owning the  establishment in conjunction with the SSEL File Number.  Matching  these EI numbers of multiunit firms against the Business Master  File (El file) and unduplicating, the residual list resulted in the  establishment of the single unit file.  Using these inputs, the  SSEL became operational covering data year 1974 and is now used as                                     44                 the mailing list source and sampling frame for all Census Bureau  economic programs.     4.   File Maintenance          The use of administrative records has played an integral part  in creating, maintaining, and updating the SSEL file.  During  noncensus years, the single establishment file (approximately 4  million records) is updated solely from administrative records.   New births are received monthly from, IRS and SSA with information  on name and address, EI number, SIC code and legal form of  organization code.  Employment and payroll data are received  quarterly.  Geographic codes are assigned by Census from the  address information received from IRS and SSA.       For multiestablishment firms, a company organization survey  was undertaken to insure that the organizational structure of each  company is updated at least once each year.  This survey includes  companies in scope of the Economic Censuses as well as out-of-scope  companies covered in a special survey.  Preprinted forms are sent  to each company. listing all establishments known to be operated by  it including name and physical location of each establishment.  The  company is requested to update these listings and report March 12  employment, first quarter payroll and annual payroll by  establishment location.  The reported payroll is then compared to  the IRS administrative payroll at the EI and company level, and  discrepancies resolved.  In addition, administrative record  employment and payroll is used to impute nonmail or delinquent  companies.  Several working papers describing the SSEL system have  been written (U.S. Bureau of the Census. 1979).  Copies can be  obtained from the Census Bureau.  Because of the cost of annual  maintenance, a complete file of zero employee cases is available  only from each quinquennial Economic Census.     5.   Confidentiality          Current legislative restrictions, including title 13 of the  Census Act, do not permit the release of the SSEL to other agencies  for statistical use.  Legislation has been proposed, however, which  would permit the release of this file to certain other Federal  agencies (see Chapter VIII).                              B. W-2 and W-3 Records          Starting in 1979 with data for tax year 1978, a significant  change took place in the method of reporting to the Social Security  Administration the wages paid to employees by their employers.  A  single annual wage reporting system began under which forms W-2 are  used as the report of individual employee wages for both social  security and income tax purposes.  This eliminates the quarterly  reporting of a detailed listing of wages paid to each employee  covered under social security.  Employers still have to file  quarterly reports containing wage and tax liability information  with the Internal Revenue Service.  State and local government  employment is excluded from the annual reporting system.        Under the annual reporting system, forms W-2 along with  transmittal forms W-3 (see Figure V.1) are received at one of four  SSA Data Operations Centers where the material is examined for  completeness and correspondence initiated with employers having  incomplete shipments.  After microfilming, the documents are  prepared for optical scanning or key-to-tape operations.  The data  on the output tapes are then transmitted to SSA's Central Office  via telecommunications equipment.  Here the data are merged with  data from employers who submit their reports directly on magnetic  tape and all the data are subjected to a series of computer  balancing and validation operations.  All validated earnings items,  those taxable under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act as well  as other earnings, are forwarded to IRS for processing for income  tax purposes.  Copies of the validated FICA items are retained by  SSA to update the Summary Earnings Record for individual employees.       The new W-2, W-3. reporting system has a number of positive  and negative implications for SSA's Continuous Work History Sample  statistical programs. (See Chapter III for a description of the  current CWHS system.) The most important positive features of the  new annual reporting system are that for the first time SSA will  have information on total wages paid to an individual, thus  eliminating the need to estimate wages above the maximum that is  taxable for social security purposes; and that initially the system  will include information on employees not covered by social  security as well as covered employees.  Privacy and Tax Reform Act  questions, however, remain to. be resolved relating to the extent  to which data for uncovered employees can be used for statistical  purposes in the CWHS program.       On the negative side, there will no longer be data on  individual earnings amounts by quarter.  Also, there are  preliminary indications that the items for statistical processing  will not be available until sometime later than under the quarterly  reporting system.  There are also indications that the SSA's  Establishment Reporting Plan could be adversely affected because of  the nature of the reporting requirements for forms W-2 and W-3.       Another aspect of the new annual reporting system that has  great statistical potential is the employee's address on the form  W-2.  These addresses could be coded to obtain residence geographic  information.  Unfortunately, present procedure does not call for  SSA to capture this information                                      45      in any machine readable form.  However, the possibility of  retaining this information in the future is presently being  pursued.       The units which employers use for establishing summary (W-3)  reports presently differ widely among employers under SSA's  voluntary establishment reporting plan (see chapter VII).  If  employers were to use the establishment definitions and codes  developed by the Census Bureau for its Standard Statistical  Establishment List, the resulting file of W-3 forms would be  immensely more useful for statistical purposes that is if the W-3  forms were collected with Census Bureau establishment codes and  confidentiality problems restricting SSA-Census interchange of  records were resolved, the SSEL could be used to code  establishments by industry and geographic location (State, county,  and possibly subcounty units), The resultant file could be used to  provide tabulations of annual wage and salary income and employment  by industry for detailed geographic units.  Such tabulations could  be used to improve a number of statistical programs, including  BEA's State and local area personal income accounts and the Census  Bureau's County Business Patterns program.  In addition, the  improved geographic coding for the individual records (W-2's)  associated with the W-3's would improve the CWHS program and if  used in conjunction with W-2 (or other;                                     46                 residence information, would permit the development of valuable  intercensal commuting estimates for local areas.  Currently,  however, not only is vital SSA access to the SSEL limited by  legislation, but there would appear to be substantial employer  resistance to proposals that they report to SSA on the basis of  SSEL establishment concepts (which frequently involve more detailed  establishment reports than called for in SSA's voluntary establish-  ment reporting plan).                      C. Unemployment Insurance System          A case study of the statistical usefulness of administrative  records for establishments can be gleaned from the unemployment  insurance system.  This system was established as part of the  Social Security Act of 1935 to serve as a countercyclical income  maintenance program for offsetting losses in wage and salary income  of the experienced work force.  Initially, UI covered only  employers in the private nonfarm economy with eight or more  employees.  Over the years, the system has been continuously ex-  panded.  In March 1978, over 90 percent of employed workers were  covered by the State and Federal UI system.       In the UI system, a variety of administrative data is  maintained.  Three important data sets which serve as the primary  source of statistical uses are discussed in this Chapter (see  Figure V.2).       First of all, there is a master list of more than 4 million  subject employers which contains the names and addresses of covered  firms and both actuarial and statistical information.  Secondly,  information from the quarterly tax reports filed by employers is  maintained.  Finally, in all but 12 States, firms report the total  wages paid to each employee during the quarter to determine an  individual's eligibility and benefit amount when filing a UI claim.     1. Master List of Employers          State agencies collect and process certain statistical  information to help provide standardization for reports and  tabulations.  Employers are assigned county and industry codes.   Industrial activity is reviewed on a three-year cycle, and attempts  are made at identifying multiestablishment employers and setting in  place a mechanism for Supplemental reports of employment and wages  by county and industry.  The UI list is used by State agencies to  draw samples in the Federal-State programs sponsored by BLS and  operated by the States.  A number of States also use the list to  publish industrial directories.  The lists are provided to the  Bureau of Labor Statistics to use for sampling purposes under a  pledge of confidentiality.  BLS uses the lists to develop its UI  Name and Address File which serves as a sampling frame for its  directly collected surveys.       The UI Name and Address File has a number of drawbacks.  Since  it is derived from an administrative source, many of the  refinements needed for sampling purposes are not present.  For  example, the major identifying field in the file is a UI account  number which is assigned independently by the various States.   There is no unique way to identify firms or companies within a  corporate structure across States.  Also, identification of  multiestablishment employers varies from State to State.     2.   Employers' Quarterly Tax Report          Taxes are collected quarterly from subject employers by  mailing each employer a tax form on which he reports the total  wages paid to employees during the quarter, the amount of these  wages that is subject to taxes, the taxes due, and the number of  employees on the payrolls for the period that includes the twelfth  of each month.  The tax forms are due at the State agency 30 days  after the end of the reference quarter.  Multiestablishment  employers are also mailed a statistical supplement with their tax  report requesting a breakdown of the monthly employment and wage  figures by reporting unit.  Five months after the end of the  quarter, State summaries in machine readable form are sent to BLS,  Washington.  Two summaries are required of each State: (1)  Statewide by four-digit industry, and (2) counties by two-digit  industry.  States that can provide four-digit industry by county,  need only send one summary.  These summaries are called ES-202  reports.       Many programs of the BLS and BEA rely on the ES-202 report's  employment and wage data.  Within BLS, the Current Employment  Statistics, Labor Turnover Statistics, the Occupational Employment  Statistics.  Industry Projections, and Occupation Safety and Health  Statistics programs are benchmarked to industrial employment data  emanating from the ES-202 report.  The BEA national income and  personal income estimates rely heavily on the UI administrative  data.  In addition, personal income is used in formulas to allocate  billions in Federal funds to State and local governments.  At the  local level the average wages of workers covered by UI are used to  adjust the average annual wage payments allowed Comprehensive  Employment and Training Act Public Service Employees.  The State  agencies also make substantial use of employment and wage data to  assess the economic vitality of local labor markets in their labor  market information programs.  Practically every employment related  statistic that is generated in the BLS-BEA-State employment agency  enclave has the UI administrative as its base.  The ES-202 report  has its limitations and problems. There is no set mechanism of  quality control to assure that                                     47     all subject employers are reporting.  There is no program of  quality assurance for ascertaining the accuracy of data reported by  employers on their tax reports.  Statistical reports which are a  by-product of an administrative program often receive a low  priority.  The statistical functions in producing the ES-202 report  compete for basic UI program resources with tax collections.  benefit payment. and research activities.  Hence, many States  cannot fully implement industry coding and multiestablishment  ""breakout"" activities.     3. Individual Wage Records          In most States, the collection of the quarterly tax reports  also involves an itemization of individual workers' wage payments  identified by social security number.  This data base provides a  rich source of information on an individual's earnings history.   The Current Wage and Benefit History program of the U.S. Department  of Labor is attempting to tap this data base to link earnings  experience with workers' eligibility and receipt of UI benefits.   Since each individual's earnings are linked to the employer,  studies on wage dispersions by industry and county (on a place of  work basis) are feasible.  These files are also being used to map  mobility patterns and labor turnover actions as part of Labor's  Employment Service Potential program.     4.   Improving Data Quality          The UI administrative data have room for improvement because  of the large and cumbersome task of identifying multiestablishment  employers.  Their major strength is the quarterly collection and  timeliness versus other sources of establishment records-namely,  the Census Bureau's County Business Patterns program.  Census does  considerable work annually in identifying and maintaining  multiestablishment breakdowns of firms in its Company Organization  Survey.  Access to these data could help identify and refine  multiestablishment reporting problems in the UI record system.       At the same time, one of the weaknesses of the Census'  establishment records is the industry codes of single-establishment  firms.  Those single unit firms not covered in the 1972 or 1977  Economic Censuses retain industry codes assigned from information  submitted when the application for an EI number was made.  A  matching of industry codes in the two data system could improve the  coding of single establishment firms on the Standard Statistical  Establishment List and help identify potential problem areas  between the two systems; i.e., such a match could determine how  much of the difference between BLS and Census series is due to  coding, how much is due to reporting differences, and how much is  the result of differences in treatment of central administrative  Offices."

An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a valid control number assigned by the Office of Management and Budget. The estimated average annual recordkeeping burden per recordkeeper is 26.5 hours. The estimated annual reporting burden per respondent is .8 hours. Comments concerning the accuracy of this burden estimate and suggestions for reducing this burden should be sent to the Internal Revenue Service, Attn: IRS Reports Clearance Officer, W :CAR:MP:FP:S:O, W ashington, DC 20224, and to the Office of Management and Budget, Attn: Desk Officer for the Department of the Treasury, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, W ashington, DC 20503. Books or records relating to a collection of information must be retained as long as their contents might become material in the administration of any internal revenue law. Generally, tax returns and tax return information are confidential, as required by 26 U.S.C. 6103. Background This document contains amendments to 26 CFR part 1 (Income Tax Regulations). On January 27, 2000, a proposed regulation (REG-113572-99) relating 2   to qualified transportation fringes was published in the Federal Register (65 FR 4388). A public hearing was held on June 1, 2000. W ritten or electronic comments responding to the notice of proposed rulemaking were received. After consideration of all the comments, the proposed regulations are adopted as amended by this Treasury decision. The revisions are discussed below. Explanation of Provisions and Summary of Comments In general, comments received on the proposed regulations were favorable and, accordingly, the final regulations retain the general structure of the proposed regulations, including the question and answer format and a variety of examples illustrating the substance of the final regulations. However, commentators made a number of specific recommendations for modifications and clarifications of the regulations. In response to these comments, the final regulations incorporate the modifications and clarifications described below. A. W hether Vouchers are Readily Available Section 132(f)(3) provides that qualified transportation fringes include cash reimbursement for transit passes ""only if a voucher or similar item which may be exchanged only for a transit pass is not readily available for direct distribution by the employer to the employee."" Thus, if vouchers are readily available, the employer must use vouchers and cash reimbursement of a mass transit expense would not be a qualified transportation fringe. Most of the comments received addressed the issue of whether vouchers are ""readily available."" Commentators representing employers generally favored rules 3   permitting cash reimbursement. Commentators representing transit operators and voucher providers generally favored rules not permitting cash reimbursement. The following discusses three issues raised by commentators: first, whether the proposed regulations' 1 percent safe harbor should be retained; second, whether internal administrative costs should be considered in applying the 1 percent test; and third, whether other nonfinancial restrictions should be considered in determining whether vouchers are readily available. 1. The 1 percent safe harbor Under Notice 94-3, 1994-1 C.B. 327, and the proposed regulations, a voucher is readily available if an employer can obtain it on terms no less favorable than those available to an individual employee and without incurring a significant administrative cost. Under the proposed regulations, administrative costs relate only to fees paid to fare media providers, and the determination of whether obtaining a voucher would result in a significant administrative cost is made with respect to each transit system voucher. The proposed regulations provide a rule under which administrative costs are treated as significant if the average monthly administrative costs incurred by the employer for a voucher (disregarding delivery charges imposed by the fare media provider to the extent not in excess of $15 per order) are more than 1 percent of the average monthly value of the vouchers for a system. Commentators, in particular those representing fare media providers and transit operators, suggested that the fare media provider fee percentage causing vouchers to not be readily available should be raised because many fare media providers charge 4   fees in excess of the 1 percent limit and, thus, under this test, transit vouchers would not be considered readily available in some large metropolitan areas. These commentators assert that the 1 percent test is therefore contrary to the intent of the statute. Commentators suggested that the 1 percent test, particularly if combined with inadequate cash reimbursement substantiation requirements, may result in taxpayer abuse, with the result that the benefit might not be used for the purpose for which it is intended, which is to increase the use of mass transit. In addition, commentators testified at the public hearing that the mandatory use of vouchers (with no ability to use cash reimbursement if vouchers are readily available) would increase the use of vouchers and promote the development of advanced technologies that minimize the burden on employers while ensuring that the benefit is used for mass transit. These new technologies might allow an employer to make payment directly to the transit operator, who in turn credits fare to the employee's magnetic media fare card, thus eliminating the need for employers to incur the expense of distributing vouchers. Other commentators, in particular groups representing employers, generally favored the 1 percent test, but suggested that internal costs be considered in applying the test (discussed below). These commentators took the position that an increase in the percentage might affect the market charge for such services. There was also a concern that a strict voucher-use requirement would result in fewer employers adopting transit pass programs, thus frustrating the purpose of section 132(f) to increase the use of mass transit.  5   The final regulations retain the 1 percent test. The 1 percent test, applicable for years beginning after December 31, 2003, is appropriate in light of the rule (discussed below) that only voucher provider fees are considered in determining availability. It is intended that the delayed application of this rule would provide sufficient time for those affected by this rule to modify their systems and procedures appropriately. The 1 percent threshold, coupled with the exclusion of internal administrative costs from the readily available determination, represents a balanced approach that will promote the growth of voucher programs in most transportation areas. In addition, raising the percentage threshold could curtail the growth in transit benefit programs, which would be contrary to the goal of increasing the use of mass transit. Finally, in cases where cash reimbursement is allowed, adequate substantiation requirements will ensure that transit pass benefits will actually go toward mass transportation usage. In this regard, the proposed regulations provide that employers must implement reasonable procedures to ensure that an amount equal to the reimbursement was incurred for transit passes. For example, the final regulations clarify that in circumstances when employee certification is a reasonable reimbursement procedure, it must occur after the expense is incurred. The final regulations also clarify the application of the 1 percent rule if multiple vouchers for a transit system are available for distribution by an employer to employees, and if multiple transit system vouchers are required in an area to meet the transit needs of an employer's employees. The final regulations provide that if multiple transit system vouchers are available for direct distribution to employees, the employer 6   must consider the lowest cost voucher for purposes of determining whether the voucher provider fees cause vouchers to not be readily available. However, if multiple vouchers are required in an area to meet the transit needs of the individual employees in that area, the employer has the option of averaging the costs applied to vouchers from each system for purposes of determining whether the voucher provider fees cause vouchers to not be readily available. 2. Internal administrative costs Several commentators representing employers recommended that, in addition to fare media provider fees, internal administrative costs, especially security and distribution costs, should be considered in determining whether vouchers are readily available. These commentators noted that administrative costs are increased when an employer must maintain both a voucher system and a reimbursement system to provide qualified transportation fringes. For example, the employer may maintain a cash reimbursement system for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and qualified parking, and also maintain a voucher system for transit passes. In addition, several commentators suggested that the increased costs and administrative burden for employers that maintain offices in multiple cities should also be considered in determining whether vouchers are readily available. The final regulations retain the test considering only fees paid to voucher providers in determining availability based on a plain reading of the terms of the  7   statute. The language ""readily available for direct distribution by the employer to the employee"" under section 132(f)(3) in its plain, ordinary sense means that vouchers are easily obtainable for direct distribution to the employer's employees. The determination of availability bears no relationship with costs that may be incurred after vouchers have been obtained. The service fees charged by voucher providers and delivery costs can reasonably be viewed as affecting whether vouchers are easily obtainable; an employer's internal costs of subsequently administering a voucher program would not. Thus, based upon the plain language of section 132(f), internal administrative costs do not affect whether vouchers are readily available. Moreover, the test considering only voucher provider fees is a comparatively simple bright line test. A test that depends on the employer's internal administrative costs would necessarily be complex, requiring complex rules that would be difficult for employers to apply. 3. Other nonfinancial restrictions Commentators representing employers suggested that nonfinancial factors should be considered in determining whether vouchers are readily available. They suggested that factors such as whether there are reasonable advance purchase and minimum purchase requirements, and whether vouchers can be purchased in appropriate denominations, should be considered in determining availability. The final  8   regulations adopt this suggestion because nonfinancial restrictions would reasonably affect whether vouchers are available for distribution by an employer to an employee. The final regulations provide guidance on the types of nonfinancial restrictions that cause vouchers to not be readily available. The final regulations provide that certain nonfinancial restrictions, such as a voucher provider not making vouchers available for purchase at reasonable intervals or failing to provide the vouchers within a reasonable period after receiving payment for the voucher, cause vouchers to not be readily available. In addition, if a voucher provider does not provide vouchers in reasonably appropriate quantities, or in reasonably appropriate denominations, vouchers may not be readily available. W hen and as the standards in these final regulations go into effect, they will supercede the current law standards in Notice 94-3. B. Advance Transit Passes Commentators suggested that the administrability of transit pass programs would be improved if vouchers were permitted to be distributed in advance for more than one month. The final regulations adopt this suggestion. In October of this year, the IRS issued Announcement 2000-78 (2000-43 I.R.B. 428) to notify taxpayers that, when finalized, the regulations will clarify that transit passes may be distributed in advance for more than one month (such as for a calendar quarter) by taking into account the monthly limits for all months for which the transit  9   passes are distributed. The announcement further provides, however, that if an employee receives advance transit passes, and the employee's employment terminates before the beginning of the last month of the period for which the transit passes were provided, the employer must include in the employee's wages, for income and for employment tax purposes (FICA, FUTA, and income tax withholding), the value of the passes provided for those month(s) beginning after the employee's employment terminates to the extent the employer does not recover those transit passes or the value of those passes. The announcement provides that pending the issuance of these final regulations, employers may rely on the announcement. The final regulations differ from the announcement in one respect. In any case in which transit passes are provided in advance for a period of no more than three months (such as for a calendar quarter), but the recipient ceases to be an employee before the beginning of the last month in that period, the final regulations provide that the value of a transit pass provided in advance for a month is excluded from wages for employment tax (FICA, FUTA, and income tax withholding) purposes (but not for income tax purposes) unless at the time the transit passes were distributed there was an established termination date that was before the beginning of the last month of that period and the employee does in fact terminate employment before the beginning of the last month of that period. C. Qualified Parking  10   The final regulations address whether reimbursement paid to an employee for parking at a work location away from the employee's permanent work location is excludable from wages for income and employment tax purposes under section 132(f). Section 132(f)(5)(C) defines qualified parking, in part, as ""parking provided to an employee on or near the business premises of the employer . . . ."" The final regulations provide that qualified parking includes parking on or near a work location at which the employee performs services for the employer. However, qualified parking does not include reimbursement for parking that is otherwise excludable from gross income as a reimbursement treated as paid under an accountable plan under 1.62-2 of the Income Tax Regulations, or parking provided in kind to an employee that is excludable from the employee's gross income as a working condition fringe under section 132(a)(3). Thus, if the exclusion at 1.62-2 or section 132(a)(3) is available (even if not reimbursed by the employer), then section 132(f) does not apply. W hether a reimbursement for local transportation expenses, including parking at a work location away from the employee's permanent work location, is excludable from the employee's gross income under 1.62-2, or whether parking provided in kind to an employee is excludable from the employee's gross income under section 132(a)(3), is determined based upon whether the parking expenses would be deductible if paid or incurred by the employee under section 162(a) as an expense incurred in the employee's trade or business of being an employee for the employer. 1.62-2(d);  11   1.132-5(a)(2). Revenue Ruling 99-7 (1999-1 C.B. 361) addresses under what circumstances daily transportation expenses, including parking, incurred by a taxpayer in going between the taxpayer's residence and a work location are deductible by the taxpayer under section 162(a). The final regulations provide the minimum requirements to ensure that transportation benefits are qualified transportation fringes under section 132(f). An employer may have a transit benefit program that is more restrictive than a program meeting the minimum requirements under the regulations. In addition, these regulations do not affect the application of authorities outside the Internal Revenue Code which may restrict a transportation benefit program. Federal Government agencies, for example, may be required by other federal law to implement restrictions beyond those required under these regulations. D. Applicability Date The regulations are generally applicable for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2001. However, in order to provide a transition period for those affected by the 1 percent rule (described under ""The 1 percent safe harbor"" in this preamble), that rule is applicable for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2003. Effect on Other Documents The following document is obsolete as of January 11, 2001: Announcement 2000-78 (2000-43 I.R.B. 428).  12   The following document is modified as of the date these regulations become applicable (see Q/A-25): Notice 94-3 (1994-1 C.B. 327). Special Analyses It has been determined that this Treasury Decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) does not apply to these regulations. A final  regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared for the collection of information in this Treasury decision under 5 U.S.C. 604. A summary of the analysis is set forth in this preamble under the heading ""Summary of Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis."" Summary of Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis This analysis is required under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6). The collection of information under this rule is based upon the requirements under section 132(f). W e estimate that approximately 265,000 employers that provide qualified transportation fringes to their employees will be affected by the recordkeeping requirements of this rule. None of the comments received in response to the notice of proposed rulemaking specifically addressed the initial regulatory flexibility analysis. Section 132(f)(3) provides that qualified transportation fringes may be provided in the form of cash reimbursement. The legislative history indicates that an employer  13   providing cash reimbursement to the employer's employees for qualified transportation fringes must establish a bona fide reimbursement arrangement. As a condition to providing cash reimbursement for qualified transportation fringes, this rule provides that employers must receive substantiation from employees. The objective of this rule is to ensure that reimbursements are made for qualified transportation fringes. W hether an arrangement constitutes a bona fide reimbursement arrangement varies depending on the facts and circumstances, including the method or methods of payment utilized within a mass transit system. An employee certification in either written or electronic form may be sufficient depending upon the facts and circumstances. For example, if receipts are not provided in the ordinary course of business, such as with respect to metered parking or used transit passes that cannot be returned to the user, an employee certification that expenses have been incurred constitutes a reasonable reimbursement procedure. A certification that expenses will be incurred in the future, by itself, is not a reasonable reimbursement procedure. There are no particular professional skills required to maintain these records. In addition, section 132(f)(4) provides that an employee may choose between cash compensation and qualified transportation fringes. This rule provides that an employer may allow an employee the choice to receive either a fixed amount of cash compensation at a specified future date or a fixed amount of qualified transportation fringes to be provided for a specified future period (such as qualified parking to be used during a future calendar month). This rule provides that employers must keep records 14   with respect to employee compensation reduction elections. An employee's election must be in writing or some other permanent and verifiable form, and include the date of the election, the amount of compensation to be reduced, and the period for which the qualified transportation fringes will be provided. The objective of this rule is to ensure against recharacterization of taxable compensation after it has been paid to the employee. There are no particular professional skills required to maintain these records. A less burdensome alternative for small organizations would be to exempt those entities from the recordkeeping requirements under this rule. However, it would be inconsistent with the statutory provisions and legislative history to exempt those entities from the recordkeeping requirements imposed under this rule. This rule provides several options which avoid more burdensome recordkeeping requirements for small entities. This rule provides that (1) there are no substantiation requirements if the employer distributes transit passes in kind; (2) a compensation reduction election may be made electronically; (3) an election to reduce compensation may be automatically renewed; (4) an employer may provide for deemed compensation reduction elections under its qualified transportation fringe benefit plan; and (5) a requirement that a voucher be distributed in-kind by the employer is satisfied if the voucher is distributed by the employer or by another person on behalf of the employer (for example, if a transit operator credits amounts to the employee's fare card as a result of payments made to the operator by the employer). 15   Drafting Information The principal author of these regulations is John Richards, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel (Exempt Organizations/Employment Tax/Government Entities).

W hat is the effective date of this section? (b) Questions and answers. Q-1. W hat is a qualified transportation fringe? A-1. (a) The following benefits are qualified transportation fringe benefits: (1) Transportation in a commuter highway vehicle. (2) Transit passes. (3) Qualified parking. (b) An employer may simultaneously provide an employee with any one or more of these three benefits. Q-2. W hat is transportation in a commuter highway vehicle?  19   A-2. Transportation in a commuter highway vehicle is transportation provided by an employer to an employee in connection with travel between the employee's residence and place of employment. A commuter highway vehicle is a highway vehicle with a seating capacity of at least 6 adults (excluding the driver) and with respect to which at least 80 percent of the vehicle's mileage for a year is reasonably expected to be-(a) For transporting employees in connection with travel between their residences and their place of employment; and (b) On trips during which the number of employees transported for commuting is at least one-half of the adult seating capacity of the vehicle (excluding the driver). Q-3. W hat are transit passes? A-3. A transit pass is any pass, token, farecard, voucher, or similar item (including an item exchangeable for fare media) that entitles a person to transportation-(a) On mass transit facilities (whether or not publicly owned); or (b) Provided by any person in the business of transporting persons for compensation or hire in a highway vehicle with a seating capacity of at least 6 adults (excluding the driver). Q-4. W hat is qualified parking? A-4. (a) Qualified parking is parking provided to an employee by an employer-(1) On or near the employer's business premises; or  20   (2) At a location from which the employee commutes to work (including commuting by carpool, commuter highway vehicle, mass transit facilities, or transportation provided by any person in the business of transporting persons for compensation or hire). (b) For purposes of section 132(f), parking on or near the employer's business premises includes parking on or near a work location at which the employee provides services for the employer. However, qualified parking does not include-(1) The value of parking provided to an employee that is excludable from gross income under section 132(a)(3) (as a working condition fringe), or (2) Reimbursement paid to an employee for parking costs that is excludable from gross income as an amount treated as paid under an accountable plan. See 1.62-2. (c) However, parking on or near property used by the employee for residential purposes is not qualified parking. (d) Parking is provided by an employer if-(1) The parking is on property that the employer owns or leases; (2) The employer pays for the parking; or (3) The employer reimburses the employee for parking expenses (see Q/A-16 of this section for rules relating to cash reimbursements). Q-5. May qualified transportation fringes be provided to individuals who are not employees? A-5. An employer may provide qualified transportation fringes only to individuals who are currently employees of the employer at the time the qualified transportation 21   fringe is provided. The term employee for purposes of qualified transportation fringes is defined in 1.132-1(b)(2)(i). This term includes only common law employees and other statutory employees, such as officers of corporations. See Q/A-24 of this section for rules regarding partners, 2-percent shareholders, and independent contractors. Q-6. Must a qualified transportation fringe benefit plan be in writing? A-6. No. Section 132(f) does not require that a qualified transportation fringe benefit plan be in writing. Q-7. Is there a limit on the value of qualified transportation fringes that may be excluded from an employee's gross income? A-7. (a) Transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and transit passes. Before January 1, 2002, up to $65 per month is excludable from the gross income of an employee for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and transit passes provided by an employer. On January 1, 2002, this amount is increased to $100 per month. (b) Parking. Up to $175 per month is excludable from the gross income of an employee for qualified parking. (c) Combination. An employer may provide qualified parking benefits in addition to transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and transit passes. (d) Cost-of-living adjustments. The amounts in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Q/A-7 are adjusted annually, beginning with 2000, to reflect cost-of-living. The adjusted figures are announced by the Service before the beginning of the year.  22   Q-8. W hat amount is includible in an employee's wages for income and employment tax purposes if the value of the qualified transportation fringe exceeds the applicable statutory monthly limit? A-8. (a) Generally, an employee must include in gross income the amount by which the fair market value of the benefit exceeds the sum of the amount, if any, paid by the employee and any amount excluded from gross income under section 132(a)(5). Thus, assuming no other statutory exclusion applies, if an employer provides an employee with a qualified transportation fringe that exceeds the applicable statutory monthly limit and the employee does not make any payment, the value of the benefits provided in excess of the applicable statutory monthly limit is included in the employee's wages for income and employment tax purposes. See 1.61-21(b)(1). (b) The following examples illustrate the principles of this Q/A-8: Example 1. (i) For each month in a year in which the statutory monthly transit pass limit is $100 (i.e., a year after 2001), Employer M provides a transit pass valued at $110 to Employee D, who does not pay any amount to Employer M for the transit pass. (ii) In this Example 1, because the value of the monthly transit pass exceeds the statutory monthly limit by $10, $120 ($110 - $100, times 12 months) must be included in D's wages for income and employment tax purposes for the year with respect to the transit passes. Example 2. (i) For each month in a year in which the statutory monthly qualified parking limit is $175, Employer M provides qualified parking valued at $195 to Employee E, who does not pay any amount to M for the parking. (ii) In this Example 2, because the fair market value of the qualified parking exceeds the statutory monthly limit by $20, $240 ($195 - $175, times 12 months) must be included in Employee E's wages for income and employment tax purposes for the year with respect to the qualified parking. 23   Example 3. (i) For each month in a year in which the statutory monthly qualified parking limit is $175, Employer P provides qualified parking with a fair market value of $220 per month to its employees, but charges each employee $45 per month. (ii) In this Example 3, because the sum of the amount paid by an employee ($45) plus the amount excludable for qualified parking ($175) is not less than the fair market value of the monthly benefit, no amount is includible in the employee's wages for income and employment tax purposes with respect to the qualified parking. Q-9. Are excludable qualified transportation fringes calculated on a monthly basis? A-9. (a) In general. Yes. The value of transportation in a commuter highway vehicle, transit passes, and qualified parking is calculated on a monthly basis to determine whether the value of the benefit has exceeded the applicable statutory monthly limit on qualified transportation fringes. Except in the case of a transit pass provided to an employee, the applicable statutory monthly limit applies to qualified transportation fringes used by the employee in a month. Monthly exclusion amounts are not combined to provide a qualified transportation fringe for any month exceeding the statutory limit. A month is a calendar month or a substantially equivalent period applied consistently. (b) Transit passes. In the case of transit passes provided to an employee, the applicable statutory monthly limit applies to the transit passes provided by the employer to the employee in a month for that month or for any previous month in the calendar year. In addition, transit passes distributed in advance for more than one month, but not for more than twelve months, are qualified transportation fringes if the requirements in paragraph (c) of this Q/A-9 are met (relating to the income tax and employment tax  24   treatment of advance transit passes). The applicable statutory monthly limit under section 132(f)(2) on the combined amount of transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and transit passes may be calculated by taking into account the monthly limits for all months for which the transit passes are distributed. In the case of a pass that is valid for more than one month, such as an annual pass, the value of the pass may be divided by the number of months for which it is valid for purposes of determining whether the value of the pass exceeds the statutory monthly limit. (c) Rule if employee's employment terminates-- (1) income tax treatment. The value of transit passes provided in advance to an employee with respect to a month in which the individual is not an employee is included in the employee's wages for income tax purposes. (2) Reporting and employment tax treatment. Transit passes distributed in advance to an employee are excludable from wages for employment tax purposes under sections 3121, 3306, and 3401 (FICA, FUTA, and income tax withholding) if the employer distributes transit passes to the employee in advance for not more than three months and, at the time the transit passes are distributed, there is not an established date that the employee's employment will terminate (for example, if the employee has given notice of retirement) which will occur before the beginning of the last month of the period for which the transit passes are provided. If the employer distributes transit passes to an employee in advance for not more than three months and at the time the transit passes are distributed there is an established date that the employee's 25   employment will terminate, and the employee's employment does terminate before the beginning of the last month of the period for which the transit passes are provided, the value of transit passes provided for months beginning after the date of termination during which the employee is not employed by the employer is included in the employee's wages for employment tax purposes. If transit passes are distributed in advance for more than three months, the value of transit passes provided for the months during which the employee is not employed by the employer is includible in the employee's wages for employment tax purposes regardless of whether at the time the transit passes were distributed there was an established date of termination of the employee's employment. (d) Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of this Q/A-9: Example 1. (i) Employee E incurs $150 for qualified parking used during the month of June of a year in which the statutory monthly parking limit is $175, for which E is reimbursed $150 by Employer R. Employee E incurs $180 in expenses for qualified parking used during the month of July of that year, for which E is reimbursed $180 by Employer R. (ii) In this Example 1, because monthly exclusion amounts may not be combined to provide a benefit in any month greater than the applicable statutory limit, the amount by which the amount reimbursed for July exceeds the applicable statutory monthly limit ($180 minus $175 equals $5) is includible in Employee E's wages for income and employment tax purposes. Example 2. (i) $195 in March of a January, February, received any transi Employee F receives transit passes from Employer G with a value of year (for which the statutory monthly transit pass limit is $65) for and March of that year. F was hired during January and has not t passes from G.  (ii) In this Example 2, the value of the transit passes (three months times $65 equals $195) is excludable from F's wages for income and employment tax purposes. 26   Example 3. (i) Employer S has a qualif which its employees receive transit passes for that calendar quarter. All employees of Employer S with a value of $195 on March the months April, May, and June (of a year limit is $65).  ied transportation fringe benefit plan under near the beginning of each calendar quarter Employer S receive transit passes from 31 for the second calendar quarter covering in which the statutory monthly transit pass  (ii) In this Example 3, because the value of the transit passes may be calculated by taking into account the monthly limits for all months for which the transit passes are distributed, the value of the transit passes (three months times $65 equals $195) is excludable from the employees' wages for income and employment tax purposes. Example 4. (i) Same facts as in Example 3, except that Employee T, an employee of Employer S, terminates employment with S on May 31. There was not an established date of termination for Employee T at the time the transit passes were distributed. (ii) In this Example 4, because at the time the transit passes were distributed there was not an established date of termination for Employee T, the value of the transit passes provided for June ($65) is excludable from T's wages for employment tax purposes. However, the value of the transit passes distributed to Employee T for June ($65) is not excludable from T's wages for income tax purposes. (iii) If Employee T's May 31 termination date was established at the time the transit passes were provided, the value of the transit passes provided for June ($65) is included in T's wages for both income and employment tax purposes. Example 5. (i) Employer F has a qualified transportation fringe benefit plan under which its employees receive transit passes semi-annually in advance of the months for which the transit passes are provided. All employees of Employer F, including Employee X, receive transit passes from F with a value of $390 on June 30 for the 6 months of July through December (of a year in which the statutory monthly transit pass limit is $65). Employee X's employment terminates and his last day of work is August 1. Employer F's other employees remain employed throughout the remainder of the year. (ii) In this Example 5, the value of the transit passes provided to Employee X for the months September, October, November, and December ($65 times 4 months equals $260) of the year is included in X's wages for income and employment tax purposes. The value of the transit passes provided to Employer F's other employees is excludable from the employees' wages for income and employment tax purposes. 27   Example 6. (i) Each month during a year in which the statutory monthly transit pass limit is $65, Employer R distributes transit passes with a face amount of $70 to each of its employees. Transit passes with a face amount of $70 can be purchased from the transit system by any individual for $65. (ii) In this Example 6, because the value of the transit passes distributed by Employer R does not exceed the applicable statutory monthly limit ($65), no portion of the value of the transit passes is included as wages for income and employment tax purposes. Q-10. May an employee receive qualified transportation fringes from more than one employer? A-10. (a) General rule. Yes. The statutory monthly limits described in Q/A-7 of this section apply to benefits provided by an employer to its employees. For this purpose, all employees treated as employed by a single employer under section 414(b), (c), (m), or (o) are treated as employed by a single employer. See section 414(t) and 1.132-1(c). Thus, qualified transportation fringes paid by entities under common control under section 414(b), (c), (m), or (o) are combined for purposes of applying the applicable statutory monthly limit. In addition, an individual who is treated as a leased employee of the employer under section 414(n) is treated as an employee of that employer for purposes of section 132. See section 414(n)(3)(C). (b) Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of this Q/A-10: Example 1. (i) During a year in which the statutory monthly qualified parking limit is $175, Employee E works for Employers M and N, who are unrelated and not treated as a single employer under section 414(b), (c), (m), or (o). Each month, M and N each provide qualified parking benefits to E with a value of $100. (ii) In this Example 1, because M and N are unrelated employers, and the value of the monthly parking benefit provided by each is not more than the applicable statutory 28   monthly limit, the parking benefits provided by each employer are excludable as qualified transportation fringes assuming that the other requirements of this section are satisfied. Example 2. (i) Same facts as in Example 1, except that Employers M and N are treated as a single employer under section 414(b). (ii) In this Example 2, because M and N are treated as a single employer, the value of the monthly parking benefit provided by M and N must be combined for purposes of determining whether the applicable statutory monthly limit has been exceeded. Thus, the amount by which the value of the parking benefit exceeds the monthly limit ($200 minus the monthly limit amount of $175 equals $25) for each month in the year is includible in E's wages for income and employment tax purposes. Q-11. May qualified transportation fringes be provided to employees pursuant to a compensation reduction agreement? A-11. Yes. An employer may offer employees a choice between cash compensation and any qualified transportation fringe. An employee who is offered this choice and who elects qualified transportation fringes is not required to include the cash compensation in income if-(a) The election is pursuant to an arrangement described in Q/A-12 of this section; (b) The amount of the reduction in cash compensation does not exceed the limitation in Q/A-13 of this section; (c) The arrangement satisfies the timing and reimbursement rules in Q/A-14 and 16 of this section; and (d) The related fringe benefit arrangement otherwise satisfies the requirements set forth elsewhere in this section. Q-12. W hat is a compensation reduction election for purposes of section 132(f)? 29   A-12. (a) Election requirements generally. A compensation reduction arrangement is an arrangement under which the employer provides the employee with the right to elect whether the employee will receive either a fixed amount of cash compensation at a specified future date or a fixed amount of qualified transportation fringes to be provided for a specified future period (such as qualified parking to be used during a future calendar month). The employee's election must be in writing or another form, such as electronic, that includes, in a permanent and verifiable form, the information required to be in the election. The election must contain the date of the election, the amount of the compensation to be reduced, and the period for which the benefit will be provided. The election must relate to a fixed dollar amount or fixed percentage of compensation reduction. An election to reduce compensation for a period by a set amount for such period may be automatically renewed for subsequent periods. (b) Automatic election permitted. An employer may provide under its qualified transportation fringe benefit plan that a compensation reduction election will be deemed to have been made if the employee does not elect to receive cash compensation in lieu of the qualified transportation fringe, provided that the employee receives adequate notice that a compensation reduction will be made and is given adequate opportunity to choose to receive the cash compensation instead of the qualified transportation fringe. Q13. Is there a limit to the amount of the compensation reduction?  30   A13. Yes. Each month, the amount of the compensation reduction may not exceed the combined applicable statutory monthly limits for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle, transit passes, and qualified parking. For example, for a year in which the statutory monthly limit is $65 for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and transit passes, and $175 for qualified parking, an employee could elect to reduce compensation for any month by no more than $240 ($65 plus $175) with respect to qualified transportation fringes. If an employee were to elect to reduce compensation by $250 for a month, the excess $10 ($250 minus $240) would be includible in the employee's wages for income and employment tax purposes. Q14. W hen must the employee have made a compensation reduction election and under what circumstances may the amount be paid in cash to the employee? A14. (a) The compensation reduction election must satisfy the requirements set forth under paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this Q/A-14. (b) Timing of election. The compensation reduction election must be made before the employee is able currently to receive the cash or other taxable amount at the employee's discretion. The determination of whether the employee is able currently to receive the cash does not depend on whether it has been constructively received for purposes of section 451. The election must specify that the period (such as a calendar month) for which the qualified transportation fringe will be provided must not begin before the election is made. Thus, a compensation reduction election must relate to  31   qualified transportation fringes to be provided after the election. For this purpose, the date a qualified transportation fringe is provided is-(1) The date the employee receives a voucher or similar item; or (2) In any other case, the date the employee uses the qualified transportation fringe. (c) Revocability of elections. The employee may not revoke a compensation reduction election after the employee is able currently to receive the cash or other taxable amount at the employee's discretion. In addition, the election may not be revoked after the beginning of the period for which the qualified transportation fringe will be provided. (d) Compensation reduction amounts not refundable. Unless an election is revoked in a manner consistent with paragraph (c) of this Q/A-14, an employee may not subsequently receive the compensation (in cash or any form other than by payment of a qualified transportation fringe under the employer's plan). Thus, an employer's qualified transportation fringe benefit plan may not provide that an employee who ceases to participate in the employer's qualified transportation fringe benefit plan (such as in the case of termination of employment) is entitled to receive a refund of the amount by which the employee's compensation reductions exceed the actual qualified transportation fringes provided to the employee by the employer. (e) Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of this Q/A-14: Example 1. (i) Employer P maintains a qualified transportation fringe benefit arrangement during a year in which the statutory monthly limit is $100 for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and transit passes (2002 or later) and $180 for qualified 32   parking. Employees of P are paid cash compensation twice per month, with the payroll dates being the first and the fifteenth day of the month. Under P's arrangement, an employee is permitted to elect at any time before the first day of a month to reduce his or her compensation payable during that month in an amount up to the applicable statutory monthly limit ($100 if the employee elects coverage for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle or a mass transit pass, or $180 if the employee chooses qualified parking) in return for the right to receive qualified transportation fringes up to the amount of the election. If such an election is made, P will provide a mass transit pass for that month with a value not exceeding the compensation reduction amount elected by the employee or will reimburse the cost of other qualified transportation fringes used by the employee on or after the first day of that month up to the compensation reduction amount elected by the employee. Any compensation reduction amount elected by the employee for the month that is not used for qualified transportation fringes is not refunded to the employee at any future date. (ii) In this Example 1, the arrangement satisfies the requirements of this Q/A-14 because the election is made before the employee is able currently to receive the cash and the election specifies the future period for which the qualified transportation fringes will be provided. The arrangement would also satisfy the requirements of this Q/A-14 and Q/A-13 of this section if employees are allowed to elect to reduce compensation up to $280 per month ($100 plus $180). (iii) The arrangement would also satisfy the requirements of this Q/A-14 (and Q/A13 of this section) if employees are allowed to make an election at any time before the first or the fifteenth day of the month to reduce their compensation payable on that payroll date by an amount not in excess of one-half of the applicable statutory monthly limit (depending on the type of qualified transportation fringe elected by the employee) and P provides a mass transit pass on or after the applicable payroll date for the compensation reduction amount elected by the employee for the payroll date or reimburses the cost of other qualified transportation fringes used by the employee on or after the payroll date up to the compensation reduction amount elected by the employee for that payroll date. Example 2. (i) Employee Q elects to reduce his compensation payable on March 1 of a year (for which the statutory monthly mass transit limit is $65) by $195 in exchange for a mass transit voucher to be provided in March. The election is made on the preceding February 27. Employee Q was hired in January of the year. On March 10 of the year, the employer of Employee Q delivers to Employee Q a mass transit voucher worth $195 for the months of January, February, and March.  33   (ii) In this Example 2, $65 is included in Employee Q's wages for income and employment tax purposes because the compensation reduction election fails to satisfy the requirement in this Q/A-14 and Q/A-12 of this section that the period for which the qualified transportation fringe will be provided not begin before the election is made to the extent the election relates to $65 worth of transit passes for January of the year. The $65 for February is not taxable because the election was for a future period that includes at least one day in February. (iii) However, no amount would be included in Employee Q's wages as a result of the election if $195 worth of mass transit passes were instead provided to Q for the months of February, March, and April (because the compensation reduction would relate solely to fringes to be provided for a period not beginning before the date of the election and the amount provided does not exceed the aggregate limit for the period, i.e., the sum of $65 for each of February, March, and April). See Q/A-9 of this section for rules governing transit passes distributed in advance for more than one month. Example 3. (i) Employee R elects to reduce his compensation payable on March 1 of a year (for which the statutory monthly parking limit is $175) by $185 in exchange for reimbursement by Employer T of parking expenses incurred by Employee R for parking on or near Employer T's business premises during the period beginning after the date of the election through March. The election is made on the preceding February 27. Employee R incurs $10 in parking expenses on February 28 of the year, and $175 in parking expenses during the month of March. On April 5 of the year, Employer T reimburses Employee R $185 for the parking expenses incurred on February 28, and during March, of the year. (ii) In this Example 3, no amount would be includible in Employee R's wages for income and employment tax purposes because the compensation reduction related solely to parking on or near Employer R's business premises used during a period not beginning before the date of the election and the amount reimbursed for parking used in any one month does not exceed the statutory monthly limitation. Q15. May an employee whose qualified transportation fringe costs are less than the employee's compensation reduction carry over this excess amount to subsequent periods? A15. (a) Yes. An employee may carry over unused compensation reduction amounts to subsequent periods under the plan of the employee's employer. 34   (b) The following example illustrates the principles of this Q/A-15: Example. (i) By an election made before November 1 of a year for which the statutory monthly mass transit limit is $65, Employee E elects to reduce compensation in the amount of $65 for the month of November. E incurs $50 in employee-operated commuter highway vehicle expenses during November for which E is reimbursed $50 by Employer R, E's employer. By an election made before December, E elects to reduce compensation by $65 for the month of December. E incurs $65 in employeeoperated commuter highway vehicle expenses during December for which E is reimbursed $65 by R. Before the following January, E elects to reduce compensation by $50 for the month of January. E incurs $65 in employee-operated commuter highway vehicle expenses during January for which E is reimbursed $65 by R because R allows E to carry over to the next year the $15 amount by which the compensation reductions for November and December exceeded the employee-operated commuter highway vehicle expenses incurred during those months. (ii) In this Example, because Employee E is reimbursed in an amount not exceeding the applicable statutory monthly limit, and the reimbursement does not exceed the amount of employee-operated commuter highway vehicle expenses incurred during the month of January, the amount reimbursed ($65) is excludable from E's wages for income and employment tax purposes. Q16. How does section 132(f) apply to expense reimbursements? A-16. (a) In general. The term qualified transportation fringe includes cash reimbursement by an employer to an employee for expenses incurred or paid by an employee for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle or qualified parking. The term qualified transportation fringe also includes cash reimbursement for transit passes made under a bona fide reimbursement arrangement, but, in accordance with section 132(f)(3), only if permitted under paragraph (b) of this Q/A-16. The reimbursement must be made under a bona fide reimbursement arrangement which meets the rules of paragraph (c) of this Q/A-16. A payment made before the date an expense has been incurred or paid is not a reimbursement. In addition, a bona fide reimbursement 35   arrangement does not include an arrangement that is dependent solely upon an employee certifying in advance that the employee will incur expenses at some future date. (b) Special rule for transit passes-- (1) In general. The term qualified transportation fringe includes cash reimbursement for transit passes made under a bona fide reimbursement arrangement, but, in accordance with section 132(f)(3), only if no voucher or similar item that may be exchanged only for a transit pass is readily available for direct distribution by the employer to employees. If a voucher is readily available, the requirement that a voucher be distributed in-kind by the employer is satisfied if the voucher is distributed by the employer or by another person on behalf of the employer (for example, if a transit operator credits amounts to the employee's fare card as a result of payments made to the operator by the employer). (2) Voucher or similar item. For purposes of the special rule in paragraph (b) of this Q/A-16, a transit system voucher is an instrument that may be purchased by employers from a voucher provider that is accepted by one or more mass transit operators (e.g., train, subway, and bus) in an area as fare media or in exchange for fare media. Thus, for example, a transit pass that may be purchased by employers directly from a voucher provider is a transit system voucher. (3) Voucher provider. The term voucher provider means any person in the trade or business of selling transit system vouchers to employers, or any transit system or transit operator that sells vouchers to employers for the purpose of direct distribution to 36   employees. Thus, a transit operator might or might not be a voucher provider. A voucher provider is not, for example, a third-party employee benefits administrator that administers a transit pass benefit program for an employer using vouchers that the employer could obtain directly. (4) Readily available. For purposes of this paragraph (b), a voucher or similar item is readily available for direct distribution by the employer to employees if and only if an employer can obtain it from a voucher provider that (i) does not impose fare media charges that cause vouchers to not be readily available as described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section; and (ii) does not impose other restrictions that cause vouchers to not be readily available as described in paragraph (b)(6) of this section. (5) Fare media charges. For purposes of paragraph (b)(4) of this section, fare media charges relate only to fees paid by the employer to voucher providers for vouchers. The determination of whether obtaining a voucher would result in fare media charges that cause vouchers to not be readily available as described in this paragraph (b) is made with respect to each transit system voucher. If more than one transit system voucher is available for direct distribution to employees, the employer must consider the fees imposed for the lowest cost monthly voucher for purposes of determining whether the fees imposed by the voucher provider satisfy this paragraph. However, if transit system vouchers for multiple transit systems are required in an area to meet the transit needs of the individual employees in that area, the employer has the 37   option of averaging the costs applied to each transit system voucher for purposes of determining whether the fare media charges for transit system vouchers satisfy this paragraph. Fare media charges are described in this paragraph (b)(5), and therefore cause vouchers to not be readily available, if and only if the average annual fare media charges that the employer reasonably expects to incur for transit system vouchers purchased from the voucher provider (disregarding reasonable and customary delivery charges imposed by the voucher provider, e.g., not in excess of $15) are more than 1 percent of the average annual value of the vouchers for a transit system. (6) Other restrictions. For purposes of paragraph (b)(4) of this section, restrictions that cause vouchers to not be readily available are restrictions imposed by the voucher provider other than fare media charges that effectively prevent the employer from obtaining vouchers appropriate for distribution to employees. Examples of such restrictions include-(i) Advance purchase requirements. Advance purchase requirements cause vouchers to not be readily available only if the voucher provider does not offer vouchers at regular intervals or fails to provide the voucher within a reasonable period after receiving payment for the voucher. For example, a requirement that vouchers may be purchased only once per year may effectively prevent an employer from obtaining vouchers for distribution to employees. An advance purchase requirement that vouchers be purchased not more frequently than monthly does not effectively prevent the employer from obtaining vouchers for distribution to employees. 38   (ii) Purchase quantity requirements. Purchase quantity requirements cause vouchers to not be readily available if the voucher provider does not offer vouchers in quantities that are reasonably appropriate to the number of the employer's employees who use mass transportation (for example, the voucher provider requires a $1,000 minimum purchase and the employer seeks to purchase only $200 of vouchers). (iii) Limitations on denominations of vouchers that are available. If the voucher provider does not offer vouchers in denominations appropriate for distribution to the employer's employees, vouchers are not readily available. For example, vouchers provided in $5 increments up to the monthly limit are appropriate for distribution to employees, while vouchers available only in a denomination equal to the monthly limit are not appropriate for distribution to employees if the amount of the benefit provided to the employer's employees each month is normally less than the monthly limit. (7) Example. The following example illustrates the principles of this paragraph (b): Example. (i) Company C in City X sells mass transit vouchers to employers in the metropolitan area of X in various denominations appropriate for distribution to employees. Employers can purchase vouchers monthly in reasonably appropriate quantities. Several different bus, rail, van pool, and ferry operators service X, and a number of the operators accept the vouchers either as fare media or in exchange for fare media. To cover its operating expenses, C imposes on each voucher a 50 cents charge, plus a reasonable and customary $15 charge for delivery of each order of vouchers. Employer M disburses vouchers purchased from C to its employees who use operators that accept the vouchers and M reasonably expects that $55 is the average value of the voucher it will purchase from C for the next calendar year. (ii) In this Example, vouchers for X are readily available for direct distribution by the employer to employees because the expected cost of the vouchers disbursed to M's employees for the next calendar year is not more than 1 percent of the value of the vouchers (50 cents divided by $55 equals 0.91 percent), the delivery charges are 39   disregarded because they are reasonable and customary, and there are no other restrictions that cause the vouchers to not be readily available. Thus, any reimbursement of mass transportation costs in X would not be a qualified transportation fringe. (c) Substantiation requirements. Employers that make cash reimbursements must establish a bona fide reimbursement arrangement to establish that their employees have, in fact, incurred expenses for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle, transit passes, or qualified parking. For purposes of section 132(f), whether cash reimbursements are made under a bona fide reimbursement arrangement may vary depending on the facts and circumstances, including the method or methods of payment utilized within the mass transit system. The employer must implement reasonable procedures to ensure that an amount equal to the reimbursement was incurred for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle, transit passes, or qualified parking. The expense must be substantiated within a reasonable period of time. An expense substantiated to the payor within 180 days after it has been paid will be treated as having been substantiated within a reasonable period of time. An employee certification at the time of reimbursement in either written or electronic form may be a reasonable reimbursement procedure depending on the facts and circumstances. Examples of reasonable reimbursement procedures are set forth in paragraph (d) of this Q/A-16. (d) Illustrations of reasonable reimbursement procedures. The following are examples of reasonable reimbursement procedures for purposes of paragraph (c) of  40   this Q/A-16. In each case, the reimbursement is made at or within a reasonable period after the end of the events described in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(3) of this section.  (1) An employee presents to the employer a parking expense receipt for parking on or near the employer's business premises, the employee certifies that the parking was used by the employee, and the employer has no reason to doubt the employee's certification. (2) An employee either submits a used time-sensitive transit pass (such as a monthly pass) to the employer and certifies that he or she purchased it or presents an unused or used transit pass to the employer and certifies that he or she purchased it and the employee certifies that he or she has not previously been reimbursed for the transit pass. In both cases, the employer has no reason to doubt the employee's certification. (3) If a receipt is not provided in the ordinary course of business (e.g., if the employee uses metered parking or if used transit passes cannot be returned to the user), the employee certifies to the employer the type and the amount of expenses incurred, and the employer has no reason to doubt the employee's certification. Q-17. May an employer provide nontaxable cash reimbursement under section 132(f) for periods longer than one month? A-17. (a) General rule. Yes. Qualified transportation fringes include reimbursement to employees for costs incurred for transportation in more than one 41   month, provided the reimbursement for each month in the period is calculated separately and does not exceed the applicable statutory monthly limit for any month in the period. See Q/A-8 and 9 of this section if the limit for a month is exceeded. (b) Example. The following example illustrates the principles of this Q/A-17: Example. (i) Employee R pays $100 per month for qualified parking used during the period from April 1 through June 30 of a year in which the statutory monthly qualified parking limit is $175. After receiving adequate substantiation from Employee R, R's employer reimburses R $300 in cash on June 30 of that year. (ii) In this Example, because the value of the reimbursed expenses for each month did not exceed the applicable statutory monthly limit, the $300 reimbursement is excludable from R's wages for income and employment tax purposes as a qualified transportation fringe. Q-18. W hat are the substantiation requirements if an employer distributes transit passes? A-18. There are no substantiation requirements if the employer distributes transit passes. Thus, an employer may distribute a transit pass for each month with a value not more than the statutory monthly limit without requiring any certification from the employee regarding the use of the transit pass. Q-19. May an employer choose to impose substantiation requirements in addition to those described in this regulation? A-19. Yes. Q-20. How is the value of parking determined? A-20. Section 1.61-21(b)(2) applies for purposes of determining the value of parking. 42   Q-21. How do the qualified transportation fringe rules apply to van pools? A-21. (a) Van pools generally. Employer and employee-operated van pools, as well as private or public transit-operated van pools, may qualify as qualified transportation fringes. The value of van pool benefits which are qualified transportation fringes may be excluded up to the applicable statutory monthly limit for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and transit passes, less the value of any transit passes provided by the employer for the month. (b) Employer-operated van pools. The value of van pool transportation provided by or for an employer to its employees is excludable as a qualified transportation fringe, provided the van qualifies as a commuter highway vehicle as defined in section 132(f)(5)(B) and Q/A-2 of this section. A van pool is operated by or for the employer if the employer purchases or leases vans to enable employees to commute together or the employer contracts with and pays a third party to provide the vans and some or all of the costs of operating the vans, including maintenance, liability insurance and other operating expenses. (c) Employee-operated van pools. Cash reimbursement by an employer to employees for expenses incurred for transportation in a van pool operated by employees independent of their employer are excludable as qualified transportation fringes, provided that the van qualifies as a commuter highway vehicle as defined in section 132(f)(5)(B) and Q/A-2 of this section. See Q/A-16 of this section for the rules governing cash reimbursements. 43   (d) Private or public transit-operated van pool transit passes. The qualified transportation fringe exclusion for transit passes is available for travel in van pools owned and operated either by public transit authorities or by any person in the business of transporting persons for compensation or hire. In accordance with paragraph (b) of Q/A-3 of this section, the van must seat at least 6 adults (excluding the driver). See Q/A-16(b) and (c) of this section for a special rule for cash reimbursement for transit passes and the substantiation requirements for cash reimbursement. (e) Value of van pool transportation benefits. Section 1.61-21(b)(2) provides that the fair market value of a fringe benefit is based on all the facts and circumstances. Alternatively, transportation in an employer-provided commuter highway vehicle may be valued under the automobile lease valuation rule in 1.61-21(d), the vehicle cents-permile rule in 1.61-21(e), or the commuting valuation rule in 1.61-21(f). If one of these special valuation rules is used, the employer must use the same valuation rule to value the use of the commuter highway vehicle by each employee who share the use. See 1.61-21(c)(2)(i)(B). (f) Qualified parking prime member. If an employee obtains a qualified parking space as a result of membership in a car or van pool, the applicable statutory monthly limit for qualified parking applies to the individual to whom the parking space is assigned. This individual is the prime member. In determining the tax consequences to the prime member, the statutory monthly limit amounts of each car pool member may not be combined. If the employer provides access to the space and the space is not 44   assigned to a particular individual, then the employer must designate one of its employees as the prime member who will bear the tax consequences. The employer may not designate more than one prime member for a car or van pool during a month. The employer of the prime member is responsible for including the value of the qualified parking in excess of the statutory monthly limit in the prime member's wages for income and employment tax purposes. Q-22. W hat are the reporting and employment tax requirements for qualified transportation fringes? A-22. (a) Employment tax treatment generally. Qualified transportation fringes not exceeding the applicable statutory monthly limit described in Q/A-7 of this section are not wages for purposes of the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA), the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), and federal income tax withholding. Any amount by which an employee elects to reduce compensation as provided in Q/A-11 of this section is not subject to the FICA, the FUTA, and federal income tax withholding. Qualified transportation fringes exceeding the applicable statutory monthly limit described in Q/A7 of this section are wages for purposes of the FICA, the FUTA, and federal income tax withholding and are reported on the employee's Form W -2, W age and Tax Statement. (b) Employment tax treatment of cash reimbursement exceeding monthly limits. Cash reimbursement to employees (for example, cash reimbursement for qualified parking) in excess of the applicable statutory monthly limit under section 132(f) is treated as paid for employment tax purposes when actually or constructively paid. See 45   31.3121(a)-2(a), 31.3301-4, 31.3402(a)-1(b) of this chapter. Employers must report and deposit the amounts withheld in addition to reporting and depositing other employment taxes. See Q/A-16 of this section for rules governing cash reimbursements. (c) Noncash fringe benefits exceeding monthly limits. If the value of noncash qualified transportation fringes exceeds the applicable statutory monthly limit, the employer may elect, for purposes of the FICA, the FUTA, and federal income tax withholding, to treat the noncash taxable fringe benefits as paid on a pay period, quarterly, semi-annual, annual, or other basis, provided that the benefits are treated as paid no less frequently than annually. Q23. How does section 132(f) interact with other fringe benefit rules? A-23. For purposes of section 132, the terms working condition fringe and de minimis fringe do not include any qualified transportation fringe under section 132(f). If, however, an employer provides local transportation other than transit passes (without any direct or indirect compensation reduction election), the value of the benefit may be excludable, either totally or partially, under fringe benefit rules other than the qualified transportation fringe rules under section 132(f). See 1.132-6(d)(2)(i) (occasional local transportation fare), 1.132-6(d)(2)(iii) (transportation provided under unusual circumstances), and 1.61-21(k) (valuation of local transportation provided to qualified employees). See also Q/A-4(b) of this section.  46   Q-24. May qualified transportation fringes be provided to individuals who are partners, 2-percent shareholders of S-corporations, or independent contractors? A-24. (a) General rule. Section 132(f)(5)(E) states that self-employed individuals who are employees within the meaning of section 401(c)(1) are not employees for purposes of section 132(f). Therefore, individuals who are partners, sole proprietors, or other independent contractors are not employees for purposes of section 132(f). In addition, under section 1372(a), 2-percent shareholders of S corporations are treated as partners for fringe benefit purposes. Thus, an individual who is both a 2-percent shareholder of an S corporation and a common law employee of that S corporation is not considered an employee for purposes of section 132(f). However, while section 132(f) does not apply to individuals who are partners, 2-percent shareholders of S corporations, or independent contractors, other exclusions for working condition and de minimis fringes may be available as described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this Q/A-24. See 1.132-1(b)(2) and 1.132-1(b)(4). (b) Transit passes. The working condition and de minimis fringe exclusions under section 132(a)(3) and (4) are available for transit passes provided to individuals who are partners, 2-percent shareholders, and independent contractors. For example, tokens or farecards provided by a partnership to an individual who is a partner that enable the partner to commute on a public transit system (not including privately-operated van pools) are excludable from the partner's gross income if the value of the tokens and farecards in any month does not exceed the dollar amount 47   specified in 1.132-6(d)(1). However, if the value of a pass provided in a month exceeds the dollar amount specified in 1.132-6(d)(1), the full value of the benefit provided (not merely the amount in excess of the dollar amount specified in 1.1326(d)(1)) is includible in gross income. (c) Parking. The working condition fringe rules under section 132(d) do not apply to commuter parking. See 1.132-5(a)(1). However, the de minimis fringe rules under section 132(e) are available for parking provided to individuals who are partners, 2-percent shareholders, or independent contractors that qualifies under the de minimis rules. See 1.132-6(a) and (b). (d) Example. The following example illustrates the principles of this Q/A-24: Example. (i) Individual G is a partner in partnership P. Individual G commutes to and from G's office every day and parks free of charge in P's lot. (ii) In this Example, the value of the parking is not excluded under section 132(f), but may be excluded under section 132(e) if the parking is a de minimis fringe under 1.132-6. Q25. W hat is the effective date of this section? A-25. (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this Q/A-25, this section is applicable for employee taxable years beginning after December 31, 2001. (b) The last sentence of paragraph (b)(5) of Q/A-16 of this section (relating to whether transit system vouchers for transit passes are readily available) is applicable for employee taxable years beginning after December 31, 2003. For this purpose, an employer may assume that the employee taxable year is the calendar year.  48   PART 602 -- OMB CONTROL NUMBERS UNDER THE PAPERW ORK REDUCTION ACT Par. 5.

GX259-46-6864778	"[4830-01-u] DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 26 CFR Parts 1 and 602 [TD 8933] RIN 1545-AX33 Qualified Transportation Fringe Benefits AGENCY: Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury. ACTION: Final regulation. SUMMARY: This document contains final regulations relating to qualified transportation fringe benefits. These final regulations provide rules to ensure that transportation benefits provided to employees are excludable from gross income. These final regulations reflect changes to the law made by the Energy Policy Act of 1992, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, and the Transportation Equity Act for the 21 st  Century. These final regulations affect employers that offer qualified transportation fringes and employees who receive these benefits. DATES: Effective Date: These regulations are effective January 11, 2001. Applicability Date: For dates of applicability, see 1.132-9(b), Q/A-25. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John Richards, (202) 622-6040 (not a toll-free number). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Paperwork Reduction Act 1   The collection of information contained in these final regulations has been reviewed and approved by the Office of Management and Budget in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3507) under control number 15451676. Responses to this collection of information are mandatory to obtain the benefit described under section 132(f). An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a valid control number assigned by the Office of Management and Budget. The estimated average annual recordkeeping burden per recordkeeper is 26.5 hours. The estimated annual reporting burden per respondent is .8 hours. Comments concerning the accuracy of this burden estimate and suggestions for reducing this burden should be sent to the Internal Revenue Service, Attn: IRS Reports Clearance Officer, W :CAR:MP:FP:S:O, W ashington, DC 20224, and to the Office of Management and Budget, Attn: Desk Officer for the Department of the Treasury, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, W ashington, DC 20503. Books or records relating to a collection of information must be retained as long as their contents might become material in the administration of any internal revenue law. Generally, tax returns and tax return information are confidential, as required by 26 U.S.C. 6103. Background This document contains amendments to 26 CFR part 1 (Income Tax Regulations). On January 27, 2000, a proposed regulation (REG-113572-99) relating 2   to qualified transportation fringes was published in the Federal Register (65 FR 4388). A public hearing was held on June 1, 2000. W ritten or electronic comments responding to the notice of proposed rulemaking were received. After consideration of all the comments, the proposed regulations are adopted as amended by this Treasury decision. The revisions are discussed below. Explanation of Provisions and Summary of Comments In general, comments received on the proposed regulations were favorable and, accordingly, the final regulations retain the general structure of the proposed regulations, including the question and answer format and a variety of examples illustrating the substance of the final regulations. However, commentators made a number of specific recommendations for modifications and clarifications of the regulations. In response to these comments, the final regulations incorporate the modifications and clarifications described below. A. W hether Vouchers are Readily Available Section 132(f)(3) provides that qualified transportation fringes include cash reimbursement for transit passes ""only if a voucher or similar item which may be exchanged only for a transit pass is not readily available for direct distribution by the employer to the employee."" Thus, if vouchers are readily available, the employer must use vouchers and cash reimbursement of a mass transit expense would not be a qualified transportation fringe. Most of the comments received addressed the issue of whether vouchers are ""readily available."" Commentators representing employers generally favored rules 3   permitting cash reimbursement. Commentators representing transit operators and voucher providers generally favored rules not permitting cash reimbursement. The following discusses three issues raised by commentators: first, whether the proposed regulations' 1 percent safe harbor should be retained; second, whether internal administrative costs should be considered in applying the 1 percent test; and third, whether other nonfinancial restrictions should be considered in determining whether vouchers are readily available. 1. The 1 percent safe harbor Under Notice 94-3, 1994-1 C.B. 327, and the proposed regulations, a voucher is readily available if an employer can obtain it on terms no less favorable than those available to an individual employee and without incurring a significant administrative cost. Under the proposed regulations, administrative costs relate only to fees paid to fare media providers, and the determination of whether obtaining a voucher would result in a significant administrative cost is made with respect to each transit system voucher. The proposed regulations provide a rule under which administrative costs are treated as significant if the average monthly administrative costs incurred by the employer for a voucher (disregarding delivery charges imposed by the fare media provider to the extent not in excess of $15 per order) are more than 1 percent of the average monthly value of the vouchers for a system. Commentators, in particular those representing fare media providers and transit operators, suggested that the fare media provider fee percentage causing vouchers to not be readily available should be raised because many fare media providers charge 4   fees in excess of the 1 percent limit and, thus, under this test, transit vouchers would not be considered readily available in some large metropolitan areas. These commentators assert that the 1 percent test is therefore contrary to the intent of the statute. Commentators suggested that the 1 percent test, particularly if combined with inadequate cash reimbursement substantiation requirements, may result in taxpayer abuse, with the result that the benefit might not be used for the purpose for which it is intended, which is to increase the use of mass transit. In addition, commentators testified at the public hearing that the mandatory use of vouchers (with no ability to use cash reimbursement if vouchers are readily available) would increase the use of vouchers and promote the development of advanced technologies that minimize the burden on employers while ensuring that the benefit is used for mass transit. These new technologies might allow an employer to make payment directly to the transit operator, who in turn credits fare to the employee's magnetic media fare card, thus eliminating the need for employers to incur the expense of distributing vouchers. Other commentators, in particular groups representing employers, generally favored the 1 percent test, but suggested that internal costs be considered in applying the test (discussed below). These commentators took the position that an increase in the percentage might affect the market charge for such services. There was also a concern that a strict voucher-use requirement would result in fewer employers adopting transit pass programs, thus frustrating the purpose of section 132(f) to increase the use of mass transit.  5   The final regulations retain the 1 percent test. The 1 percent test, applicable for years beginning after December 31, 2003, is appropriate in light of the rule (discussed below) that only voucher provider fees are considered in determining availability. It is intended that the delayed application of this rule would provide sufficient time for those affected by this rule to modify their systems and procedures appropriately. The 1 percent threshold, coupled with the exclusion of internal administrative costs from the readily available determination, represents a balanced approach that will promote the growth of voucher programs in most transportation areas. In addition, raising the percentage threshold could curtail the growth in transit benefit programs, which would be contrary to the goal of increasing the use of mass transit. Finally, in cases where cash reimbursement is allowed, adequate substantiation requirements will ensure that transit pass benefits will actually go toward mass transportation usage. In this regard, the proposed regulations provide that employers must implement reasonable procedures to ensure that an amount equal to the reimbursement was incurred for transit passes. For example, the final regulations clarify that in circumstances when employee certification is a reasonable reimbursement procedure, it must occur after the expense is incurred. The final regulations also clarify the application of the 1 percent rule if multiple vouchers for a transit system are available for distribution by an employer to employees, and if multiple transit system vouchers are required in an area to meet the transit needs of an employer's employees. The final regulations provide that if multiple transit system vouchers are available for direct distribution to employees, the employer 6   must consider the lowest cost voucher for purposes of determining whether the voucher provider fees cause vouchers to not be readily available. However, if multiple vouchers are required in an area to meet the transit needs of the individual employees in that area, the employer has the option of averaging the costs applied to vouchers from each system for purposes of determining whether the voucher provider fees cause vouchers to not be readily available. 2. Internal administrative costs Several commentators representing employers recommended that, in addition to fare media provider fees, internal administrative costs, especially security and distribution costs, should be considered in determining whether vouchers are readily available. These commentators noted that administrative costs are increased when an employer must maintain both a voucher system and a reimbursement system to provide qualified transportation fringes. For example, the employer may maintain a cash reimbursement system for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and qualified parking, and also maintain a voucher system for transit passes. In addition, several commentators suggested that the increased costs and administrative burden for employers that maintain offices in multiple cities should also be considered in determining whether vouchers are readily available. The final regulations retain the test considering only fees paid to voucher providers in determining availability based on a plain reading of the terms of the  7   statute. The language ""readily available for direct distribution by the employer to the employee"" under section 132(f)(3) in its plain, ordinary sense means that vouchers are easily obtainable for direct distribution to the employer's employees. The determination of availability bears no relationship with costs that may be incurred after vouchers have been obtained. The service fees charged by voucher providers and delivery costs can reasonably be viewed as affecting whether vouchers are easily obtainable; an employer's internal costs of subsequently administering a voucher program would not. Thus, based upon the plain language of section 132(f), internal administrative costs do not affect whether vouchers are readily available. Moreover, the test considering only voucher provider fees is a comparatively simple bright line test. A test that depends on the employer's internal administrative costs would necessarily be complex, requiring complex rules that would be difficult for employers to apply. 3. Other nonfinancial restrictions Commentators representing employers suggested that nonfinancial factors should be considered in determining whether vouchers are readily available. They suggested that factors such as whether there are reasonable advance purchase and minimum purchase requirements, and whether vouchers can be purchased in appropriate denominations, should be considered in determining availability. The final  8   regulations adopt this suggestion because nonfinancial restrictions would reasonably affect whether vouchers are available for distribution by an employer to an employee. The final regulations provide guidance on the types of nonfinancial restrictions that cause vouchers to not be readily available. The final regulations provide that certain nonfinancial restrictions, such as a voucher provider not making vouchers available for purchase at reasonable intervals or failing to provide the vouchers within a reasonable period after receiving payment for the voucher, cause vouchers to not be readily available. In addition, if a voucher provider does not provide vouchers in reasonably appropriate quantities, or in reasonably appropriate denominations, vouchers may not be readily available. W hen and as the standards in these final regulations go into effect, they will supercede the current law standards in Notice 94-3. B. Advance Transit Passes Commentators suggested that the administrability of transit pass programs would be improved if vouchers were permitted to be distributed in advance for more than one month. The final regulations adopt this suggestion. In October of this year, the IRS issued Announcement 2000-78 (2000-43 I.R.B. 428) to notify taxpayers that, when finalized, the regulations will clarify that transit passes may be distributed in advance for more than one month (such as for a calendar quarter) by taking into account the monthly limits for all months for which the transit  9   passes are distributed. The announcement further provides, however, that if an employee receives advance transit passes, and the employee's employment terminates before the beginning of the last month of the period for which the transit passes were provided, the employer must include in the employee's wages, for income and for employment tax purposes (FICA, FUTA, and income tax withholding), the value of the passes provided for those month(s) beginning after the employee's employment terminates to the extent the employer does not recover those transit passes or the value of those passes. The announcement provides that pending the issuance of these final regulations, employers may rely on the announcement. The final regulations differ from the announcement in one respect. In any case in which transit passes are provided in advance for a period of no more than three months (such as for a calendar quarter), but the recipient ceases to be an employee before the beginning of the last month in that period, the final regulations provide that the value of a transit pass provided in advance for a month is excluded from wages for employment tax (FICA, FUTA, and income tax withholding) purposes (but not for income tax purposes) unless at the time the transit passes were distributed there was an established termination date that was before the beginning of the last month of that period and the employee does in fact terminate employment before the beginning of the last month of that period. C. Qualified Parking  10   The final regulations address whether reimbursement paid to an employee for parking at a work location away from the employee's permanent work location is excludable from wages for income and employment tax purposes under section 132(f). Section 132(f)(5)(C) defines qualified parking, in part, as ""parking provided to an employee on or near the business premises of the employer . . . ."" The final regulations provide that qualified parking includes parking on or near a work location at which the employee performs services for the employer. However, qualified parking does not include reimbursement for parking that is otherwise excludable from gross income as a reimbursement treated as paid under an accountable plan under 1.62-2 of the Income Tax Regulations, or parking provided in kind to an employee that is excludable from the employee's gross income as a working condition fringe under section 132(a)(3). Thus, if the exclusion at 1.62-2 or section 132(a)(3) is available (even if not reimbursed by the employer), then section 132(f) does not apply. W hether a reimbursement for local transportation expenses, including parking at a work location away from the employee's permanent work location, is excludable from the employee's gross income under 1.62-2, or whether parking provided in kind to an employee is excludable from the employee's gross income under section 132(a)(3), is determined based upon whether the parking expenses would be deductible if paid or incurred by the employee under section 162(a) as an expense incurred in the employee's trade or business of being an employee for the employer. 1.62-2(d);  11   1.132-5(a)(2). Revenue Ruling 99-7 (1999-1 C.B. 361) addresses under what circumstances daily transportation expenses, including parking, incurred by a taxpayer in going between the taxpayer's residence and a work location are deductible by the taxpayer under section 162(a). The final regulations provide the minimum requirements to ensure that transportation benefits are qualified transportation fringes under section 132(f). An employer may have a transit benefit program that is more restrictive than a program meeting the minimum requirements under the regulations. In addition, these regulations do not affect the application of authorities outside the Internal Revenue Code which may restrict a transportation benefit program. Federal Government agencies, for example, may be required by other federal law to implement restrictions beyond those required under these regulations. D. Applicability Date The regulations are generally applicable for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2001. However, in order to provide a transition period for those affected by the 1 percent rule (described under ""The 1 percent safe harbor"" in this preamble), that rule is applicable for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2003. Effect on Other Documents The following document is obsolete as of January 11, 2001: Announcement 2000-78 (2000-43 I.R.B. 428).  12   The following document is modified as of the date these regulations become applicable (see Q/A-25): Notice 94-3 (1994-1 C.B. 327). Special Analyses It has been determined that this Treasury Decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) does not apply to these regulations. A final  regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared for the collection of information in this Treasury decision under 5 U.S.C. 604. A summary of the analysis is set forth in this preamble under the heading ""Summary of Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis."" Summary of Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis This analysis is required under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6). The collection of information under this rule is based upon the requirements under section 132(f). W e estimate that approximately 265,000 employers that provide qualified transportation fringes to their employees will be affected by the recordkeeping requirements of this rule. None of the comments received in response to the notice of proposed rulemaking specifically addressed the initial regulatory flexibility analysis. Section 132(f)(3) provides that qualified transportation fringes may be provided in the form of cash reimbursement. The legislative history indicates that an employer  13   providing cash reimbursement to the employer's employees for qualified transportation fringes must establish a bona fide reimbursement arrangement. As a condition to providing cash reimbursement for qualified transportation fringes, this rule provides that employers must receive substantiation from employees. The objective of this rule is to ensure that reimbursements are made for qualified transportation fringes. W hether an arrangement constitutes a bona fide reimbursement arrangement varies depending on the facts and circumstances, including the method or methods of payment utilized within a mass transit system. An employee certification in either written or electronic form may be sufficient depending upon the facts and circumstances. For example, if receipts are not provided in the ordinary course of business, such as with respect to metered parking or used transit passes that cannot be returned to the user, an employee certification that expenses have been incurred constitutes a reasonable reimbursement procedure. A certification that expenses will be incurred in the future, by itself, is not a reasonable reimbursement procedure. There are no particular professional skills required to maintain these records. In addition, section 132(f)(4) provides that an employee may choose between cash compensation and qualified transportation fringes. This rule provides that an employer may allow an employee the choice to receive either a fixed amount of cash compensation at a specified future date or a fixed amount of qualified transportation fringes to be provided for a specified future period (such as qualified parking to be used during a future calendar month). This rule provides that employers must keep records 14   with respect to employee compensation reduction elections. An employee's election must be in writing or some other permanent and verifiable form, and include the date of the election, the amount of compensation to be reduced, and the period for which the qualified transportation fringes will be provided. The objective of this rule is to ensure against recharacterization of taxable compensation after it has been paid to the employee. There are no particular professional skills required to maintain these records. A less burdensome alternative for small organizations would be to exempt those entities from the recordkeeping requirements under this rule. However, it would be inconsistent with the statutory provisions and legislative history to exempt those entities from the recordkeeping requirements imposed under this rule. This rule provides several options which avoid more burdensome recordkeeping requirements for small entities. This rule provides that (1) there are no substantiation requirements if the employer distributes transit passes in kind; (2) a compensation reduction election may be made electronically; (3) an election to reduce compensation may be automatically renewed; (4) an employer may provide for deemed compensation reduction elections under its qualified transportation fringe benefit plan; and (5) a requirement that a voucher be distributed in-kind by the employer is satisfied if the voucher is distributed by the employer or by another person on behalf of the employer (for example, if a transit operator credits amounts to the employee's fare card as a result of payments made to the operator by the employer). 15   Drafting Information The principal author of these regulations is John Richards, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel (Exempt Organizations/Employment Tax/Government Entities).

W hat is the effective date of this section? (b) Questions and answers. Q-1. W hat is a qualified transportation fringe? A-1. (a) The following benefits are qualified transportation fringe benefits: (1) Transportation in a commuter highway vehicle. (2) Transit passes. (3) Qualified parking. (b) An employer may simultaneously provide an employee with any one or more of these three benefits. Q-2. W hat is transportation in a commuter highway vehicle?  19   A-2. Transportation in a commuter highway vehicle is transportation provided by an employer to an employee in connection with travel between the employee's residence and place of employment. A commuter highway vehicle is a highway vehicle with a seating capacity of at least 6 adults (excluding the driver) and with respect to which at least 80 percent of the vehicle's mileage for a year is reasonably expected to be-(a) For transporting employees in connection with travel between their residences and their place of employment; and (b) On trips during which the number of employees transported for commuting is at least one-half of the adult seating capacity of the vehicle (excluding the driver). Q-3. W hat are transit passes? A-3. A transit pass is any pass, token, farecard, voucher, or similar item (including an item exchangeable for fare media) that entitles a person to transportation-(a) On mass transit facilities (whether or not publicly owned); or (b) Provided by any person in the business of transporting persons for compensation or hire in a highway vehicle with a seating capacity of at least 6 adults (excluding the driver). Q-4. W hat is qualified parking? A-4. (a) Qualified parking is parking provided to an employee by an employer-(1) On or near the employer's business premises; or  20   (2) At a location from which the employee commutes to work (including commuting by carpool, commuter highway vehicle, mass transit facilities, or transportation provided by any person in the business of transporting persons for compensation or hire). (b) For purposes of section 132(f), parking on or near the employer's business premises includes parking on or near a work location at which the employee provides services for the employer. However, qualified parking does not include-(1) The value of parking provided to an employee that is excludable from gross income under section 132(a)(3) (as a working condition fringe), or (2) Reimbursement paid to an employee for parking costs that is excludable from gross income as an amount treated as paid under an accountable plan. See 1.62-2. (c) However, parking on or near property used by the employee for residential purposes is not qualified parking. (d) Parking is provided by an employer if-(1) The parking is on property that the employer owns or leases; (2) The employer pays for the parking; or (3) The employer reimburses the employee for parking expenses (see Q/A-16 of this section for rules relating to cash reimbursements). Q-5. May qualified transportation fringes be provided to individuals who are not employees? A-5. An employer may provide qualified transportation fringes only to individuals who are currently employees of the employer at the time the qualified transportation 21   fringe is provided. The term employee for purposes of qualified transportation fringes is defined in 1.132-1(b)(2)(i). This term includes only common law employees and other statutory employees, such as officers of corporations. See Q/A-24 of this section for rules regarding partners, 2-percent shareholders, and independent contractors. Q-6. Must a qualified transportation fringe benefit plan be in writing? A-6. No. Section 132(f) does not require that a qualified transportation fringe benefit plan be in writing. Q-7. Is there a limit on the value of qualified transportation fringes that may be excluded from an employee's gross income? A-7. (a) Transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and transit passes. Before January 1, 2002, up to $65 per month is excludable from the gross income of an employee for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and transit passes provided by an employer. On January 1, 2002, this amount is increased to $100 per month. (b) Parking. Up to $175 per month is excludable from the gross income of an employee for qualified parking. (c) Combination. An employer may provide qualified parking benefits in addition to transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and transit passes. (d) Cost-of-living adjustments. The amounts in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Q/A-7 are adjusted annually, beginning with 2000, to reflect cost-of-living. The adjusted figures are announced by the Service before the beginning of the year.  22   Q-8. W hat amount is includible in an employee's wages for income and employment tax purposes if the value of the qualified transportation fringe exceeds the applicable statutory monthly limit? A-8. (a) Generally, an employee must include in gross income the amount by which the fair market value of the benefit exceeds the sum of the amount, if any, paid by the employee and any amount excluded from gross income under section 132(a)(5). Thus, assuming no other statutory exclusion applies, if an employer provides an employee with a qualified transportation fringe that exceeds the applicable statutory monthly limit and the employee does not make any payment, the value of the benefits provided in excess of the applicable statutory monthly limit is included in the employee's wages for income and employment tax purposes. See 1.61-21(b)(1). (b) The following examples illustrate the principles of this Q/A-8: Example 1. (i) For each month in a year in which the statutory monthly transit pass limit is $100 (i.e., a year after 2001), Employer M provides a transit pass valued at $110 to Employee D, who does not pay any amount to Employer M for the transit pass. (ii) In this Example 1, because the value of the monthly transit pass exceeds the statutory monthly limit by $10, $120 ($110 - $100, times 12 months) must be included in D's wages for income and employment tax purposes for the year with respect to the transit passes. Example 2. (i) For each month in a year in which the statutory monthly qualified parking limit is $175, Employer M provides qualified parking valued at $195 to Employee E, who does not pay any amount to M for the parking. (ii) In this Example 2, because the fair market value of the qualified parking exceeds the statutory monthly limit by $20, $240 ($195 - $175, times 12 months) must be included in Employee E's wages for income and employment tax purposes for the year with respect to the qualified parking. 23   Example 3. (i) For each month in a year in which the statutory monthly qualified parking limit is $175, Employer P provides qualified parking with a fair market value of $220 per month to its employees, but charges each employee $45 per month. (ii) In this Example 3, because the sum of the amount paid by an employee ($45) plus the amount excludable for qualified parking ($175) is not less than the fair market value of the monthly benefit, no amount is includible in the employee's wages for income and employment tax purposes with respect to the qualified parking. Q-9. Are excludable qualified transportation fringes calculated on a monthly basis? A-9. (a) In general. Yes. The value of transportation in a commuter highway vehicle, transit passes, and qualified parking is calculated on a monthly basis to determine whether the value of the benefit has exceeded the applicable statutory monthly limit on qualified transportation fringes. Except in the case of a transit pass provided to an employee, the applicable statutory monthly limit applies to qualified transportation fringes used by the employee in a month. Monthly exclusion amounts are not combined to provide a qualified transportation fringe for any month exceeding the statutory limit. A month is a calendar month or a substantially equivalent period applied consistently. (b) Transit passes. In the case of transit passes provided to an employee, the applicable statutory monthly limit applies to the transit passes provided by the employer to the employee in a month for that month or for any previous month in the calendar year. In addition, transit passes distributed in advance for more than one month, but not for more than twelve months, are qualified transportation fringes if the requirements in paragraph (c) of this Q/A-9 are met (relating to the income tax and employment tax  24   treatment of advance transit passes). The applicable statutory monthly limit under section 132(f)(2) on the combined amount of transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and transit passes may be calculated by taking into account the monthly limits for all months for which the transit passes are distributed. In the case of a pass that is valid for more than one month, such as an annual pass, the value of the pass may be divided by the number of months for which it is valid for purposes of determining whether the value of the pass exceeds the statutory monthly limit. (c) Rule if employee's employment terminates-- (1) income tax treatment. The value of transit passes provided in advance to an employee with respect to a month in which the individual is not an employee is included in the employee's wages for income tax purposes. (2) Reporting and employment tax treatment. Transit passes distributed in advance to an employee are excludable from wages for employment tax purposes under sections 3121, 3306, and 3401 (FICA, FUTA, and income tax withholding) if the employer distributes transit passes to the employee in advance for not more than three months and, at the time the transit passes are distributed, there is not an established date that the employee's employment will terminate (for example, if the employee has given notice of retirement) which will occur before the beginning of the last month of the period for which the transit passes are provided. If the employer distributes transit passes to an employee in advance for not more than three months and at the time the transit passes are distributed there is an established date that the employee's 25   employment will terminate, and the employee's employment does terminate before the beginning of the last month of the period for which the transit passes are provided, the value of transit passes provided for months beginning after the date of termination during which the employee is not employed by the employer is included in the employee's wages for employment tax purposes. If transit passes are distributed in advance for more than three months, the value of transit passes provided for the months during which the employee is not employed by the employer is includible in the employee's wages for employment tax purposes regardless of whether at the time the transit passes were distributed there was an established date of termination of the employee's employment. (d) Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of this Q/A-9: Example 1. (i) Employee E incurs $150 for qualified parking used during the month of June of a year in which the statutory monthly parking limit is $175, for which E is reimbursed $150 by Employer R. Employee E incurs $180 in expenses for qualified parking used during the month of July of that year, for which E is reimbursed $180 by Employer R. (ii) In this Example 1, because monthly exclusion amounts may not be combined to provide a benefit in any month greater than the applicable statutory limit, the amount by which the amount reimbursed for July exceeds the applicable statutory monthly limit ($180 minus $175 equals $5) is includible in Employee E's wages for income and employment tax purposes. Example 2. (i) $195 in March of a January, February, received any transi Employee F receives transit passes from Employer G with a value of year (for which the statutory monthly transit pass limit is $65) for and March of that year. F was hired during January and has not t passes from G.  (ii) In this Example 2, the value of the transit passes (three months times $65 equals $195) is excludable from F's wages for income and employment tax purposes. 26   Example 3. (i) Employer S has a qualif which its employees receive transit passes for that calendar quarter. All employees of Employer S with a value of $195 on March the months April, May, and June (of a year limit is $65).  ied transportation fringe benefit plan under near the beginning of each calendar quarter Employer S receive transit passes from 31 for the second calendar quarter covering in which the statutory monthly transit pass  (ii) In this Example 3, because the value of the transit passes may be calculated by taking into account the monthly limits for all months for which the transit passes are distributed, the value of the transit passes (three months times $65 equals $195) is excludable from the employees' wages for income and employment tax purposes. Example 4. (i) Same facts as in Example 3, except that Employee T, an employee of Employer S, terminates employment with S on May 31. There was not an established date of termination for Employee T at the time the transit passes were distributed. (ii) In this Example 4, because at the time the transit passes were distributed there was not an established date of termination for Employee T, the value of the transit passes provided for June ($65) is excludable from T's wages for employment tax purposes. However, the value of the transit passes distributed to Employee T for June ($65) is not excludable from T's wages for income tax purposes. (iii) If Employee T's May 31 termination date was established at the time the transit passes were provided, the value of the transit passes provided for June ($65) is included in T's wages for both income and employment tax purposes. Example 5. (i) Employer F has a qualified transportation fringe benefit plan under which its employees receive transit passes semi-annually in advance of the months for which the transit passes are provided. All employees of Employer F, including Employee X, receive transit passes from F with a value of $390 on June 30 for the 6 months of July through December (of a year in which the statutory monthly transit pass limit is $65). Employee X's employment terminates and his last day of work is August 1. Employer F's other employees remain employed throughout the remainder of the year. (ii) In this Example 5, the value of the transit passes provided to Employee X for the months September, October, November, and December ($65 times 4 months equals $260) of the year is included in X's wages for income and employment tax purposes. The value of the transit passes provided to Employer F's other employees is excludable from the employees' wages for income and employment tax purposes. 27   Example 6. (i) Each month during a year in which the statutory monthly transit pass limit is $65, Employer R distributes transit passes with a face amount of $70 to each of its employees. Transit passes with a face amount of $70 can be purchased from the transit system by any individual for $65. (ii) In this Example 6, because the value of the transit passes distributed by Employer R does not exceed the applicable statutory monthly limit ($65), no portion of the value of the transit passes is included as wages for income and employment tax purposes. Q-10. May an employee receive qualified transportation fringes from more than one employer? A-10. (a) General rule. Yes. The statutory monthly limits described in Q/A-7 of this section apply to benefits provided by an employer to its employees. For this purpose, all employees treated as employed by a single employer under section 414(b), (c), (m), or (o) are treated as employed by a single employer. See section 414(t) and 1.132-1(c). Thus, qualified transportation fringes paid by entities under common control under section 414(b), (c), (m), or (o) are combined for purposes of applying the applicable statutory monthly limit. In addition, an individual who is treated as a leased employee of the employer under section 414(n) is treated as an employee of that employer for purposes of section 132. See section 414(n)(3)(C). (b) Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of this Q/A-10: Example 1. (i) During a year in which the statutory monthly qualified parking limit is $175, Employee E works for Employers M and N, who are unrelated and not treated as a single employer under section 414(b), (c), (m), or (o). Each month, M and N each provide qualified parking benefits to E with a value of $100. (ii) In this Example 1, because M and N are unrelated employers, and the value of the monthly parking benefit provided by each is not more than the applicable statutory 28   monthly limit, the parking benefits provided by each employer are excludable as qualified transportation fringes assuming that the other requirements of this section are satisfied. Example 2. (i) Same facts as in Example 1, except that Employers M and N are treated as a single employer under section 414(b). (ii) In this Example 2, because M and N are treated as a single employer, the value of the monthly parking benefit provided by M and N must be combined for purposes of determining whether the applicable statutory monthly limit has been exceeded. Thus, the amount by which the value of the parking benefit exceeds the monthly limit ($200 minus the monthly limit amount of $175 equals $25) for each month in the year is includible in E's wages for income and employment tax purposes. Q-11. May qualified transportation fringes be provided to employees pursuant to a compensation reduction agreement? A-11. Yes. An employer may offer employees a choice between cash compensation and any qualified transportation fringe. An employee who is offered this choice and who elects qualified transportation fringes is not required to include the cash compensation in income if-(a) The election is pursuant to an arrangement described in Q/A-12 of this section; (b) The amount of the reduction in cash compensation does not exceed the limitation in Q/A-13 of this section; (c) The arrangement satisfies the timing and reimbursement rules in Q/A-14 and 16 of this section; and (d) The related fringe benefit arrangement otherwise satisfies the requirements set forth elsewhere in this section. Q-12. W hat is a compensation reduction election for purposes of section 132(f)? 29   A-12. (a) Election requirements generally. A compensation reduction arrangement is an arrangement under which the employer provides the employee with the right to elect whether the employee will receive either a fixed amount of cash compensation at a specified future date or a fixed amount of qualified transportation fringes to be provided for a specified future period (such as qualified parking to be used during a future calendar month). The employee's election must be in writing or another form, such as electronic, that includes, in a permanent and verifiable form, the information required to be in the election. The election must contain the date of the election, the amount of the compensation to be reduced, and the period for which the benefit will be provided. The election must relate to a fixed dollar amount or fixed percentage of compensation reduction. An election to reduce compensation for a period by a set amount for such period may be automatically renewed for subsequent periods. (b) Automatic election permitted. An employer may provide under its qualified transportation fringe benefit plan that a compensation reduction election will be deemed to have been made if the employee does not elect to receive cash compensation in lieu of the qualified transportation fringe, provided that the employee receives adequate notice that a compensation reduction will be made and is given adequate opportunity to choose to receive the cash compensation instead of the qualified transportation fringe. Q13. Is there a limit to the amount of the compensation reduction?  30   A13. Yes. Each month, the amount of the compensation reduction may not exceed the combined applicable statutory monthly limits for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle, transit passes, and qualified parking. For example, for a year in which the statutory monthly limit is $65 for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and transit passes, and $175 for qualified parking, an employee could elect to reduce compensation for any month by no more than $240 ($65 plus $175) with respect to qualified transportation fringes. If an employee were to elect to reduce compensation by $250 for a month, the excess $10 ($250 minus $240) would be includible in the employee's wages for income and employment tax purposes. Q14. W hen must the employee have made a compensation reduction election and under what circumstances may the amount be paid in cash to the employee? A14. (a) The compensation reduction election must satisfy the requirements set forth under paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this Q/A-14. (b) Timing of election. The compensation reduction election must be made before the employee is able currently to receive the cash or other taxable amount at the employee's discretion. The determination of whether the employee is able currently to receive the cash does not depend on whether it has been constructively received for purposes of section 451. The election must specify that the period (such as a calendar month) for which the qualified transportation fringe will be provided must not begin before the election is made. Thus, a compensation reduction election must relate to  31   qualified transportation fringes to be provided after the election. For this purpose, the date a qualified transportation fringe is provided is-(1) The date the employee receives a voucher or similar item; or (2) In any other case, the date the employee uses the qualified transportation fringe. (c) Revocability of elections. The employee may not revoke a compensation reduction election after the employee is able currently to receive the cash or other taxable amount at the employee's discretion. In addition, the election may not be revoked after the beginning of the period for which the qualified transportation fringe will be provided. (d) Compensation reduction amounts not refundable. Unless an election is revoked in a manner consistent with paragraph (c) of this Q/A-14, an employee may not subsequently receive the compensation (in cash or any form other than by payment of a qualified transportation fringe under the employer's plan). Thus, an employer's qualified transportation fringe benefit plan may not provide that an employee who ceases to participate in the employer's qualified transportation fringe benefit plan (such as in the case of termination of employment) is entitled to receive a refund of the amount by which the employee's compensation reductions exceed the actual qualified transportation fringes provided to the employee by the employer. (e) Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of this Q/A-14: Example 1. (i) Employer P maintains a qualified transportation fringe benefit arrangement during a year in which the statutory monthly limit is $100 for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and transit passes (2002 or later) and $180 for qualified 32   parking. Employees of P are paid cash compensation twice per month, with the payroll dates being the first and the fifteenth day of the month. Under P's arrangement, an employee is permitted to elect at any time before the first day of a month to reduce his or her compensation payable during that month in an amount up to the applicable statutory monthly limit ($100 if the employee elects coverage for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle or a mass transit pass, or $180 if the employee chooses qualified parking) in return for the right to receive qualified transportation fringes up to the amount of the election. If such an election is made, P will provide a mass transit pass for that month with a value not exceeding the compensation reduction amount elected by the employee or will reimburse the cost of other qualified transportation fringes used by the employee on or after the first day of that month up to the compensation reduction amount elected by the employee. Any compensation reduction amount elected by the employee for the month that is not used for qualified transportation fringes is not refunded to the employee at any future date. (ii) In this Example 1, the arrangement satisfies the requirements of this Q/A-14 because the election is made before the employee is able currently to receive the cash and the election specifies the future period for which the qualified transportation fringes will be provided. The arrangement would also satisfy the requirements of this Q/A-14 and Q/A-13 of this section if employees are allowed to elect to reduce compensation up to $280 per month ($100 plus $180). (iii) The arrangement would also satisfy the requirements of this Q/A-14 (and Q/A13 of this section) if employees are allowed to make an election at any time before the first or the fifteenth day of the month to reduce their compensation payable on that payroll date by an amount not in excess of one-half of the applicable statutory monthly limit (depending on the type of qualified transportation fringe elected by the employee) and P provides a mass transit pass on or after the applicable payroll date for the compensation reduction amount elected by the employee for the payroll date or reimburses the cost of other qualified transportation fringes used by the employee on or after the payroll date up to the compensation reduction amount elected by the employee for that payroll date. Example 2. (i) Employee Q elects to reduce his compensation payable on March 1 of a year (for which the statutory monthly mass transit limit is $65) by $195 in exchange for a mass transit voucher to be provided in March. The election is made on the preceding February 27. Employee Q was hired in January of the year. On March 10 of the year, the employer of Employee Q delivers to Employee Q a mass transit voucher worth $195 for the months of January, February, and March.  33   (ii) In this Example 2, $65 is included in Employee Q's wages for income and employment tax purposes because the compensation reduction election fails to satisfy the requirement in this Q/A-14 and Q/A-12 of this section that the period for which the qualified transportation fringe will be provided not begin before the election is made to the extent the election relates to $65 worth of transit passes for January of the year. The $65 for February is not taxable because the election was for a future period that includes at least one day in February. (iii) However, no amount would be included in Employee Q's wages as a result of the election if $195 worth of mass transit passes were instead provided to Q for the months of February, March, and April (because the compensation reduction would relate solely to fringes to be provided for a period not beginning before the date of the election and the amount provided does not exceed the aggregate limit for the period, i.e., the sum of $65 for each of February, March, and April). See Q/A-9 of this section for rules governing transit passes distributed in advance for more than one month. Example 3. (i) Employee R elects to reduce his compensation payable on March 1 of a year (for which the statutory monthly parking limit is $175) by $185 in exchange for reimbursement by Employer T of parking expenses incurred by Employee R for parking on or near Employer T's business premises during the period beginning after the date of the election through March. The election is made on the preceding February 27. Employee R incurs $10 in parking expenses on February 28 of the year, and $175 in parking expenses during the month of March. On April 5 of the year, Employer T reimburses Employee R $185 for the parking expenses incurred on February 28, and during March, of the year. (ii) In this Example 3, no amount would be includible in Employee R's wages for income and employment tax purposes because the compensation reduction related solely to parking on or near Employer R's business premises used during a period not beginning before the date of the election and the amount reimbursed for parking used in any one month does not exceed the statutory monthly limitation. Q15. May an employee whose qualified transportation fringe costs are less than the employee's compensation reduction carry over this excess amount to subsequent periods? A15. (a) Yes. An employee may carry over unused compensation reduction amounts to subsequent periods under the plan of the employee's employer. 34   (b) The following example illustrates the principles of this Q/A-15: Example. (i) By an election made before November 1 of a year for which the statutory monthly mass transit limit is $65, Employee E elects to reduce compensation in the amount of $65 for the month of November. E incurs $50 in employee-operated commuter highway vehicle expenses during November for which E is reimbursed $50 by Employer R, E's employer. By an election made before December, E elects to reduce compensation by $65 for the month of December. E incurs $65 in employeeoperated commuter highway vehicle expenses during December for which E is reimbursed $65 by R. Before the following January, E elects to reduce compensation by $50 for the month of January. E incurs $65 in employee-operated commuter highway vehicle expenses during January for which E is reimbursed $65 by R because R allows E to carry over to the next year the $15 amount by which the compensation reductions for November and December exceeded the employee-operated commuter highway vehicle expenses incurred during those months. (ii) In this Example, because Employee E is reimbursed in an amount not exceeding the applicable statutory monthly limit, and the reimbursement does not exceed the amount of employee-operated commuter highway vehicle expenses incurred during the month of January, the amount reimbursed ($65) is excludable from E's wages for income and employment tax purposes. Q16. How does section 132(f) apply to expense reimbursements? A-16. (a) In general. The term qualified transportation fringe includes cash reimbursement by an employer to an employee for expenses incurred or paid by an employee for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle or qualified parking. The term qualified transportation fringe also includes cash reimbursement for transit passes made under a bona fide reimbursement arrangement, but, in accordance with section 132(f)(3), only if permitted under paragraph (b) of this Q/A-16. The reimbursement must be made under a bona fide reimbursement arrangement which meets the rules of paragraph (c) of this Q/A-16. A payment made before the date an expense has been incurred or paid is not a reimbursement. In addition, a bona fide reimbursement 35   arrangement does not include an arrangement that is dependent solely upon an employee certifying in advance that the employee will incur expenses at some future date. (b) Special rule for transit passes-- (1) In general. The term qualified transportation fringe includes cash reimbursement for transit passes made under a bona fide reimbursement arrangement, but, in accordance with section 132(f)(3), only if no voucher or similar item that may be exchanged only for a transit pass is readily available for direct distribution by the employer to employees. If a voucher is readily available, the requirement that a voucher be distributed in-kind by the employer is satisfied if the voucher is distributed by the employer or by another person on behalf of the employer (for example, if a transit operator credits amounts to the employee's fare card as a result of payments made to the operator by the employer). (2) Voucher or similar item. For purposes of the special rule in paragraph (b) of this Q/A-16, a transit system voucher is an instrument that may be purchased by employers from a voucher provider that is accepted by one or more mass transit operators (e.g., train, subway, and bus) in an area as fare media or in exchange for fare media. Thus, for example, a transit pass that may be purchased by employers directly from a voucher provider is a transit system voucher. (3) Voucher provider. The term voucher provider means any person in the trade or business of selling transit system vouchers to employers, or any transit system or transit operator that sells vouchers to employers for the purpose of direct distribution to 36   employees. Thus, a transit operator might or might not be a voucher provider. A voucher provider is not, for example, a third-party employee benefits administrator that administers a transit pass benefit program for an employer using vouchers that the employer could obtain directly. (4) Readily available. For purposes of this paragraph (b), a voucher or similar item is readily available for direct distribution by the employer to employees if and only if an employer can obtain it from a voucher provider that (i) does not impose fare media charges that cause vouchers to not be readily available as described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section; and (ii) does not impose other restrictions that cause vouchers to not be readily available as described in paragraph (b)(6) of this section. (5) Fare media charges. For purposes of paragraph (b)(4) of this section, fare media charges relate only to fees paid by the employer to voucher providers for vouchers. The determination of whether obtaining a voucher would result in fare media charges that cause vouchers to not be readily available as described in this paragraph (b) is made with respect to each transit system voucher. If more than one transit system voucher is available for direct distribution to employees, the employer must consider the fees imposed for the lowest cost monthly voucher for purposes of determining whether the fees imposed by the voucher provider satisfy this paragraph. However, if transit system vouchers for multiple transit systems are required in an area to meet the transit needs of the individual employees in that area, the employer has the 37   option of averaging the costs applied to each transit system voucher for purposes of determining whether the fare media charges for transit system vouchers satisfy this paragraph. Fare media charges are described in this paragraph (b)(5), and therefore cause vouchers to not be readily available, if and only if the average annual fare media charges that the employer reasonably expects to incur for transit system vouchers purchased from the voucher provider (disregarding reasonable and customary delivery charges imposed by the voucher provider, e.g., not in excess of $15) are more than 1 percent of the average annual value of the vouchers for a transit system. (6) Other restrictions. For purposes of paragraph (b)(4) of this section, restrictions that cause vouchers to not be readily available are restrictions imposed by the voucher provider other than fare media charges that effectively prevent the employer from obtaining vouchers appropriate for distribution to employees. Examples of such restrictions include-(i) Advance purchase requirements. Advance purchase requirements cause vouchers to not be readily available only if the voucher provider does not offer vouchers at regular intervals or fails to provide the voucher within a reasonable period after receiving payment for the voucher. For example, a requirement that vouchers may be purchased only once per year may effectively prevent an employer from obtaining vouchers for distribution to employees. An advance purchase requirement that vouchers be purchased not more frequently than monthly does not effectively prevent the employer from obtaining vouchers for distribution to employees. 38   (ii) Purchase quantity requirements. Purchase quantity requirements cause vouchers to not be readily available if the voucher provider does not offer vouchers in quantities that are reasonably appropriate to the number of the employer's employees who use mass transportation (for example, the voucher provider requires a $1,000 minimum purchase and the employer seeks to purchase only $200 of vouchers). (iii) Limitations on denominations of vouchers that are available. If the voucher provider does not offer vouchers in denominations appropriate for distribution to the employer's employees, vouchers are not readily available. For example, vouchers provided in $5 increments up to the monthly limit are appropriate for distribution to employees, while vouchers available only in a denomination equal to the monthly limit are not appropriate for distribution to employees if the amount of the benefit provided to the employer's employees each month is normally less than the monthly limit. (7) Example. The following example illustrates the principles of this paragraph (b): Example. (i) Company C in City X sells mass transit vouchers to employers in the metropolitan area of X in various denominations appropriate for distribution to employees. Employers can purchase vouchers monthly in reasonably appropriate quantities. Several different bus, rail, van pool, and ferry operators service X, and a number of the operators accept the vouchers either as fare media or in exchange for fare media. To cover its operating expenses, C imposes on each voucher a 50 cents charge, plus a reasonable and customary $15 charge for delivery of each order of vouchers. Employer M disburses vouchers purchased from C to its employees who use operators that accept the vouchers and M reasonably expects that $55 is the average value of the voucher it will purchase from C for the next calendar year. (ii) In this Example, vouchers for X are readily available for direct distribution by the employer to employees because the expected cost of the vouchers disbursed to M's employees for the next calendar year is not more than 1 percent of the value of the vouchers (50 cents divided by $55 equals 0.91 percent), the delivery charges are 39   disregarded because they are reasonable and customary, and there are no other restrictions that cause the vouchers to not be readily available. Thus, any reimbursement of mass transportation costs in X would not be a qualified transportation fringe. (c) Substantiation requirements. Employers that make cash reimbursements must establish a bona fide reimbursement arrangement to establish that their employees have, in fact, incurred expenses for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle, transit passes, or qualified parking. For purposes of section 132(f), whether cash reimbursements are made under a bona fide reimbursement arrangement may vary depending on the facts and circumstances, including the method or methods of payment utilized within the mass transit system. The employer must implement reasonable procedures to ensure that an amount equal to the reimbursement was incurred for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle, transit passes, or qualified parking. The expense must be substantiated within a reasonable period of time. An expense substantiated to the payor within 180 days after it has been paid will be treated as having been substantiated within a reasonable period of time. An employee certification at the time of reimbursement in either written or electronic form may be a reasonable reimbursement procedure depending on the facts and circumstances. Examples of reasonable reimbursement procedures are set forth in paragraph (d) of this Q/A-16. (d) Illustrations of reasonable reimbursement procedures. The following are examples of reasonable reimbursement procedures for purposes of paragraph (c) of  40   this Q/A-16. In each case, the reimbursement is made at or within a reasonable period after the end of the events described in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(3) of this section.  (1) An employee presents to the employer a parking expense receipt for parking on or near the employer's business premises, the employee certifies that the parking was used by the employee, and the employer has no reason to doubt the employee's certification. (2) An employee either submits a used time-sensitive transit pass (such as a monthly pass) to the employer and certifies that he or she purchased it or presents an unused or used transit pass to the employer and certifies that he or she purchased it and the employee certifies that he or she has not previously been reimbursed for the transit pass. In both cases, the employer has no reason to doubt the employee's certification. (3) If a receipt is not provided in the ordinary course of business (e.g., if the employee uses metered parking or if used transit passes cannot be returned to the user), the employee certifies to the employer the type and the amount of expenses incurred, and the employer has no reason to doubt the employee's certification. Q-17. May an employer provide nontaxable cash reimbursement under section 132(f) for periods longer than one month? A-17. (a) General rule. Yes. Qualified transportation fringes include reimbursement to employees for costs incurred for transportation in more than one 41   month, provided the reimbursement for each month in the period is calculated separately and does not exceed the applicable statutory monthly limit for any month in the period. See Q/A-8 and 9 of this section if the limit for a month is exceeded. (b) Example. The following example illustrates the principles of this Q/A-17: Example. (i) Employee R pays $100 per month for qualified parking used during the period from April 1 through June 30 of a year in which the statutory monthly qualified parking limit is $175. After receiving adequate substantiation from Employee R, R's employer reimburses R $300 in cash on June 30 of that year. (ii) In this Example, because the value of the reimbursed expenses for each month did not exceed the applicable statutory monthly limit, the $300 reimbursement is excludable from R's wages for income and employment tax purposes as a qualified transportation fringe. Q-18. W hat are the substantiation requirements if an employer distributes transit passes? A-18. There are no substantiation requirements if the employer distributes transit passes. Thus, an employer may distribute a transit pass for each month with a value not more than the statutory monthly limit without requiring any certification from the employee regarding the use of the transit pass. Q-19. May an employer choose to impose substantiation requirements in addition to those described in this regulation? A-19. Yes. Q-20. How is the value of parking determined? A-20. Section 1.61-21(b)(2) applies for purposes of determining the value of parking. 42   Q-21. How do the qualified transportation fringe rules apply to van pools? A-21. (a) Van pools generally. Employer and employee-operated van pools, as well as private or public transit-operated van pools, may qualify as qualified transportation fringes. The value of van pool benefits which are qualified transportation fringes may be excluded up to the applicable statutory monthly limit for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and transit passes, less the value of any transit passes provided by the employer for the month. (b) Employer-operated van pools. The value of van pool transportation provided by or for an employer to its employees is excludable as a qualified transportation fringe, provided the van qualifies as a commuter highway vehicle as defined in section 132(f)(5)(B) and Q/A-2 of this section. A van pool is operated by or for the employer if the employer purchases or leases vans to enable employees to commute together or the employer contracts with and pays a third party to provide the vans and some or all of the costs of operating the vans, including maintenance, liability insurance and other operating expenses. (c) Employee-operated van pools. Cash reimbursement by an employer to employees for expenses incurred for transportation in a van pool operated by employees independent of their employer are excludable as qualified transportation fringes, provided that the van qualifies as a commuter highway vehicle as defined in section 132(f)(5)(B) and Q/A-2 of this section. See Q/A-16 of this section for the rules governing cash reimbursements. 43   (d) Private or public transit-operated van pool transit passes. The qualified transportation fringe exclusion for transit passes is available for travel in van pools owned and operated either by public transit authorities or by any person in the business of transporting persons for compensation or hire. In accordance with paragraph (b) of Q/A-3 of this section, the van must seat at least 6 adults (excluding the driver). See Q/A-16(b) and (c) of this section for a special rule for cash reimbursement for transit passes and the substantiation requirements for cash reimbursement. (e) Value of van pool transportation benefits. Section 1.61-21(b)(2) provides that the fair market value of a fringe benefit is based on all the facts and circumstances. Alternatively, transportation in an employer-provided commuter highway vehicle may be valued under the automobile lease valuation rule in 1.61-21(d), the vehicle cents-permile rule in 1.61-21(e), or the commuting valuation rule in 1.61-21(f). If one of these special valuation rules is used, the employer must use the same valuation rule to value the use of the commuter highway vehicle by each employee who share the use. See 1.61-21(c)(2)(i)(B). (f) Qualified parking prime member. If an employee obtains a qualified parking space as a result of membership in a car or van pool, the applicable statutory monthly limit for qualified parking applies to the individual to whom the parking space is assigned. This individual is the prime member. In determining the tax consequences to the prime member, the statutory monthly limit amounts of each car pool member may not be combined. If the employer provides access to the space and the space is not 44   assigned to a particular individual, then the employer must designate one of its employees as the prime member who will bear the tax consequences. The employer may not designate more than one prime member for a car or van pool during a month. The employer of the prime member is responsible for including the value of the qualified parking in excess of the statutory monthly limit in the prime member's wages for income and employment tax purposes. Q-22. W hat are the reporting and employment tax requirements for qualified transportation fringes? A-22. (a) Employment tax treatment generally. Qualified transportation fringes not exceeding the applicable statutory monthly limit described in Q/A-7 of this section are not wages for purposes of the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA), the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), and federal income tax withholding. Any amount by which an employee elects to reduce compensation as provided in Q/A-11 of this section is not subject to the FICA, the FUTA, and federal income tax withholding. Qualified transportation fringes exceeding the applicable statutory monthly limit described in Q/A7 of this section are wages for purposes of the FICA, the FUTA, and federal income tax withholding and are reported on the employee's Form W -2, W age and Tax Statement. (b) Employment tax treatment of cash reimbursement exceeding monthly limits. Cash reimbursement to employees (for example, cash reimbursement for qualified parking) in excess of the applicable statutory monthly limit under section 132(f) is treated as paid for employment tax purposes when actually or constructively paid. See 45   31.3121(a)-2(a), 31.3301-4, 31.3402(a)-1(b) of this chapter. Employers must report and deposit the amounts withheld in addition to reporting and depositing other employment taxes. See Q/A-16 of this section for rules governing cash reimbursements. (c) Noncash fringe benefits exceeding monthly limits. If the value of noncash qualified transportation fringes exceeds the applicable statutory monthly limit, the employer may elect, for purposes of the FICA, the FUTA, and federal income tax withholding, to treat the noncash taxable fringe benefits as paid on a pay period, quarterly, semi-annual, annual, or other basis, provided that the benefits are treated as paid no less frequently than annually. Q23. How does section 132(f) interact with other fringe benefit rules? A-23. For purposes of section 132, the terms working condition fringe and de minimis fringe do not include any qualified transportation fringe under section 132(f). If, however, an employer provides local transportation other than transit passes (without any direct or indirect compensation reduction election), the value of the benefit may be excludable, either totally or partially, under fringe benefit rules other than the qualified transportation fringe rules under section 132(f). See 1.132-6(d)(2)(i) (occasional local transportation fare), 1.132-6(d)(2)(iii) (transportation provided under unusual circumstances), and 1.61-21(k) (valuation of local transportation provided to qualified employees). See also Q/A-4(b) of this section.  46   Q-24. May qualified transportation fringes be provided to individuals who are partners, 2-percent shareholders of S-corporations, or independent contractors? A-24. (a) General rule. Section 132(f)(5)(E) states that self-employed individuals who are employees within the meaning of section 401(c)(1) are not employees for purposes of section 132(f). Therefore, individuals who are partners, sole proprietors, or other independent contractors are not employees for purposes of section 132(f). In addition, under section 1372(a), 2-percent shareholders of S corporations are treated as partners for fringe benefit purposes. Thus, an individual who is both a 2-percent shareholder of an S corporation and a common law employee of that S corporation is not considered an employee for purposes of section 132(f). However, while section 132(f) does not apply to individuals who are partners, 2-percent shareholders of S corporations, or independent contractors, other exclusions for working condition and de minimis fringes may be available as described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this Q/A-24. See 1.132-1(b)(2) and 1.132-1(b)(4). (b) Transit passes. The working condition and de minimis fringe exclusions under section 132(a)(3) and (4) are available for transit passes provided to individuals who are partners, 2-percent shareholders, and independent contractors. For example, tokens or farecards provided by a partnership to an individual who is a partner that enable the partner to commute on a public transit system (not including privately-operated van pools) are excludable from the partner's gross income if the value of the tokens and farecards in any month does not exceed the dollar amount 47   specified in 1.132-6(d)(1). However, if the value of a pass provided in a month exceeds the dollar amount specified in 1.132-6(d)(1), the full value of the benefit provided (not merely the amount in excess of the dollar amount specified in 1.1326(d)(1)) is includible in gross income. (c) Parking. The working condition fringe rules under section 132(d) do not apply to commuter parking. See 1.132-5(a)(1). However, the de minimis fringe rules under section 132(e) are available for parking provided to individuals who are partners, 2-percent shareholders, or independent contractors that qualifies under the de minimis rules. See 1.132-6(a) and (b). (d) Example. The following example illustrates the principles of this Q/A-24: Example. (i) Individual G is a partner in partnership P. Individual G commutes to and from G's office every day and parks free of charge in P's lot. (ii) In this Example, the value of the parking is not excluded under section 132(f), but may be excluded under section 132(e) if the parking is a de minimis fringe under 1.132-6. Q25. W hat is the effective date of this section? A-25. (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this Q/A-25, this section is applicable for employee taxable years beginning after December 31, 2001. (b) The last sentence of paragraph (b)(5) of Q/A-16 of this section (relating to whether transit system vouchers for transit passes are readily available) is applicable for employee taxable years beginning after December 31, 2003. For this purpose, an employer may assume that the employee taxable year is the calendar year.  48   PART 602 -- OMB CONTROL NUMBERS UNDER THE PAPERW ORK REDUCTION ACT Par. 5.

GX004-50-1412443	"TREASURY INSPECTOR GENERAL    FOR TAX ADMINISTRATION    THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE’S INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYER   IDENTIFICATION NUMBER PROGRAM WAS NOT IMPLEMENTED   IN ACCORDANCE WITH INTERNAL REVENUE CODE REGULATIONS    September 1999    Reference No. 094505    Executive Summary    The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) made a policy decision to issue IRS Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITINs) to illegal aliens so tax filing obligations could be met. This IRS policy, to ""legalize"" illegal aliens, seems counter-productive to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) mission to identify illegal aliens and prevent unlawful alien entry. The ITIN Program was designed to improve nonresident alien compliance with tax laws.    In 1994, the IRS conducted a study, based on the audit report entitled  Review of Nonresident Alien Information Documents  (Reference Number 041403, dated January 21, 1994), which showed significant compliance concerns with the $80 billion annual nonresident alien United States (U.S.) investment income. The ITIN Program permanently assigns a U.S. Tax Identification Number (TIN) to nonresident aliens. Information documents, showing individual taxpayers as recipients of dividends, interest, and other income, can then be matched to tax returns.     Results    The IRS established ITIN regulations that require an alien person to provide sufficient documentation to prove both identity and foreign status. The ITIN Program, as implemented,  ****2a,2b,2e**** . We concluded that the majority of these persons were illegal aliens.    Illegal alien presence in the U.S. is a congressional concern. Legislation in the Welfare Reform Act and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 requires:         Curtailing and/or eliminating welfare benefits.     Cooperating among federal, state and local governments on illegal alien identification.     Increasing border patrols to prevent unlawful alien entry.      The ITIN Program adversely affects effective and efficient tax administration. Providing illegal aliens with valid TINs allows for certain tax advantages and increases the potential for fraud. Fraudulent or invalid dependent claims on tax returns provide additional tax deductions and access to certain tax credits. This will become an increasingly important factor with the addition of the child tax and education credits provided for in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. The potential for fraud is further increased because of costly examination resources required to determine compliance.  ****2a,2b,2e**** .     The ITIN Program raises a range of concerns from tax policy to operational implementation.    Tax policy concerns include:         Conflict between the IRS’ disclosure policy, which does not provide for information sharing with the INS, and federal statutes requiring cooperation between federal agencies and the INS.     Tax treatment of illegal aliens as residents, which allows tax benefits not available to nonresident aliens.      Operational concerns include:         Management controls did not ensure effective implementation of the Internal Revenue Service’s ITIN Program.    ****2a,2b,2e**** .    Ineffective returns processing controls for taxpayers affected by the ITIN Program requirement.         Summary of Recommendations      To address tax policy and operational issues, the IRS needs to request input from appropriate external authorities and take internal actions to determine whether:         The ITIN Program disclosure policy is in conformance with current Immigration laws.    The Privacy Act Notification should be included on the ITIN application form. The Privacy Act Notification provides the warning that information can be provided to the Department of Justice within the parameters of disclosure law.     The Administration wants to continue affording illegal aliens tax treatment similar to legal resident aliens.    The role of the Acceptance Agent in facilitating the application process should be re-examined.     Necessary information should be included in the ITIN database for future computer matching initiatives.      Management’s Response : IRS management generally concurs with the recommendations in this report.     In response to Tax Policy Issues:    The IRS will request that the study groups for the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Secretary of the Treasury address the interrelationship of taxpayer confidentiality provisions under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) with provisions of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996.     A Privacy Act Notice will be added to the Application for IRS Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (Form W-7), and a determination will be made as to whether the Form W-7 will require a disclosure statement under the definition of an ""individual federal income tax return form.""    The Commissioner will be informed of the concern that certain illegal aliens may be receiving tax benefits under the IRC. Currently, the IRS does not have authority to act on the related recommendation.     In response to Operational Issues:    ****2a,2b,2e**** . Using information from the ITIN database, checks to measure compliance with the terms of Acceptance Agent Agreements will be initiated by the IRS Foreign Payments Branch.    A Request for Information Services will be prepared and submitted to request updates to the ITIN database screen display to permit the display of cross-reference information.    Management’s complete response to the draft report is included in Appendix IX.    Office of Audit Comment: ****2a,2b,2e**** . The IRS needs to examine the overall Revenue Protection Strategy to ensure that returns with ITINs  ****2a,2b,2e**** . This could be conducted on a sample basis. Subsequent to the issuance of the draft report, the Office of Audit determined that there were 180,662 Tax Year 1997 Form 1040 returns filed with the ITIN as the identifying number.

Final regulations. This document contains final regulations under section The final  6109 relating to taxpayer identifying numbers.  regulations provide rules for obtaining IRS adoption taxpayer identification numbers (ATINs), which are used to identify children placed for adoption. The regulations assist prospective  adoptive parents in claiming tax benefits with respect to these children. DATES: Effective Date: 22, 1999. Dates of Applicability: For dates of applicability of these These regulations are effective September  regulations, see 301.6109-1(h)(2)(iii) and 301.6109-3(d). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Beverly A. Baughman, (202) 6224940 (not a toll-free number). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Paperwork Reduction Act   2 The collection of information contained in these final regulations has been reviewed and approved by the Office of Management and Budget in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3507) under control number 1545-1564. Responses to this collection of information are required to obtain ATINs, which are used by prospective adoptive parents to claim tax benefits with respect to children placed for adoption. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless the collection of information displays a valid control number. The collection of information in this final regulation is contained in 301.6109-3(c)(2). The information collection  requirements of that section are satisfied by including the required information on Form W-7A or such other form as may be prescribed by the IRS to apply for an adoption taxpayer identification number (ATIN). The burden for this requirement is The current  reflected in the burden estimated for the form.  burden estimated for Form W-7A is 40 minutes per form. Comments concerning the accuracy of this burden estimate and suggestions for reducing this burden should be sent to the Internal Revenue Service, Attn: IRS Reports Clearance Officer, OP:FS:FP, Washington, DC 20224, and to the Office of Management and Budget, Attn: Desk Officer for the Department of the Treasury, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503.   3 Books or records relating to this collection of information must be retained as long as their contents may become material in the administration of any internal revenue law. Generally, tax  returns and tax return information are confidential, as required by 26 U.S.C. 6103. Background This document contains final Regulations on Procedure and Administration (26 CFR Part 301) relating to identifying numbers under section 6109. On November 24, 1997, final and temporary regulations (TD 8739) were published in the Federal Register (62 FR 62518). A  notice of proposed rulemaking (REG-103330-97) cross-referencing the temporary regulations was published in the Federal Register for the same day (62 FR 62538). Written comments responding to these notices were received and a public hearing was held on March 4, 1998. After  consideration of all the comments, the proposed regulations under section 6109 are adopted with minor changes by this Treasury decision, and the corresponding temporary regulations are removed. The comments and revisions are discussed below.  Explanation of Revisions and Summary of Comments Comments were received concerning the requirement that, in order for an ATIN to be assigned, the child must be placed for adoption by an authorized placement agency as defined in 1.1522(c)(2) of the regulations. The commentators expressed concern   4 that because of this requirement ATINs are not available in the case of independent adoptions as defined by state law. general, independent adoptions take two forms. In  In one type the  biological parent(s) places the child with the adoptive parents with the assistance of an attorney or other intermediary. In  other independent adoptions, no such intermediary is necessary because the adoptive parents and the biological parent(s) know one another. The IRS and Treasury Department believe that, under section 1.152-2(c), authorized placement agency is not limited to governmental and private organizations authorized by state law to place children for legal adoption, but also includes biological parents and other persons authorized by state law to place children for legal adoption. To address commentators' concerns  regarding independent adoptions, the IRS and Treasury Department intend to amend section 1.152-2(c) to clarify that this is the meaning of authorized placement agency. Accordingly, the final  ATIN regulations continue to provide that authorized placement agency has the same meaning as in section 1.152-2(c) of the regulations. Special Analyses   5 It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. a regulatory assessment is not required. Therefore,  It also has been  determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) does not apply to these regulations, and because the regulation does not impose a collection of information on small entities, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) does not apply. ATINs under this Treasury decision. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, the notice of proposed rulemaking that preceded these regulations was submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business.

Section 301.6109-1T is removed. Par. 4. Section 301.6109-3 is added to read as follows: 301.6109-3 IRS adoption taxpayer identification numbers. (a) In general--(1) Definition. An IRS adoption taxpayer  identification number (ATIN) is a temporary taxpayer identifying number assigned by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to a child (other than an alien individual as defined in 301.61091(d)(3)(i)) who has been placed, by an authorized placement agency, in the household of a prospective adoptive parent for legal adoption. An ATIN is assigned to the child upon  application for use in connection with filing requirements under   9 the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder. When  an adoption becomes final, the adoptive parent must apply for a social security number for the child. After the social security  number is assigned, that number, rather than the ATIN, must be used as the child's taxpayer identification number on all returns, statements, or other documents required under the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder. (2) Expiration and extension. An ATIN automatically expires However, upon request,  two years after the number is assigned.  the IRS may grant an extension if the IRS determines the extension is warranted. (b) Definitions. For purposes of this section--  (1) Authorized placement agency has the same meaning as in 1.152-2(c) of this chapter; (2) Prospective adoptive child or child means a child who has not been adopted, but who has been placed in the household of a prospective adoptive parent for legal adoption by an authorized placement agency; and (3) Prospective adoptive parent or parent means an individual in whose household a prospective adoptive child is placed by an authorized placement agency for legal adoption. (c) General rule for obtaining a number--(1) Who may apply. A prospective adoptive parent may apply for an ATIN for a child if-(i) The prospective adoptive parent is eligible to claim a personal exemption under section 151 with respect to the child;   10 (ii) An authorized placement agency places the child with the prospective adoptive parent for legal adoption; (iii) The Social Security Administration will not process an application for an SSN by the prospective adoptive parent on behalf of the child (for example, because the adoption is not final); and (iv) The prospective adoptive parent has used all reasonable means to obtain the child's assigned social security number, if any, but has been unsuccessful in obtaining this number (for example, because the biological parent who obtained the number is not legally required to disclose the number to the prospective adoptive parent). (2) Procedure for obtaining an ATIN. If the requirements of  paragraph (c)(1) of this section are satisfied, the prospective adoptive parent may apply for an ATIN for a child on Form W-7A, Application for Taxpayer Identification Number for Pending Adoptions (or such other form as may be prescribed by the IRS). An application for an ATIN should be made far enough in advance of the first intended use of the ATIN to permit issuance of the ATIN in time for such use. An application for an ATIN must  include the information required by the form and accompanying instructions, including the name and address of each prospective adoptive parent and the child's name and date of birth. In  addition, the application must include such documentary evidence as the IRS may prescribe to establish that a child was placed in the prospective adoptive parent's household by an authorized   11 placement agency for legal adoption. Examples of acceptable  documentary evidence establishing placement for legal adoption by an authorized placement agency may include-(i) A copy of a placement agreement entered into between the prospective adoptive parent and an authorized placement agency; (ii) An affidavit or letter signed by the adoption attorney or government official who placed the child for legal adoption pursuant to state law; (iii) A document authorizing the release of a newborn child from a hospital to a prospective adoptive parent for adoption; and (iv) A court document ordering or approving the placement of a child for adoption. (d) Effective date. The provisions of this section apply to  income tax returns due (without regard to extension) on or after April 15, 1998. 301.6109-3T [Removed] Par. 5.

GX271-86-0366719	"DATA ENTRY GOES HI-TECH The Tax Division is currently installing Cognatronics Imaging Systems' CIP\200 Data Entry System. This system efficiently captures document images and extracts data from the images for further processing using Intelligent Character Recognition (ICR) technology. The CIP/200 software is capable of reading both machine printed and handwritten data. Data is verified using common name files, zip codes, and numeric checks. This is referred to as context verification. Most Imaging/ICR systems perform this type of verification, but the CIP/200 goes one step further. This system is unique because of Batched Character Image Processing (BCIP). BCIP sorts like character images that cannot be verified through context verification. The character images are displayed in groups for operator intervention. This is called Sorted Character Image Verification (SCIV). In order to keep the operator's attention focused, the system actually creates false errors and lets the operator know when those errors are missed. This technology requires tax return forms to be redesigned using ""constrained fields"" and ""drop out ink."" A constrained field is the term for those little boxes on returns in which information is written. Dropout inks are inks of special colors that are filtered out when processed through scanners. This allows the ICR software to read the data in the boxes. Some tax return forms have already been redesigned, including the Employer's Withholding and Personal Income Tax Estimated returns. Additional returns will be redesigned as new supplies are ordered. The use of imaging and ICR will substantially increase data availability for billing and audit purposes. However, for this technology to be truly effective, it is necessary for taxpayers to use the pre-printed returns provided by the West Virginia Tax Commission and write or print clearly in the boxes on the forms.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Beverly A. Baughman, (202) 6224940 (not a toll-free number). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Paperwork Reduction Act   2 The collection of information contained in these final regulations has been reviewed and approved by the Office of Management and Budget in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3507) under control number 1545-1564. Responses to this collection of information are required to obtain ATINs, which are used by prospective adoptive parents to claim tax benefits with respect to children placed for adoption. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless the collection of information displays a valid control number. The collection of information in this final regulation is contained in 301.6109-3(c)(2). The information collection  requirements of that section are satisfied by including the required information on Form W-7A or such other form as may be prescribed by the IRS to apply for an adoption taxpayer identification number (ATIN). The burden for this requirement is The current  reflected in the burden estimated for the form.  burden estimated for Form W-7A is 40 minutes per form. Comments concerning the accuracy of this burden estimate and suggestions for reducing this burden should be sent to the Internal Revenue Service, Attn: IRS Reports Clearance Officer, OP:FS:FP, Washington, DC 20224, and to the Office of Management and Budget, Attn: Desk Officer for the Department of the Treasury, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503.   3 Books or records relating to this collection of information must be retained as long as their contents may become material in the administration of any internal revenue law. Generally, tax  returns and tax return information are confidential, as required by 26 U.S.C. 6103. Background This document contains final Regulations on Procedure and Administration (26 CFR Part 301) relating to identifying numbers under section 6109. On November 24, 1997, final and temporary regulations (TD 8739) were published in the Federal Register (62 FR 62518). A  notice of proposed rulemaking (REG-103330-97) cross-referencing the temporary regulations was published in the Federal Register for the same day (62 FR 62538). Written comments responding to these notices were received and a public hearing was held on March 4, 1998. After  consideration of all the comments, the proposed regulations under section 6109 are adopted with minor changes by this Treasury decision, and the corresponding temporary regulations are removed. The comments and revisions are discussed below.  Explanation of Revisions and Summary of Comments Comments were received concerning the requirement that, in order for an ATIN to be assigned, the child must be placed for adoption by an authorized placement agency as defined in 1.1522(c)(2) of the regulations. The commentators expressed concern   4 that because of this requirement ATINs are not available in the case of independent adoptions as defined by state law. general, independent adoptions take two forms. In  In one type the  biological parent(s) places the child with the adoptive parents with the assistance of an attorney or other intermediary. In  other independent adoptions, no such intermediary is necessary because the adoptive parents and the biological parent(s) know one another. The IRS and Treasury Department believe that, under section 1.152-2(c), authorized placement agency is not limited to governmental and private organizations authorized by state law to place children for legal adoption, but also includes biological parents and other persons authorized by state law to place children for legal adoption. To address commentators' concerns  regarding independent adoptions, the IRS and Treasury Department intend to amend section 1.152-2(c) to clarify that this is the meaning of authorized placement agency. Accordingly, the final  ATIN regulations continue to provide that authorized placement agency has the same meaning as in section 1.152-2(c) of the regulations. Special Analyses   5 It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. a regulatory assessment is not required. Therefore,  It also has been  determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) does not apply to these regulations, and because the regulation does not impose a collection of information on small entities, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) does not apply. ATINs under this Treasury decision. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, the notice of proposed rulemaking that preceded these regulations was submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business.

Section 301.6109-1T is removed. Par. 4. Section 301.6109-3 is added to read as follows: 301.6109-3 IRS adoption taxpayer identification numbers. (a) In general--(1) Definition. An IRS adoption taxpayer  identification number (ATIN) is a temporary taxpayer identifying number assigned by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to a child (other than an alien individual as defined in 301.61091(d)(3)(i)) who has been placed, by an authorized placement agency, in the household of a prospective adoptive parent for legal adoption. An ATIN is assigned to the child upon  application for use in connection with filing requirements under   9 the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder. When  an adoption becomes final, the adoptive parent must apply for a social security number for the child. After the social security  number is assigned, that number, rather than the ATIN, must be used as the child's taxpayer identification number on all returns, statements, or other documents required under the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder. (2) Expiration and extension. An ATIN automatically expires However, upon request,  two years after the number is assigned.  the IRS may grant an extension if the IRS determines the extension is warranted. (b) Definitions. For purposes of this section--  (1) Authorized placement agency has the same meaning as in 1.152-2(c) of this chapter; (2) Prospective adoptive child or child means a child who has not been adopted, but who has been placed in the household of a prospective adoptive parent for legal adoption by an authorized placement agency; and (3) Prospective adoptive parent or parent means an individual in whose household a prospective adoptive child is placed by an authorized placement agency for legal adoption. (c) General rule for obtaining a number--(1) Who may apply. A prospective adoptive parent may apply for an ATIN for a child if-(i) The prospective adoptive parent is eligible to claim a personal exemption under section 151 with respect to the child;   10 (ii) An authorized placement agency places the child with the prospective adoptive parent for legal adoption; (iii) The Social Security Administration will not process an application for an SSN by the prospective adoptive parent on behalf of the child (for example, because the adoption is not final); and (iv) The prospective adoptive parent has used all reasonable means to obtain the child's assigned social security number, if any, but has been unsuccessful in obtaining this number (for example, because the biological parent who obtained the number is not legally required to disclose the number to the prospective adoptive parent). (2) Procedure for obtaining an ATIN. If the requirements of  paragraph (c)(1) of this section are satisfied, the prospective adoptive parent may apply for an ATIN for a child on Form W-7A, Application for Taxpayer Identification Number for Pending Adoptions (or such other form as may be prescribed by the IRS). An application for an ATIN should be made far enough in advance of the first intended use of the ATIN to permit issuance of the ATIN in time for such use. An application for an ATIN must  include the information required by the form and accompanying instructions, including the name and address of each prospective adoptive parent and the child's name and date of birth. In  addition, the application must include such documentary evidence as the IRS may prescribe to establish that a child was placed in the prospective adoptive parent's household by an authorized   11 placement agency for legal adoption. Examples of acceptable  documentary evidence establishing placement for legal adoption by an authorized placement agency may include-(i) A copy of a placement agreement entered into between the prospective adoptive parent and an authorized placement agency; (ii) An affidavit or letter signed by the adoption attorney or government official who placed the child for legal adoption pursuant to state law; (iii) A document authorizing the release of a newborn child from a hospital to a prospective adoptive parent for adoption; and (iv) A court document ordering or approving the placement of a child for adoption. (d) Effective date. The provisions of this section apply to  income tax returns due (without regard to extension) on or after April 15, 1998. 301.6109-3T [Removed] Par. 5.

This has been supplemented with networking with examiners in other districts, and sports league information from public sources. Although this guide focuses on major league sports franchises, the examination techniques and issues addressed also have relevance to the examinations of minor league sports franchises.  EMERGING ISSUES AND SPORTS FRANCHISE ISP TEAM ISSUE ASSISTANCE Potential emerging sports franchise issues addressed in this guide are distinguished from established sports franchise issues. Any emerging sports franchise issues are addressed at the end of the applicable issue chapter. For some emerging sports franchise issues, a position is not taken. Promising emerging issues may receive additional consideration by the Sports Franchise Industry Specialization Program (ISP) team. Examiners are encouraged to contact the Sports Franchise ISP team, located in the South Florida District, for issue assistance on both established and emerging sports franchise issues addressed in this guide.  SPORTS LEAGUE ASSOCIATIONS Each of the major sports leagues is represented by a league association. The primary purpose of the league association is to promote the sport, negotiate national TV broadcast rights, negotiate national sponsorship agreements, and protect the interests of the sports franchise owners and the sports league as a whole. The individual sports franchises in the league are members of the league association. League associations are operated as tax exempt organizations under IRC section 501(c)(6).  1-1   LEAGUE REVENUE SHARING Each of the major sports leagues has revenue sharing. The leagues equally divide national television revenues regardless of the sports franchise's number of televised games, winning record, or drawing power among the sports franchises in the league. Merchandise licensed on a national level, such as team logos, are also shared by the sports franchises in the leagues. Sharing of gate receipts varies among the leagues. For instance, the National Football League (NFL), splits gate receipts 60-40 with the home team receiving the larger amount, whereas in the National Hockey League (NHL), the home team retains the entire gate. In the National Basketball Association (NBA), the home team retains 94 percent of the gate with the league receiving the other 6 percent. In Major League Baseball (MLB), the split with the American league is 80-20, and in the National League, the visiting team receives 42 cents per admission. Local media revenue is not shared, and the revenue from stadium box seats is generally not shared. There are significant differences in the relative amount of revenue shared in the different leagues. The NFL has the highest degree of revenue sharing with over 80 percent of league revenues shared. This is because the NFL derives most of its revenue from national media broadcasting contracts. On the other end of the scale, only 5.4 percent of league revenue is shared in the NHL. The NHL derives only a small portion of total revenue from its national media contracts, with the majority of its revenues obtained from gate receipts. The MLB and the NBA fall between these two extremes.  THE MAJOR SPORTS LEAGUE TEAMS The major sports league information furnished below is based on the status of these leagues in 1998. A separate sports franchise owns each of the major league teams listed.  1-2   The National Basketball Association The National Basketball Association (NBA) consists of 29 teams divided into the Eastern and Western Conferences. The teams are further divided into four divisions: Atlantic, Central, Midwest and Pacific. Eastern Conference Atlantic Division Boston Celtics Miami Heat New Jersey Nets New York Knicks Orlando Magic Philadelphia 76ers Washington Wizards Central Division Atlanta Hawks Charlotte Hornets Chicago Bulls Cleveland Cavaliers Detroit Pistons Indiana Pacers Milwaukee Bucks Toronto Raptors  Western Conference Midwest Division Dallas Mavericks Denver Nuggets Houston Rockets Minnesota Timberwolves San Antonio Spurs Utah Jazz Vancouver Grizzlies Pacific Division Golden State Warriors Los Angeles Clippers Los Angeles Lakers Phoenix Suns Portland Trail Blazers Sacramento Kings Seattle SuperSonics  Each team plays an 82 game regular season schedule with 41 home games and 41 away games. The winner in each division, plus the next six top finishing teams in the conference, play to determine the conference winner. The two conference winners play in the NBA playoffs to determine the overall NBA champion.  1-3   The National Football League The National Football League (NFL) consists of 31 teams divided into the American and National Conferences. Both the American and National Conferences further divide the teams into three divisions: Eastern, Central, and Western. American Conference Eastern Division Buffalo Bills Indianapolis Colts Miami Dolphins New England Patriots New York Jets Central Division Cincinnati Bengals Baltimore Ravens Tennessee Titans Pittsburgh Steelers Jacksonville Jaguars Cleveland Browns Western Division Denver Broncos Kansas City Chiefs Oakland Raiders San Diego Chargers Seattle Seahawks National Conference Eastern Division Arizona Cardinals Dallas Cowboys New York Giants Philadelphia Eagles Washington Redskins Central Division Chicago Bears Detroit Lions Green Bay Packers Minnesota Vikings Tampa Bay Buccaneers  Western Division St. Louis Rams Atlanta Falcons New Orleans Saints San Francisco 49ers Carolina Panthers  Each team plays a 16 game regular season schedule with 8 home games and 8 away games. The winner in each division, plus the next three top finishing teams in each conference, play to determine the conference champion for their respective conference. The two teams that win their respective conference play against each other for the overall league championship in the Super Bowl.  1-4   Major League Baseball Major League Baseball (MLB) includes 30 teams, with the American and National Leagues having 14 and 16 team circuits respectively. The American and National Leagues further divide the teams into three divisions: Eastern, Central, and Western. National League Eastern Division Atlanta Braves Montreal Expos Florida Marlins New York Mets Philadelphia Phillies Central Division St. Louis Cardinals Houston Astros Cincinnati Reds Chicago Cubs Pittsburgh Pirates Milwaukee Brewers Western Division San Diego Padres Los Angeles Dodgers Colorado Rockies San Francisco Giants Arizona Diamondbacks American League Eastern Division New York Yankees Baltimore Orioles Boston Red Sox Toronto Blue Jays Tampa Bay Devil Rays Central Division Cleveland Indians Chicago White Sox Detroit Tigers Minnesota Twins Kansas City Royals  Western Division Texas Rangers Seattle Mariners Oakland Athletics Anaheim Angels  Each team plays a 162 game regular season, with 81 home games and 81 away games. The top four teams in each league, with at least one from each division, play in the post season league championship games. The two teams that emerge as champions of their respective leagues play in the World Series. The winner of the World Series is the MLB champion.  1-5   The National Hockey League The National Hockey League (NHL) consists of 26 teams divided into the Eastern and Western Conferences. The teams are further divided into four divisions: Northeast, Atlantic, Central, and Pacific. Eastern Conference Northeast Division Boston Bruins Pittsburgh Penguins Montreal Canadiens Hartford Whalers Buffalo Sabres Ottawa Senators Atlantic Division Philadelphia Flyers New York Rangers Florida Panthers Washington Capitals Tampa Bay Lightning New Jersey Devils New York Islanders  Western Conference Central Division Chicago Blackhawks Dallas Stars Detroit Redwings St. Louis Blues Phoenix Coyotes Toronto Maple Leafs Colorado Avalanche Pacific Division Mighty Ducks of Anaheim Calgary Flames Edmonton Oilers Los Angeles Kings San Jose Sharks Vancouver Canucks  Each team plays an 82 game regular season schedule, with 41 home games and 41 away games. The top eight teams in each conference play to determine the conference winner. The two conference winners play in the Stanley Cup Playoffs to determine the overall NHL champion.  1-6   League Expansion The major sports leagues have added new teams throughout the course of their history, and each league is scheduled for further expansion. Expansion teams added in the major sports leagues in the 1990's are as follows: The National Basketball Association 1994 - Toronto Raptors (started playing in 1995-1996 season) 1994 - Vancouver Grizzlies (started playing in 1995-1996 season) The National Football League 1993 - Carolina Panthers (started playing in 1995 season) 1993 - Jacksonville Jaguars (started playing in 1995 season) 1998 - Cleveland Browns (started playing in 1999) Major League Baseball 1993 1993 1998 1998 Colorado Rockies (National League) Florida Marlins (National League) Arizona Diamondbacks (National League) Tampa Bay Devil Rays (American League)  The National Hockey League 1991 1992 1992 1993 1993 San Jose Sharks Ottawa Senators Tampa Bay Lightning Mighty Ducks of Anaheim Florida Panthers  1-7   This page intentionally left blank.  1-8   Chapter 2 GENERAL SPORTS FRANCHISE EXAMINATION TECHNIQUES  OVERVIEW This chapter addresses general sports franchise examination techniques. More detailed examination techniques and issue guidance are contained in the specific issue chapters of this guide. GENERAL ACCOUNTING CONSIDERATIONS Even among sports franchises in the same league, the financial statements for the sports franchise are generally unique. There are often significant differences in accounting for the acquisition of the sports franchise and in the accounting policies for major items such as player contracts and contingencies. There are also varying levels of vertical business integration. The financial statements often reflect significant related party transactions which are common for most sports franchises. The amortization of player contracts is almost always a material audit issue. Player contracts are typically structured to include signing bonuses and deferred compensation arrangements. For most sports franchises, ticket revenues and broadcasting rights constitute the majority of revenue. Many teams also have favorable lease arrangements in which the team receives revenue from parking, concessions, and stadium naming rights. Advance sales of upcoming season tickets are typically reflected as deferred revenue on the balance sheet. Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) require that gate revenues be recorded in the period in which the fans attend the games so that they are matched against period costs. As with other industries, the GAAP timing of income and expenses for sports franchises often differs from that for tax purposes. RETURN IDENTIFICATION AND ENTITY BACKGROUND INFORMATION There are usually a limited number of sports franchises located within a specific district. For purposes of an approved district compliance initiative, sports franchise returns can often best be identified through the examiner's personal knowledge of the sports teams located within their district. The main problem in identifying returns, however, is identifying the owner's entity name under which the tax return is filed, as opposed to the sports franchise's ""doing business as"" (DBA) name. This can be a difficult and time consuming task in situations in which the entity operates as a partnership. One way to identify the ownership entity is through the use of the incorporation library 2-1   (INCORP) on Lexis-Nexis. By accessing the XXBIZ file (where XX represents the state abbreviation; for example, FLBIZ for Florida) examiners can usually locate the records for the ownership entity by utilizing the DBA name as the search term. The BIZ file can provide a wealth of information about the entity, including the entity's registered name; the form of the entity, for example, corporation or partnership; the officers of record; and the federal employer's identification number (EIN). The INCORP records will also indicate whether or not the entity is still active, or if it has been dissolved (voluntary or involuntary). Additionally, historical data is provided which, if applicable, would include name changes or whether a merger had occurred. The BIZ file will often cross reference related entity records. PREPLAN AND ISSUE IDENTIFICATION The following information is presented to assist in assessing the audit potential of a sports franchise return. It should only be used as supplemental information during the preplanning stage of an examination. Since it is not all inclusive, in no way should it restrict the examiner from identifying other potential return issues that may be present. Intangible Assets The balance sheet is an integral part of any preplan. Aside from normal preplan audit considerations, a specific review of the allocation among amortizable and non-amortizable intangible assets is especially important in sports franchise examinations. A sports franchise's non-amortizable intangible assets may, upon examination, be determined to be significant. The ratio of non-amortizable intangible assets (TV broadcast rights, goodwill, going concern value, and franchise costs) to amortizable assets (primarily player contracts) will depend on how long the franchise has been in existence and the number of marque players employed by the team. Form 4562, Depreciation and Amortization, should be viewed to ascertain if amortization has been claimed on non-amortizable intangible assets. An inspection of Form 4562 might also indicate potential problems regarding the amount of the original franchise cost (whether by purchase or by expansion) allocated to player contracts, the useful life assigned to player contracts, and the placed in-service date for these contracts. Deferred Revenue and Deposits In order to identify deferred revenue and amounts that may have been improperly treated as non-taxable deposits, a detailed review of balance sheet current liabilities and long term liabilities is recommended. The detail attached to the return may identify the make up of any deferred revenue. For example, the detail may state that long term liabilities include deferred broadcast revenue and deferred sponsorship revenue. Look at long-term liabilities to determine if any deferred revenue is included. Sources of income 2-2   such as ticket revenue for games which may extend beyond more than one season are often inappropriately deferred. Amounts treated by the taxpayer as non-taxable deposits, which may in fact be taxable advance payments for services, may be included in long term liabilities or other liabilities. The deposit/advance payment amounts for multiple year season ticket holder agreements (regular season ticket holders, club seats, and skybox or executive suites) can be quite significant. This is especially the case for new sports franchises resulting from league expansion or team relocations and sports franchises that have or are trying to improve or expand the stadiums in which they play their home games. Accrued Expenses As part of the examination of the balance sheet, large accrued expense items should be considered. Accrued expenses may include such items as accrued bonuses or compensation to related parties to which IRC section 267 or IRC section 482 may apply. Additionally, accrued compensation costs will often fall under the purview of IRC section 404 (deductions for deferred compensation) or IRC section 419 (deductions for contributions to welfare benefit funds). Also, a large accrual of rent for a stadium or an arena should be reviewed to determine whether it qualifies as an IRC section 467 rental agreement, and if so, that the requirements of IRC section 467 are in compliance. Other Deductions As with any examination, excessive repair expenses claimed may indicate capital improvements are being improperly expensed. The same can be said for excessive professional fees claimed, which may represent fees connected with the acquisition of the sports franchise, a lease agreement, or similar capital asset. The audited financial statements should reflect any loans to related parties and the terms of the loans. A review of this information may indicate an IRC section 7872 issue involving related party debt having below market interest rates. Schedule M-1 Schedule M-1 should be inspected to determine the sports franchise's differences between taxable income and book income. As with other taxpayers, these differences warrant consideration. A taxpayer's tax accounting and book accounting are the same for items not reflected in Schedule M-1. Accordingly, awareness of the sports franchise accounting areas for which there are usually differences in tax accounting and book accounting (which raise questions by their absence from Schedule M-1) can assist the examiner in identifying areas of audit risk.  2-3   An example is the absence of a Schedule M-1 adjustment for amortization. Generally, a sports franchise's amortization will be less for tax purposes than for book purposes. This is especially the case for new franchises, whether through expansion or purchase. Related Party Transactions Related party transactions are common for sports franchises. Concession arrangements, local television contracts, and stadium lease arrangements to related entities are common in the industry. It is not uncommon for the owners of the sports franchise to have an interest in these and other businesses that have financial dealings with the sports franchise. The audited financial statements are a good source of information. Generally accepted accounting principles and more specifically Statement of Financial Accounting Standard 57, Related Party Disclosures, require disclosure of related party transactions in the notes to the financial statements. This includes information on: (1) their affect on the financial statements, (2) the dollar amount of each transaction, and (3) any amounts due to or from related parties along with the terms of the debt arrangement. Often, the underlying documents will be needed to determine the substance of related party transactions. ISSUE DEVELOPMENT Issue development is the key to any examination. This means the facts should be fully developed to support the underlying issue, and to the extent possible, the taxpayer should acknowledge agreement with the facts. Exhibit 2-1 is a sample Form 4564, Information Document Request, that can be tailored to fit the specific needs of the examination. Depending on the issue, the examiner may need to retain a copy of many of the documents and agreements inspected during the examination for the case file workpapers. Factual development starts with the initial interview. The interview should be conducted with the party having first-hand knowledge, usually the chief financial officer or comptroller. It is important to develop initial interview questions which fit the particular facts and circumstances of the sports franchise. Exhibit 2-2 is a sample interview questionnaire that can be tailored to the sports franchise's unique facts and circumstances. This sample interview questionnaire contains generic, initial interview questions, as well as questions specific to sports franchise examinations. The questionnaire is by no means all inclusive. Rather, it is meant to be used as only a guideline.  2-4   As with most examinations, a key to good issue development of how many stadiums or sports arenas the examiner has visit Moreover, visiting a stadium or sports arena as a spectator is facility as an examiner, where one has the opportunity to ask financing arrangements, and income producing activities.  is a tour of the business. Regardless ed, each is unique in its own way. quite different from touring the questions about the lives of assets,  It is preferable that the examination take place at the sports franchise's place of business. A dayto-day observation of the business operations can lead to a more thorough understanding of the facts, clear up potential misunderstandings, and facilitate obtaining information from the taxpayer in a timely manner. This usually minimizes the time expended on the examination and inconvenience to the taxpayer. Make specialist referrals as early as possible. Because a Computer Audit Specialist (CAS) referral is mandatory on all cases with Activity Code 219 and above, sports franchises typically require a CAS referral. Asset valuation issues are usually identified early in the examination. If asset valuation assistance is warranted, make the engineering referral early in the examination. REQUIRED FILING CHECKS There are usually related entity returns that should be inspected and perhaps examined. This often includes the tax returns of the owners of the sports franchise. The single largest expense of a professional sports franchise team is its salaries due to ever increasing player costs. It is, therefore, important for examiners to filing of all employment tax returns. In addition, the policies for issuing Forms reviewed in conjunction with a determination that all required Forms 1099 wer employees and subcontractors were properly classified. and wages. This is ensure the proper 1099 should be e issued and that  Among other things, examiners should ensure that any relocation expenses paid to new players, coaches, etc., are included in the employee's W-2. Additionally, examiners should determine if taxable fringe benefits have been properly handled. For example, if all employees are provided season tickets at no cost, the value of the tickets given should be included in the employee's W-2, and proper FICA and FUTA paid. If appropriate, the assistance of an Employment Tax Specialist should be requested. Player Personal Service Corporations A potential issue area is whether the sports franchise's players have formed personal service corporations (PSCs) through which their services are offered to the sports franchise. A PSC may have a tax impact on the individual player under IRC section 269A and IRC section 482. In addition, a PSC is likely to have a major employment tax impact on the sports franchise. 2-5   In the case of a sports franchise and a player employed through his PSC, there is no issue as to whether the player is an employee or independent contractor. The issue is whether the player is an employee of the sports franchise or the PSC for employment tax purposes. An analysis of the evidence generally establishes that a sports franchise controls its players not only as to the result, but also as to the means and methods of accomplishing the result. Under the player contracts, players may not offer their services to any other sports franchise in the league. Additionally, the sports franchise normally pays for the players' expenses when the team is on the road. Generally, a sports franchise will be determined to be the employer of its players. Accordingly, the sports franchise is usually responsible for FICA and FUTA taxes on the compensation paid for player services even if they are paid to a PSC. See Leavell v. Commissioner, 104 T.C. 140 (1995). COMPLIANCE STRATEGIES If you believe there may be a lack of compliance in your area for one or more of the issues covered in this ATG, you may want to recommend a district compliance initiative. In determining the appropriate compliance initiative strategy, consideration should also be given to taxpayer education, guidance, and assistance.  2-6   Exhibit 2-1 (1 of 3) Form 4564 Rev. 6/88 Department of the Treasury Internal Revenue Service INFORMATION DOCUMENT REQ UEST Request Number  TO: Name of Taxpayer and Co.

Most sports franchises solicit local sponsors that want to be associated with the sport franchise's team name. Most notably, a sports franchise may have an official team bank, an official team television station, an official team radio station, an official team healthcare provider, etc. Sponsors pay significant sums of money to enter into these contracts, which usually cover multiple years. Unlike other categories of revenue, local area sponsorship revenue is generally not shared with other sports franchises in the league. The sponsorship agreements entered into, for the most part, represent advertising contracts. The sponsors receive specified advertising spots in radio broadcasts, television broadcasts, and team print media. Additionally, the sponsors usually receive stadium signage. The sports franchise usually receives significant advance payments from the various sponsors upon signing the contract, with periodic payments to be made during the remainder of the contract term. Often the sports franchise's tax return will reflect less than the total amount received during the initial year as current income. The remaining amount received will usually be reflected as deferred revenue. Depending on the length of the contract and the nature of the advance payment, some portion may be designated as long-term deferred revenue. Instead of including advance payments on multiple year sponsorship contracts in gross income during the tax year received, sports franchises often report advance payments prorata over the term of the contracts. Some contracts designate a portion of the advance payment as ""exclusivity."" This term indicates the vendor is the exclusive sponsor in a particular business segment (such as banking, television, radio, healthcare, etc.). The payment made for exclusivity is usually reported by sports franchises as income over the life of the contract, with the currently recognized portion representing only the current year's prorata share. AUDIT ISSUE It should be determined whether the sports franchise has improperly deferred the reporting of sponsorship revenue. More specifically, whether the sports franchise is unable to rely on the income deferral provisions of Rev. Proc. 71-21, 1971-2 C.B. 549, because:  3-1   1.  The sponsorship agreement provides for the provision of services after the end of the sports franchise's tax year following the tax year in which the advance payments are received, and for sponsorship agreements conferring exclusivity rights. The advance payment is for property rights, rather than the provision of services by the sports franchise.  2.  TAX LAW Prepaid Income Under IRC section 451(a), ""General Rule. The amount of gross income shall be included in the gross income for the taxable year in which received by the taxpayer, unless, under the method of accounting used in computing taxable income, such amount is to be properly accounted for as from a different period."" Treas. Reg. section 1.4511(a) provides ""***Under an accrual method of accounting, income is includible in gross income when all the events have occurred which fix the right to receive such income and the amount thereof can be determined with reasonable accuracy.***"" A fixed right to receive income occurs when: (a) the taxpayer's required performance takes place; (b) payment is due; or (c) payment is received, whichever occurs first. Schlude v. Commissioner, 372 U.S. 128 (1963), and Rev. Rul. 79-195, 1979-1 C.B. 177. The history behind former IRC section 452 reflects Congressional intent to limit tax deferrals of prepaid income to just those narrow areas specifically provided by Congress (such as IRC sections 455 and 456). Former IRC section 452 permitted the deferral of prepaid income. The purpose of IRC section 452 was to bring tax accounting more in line with accepted business accounting for prepaid income. When IRC sections 452 and 462 (which allowed deductions for reserves for estimated expenses) were enacted with the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, the estimated revenue loss was $45 million. A year later, after the American Institute of Accountants estimated the tax revenue loss resulting from these provisions to be around $500 million, Congress retroactively repealed IRC sections 452 and 462. Revenue Procedure 71-21 Rev. Proc. 71-21 was published ""to implement an administrative decision, made by the Commissioner in the exercise of his discretion under section 446, to allow accrual method taxpayers in certain specified and limited circumstances to defer the inclusion in gross income for Federal income tax purposes of payments received (or amounts due and payable) in one taxable year for services to be performed by the end of the next succeeding taxable year."" [underlining added]  3-2   Per section 2 of Rev. Proc. 71-21: In general, tax accounting requires that payments received for services to be performed in the future must be included in gross income in the taxable year of receipt. *** The purpose of this Revenue Procedure is to reconcile the tax and financial accounting treatment of such payments in a large proportion of these cases without permitting extended deferral in the time of including such payments in gross income for Federal income tax purposes. Section 3.02 of Rev. Proc. 71-21 provides: An accrual method taxpayer who, pursuant to an agreement (written or otherwise), receives a payment in one taxable year for services, where all of the services under such agreement are required by the agreement as it exists at the end of the taxable year of receipt to be performed by him before the end of the next succeeding taxable year, may include such payments in gross income as earned through the performance of the services, subject to the limitations provided in sections 3.07, 3.08, and 3.11. However, if the inclusion in gross income of payments received is properly deferred under the preceding sentence and for any reason a portion of such services is not performed by the end of the next succeeding taxable year, the amount allocable to the services not performed must be included in gross income in such succeeding year, regardless of when (if ever) such services are performed. [underlining added] Section 3.03 provides: Except as provided in sections 3.04 and 3.05, a payment received by an accrual method taxpayer pursuant to an agreement for the performance by him of services must be included in his gross income in the taxable year of receipt if under the terms of the agreement as it exists at the end of such year: (a) Any portion of the services is to be performed by him after the end of the taxable year immediately succeeding the year of receipt; or (b) Any portion of the services is to be performed by him at an unspecified future date which may be after the end of the taxable year immediately succeeding the year of receipt. [underlining added] The Tax Court in T.F.H. Publications, Inc. v. Commissioner, 72 T.C. 623 (1979), determined that ""advertising is considered a service."" Thus, amounts received in advance for advertising are considered payments for future services to which Rev. Proc. 71-21 may apply. Advance payments under -- the right to publicize t of the advance payments section in Chapter 4 addr television contracts are not services, but are considered a property right he taxpayer's games. Accordingly, a taxpayer cannot defer the reporting received for television contracts under Rev. Proc. 71-21. The tax law esses the case law supporting this conclusion.  3-3   TAX LAW APPLICATION Advance payments received on most of a sports franchise's multiple year sponsorship contracts are unlikely to qualify for income deferral under the provisions of Rev. Proc. 71-21. As addressed above, per Rev. Proc. 71-21 sections 3.02 and 3.03, advance payment for services is deferred under Rev. Proc. 71-21 only if the services are to be provided by the close of the next taxable year. Accordingly, Rev. Proc. 71-21 only results in sponsorship income deferral if, under the specific sponsorship contract, the services are to be provided by the close of the sports franchise's tax year following the tax year during which the advance payment is received. This results in most advance payments for multiple year sponsorship contracts being ineligible for deferral under the provisions of Rev. Proc. 71-21. For advance payments that are not excluded from Rev. Proc. 71-21 deferral due to the requirement that the service be provided by the end of the tax year, following the tax year of receipt, only advance payments for services versus advance payments for property rights qualify for Rev. Proc. 71-21 deferral. In this guide, ""exclusivity rights"" are defined as a sponsor's payments to a sports franchise to promote the sponsor's association with the sports franchise as the exclusive sponsor for the specific market segment or industry (banking, television, radio, health provider, etc.). For advance payment issues on exclusivity rights, the primary argument is that Rev. Proc. 71-21 does not apply because it is an advance payment for property rights versus an advance payment for services, and then, if applicable, an alternative argument that Rev. Proc. 71-21 does not apply because the services are not provided by the end of the subsequent tax year. The distinction between property rights and services is further addressed in Chapter 4. When the examiner determines a sports franchise is unable to rely on Rev. Proc. 71-21 for income deferral, it is not uncommon for the sports franchise to argue that its sponsorship income is deferred based on the application of general case law on prepaid services. The case law on the taxation of fixed and definite prepaid services is addressed in Chapter 5. EXAMPLE XYZ, a professional sports franchise, entered into a sponsorship agreement with a local bank to be the official bank of the sport franchise. The contract provided the bank with a specified amount of advertising time during television broadcasts, radio broadcasts, as well as in the team magazine. Additionally, the sports franchise agreed to do all of its banking with the sponsor and would encourage its employees to do the same. The bank had the right to advertise itself as the official bank of the sports franchise. The contract is for 5 years beginning on January 1, 1994, for a total contract price of $6 million. The bank paid $4.2 million on execution of the contract, which represented a $3.75 3-4   million exclusivity rights fee and $450,000 for the first year's advertising. On each anniversary date, the bank is to pay $450,000 until the end of the contract. On its 1994 calendar year tax return, XYZ included in gross income $1.2 million on the bank sponsorship contract. This included $450,000 for the first year's advertising and $750,000 for the first year's pro rata share of the exclusivity rights fee (which is $3.75 million divided by 5 years equaling $750,000). XYZ's balance sheet on December 31, 1994, reflected $3 million of deferred revenue (the $3.75 million total exclusivity rights fee less the $750,000 amount reported in 1994). $750,000 of the $3 million was designated as a current liability, and $2.25 million was designated as long term liability. On its 1995 and 1996 calendar year tax returns, XYZ reported $450,000 for the advertising fee paid in January and $750,000 for the pro rata share of the exclusivity rights fee which had been pre-paid. At year end, XYZ's 1995 balance sheet reflected total deferred revenue of $2.25 million, and XYZ's 1996 balance sheet reflected total deferred revenue of $1.5 million. The sports franchise's tax reporting of the local bank sponsorship contract is summarized as follows: Tax Year 1994 1995 1996 Advertising Fee Reported $450,000 $450,000 $450,000 Pro Rata Exclusivity Fee Reported $750,000 $750,000 $750,000 Exclusivity Fee Account Balance $3,000,000 $2,250,000 $1,500,000  During an examination of the sports franchise's 1994-1996 tax returns, the examiner determined the exclusivity rights fee advance payment was an advance payment for property rights. The examiner's primary argument is Rev. Proc. 71-21 does not apply because it is an advance payment for property rights versus an advance payment for services, and, alternatively, that Rev. Proc. 71-21 does not apply because the services are not provided by the end of the tax year following the tax year in which the advance payment was received. The alternative argument applies, because under the agreement existing at the end of the tax year in which the advance payment was received (the January 1, 1994 contract constituted the terms of the agreement at December 31, 1994), the sports franchise's services (assuming not property rights) are to be provided after December 31, 1995 (the end of the year following the tax year in which the advance pavement is received). 3-5   The examiner's report adjustments are reflected as follows: 1994 IRC section 446 Adjustment Total Adjustment $3,000,000 $3,000,000 1995 ($750,000) ($750,000) 1996 ($750,000) ($750,000)  The 1994 IRC section 446 adjustment includes in income the revenue improperly deferred to future years in the amount of $3 million. The 1995 and 1996 IRC section 446 adjustments eliminate the $750,000 of income improperly deferred from 1994 that was erroneously reported in each of these years. Because the examiner's case was closed unagreed, the examiner prepared a Form 5346, Examination Information Report, for the sports franchise's subsequent tax years which were not yet filed or due to be filed when the examiner closed his case. EXAMINATION TECHNIQUES Documents and information that should be obtained in determining whether you have one or more deferred sponsorship revenue issues include: 1. All agreements, contracts, and other documents regarding corporate sponsors, such as official team bank, official team health care provider, etc., that remain in effect during the tax year under examination. This includes all concession agreements. A breakdown of current versus deferred revenue (both current and long-term deferred revenue) by contract.  2.  The breakdown of current versus deferred revenue should be tied to the income recognized during the current year, as well as the deferred revenue accounts on the return's balance sheet. The sponsorship contracts provide specific information on what the sports franchise is providing (advertising, game tickets, etc.), as well as the specific payment, length, renewal, and other contract terms. Additionally, the contracts sometimes call for other up-front fees and should define what the fees cover. Since a tax distinction is made for advance payments for services and advance payments for property rights, the nature of the advance payments in question needs to be determined. In the context of sports franchises, what is often referred to in contracts as exclusivity rights may, in fact, be property rights. The precise nature of the payments as advertising or exclusivity rights can be determined by 3-6   reference to the contracts themselves. Exclusivity rights contracts expressly provide for the sale of the rights to use team logos and name on letterhead, etc., to promote the association with the team. In some instances, the contracts refer to the transaction as a license. In such a circumstance, the contracts may not be in exchange for services, but in exchange for the taxpayer's property interest in the publicity of its enterprise. Proper application of the law for exclusivity rights would appear to require the examiner to first determine if the advance payment qualifies for Rev. Proc. 71-21 deferral (whether it is an advance payment for services or an advance payment for property rights) and then, only for advance payments for services, determine if the provisions of Rev. Proc. 71-21 are met. However, because the determination of the nature of the payment (services versus property rights) may be less clear and more time consuming than determining the timing of the services, the examiner may want to first determine if the subsequent year rule is met before addressing the nature of the advance payments. Because the sponsorship issue involves the timing of income, it constitutes a change in the sports franchise's method of accounting for sponsorship revenue. Accordingly, examiners need to follow the change in method of accounting issue procedures in raising sponsorship issues. The IRC section 481(a) adjustment amount is the deferred income balance at the beginning of the first tax year examined. The current year IRC section 446 adjustments are the yearly changes to the deferred income balances for each tax year beginning with the first year examined. This is illustrated in the issue example given earlier in this chapter.  3-7   This page intentionally left blank.   Chapter 4 BROADCAST REVENUE  INDUSTRY PRACTICE Broadcast revenue is one of the single largest revenue generators for a sports franchise. Generally, national broadcasting contracts are consummated at the league level, with each sports franchise receiving a pro rata share. Additionally, sports franchises usually negotiate and enter into local broadcasting agreements on an individual basis. The income generated by local broadcasting agreements is usually not shared with the other sports franchises in the league. National Broadcasting Contracts The leagues normally enter into multiple year contracts with various television networks for the sale of broadcasting rights to the games played among its sports franchises. The money received under these contracts is normally divided equally among each sports franchise in the league. Payments under the league contracts are generally made networks pay a fixed amount for the broadcasting rights contract. The payments for each season may be made in on the sports franchise's tax year period, one or more of year immediately preceding the year in which the season Local Broadcasting Contracts Individual sports teams usually enter into broadcasting agreements with both local television and radio stations for the sale of broadcasting rights to the games played at the home stadium. Similar to the national contracts, the local agreements are usually for multiple years. Additionally, the agreements may include other special programs; for example, a coach's show, pre-game show, post-game show, etc. The local agreements may also include team sponsorship; for example, an official team station. Generally, these contracts require a substantial payment upon contract execution, as well as periodic payments (normally annual) through the contract term. Again, depending on the tax year period, a sports franchise may receive a periodic payment in a tax year preceding the year to which the payment relates. AUDIT ISSUE It is important to determine whether the sports franchise has improperly deferred the reporting of broadcast revenue. More specifically, whether the sports franchise is unable to rely on the income 4-1 on a per-season basis; that is, the for each season covered under the installments, often quarterly. Depending the installments may be received in a tax takes place.   deferral provisions of Rev. Proc. 71-21 because the advance payment is for property rights, rather than for services provided by the sports franchise. TAX LAW Whether broadcast revenue is received for services or property rights is addressed in this chapter. The general prepaid income tax law and Rev. Proc. 71-21, 1971-2 C.B. 549, are addressed in Chapter 3. The case law on the taxation of fixed and definite prepaid services is addressed in Chapter 5. Services or Property Right? In Pittsburgh Athletic Co. v. KQV Broadcasting Co., addressed the issue of a baseball team's interest in the Employees of a radio station were standing on a hill o play-by-play description of the games. In granting an games, the court held: 24 F.Supp. 490 (W.D. Pa. 1938), the court broadcasting rights to its games. verlooking the stadium and broadcasting a injunction against the broadcast of the  It is perfectly clear that the exclusive right to broadcast play-by-play descriptions of the home games played by the 'Pirates' at their home field rests in the plaintiffs. *** That is a property right of the plaintiffs with which defendant is interfering when it broadcasts the play-by-play description of the ball games. *** The Pittsburgh Athletic Company by reason of its creation of the game, its control of the park, and its restriction of the dissemination of news therefrom, has a property right in such news. In Uhlaender v. Henrickson, 316 F.Supp. 1277 (D. Minn. 1970), the defendants marketed a baseball table game. The game employed the names, numbers, and statistics of the players in major league baseball. The players sued to enjoin the use of their names and statistics for profit. The court held: It is this court's view that a celebrity has a legitimate interest in his public personality. A celebrity must be considered to have invested his years of practice and compensation in a public personality which eventually may reach marketable status. That identity, embodied in his name, likeness, statistics and other personal characteristics, is the fruit of his labors and is a type of property. In Zacchini v. Scripps-Howard Broadcasting Co., 433 U.S. 562 (1977), the Supreme Court considered the interrelationship between a performer's right to publicity of his performance and the First Amendment. A television station had aired as a news clip the entire performance of a ""human cannonball."" The performer sued for compensation for the use of his professional property. The Court agreed that the First Amendment did not prohibit such a suit and described the plaintiff's interest as follows:  4-2   *** the State's interest in permitting a `right of publicity' is in protecting the proprietary interest of the individual in his act in part to encourage such entertainment. As we later note, the State's interest is closely analogous to the goals of patent and copyright law. In Board of Regent of the University of Oklahoma v. National Collegiate Athletic Association, Civil No. 81-1209 (W.D. Okl. 1982), the court considered television contracts entered into by the NCAA for the broadcast of its member schools' football games. The plaintiffs, the Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma and the University of Georgia Athletic Association, claimed that the contracts violated the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. sections 1 and 2. In holding the contracts violated antitrust laws, the court held: The right to telecast college football games is the property of the institutions participating in the games, and that right may be sold or assigned by those institutions to any entity at their discretion. TAX LAW APPLICATION Regardless of whether the payments received by a sports franchise are from a national broadcasting contract or from a local broadcasting contract, the tax treatment is the same. In the case of a sports franchise, the right to receive the advance broadcast income is fixed for the tax year in which the amounts are received. Based on the court cases cited above, the payments received under television and radio broadcasting contracts are made not in exchange for services but in exchange for property rights (the sports franchise's proprietary rights in the publicity of its enterprise). The networks, local television stations, and local radio stations are not paying for services but rather for the right to exploit the sports franchise's property right. Accordingly, the Rev. Proc. 71-21 provisions that allow the deferral of income from services do not apply to the broadcast revenue of a sports franchise. EXAMPLE Sports franchise ABC receives a pro rata share of the league's national television broadcasting revenue. The contract entered into by the sports league and the national television broadcaster for the 1994 through 1997 seasons was entered into on April 15, 1993. The national broadcasting contract provides for quarterly payments of the annual amount, payable the first day of each quarter. The first payment was to be paid October 1, 1993, with the last payment due July 1, 1997. The sports franchise received $7.5 million on October 1, 1993 applicable to the 1994 season. The sports franchise did not include the $7.5 million in gross income on its 1993 tax return. Instead, the $7.5 million was reflected in the balance sheet as a current liability. A supporting statement characterized it as deferred revenue. 4-3   The sports franchise received $7.5 million on January 1, 1994, April 1, 1994, and July 1, 1994, applicable to the 1994 season. Additionally, ABC received $10 million on October 1, 1994, applicable to the 1995 season. On its 1994 tax return, ABC reported $30 million of broadcast revenue (the four $7.5 million payments received on October 1, 1993, January 1, 1994, April 1, 1994, and July 1, 1994). The $10 million received on October 1, 1994 was treated as deferred revenue. The sports franchise received $10 million on January 1, 1995, April 1, 1995, and July 1, 1995, applicable to the 1995 season. Additionally, ABC received $12 million on October 1, 1995, applicable to the 1996 season. On its 1995 tax return, ABC reported $40 million of broadcast revenue (the four $10 million payments received on October 1, 1994, January 1, 1995, April 1, 1995, and July 1, 1995). The $12 million received on October 1, 1995, was treated as deferred revenue. In summary, the sports franchise's tax return deferred broadcast revenue balances attributable to the league's national television broadcast contract as follows:  December 31, 1993 December 31, 1994 December 31, 1995  $ 7.5 million $10 million $12 million  During an examination of the sports franchise's 1994 calendar year tax return, the examiner determined sports franchise ABC was not entitled to defer the reporting of its broadcast revenue under Rev. Proc. 71-21. The examiner's report adjustments are as follows: 1994 IRC section 481(a) Adjustment IRC section 446 Adjustment Total Adjustment $7,500,000 $2,500,000 $10,000,000 1995 -- $2,000,000 $2,000,000  The IRC section 481(a) adjustment is the deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the year of change (1994) of $7.5 million. The 1994 IRC section 446 adjustment is the $2.5 million increase in the deferred liability account balance from $7.5 million at the beginning of 1994 to $10 million at the end of 1994. The 1995 IRC section 446 adjustment is the $2 million increase in the deferred liability balance from $10 million at the beginning of 1995 to $12 million at the end of 1995.

The current year IRC section 446 adjustments are the yearly changes to the deferred income balances for each tax year beginning with the first year examined. This is illustrated in the example given in this chapter.  4-5   This page intentionally left blank.   Chapter 5 SEASON TICKET REVENUE  INDUSTRY PRACTICE Categories of Seating A major revenue source for a sports franchise is its ticket receipts. There are normally three categories of seats: regular or general admission seats, club seats, and luxury or skybox suites. A regular seat ticket entitles a sports fan admittance to the stadium for a specific game or a specific season of games. Generally, this category of seat contains no added benefits and the cost of the ticket is normally determined by seat location. Regular seat tickets can be sold on a game-by-game basis, although the majority are sold on a season ticket basis. Regular season seat tickets can be sold for a single season or for multiple seasons. For the sports franchise, the sale of season tickets ensures a stream of income for a specified time frame, as well as fan turn-out which can impact ancillary income; for example, parking revenue, concession revenue, etc. Normally, club seat tickets cost more than regular seat tickets, and in some cases as much as double. This additional cost is primarily due to the club seat location in the stadium, offering patrons a better view of the action; however, the increased cost is also due to the added benefits usually afforded these patrons. Club seat tickets entitle the ticket holders to admittance to the game, usually through a separate entrance from the general public; moreover, usually these sports fans also have access to a club facility at which they may purchase concessions in climate controlled surroundings before, during, or after the game. Additionally, the club area may include a lounge area in which the sports fans may socialize before, during, or after the game. Closed circuit television coverage allowing the patrons continued coverage of the field action while away from their seats is not uncommon in these facilities. Club seat ticket holders are often offered the right to acquire parking privileges close to the stadium. In the skybox category, the patron, normally a corporation, purchases a box of seats rather than a single seat. The number of seats in each box can vary within a particular stadium, depending on the stadium design and configuration. Similarly, the number of skyboxes varies from stadium to stadium. Skyboxes are the most expensive category of seats. This is not only due to the number of seats acquired, but also due to the facility and benefits provided as part of the skybox package. 5-1   Usually, skyboxes are elaborate facilities, containing climate control, comfort seating, closed circuit television equipment, as well as kitchen and bar facilities. It is not uncommon for skybox patrons to also receive a preferred parking location either adjacent to the stadium or in close proximity. Club seat tickets and skyboxes are normally sold on a multiple season basis. This ensures the sports franchise a steady income stream for a specific number of years. Accounting for Season Tickets Accounting for revenue from the sale of regular single season ticket sales is straight forward. For both generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) purposes and for tax purposes, the revenue is recorded as the games are played. This is true even if the playing season begins in one tax year and ends in the next tax year. Usually, the sale of multiple year season tickets requires a commitment from the sports fan to purchase season tickets for a specified number of years. Regardless of the seat category, the sports franchise normally issues terms and conditions, outlining the rights and obligations of both the ticket holder and the sports franchise. The terms and conditions usually specify the number of years for which the sports fan is obligated to purchase tickets, the cost of tickets per season (including any potential price increases), consequences to the ticket holder in the event of default, and other miscellaneous provisions. Multiple year season ticket sales, regardless of seat category, often require a security deposit. The terms and conditions usually contain provisions regarding the security deposit, including cancellation, application, and refund provisions. AUDIT ISSUES 1. Whether the reporting of advance payments on multiple season ticket sales can be deferred, or instead can be included in gross income in the tax year received; and Whether amounts treated by the sports franchise as non-taxable security deposits are, instead, taxable advance payments.  2.  TAX LAW Fixed & Definite Services Generally, payments received in advance are income to both accrual and cash basis taxpayers in the year of receipt, provided there is no restriction on the use of such payments. This income recognition rule holds true even though the advance payments are returnable upon the happening of some specified event. For accrual basis taxpayers, deferral of prepayments for future services 5-2   is permitted, provided the services do not extend after the tax year following the year of receipt. Chapter 3 addresses the general year of income inclusion rules and Rev. Proc. 71-21, 1971-2 C.B. 549. While the general rule for tax purposes is that payments received for services to be performed in the future must be included in gross income in the taxable year of receipt, several courts have allowed deferral of prepaid income when the contract obligations to perform the services are fixed and determinable. Artnell Co. v. Commissioner, 400 F.2d 981 (7th Cir. 1968), Boise Cascade Corp. v. United States, 530 F.2d 1367 (Ct. Cl. 1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 867 (1976). In Artnell the court allowed the deferral of prepaid single season baseball tickets because unlike American Automobile Association v. United States, 367 U.S. 687 (1961), and Schlude v. Commissioner, 572 U.S. 128 (1963), the time and extent of future services was certain (except for rained out games, the baseball games were played on a fixed schedule). The court in Boise Cascade Corp. also allowed the deferral of prepaid engineering services until the year the services were performed because performance was required on fixed dates or as expeditiously as possible. These courts reasoned ""there were situations when deferral so clearly reflected income that it must be permitted."" In the action on decision on Boise Cascade Corp., dated February 19, 1986, the Service stated: We believe that the reasoning of the Court of Claims is incorrect. The so-called 'fixed and definite' or 'certainty of performance' test, which suggests that income deferral might be possible if certain standards are met for the matching of deferred income with future services and expenses, (see Artnell v. Commissioner, 400 F.2d 981 (7th Cir. 1968)) is premised on a misinterpretation of the Supreme Court's holdings in Schlude and A.A.A. In those cases, the Supreme Court cited as an 'additional ground' (Schlude, at 135) for disallowing income deferral the fact that the advance payments related to services which were to be performed without relation to fixed dates in the future. From this holding, it is argued that the Supreme Court 'left an opening' (Artnell at 984) allowing for deferral if the extent and time of future performance are 'certain'. However, there is no implication that the Supreme Court, in disallowing deferral of income in Schlude, A.A.A. and Michigan, intended expressly or impliedly to state a positive rule allowing for income deferral. To the contrary, advance payments for services to be rendered in future years and received without restriction as to use, are income in the year received by an accrual basis taxpayer. RCA Corp. v. United States, 664 F.2d 881 (2d Cir. 1981); Simplified Tax Records, Inc. v. Commissioner, 41 T.C. 75 (1963); Popular Library, Inc. v. Commissioner, 39 T.C. 1092 (1963). Moreover, the fixed-and-definite theory, which argues by implication from the 'additional ground' in Schlude and A.A.A., overlooks the primary ground upon which the Supreme Court relied in refusing income deferral: the 'long-standing' (at 134) principle that 'accounting systems Schlude deferring prepaid income could be rejected by the Commissioner' (Id.) pursuant to the broad discretion given him by I.R.C. section 5-3   446. With certain limited exceptions, Service position is that all the events that fix the right to receive income occur when (1) the required performance takes place, (2) payment is due, or (3) payment is made, whichever happens first. See: Rev. Rul. 80-308, 1980-2 C.B. 162; Rev. Rul. 79-292, 1979-2 C.B. 287; Rev. Rul. 79-195, 1979-1 C.B. 177. The Service disagreed with both the Artnell and Boise Cascade decisions, and in response to the Artnell decision published Rev. Proc. 7121. In the Action on Decision on Artnell, dated July 27, 1971, Chief Counsel stated ""the Service will not follow Artnell to the extent the rules for deferral could be deemed to be broader than those contained in Rev. Proc. 71-21."" Advance Payment Versus Deposit A distinction between a deposit in the nature of a loan and an advance payment turns on the nature of the rights and obligations that are assumed when the deposit is made. The leading case addressing the taxability of customer deposits is the Supreme Court's opinion in Commissioner v. Indianapolis Power & Light Co., 493 U.S. 203 (1990). In this case, the Supreme Court applied what has become known as the ""complete dominion test"" to determine whether customer deposits should be included in taxable income when received. In Indianapolis Power & Light, customers with poor credit (about 5 percent of all customers) had to make deposits to a utility to ensure prompt payment of future electric bills. The deposits were collected pursuant to terms established by a public utilities regulatory authority. The deposits would accrue interest if held for more than 12 months. The utility would refund the deposits upon termination of service or earlier if the customer demonstrated acceptable credit (by making timely payments for a certain period). The customer could receive a cash refund or could elect to apply the deposit as payment of his electric bill. The utility did not segregate the deposits, and the deposits were subject to its use and control. One of the major factors considered by the Supreme Court was the fact that the customers in this case could cancel at any time. The Court stated: Here in contrast, a customer submitting a deposit made no commitment to purchase a specified quantity of electricity, or indeed to purchase any electricity at all. [Footnote 6] IPL's right to keep the money depends upon the customer's purchase of electricity, and upon his later decision to have the deposit applied to future bills, not merely upon the utility's adherence to its contractual duties.  5-4   The Supreme Court stated in Footnote 6: A customer, for example, might terminate service the day after making the deposit. Also, IPL's dominion over a deposit remains incomplete even after the customer begins buying electricity. As has been noted, the deposit typically is set at twice the customer's estimated monthly bill. So long as the customer pays his bills in a timely fashion, the money he owes the utility (for electricity used but not yet paid for) almost always will be less than the amount of the deposit. If this were not the case, the deposit would provide inadequate protection. Thus, through the period the deposit is held, at least a portion is likely to be money that IPL has no real assurance of ever retaining. The Supreme Court held that control over the deposits, unrestricted use of the funds, and nonpayment of interest were not controlling factors in determining whether a taxpayer exercised complete dominion over deposits received or is obligated to repay the deposits. The controlling factor was that, at the time deposits were made, the utility had no guarantee that it would be allowed to retain them. The utility acquired the deposits subject to an express obligation to repay at some future date (at the time of termination of service or earlier, if the customer established good credit). The Supreme Court noted: The individual who makes an advance payment retains no right to insist upon the return of the funds. On the other hand, a customer submitting a deposit retains the right to insist upon repayment in cash, even though he may choose to apply the deposit to purchase goods. *** An advance payment, like the deposits at issue here, concededly protects the seller against the risk that it would be able to collect money owed it after it has furnished goods or services. But an advance payment does much more; it protects against the risk that the purchaser will back out of the deal before the seller performs. *** Here, in contrast, a customer submitting a deposit made no commitment. In section 3.03 of Rev. Proc. 91-31, 1991-1 C.B. 566, the Service stated: Change in treatment of deposits. If a utility company consistently includes customer deposits in gross income in the year of receipt and those deposits are not taxed upon receipt under the decision in Indianapolis Power, a change in the treatment of those deposits is a change in method of accounting.  5-5   TAX LAW APPLICATION Except perhaps for multiple season ticket contracts covering just two regular seasons, most multiple season contracts will not meet the requirement under Rev. Proc. 71-21 that the services be provided by the end of the tax year following the year of receipt. This Rev. Proc. 71-21 requirement is addressed in Chapter 3. There are significant differences between Indianapolis Power & Light and a professional sports franchise. First, the deposits in Indianapolis Power & Light were typically set at twice the estimated monthly bill. Advance payments/deposits required by sports franchises normally are exactly equal to the cost of one year's season ticket. Second, the customers in Indianapolis Power & Light were not obligated to purchase any electricity and could terminate the service at any time, requiring an immediate refund (either in cash or in credit). Multiple year season ticket holders, on the other hand, are usually obligated to purchase tickets for a specified number of years, which may range from 3 to 10 years, depending on the sports franchise and the seat category. The customers in Indianapolis Power & Light were assured of a complete refund upon termination. Thus, the customers controlled both the timing and the method of their refunds. In contrast, multiple year season ticket contracts often do not contain a cancellation provision whereby the ticket holder will receive an unconditional refund. Sports franchise multiple year season ticket contracts that do provide for ""early"" refunds often contain restrictions on the timing of the refund or the amount of the refund. For example, the contract may specify a refund will only be made if the ticket is resold and that the refund will be reduced by a reselling charge or cancellation charge. As a regulated utility, the taxpayer in Indianapolis Power & Light was required by the State to treat the amounts in question as deposits. Additionally, unclaimed deposits were required to be transferred to the State. While sports franchises are members of their respective leagues, they are not regulated entities. Thus, there are no industry regulations governing the accounting of a sports franchise's season ticket advance payments/deposits. Moreover, any unclaimed advance payments/deposits remain with the sports franchise. Another factor is the rights the sports franchise possesses with respect to the advance payments/deposits and the season ticket contracts. In a number of sports franchise cases, the sports franchise pledged the advance payments/deposits and season ticket contracts as security for third party financing. As stated earlier, control over the deposits and unrestricted use of funds are not the controlling factors in determining whether a taxpayer has complete dominion over the deposits and is obligated to repay deposits. Substance versus form is controlling for tax purposes. The Supreme Court noted in Indianapolis Power & Light: 5-6   When the Commissioner examines privately structured transactions, the true understanding of the parties, of course, may not be apparent. It may be that a transfer of funds, though nominally a loan, may conceal an unstated agreement that the money is to be applied to the purchase of goods or services. Generally, a sports franchise advance payment/deposit issue is not going to be a black and white issue. Each sports franchise's potential advance payment/deposit issue must be evaluated based on the sports franchise's unique facts and circumstances. EXAMINATION TECHNIQUES Documents and information that should be obtained in developing a sports franchise advance payment/deposit issue include: 1. The season ticket application packages. This may consist of the actual application submitted by a prospective season ticket holder, along with any attachments such as seating selections, payment options, etc. If different applications are used for different categories of seats, each type should be secured. The applications should provide basic information such as application fee required, cost of ticket (per season), location of seating, etc. Sample copy of season ticket agreements (original, as well as any later amendments, or terms in any form) for each category of seat, including club seats. In some cases, the terms and conditions are significantly different for regular season tickets, club seats, and skyboxes. A breakdown of the total number of seats in each seat category. A listing of season ticket holders, including name, purchase date of ticket, total purchase price, date and amount of the advance payment/deposit, subsequent payments (if any), and remaining amount due. The payment plan agreement for each category of seat, which outlines the various payment options available to the season ticket holders. Sometimes sports franchises will offer the ticket holder the option to pay annually or pay monthly. The various payment plan agreements will specify the amount of each periodic payment, how many payments are due, when the payments are due, etc. Sample cover letter to ticket holders transmitting coupon books for those who opted to pay by monthly check, and if available, a sample coupon book. Similarly, a sample confirmation letter or signature authorization, if any, sent to those who opted for an automatic monthly withdrawal to pay for their tickets. A copy of the sports franchise's policy regarding liquidating damages, cancellation fees, resale fees, etc., when the multiple year season ticket agreements were entered into. If the sports franchise has a written policy, retain a copy for the case file workpapers. If the agreements or policies have changed over time, secure a copy of all agreement and policy 5-7  2.  3.  4.  5.  6.   changes through the date the examination is closed. Some policy changes may apply retroactively. 7. Listing of ticket holders who requested refunds of their deposits. The list should reflect the date the refund was requested, the date the refund was made, as well as the amount of the refund. Sample packages of cancellation requests for each seat category. This would include the request from the ticket holder, the response from the team, any default letters sent, etc. Sample renewal letters sent to ticket holders whose contracts were due to expire. Examiners need to analyze these letters to determine the disposition of any advance payment/deposit which may have been paid up front by the ticket holder.  8.  9.  10. Media packages for the marketing of skyboxes. These often have separate marketing campaigns which are targeted to the larger local businesses. The contracts utilized for multiple season tickets, regardless of seat category, should be carefully analyzed. Additionally, it may be helpful to use a look-back approach. Securing refund packages may give some insight as to any unstated agreements. These packages may consist of refund requests from the ticket holder and response letters from the sports franchise, as well as the final letter transmitting or denying the refund. Depending on the length of time the sports franchise has been in existence, it may be helpful to trace the disposition of advance payments/deposits for those ticket holders who do not renew their seats. The invoice and correspondence sent for the final season should be inspected to ascertain if the sports franchise automatically applies the advance payment/deposit against the final season's ticket price. In developing a potential advance payment versus deposit issue, the examiner needs to look beyond the form of the sports franchise's privately structured contracts and agreements, and to focus on the substance of the rights and obligations of parties under the season ticket agreements. This includes consideration of unstated agreements and understandings among the parties. Substance versus form is controlling for tax purposes. Because the multiple year season ticket revenue issues addressed in this chapter involve the timing of the sports franchise's reporting of season ticket revenue, they constitute a change in the sports franchise's method of accounting for multiple year season contract revenue. Accordingly, examiners need to follow the change in method of accounting issue procedures in raising season ticket revenue issues.  5-8   POTENTIAL EMERGING ISSUE Some districts have raised the question of whether advance payments on season contracts are advance payments for property rights versus advance payments for services. Rev. Proc. 71-21 only applies to advance payments for services. Chapter 4 addresses the case law in this area and a similar issue for broadcasting rights. Chapter 3 addresses a similar issue for sponsorship agreements that convey exclusivity rights to the sponsor. This issue is currently under review by the Sports Franchise ISP Team and should be discussed with the ISP before proposing an adjustment to the taxpayer.  5-9   This page intentionally left blank.   Chapter 6 RELOCATION INCENTIVES  INDUSTRY PRACTICE The number of major league sports franchises has increased over the last several years. For example, in 1991 there were 102 professional teams in the National Football League (NFL), National Basketball Association (NBA), National Hockey League (NHL), and Major League Baseball (MLB). In 1995 there were a total of 111 teams in these four major sports leagues. In addition, there has been a significant number of sports franchise teams relocating from one city to another. Cities and states may offer significant incentives to lure a sports franchise's team to a certain area, whether through expansion or through relocation. One incentive offered may be in the form of lease inducements for the use of a municipal stadium or arena. As with other commercial real estate leases, inducements to sports franchises may be in the form of cash advances, loans, and free or substantially reduced rental rates. City and state relocation incentives structured in the form of a cash advance or loan transaction may be income to the sports franchise. AUDIT ISSUE It is necessary to determine whether sports franchise relocation incentives structured in the form of a cash advance or a loan are income to the sports franchise in the tax year received. TAX LAW Under IRC section 61, gross income includes all income from whatever source derived. Gross income includes ""accessions to wealth, clearly realized and over which the taxpayer has complete dominion."" Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass Co., 348 U.S. 426 (1955). Generally, loan proceeds do not constitute income to the borrower because the benefit is offset by the obligation to repay. United States v. Rochelle, 384 F.2d 748 (5th Cir. 1967); Arlen v. Commissioner, 48 T.C. 640 (1967); Vaughan v. Commissioner, 67 CCH Tax Ct. Mem. 1936 (1994). Whether a specific transaction actually constitutes a loan, however, must be determined based on all the facts and circumstances. Fisher v. Commissioner, 54 T.C. 905 (1970). In Milenbach v. Commissioner, 106 T.C. 184 (1996), the Tax Court held that municipal funds received by a football sports franchise, repayable only from specific sources of revenue, were not loans and had to be included in gross income, because the obligation to repay the funds was not unconditional.  6-1   The Tax Court in Milenbach found that the Raiders sports franchise announced in 1980 that it was moving from Oakland to Los Angeles. Under the terms of the agreement with the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission (LAMCC), the LAMCC loaned the sports franchise $6.7 million under a promissory note to be repaid with 12 percent of the net receipts from operations of suites, or skyboxes, to be constructed by the sports franchise at the Los Angeles Coliseum. The agreement further provided that construction of the suites would begin as soon as practical as determined by the sports franchise. The sports franchise was to begin repayment of the loan 3 years after the completion of construction of the suites. The loan was non-recourse against the sports franchise, secured solely by the improvements to be made. The $6.7 million loan was funded with a $4 million advance in 1984, and by credits against rent due from the sports franchise during the years 1982 through 1986 in the total amount of $2.7 million. The construction of the suites began in early 1987, but was halted shortly thereafter. Construction was stopped due to a dispute between the sports franchise and the LAMCC to perform certain improvements to the Los Angeles Coliseum. The sports franchise made no payments on the LAMCC loan and did not complete construction of the suites. The sports franchise relied on Commissioner v. Indianapolis Power & Light Co., 493 U.S. 203 (1990), to support its argument that the $6.7 million represented a valid debt not includible in its taxable income. The Tax Court in Milenbach determined ""The Supreme Court's reasoning does not support petitioner's position. *** The Raiders, unlike the power company, were not subject to an express obligation to repay within the lender's control."" The Tax Court concluded: The Raiders had the discretion to determine if and when the suites would be constructed, *** Although both documents limited the Raiders discretion by a standard of reasonableness, the agreements gave the Raiders great latitude in the timing of construction. *** Repayment of the $6.7 million was to commence 3 years after the construction of the suites, and repayment was to be solely from the net revenues from suite operations. If the Raiders did not construct the suites, which was the case, there would be no suite revenues to use for repayment. No default or alternative payment provision was included in the 1982 MOA [memorandum of understanding], the 1984 lease, or the promissory note. The nonrecourse promissory note was secured only by the improvements, i.e., the suites. When the Raiders did not construct the suites, the LAMCC was without a source for repayment. The Tax Court determined an unconditional, enforceable debt did not exist for tax purposes due to the contingent nature of the sports franchise's obligation. The court sustained the government's determination that the sports franchise had income in the years 1982 through 1986 equal to the 6-2   amount of rental credits, and in 1984 the sports franchise had income from the additional $4 million cash advance.  TAX LAW APPLICATION Relocation incentives which appear to be structured in the form of a cash advance or loan transaction may be income to the sports franchise. In the case of a cash advance or loan, the tax treatment will depend largely upon the terms under which the money is advanced. If the terms of the cash advance or loan do not establish an unconditional obligation to repay, the cash advance or loan may constitute taxable income to the sports franchise in the tax year received. EXAMINATION TECHNIQUES Examiners should consider the transactions that the sports franchise may have with state or local government. Contracts, agreements, and related documents should be carefully inspected for relocation incentives that constitute income to the sports franchise. The substance of relocation provisions should be considered to determine if they conform with the form of amounts characterized as cash advances or loans.  6-3   This page intentionally left blank.   Chapter 7 STRIKE FUND PAYMENTS  INDUSTRY PRACTICE A sports league owners' association may maintain a strike fund to loan funds to the league's sports franchises, as needed, during player strikes. At least one major sports league (National Football League) is known to have a strike fund. This chapter addresses the taxation of strike fund payments made by a sports franchise to the sports league owners' association. A sports league owners' association may establish a strike fund to provide a source of funds during player strikes. Typically, the strike fund is funded by pro rata assessments to the sports franchises in the league. The league's rules and the strike fund provisions usually determine the circumstances and categories of expenditures for which disbursements may be made from the strike fund. These provisions, however, are likely to be subject to suspension or modification by a vote of a specified number of league owners. AUDIT ISSUE The issue to be determined is whether strike fund payments made by a sports franchise to the league association are deductible in the tax year in which they are paid or incurred, or whether they are instead nondeductible capital expenditures. TAX LAW Under IRC section 162, ordinary and necessary expenses incurred in carrying on a trade or business are deductible in the tax year paid or incurred. IRC section 263(a) provides for the capitalization of capital expenditures. Treas. Reg. section 1.263(a)-2(a) requires the capitalization of costs having a useful life, extending beyond the close of the tax year in which the expenditure is paid or incurred. An expenditure that is otherwise an ordinary and necessary expense under IRC section 162 must be capitalized if it constitutes a capital expenditure under IRC section 263. The determination must be made of whether an expenditure is currently deductible or a capital expenditure is fact specific, and no one factor can control this determination. National Starch & Chemical Corp. v. Commissioner, 918 F.2d 426 (3d Cir. 1990). There is no readily available formula for determining in every context whether a particular expenditure is currently deductible or a capital expenditure. In Welch v. Helvering, 290 U.S. 111 (1933), the Supreme Court observed, ""the decisive distinctions are those of degree and not of kind."" Courts, however, have employed a variety of standards in making this determination.  7-1   Capital expenditures are expenditures that result in a benefit to the taxpayer which could be expected to produce returns for many years in the future. E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. v. United States, 432 F.2d 1052 (3d Cir. 1970). Capital expenditures are expenditures with the purpose of betterment for the indefinite future or, for a time, somewhat longer than the current taxable year, in contrast to being devoted to the income production or other needs of the more immediate present. General Bancshares Corp. v. Commissioner, 326 F.2d 712 (8th Cir. 1964), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 832 (1964). See also, Commissioner v. Idaho Power Co., 418 U.S. 1 (1974), Indopco Inc. v. Commissioner, 503 U.S. 79 (1992), and National Starch & Chemical. Notwithstanding the fact that there is no bright line test for determining, in all cases, whether an expenditure is currently deductible or a capital expenditure, the expenditures that create or enhance a capital asset are generally required to be capitalized. See Commissioner v. Idaho Power Co., 418 U.S. 1 (1974), and the cases cited therein. In Commissioner v. Lincoln Savings & Loan Ass'n, 403 U.S. 345 (1971), the savings and loan association was required to pay premiums to a secondary reserve maintained by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC). Each insured association had a pro rata shared interest in the secondary reserve. Each association received an annual credit from the FSLIC for the earnings on its share of the secondary reserve. An association's share in the reserve was transferable for FSLIC approved situations of merger, consolidation, transfer of bulk assets, and similar transactions. An insured association could obtain a cash refund of its pro rata share if its status as an insured was terminated. Based on these factors, the Supreme Court found that each insured association had a distinct and separate property interest in the secondary reserve, even though there was a possibility that the secondary reserve might be consumed by FSLIC's losses and never refunded to the association. The Supreme Court concluded the association's premium payments to the secondary reserve constituted capital expenditures. In contrast, in Rev. Rul. 82-15, 1982-1 C.B. 29, the taxpayer was required to pay its trade association increased dues earmarked for a loan fund to be used by any member of the association which was experiencing a strike and needed a loan to continue in business, and to continue to participate in collective bargaining with the labor union. There was no relationship between eligibility for, or the size of the loans and the dues payment uniformly required of members. The loans would be made only to the trade association's members during strikes, and then only under circumstances establishing that a member would not be able to continue in business and to bargain in good faith without a loan. Loan applications would be evaluated by using criteria similar to those used by lending institutions. Default on repayment would result in the initiation of collection procedures and suspension of the borrower's membership in the association. If the fund was terminated, any remaining amounts would be used to further the trade association's exempt purposes.  7-2   The ruling held the increased dues did not result in the acquisition by the taxpayer of a permanent interest in property. The taxpayer's additional payments entitled the taxpayer only to the benefits of continued membership in the association, which included the use of the loan fund. Accordingly, the Service concluded the increased dues were current period expenses, not capital expenditures. TAX LAW APPLICATION If a sports franchise is determined to have a separate and distinct property interest in a sports league's strike fund, then the strike fund payments may constitute a capital expenditure in the tax year paid or incurred; however, as addressed above, consideration of whether strike fund payments are currently deductible or capital expenditures is not limited to whether the sports franchise may have some continuing property interest in the strike fund. All relevant facts and circumstances need to be developed and considered. In addition, whether a sports franchise has separate and distinct property interest in the strike fund is a factual and legal question requiring detailed analysis. Relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether a sports franchise has a separate and distinct property interest in a league's strike fund include, but are not limited, to the following questions: 1. Are strike fund payments required payments of each sports franchise in the league or optional? If strike fund payments are required, how is each franchise's required payment determined (pro rata, team player salaries, team revenue, etc.)? If strike fund payments are required, what are the provisions for delinquent payments? Does the league keep track of each individual sports franchise's accumulated payments to the strike fund? For recordkeeping purposes, are earnings on strike funds allocated to the individual sports franchises based on their respective accumulated payments to the strike fund? Does the league periodically provide an accounting to the league members of each member's accumulated strike fund payments and earnings? Does the sports franchise reflect its share of the strike fund as an asset in its financial statements or tax returns? Is the use of strike funds restricted to certain types of expenditures under specified circumstances? 7-3  2.  3. 4.  5.  6.  7.  8.   9.  Do strike funds specifically benefit a specific sports franchise to the extent of its accumulated strike fund payments and earnings?  10. Is there any relationship between a sports franchise's accumulated strike fund payments and its eligibility for strike fund loans or payments? 11. Are loans from the strike fund to be repaid and, if so, under what terms and conditions? 12. If a sports franchise is sold, how are prior strike fund payments accounted for by the sports league, the seller, and the buyer? 13. What are the provisions if the strike fund is terminated or a decision is made to reduce the amount of the strike fund? 14. What are the procedures for modifying the operating or distribution provisions of the strike fund (majority vote of owners, etc.)? 15. Does the sports franchise have a continuing economic or property interest in the strike fund? 16. Does the form of the strike fund provisions reflect the substance of the strike fund? To the extent that the sports franchise and sports league do not furnish documents and information to address the above and other relevant questions, it may be appropriate to take the position that the sports franchise has not established that strike fund payments are currently deductible. EXAMINATION TECHNIQUES Initial documents and information that should be obtained in developing a sports franchise strike fund issue include: 1. 2. The strike fund agreement, The resolutions and minutes of league meetings in which the strike fund agreement and funding were discussed, Financial statements or supplementary financial information of the sports league association which address the league strike fund, and  3.  Workpapers and schedules reconciling the amount deducted in the sports franchise's tax return to the amount in its books and financial statements. This includes reconciliation of accruals at the beginning and end of each year under examination. The above documents and information should be requested early in the examination.

The increasing significance of revenue generated by club seats and luxury suites, which offer an advantage to new and renovated stadiums, is a major impetus for stadium expansion. Expansion sports franchises and relocated sports franchises generally have new or renovated stadiums. In addition, established sports franchises are commonly pursuing stadium expansion or, in some instances, new stadiums. A major factor in a sports franchise's financial success includes having a favorable stadium deal. Numerous cities have proven their willingness to mortgage their futures through taxes and the sale of bonds to attract or keep a sports franchise. As a result of new stadium construction and city concessions, sports franchises in larger markets, once thought to have an insurmountable economic advantage over franchises in smaller markets, have, in many instances, been surpassed in profits and value by their smaller market counterparts. The willingness of cities to build stadiums and the large increases in revenues related to the new stadiums creates an environment where it appears that in many leagues a sports franchise will need new stadiums and favorable concessions packages to remain competitive in their league. The sports franchise will either own its stadium or lease it from another party. The stadium owner may be an entity related to the sports franchise, a public entity, or an unrelated third party. The sports franchise's stadium interests, leased or owned, are a strong component of the sports franchise's overall value; accordingly, the agreements between the sports franchise and the local sports authority tend to be heavily negotiated, lengthy, and complex. It is not uncommon for the owner of a sports franchise to also own other entities related to the sports franchise. For instance, one entity may own the actual sports franchise, while another separate entity may own the sport facility or hold the long-term lease to the facility. Additionally, another related entity could hold the concession contract, while yet another can provide the parking. The ways in which ancillary services can be segregated into separate entities is almost limitless. Moreover, most sports franchise owners also own other businesses which, while unrelated to sports franchise operations (such as a television or radio station), may be enhanced by the ownership of a professional sports team.  8-1   Examiners should consider whether the agreements among an owner's businesses are entered into on an arms-length basis. Since these related party transactions will, in all likelihood, be unique, a thorough analysis is required to determine the true nature of the transactions. When related party transactions are determined to be at less than arms length, IRC section 482 may be used to reallocate income and expenses in order to reflect the proper taxable income. The applicability of IRC section 267 should also be considered for transactions among related parties. Because there are different audit issues and audit risk for a sports franchise which owns its stadium and a sports franchise which leases its stadium, the ownership and lease of a sports stadium are addressed separately in this chapter. STADIUM OWNERSHIP Overview As with all real estate owned, there are burdens and benefits that go with a sports franchise's ownership of its stadium. The sports franchise that owns its stadium will have a large capital asset on its balance sheet, and significant depreciation will be claimed. Rental expense will be drastically reduced in comparison to a sport franchise that leases its stadium. Unless the city has made concessions (which is not unlikely), the sports franchise will probably have significant property taxes. A sports franchise that owns its stadium is also likely to have a higher payroll than a sports franchise that leases its stadium. Stadium ownership by a sports franchise or an entity related to the sports franchise is generally achieved through construction or acquisition. In both instances, the basis of the asset will be the costs directly and indirectly chargeable to the stadium and related facility assets. In computing depreciation, the value of the land is excluded from the depreciable assets. With new construction, the determination of land value is generally provided in a separate acquisition closing statement; however, when an existing stadium is acquired, the determination of land value is more problematic. The contract on the acquisition of an existing stadium should allocate the acquisition price as negotiated by buyers and sellers among the various assets acquired. Even though the buyer and seller have agreed on the purchase/sale price allocations, the examiner is not prevented from challenging allocations to reflect their actual fair market values. AUDIT ISSUES 1. This issue relates to whether the allocation to land versus buildings and other depreciable assets is proper. As with any other purchase of real estate, the value allocated to land should be reviewed to determine its reasonableness. Whether the depreciable assets have been assigned proper recovery periods is a further issue. 8-2  2.   There are various structural components which are considered to be part of the stadium structure. Some components, such as stadium seats, the score board and message board have a considerably shorter life than the stadium structure. Therefore, it is important to determine that assets have been appropriately classified and the correct recovery period is applied in calculating depreciation. 3. For stadiums constructed using tax exempt bonds, another issue is whether the sports franchise properly used the alternative depreciation system versus the regular depreciation system.  Recovery Periods A sports stadium is a single purpose str of sports and other events. It is limited more general business use or activities. Accordingly, the stadium structure and of 39 years. uct to A its ure in that it provides spectator space for the viewing this functional use and is not readily adaptable to other sports stadium is nonresidential real property. structural components normally have a recovery period  The term ""structural components"" includes parts of the building such as: walls; partitions; floors; ceilings; permanent coverings such as paneling or tiling; windows and doors; all components (whether in, on, or adjacent to the building) of a central air conditioning or heating system, including motors, compressors, pipes and ducts; plumbing and plumbing fixtures, such as sinks and bathtubs; electric wiring and lighting fixtures; chimneys; escalators and elevators, including all components thereof; sprinkler systems; fire escapes; and other components relating to the operation or maintenance of a building. There are certain stadium-related assets which are considered personal property in nature and are, therefore, entitled to a shorter recovery period than the stadium structure and its structural components. Rev. Rul. 69-170, 1969-1 C.B. 28, addresses whether stadium seats and other miscellaneous items associated with a sports stadium qualify as IRC section 38 property for purposes of investment credit. This ruling indirectly provides guidance on what assets, associated with a sports stadium, qualify for recovery periods separate from (and thereby qualifying for shorter recovery periods) the stadium building and its structural components. The taxpayer in Rev. Rul. 69-170 operated a concrete and steel baseball stadium. The items of property in question were the stadium seats, score boards and message board (including equipment and circuitry), field lights, backstop, batter's eye screen, foul and flag poles, and signs. The stadium seats were wooden with metal frames and were attached to the stadium with bolts that were embedded in the concrete floor. The backstop was located behind home plate and was made of wire mesh attached by cables to the stadium structure. The batter's eye screen was located in center field and consisted of a 8-3   metallic screen across steel poles that were attached to concrete foundations with steel bolts. The foul and flag poles were four steel poles embedded in concrete and were separate from the stadium structure. The score boards and message board were in the nature of electrical signs. Both were mounted on large steel poles, attached to concrete foundations with steel bolts. These boards were separate and apart from the stadium structure. The field lights consisted of eight clusters of lights, each cluster having approximately 200 bulbs. Each cluster of lights was supported by steel poles that were attached to concrete foundations with steel bolts. Six of these steel poles were attached to foundations that were part of the stadium structure while the other two had foundations set apart from the structure. The signs consisted of numerous directional and traffic signs located in the parking lots and traffic lanes adjacent to the stadium. The Service ruled the stadium seats, the backstop, the flagpoles mounted on the stadium, and the equipment and circuitry contained in or attached to the score boards, and the message board were tangible personal property. In contrast, the Service ruled the score boards and message board (excluding equipment and circuitry), field lights (including those mounted on the stadium), batter's eye screen, foul line poles, flagpoles (excluding those mounted on the stadium), and sign structures (including the basic signs) were other tangible property. A change in the useful life of property under IRC section 167 is not a change in method of accounting. Treas. Reg. section 1.446-1(e)(2)(ii)(b). The allowed or allowable depreciation provisions apply to IRC section 167, useful life changes. A change in the recovery period of a class of assets under IRC section 168 is a change in method of accounting. Accordingly, the allowed or allowable depreciation provisions do not apply to recovery period changes under IRC section 168. Instead, the IRC section 481(a) and IRC section 446 change in accounting method provisions apply. Tax Exempt Bond Financing IRC section 168(g) requires the use of the alternative depreciation system for tax exempt bondfinanced property. Under the alternative depreciation method, the straight line method is used and the applicable recovery periods are:  8-4   Recovery Period 1. 2. 3. Property not described in 2 or 3 Personal property with no class life Nonresidential real and residential rental property the class life 12 years 40 years  EXAMINATION TECHNIQUES Documents and information that should be obtained for sports franchises that own their sports stadium include: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. stadium agreement(s), purchase/sale contract(s), appraisals, real property tax assessments, tangible tax returns, and depreciation schedules and workpapers.  Inspection of real property tax assessments and tangible tax returns filed is often a quick and easy way to determine the examination potential of allocation issues. Chapter 10 addresses purchase/sale price allocations in more detail. Consider whether the sports franchise is improperly treating categories of assets as being separate from the stadium building and its structural components. The sports franchise's recovery period characterizations of tangible personal property should be reviewed. Apply the allowed or allowable depreciation provisions to IRC section 167 useful life changes. Apply the IRC section 481(a) and IRC section 446 change in accounting method adjustment computation provisions and change in accounting method examination procedures for a change in the recovery period of a class of assets under IRC section 168.  8-5   STADIUM LEASES Overview If the stadium is being leased by the sports franchise, then leasehold improvements are a potential issue area. The general rule is that depreciation of improvements to real property, subject to a lease, is calculated in the same manner as the depreciation deduction for the underlying property would have been calculated had the property been placed in service at the same time as the addition or improvement, without regard to the lease term. The IRC section 467 rental agreement provisions may apply to a sports franchise's lease arrangements. AUDIT ISSUES 1. Whether amounts claimed as repair and maintenance expenses are lease improvements that should be capitalized under IRC section 263. Whether depreciation is being properly computed on leasehold improvements. Whether IRC section 267 or IRC section 482 apply to lease payments to related parties. Whether IRC section 467 is properly applied to rental arrangements.  2. 3. 4.  Leasehold Improvements Since a stadium lease is generally long term in nature, the examiner should consider whether amounts classified by the sports franchise as repair and maintenance expenditures are instead leasehold improvements that should be capitalized. The right to claim depreciation is not predicated on ownership of property, but on an investment in the property. The cost of improvements made by a lessee are generally depreciable. IRC section 168(i)(8)(A). Under IRC section 168, the depreciation of a capital asset is computed without regard to the lease term; thus, the cost of the improvement is recovered over the applicable recovery period. If, upon termination of the lease, the lessee does not retain the improvements, gain or loss is computed by reference to the adjusted basis in the improvements. IRC section 168(i)(8)(B). If the leasehold improvements are financed with tax exempt proceeds, under IRC section 168(g)(3)(A) the recovery period used for purposes of the alternative depreciation system is not less than 125 percent of the lease term.  8-6   IRC Section 467 Rental Agreements IRC section 467 rental agreements include leases in which the sum of the lease payments are in excess of $250,000, and either (1) at least one amount, allocable to the use of the property in one calendar year, is payable after the close of the subsequent calendar year, or (2) there are periodic increases in the rent. IRC section 467 requires both the lessor and lessee to report rental income and expense (and interest on rent) using an accrual method of accounting. Under IRC section 467, one of three different accrual methods may apply depending on the circumstances: 1. 2. 3. constant rental accrual; accrual in accordance with the allocation of rents provided in the rental agreement, or accrual in accordance with the allocation of rents provided in the rental agreement, adjusted to take into account present value concepts.  The proper IRC section 467 accrual method must be determined on a lease-by-lease basis. The constant rental method of IRC section 467(b)(2) applies when: (1) the rental agreement contains no allocation of rents, or (2) the rental agreement contains an allocation with stepped rents, a principal purpose for providing the stepped rents is avoidance of tax, and the agreement is either a leaseback or long-term agreement. If a rental agreement does not specify how much rent is allocable to the periods under the lease, the rent payment schedule should be treated as the rent allocation schedule. Because almost all rental agreements contain rent payment schedules, rarely will a rental agreement be subject to the constant rental accrual method because of a failure to allocate rent. If the constant rental method applies, the agreement of the parties concerning the allocation of rent will be totally disregarded, and the rent leveling provisions of IRC section 467(b)(2) will determine the income and expenses for each taxable year during the rental period. The constant rental amount is defined in IRC section 467(e)(1) as the amount which, if paid as of the close of each lease period under the agreement, would result in an aggregate present value equal to the present value of the aggregate payments required under the agreement. Section 1.467-3 of the proposed IRC section 467 regulations provides a formula for determining the constant rental method. For an IRC section 467 rental rents are generally recognized report the rent allocable to the accounting; thus, there will be agreement for which the constant rental method does not apply, as specified in the rental agreement. The parties will be required to period on the accrual basis regardless of their method of ""matching"" on an accrual basis by both lessors and lessees.  8-7   If the payment of rent is deferred and adequate interest is not charged on the deferred rent, the amount of rent allocated to a period must be discounted to its present value, and interest on the unpaid rent must be taken into account as it accrues. One reasonable method for discounting rent to present value is contained in section 1.467-2 of the proposed regulations. The section 467 regulations also apply IRC section 467 rules to rental agreements prepaid rent and/or decreasing rents. In some cases a sports franchise may lease a tax-exempt entity. In such cases, if the rental agreement has decreasing rents, and to the final section 467 regulations, application of the constant rental method shou considered. providing for stadium from a if it is subject ld be  The above constitutes just an overview of the detailed IRC section 467 provisions. More detailed guidance on IRC section 467 can be found in the Construction ISP team's coordinated issue papers entitled: -- Section 467 Rental Agreements -- The Constant Rate Method, and -- Section 467 Rental Agreements -- The Economic Accrual Method. EXAMINATION TECHNIQUES Documents and information that should be obtained in developing the sports franchise stadium lease include: 1. 2. 3. lease agreements, concession agreements, audited financial statements (the terms of the lease agreements and related party transactions should be disclosed in the footnotes), workpapers and schedules on the application of IRC section 467, copies of the returns of any related entity returns involved, and workpapers and schedules reconciling the amount deducted on the return with the amounts per the books (Schedule M-1). This should include year end accruals.  4. 5. 6.  Large repair and maintenance costs should be reviewed to determine if they are in the nature of a capital improvement. If the lease payments are to a related party, then IRC section 267 or IRC section 482 may apply. Generally, under IRC section 267, related entities are required to use the same method of 8-8   accounting so that there is no mismatching of income and expense between the two parties. To clearly reflect income and prevent the evasion of taxes, IRC section 482 enables examiners to re-allocate income and expense among entities when the transactions are not at arms length. With respect to IRC section 467, the first step is to determine if you have an IRC section 467 rental agreement. The second step is to determine whether the constant rental method or the economic accrual method applies. The third step is to determine whether the constant rental method or the economic accrual method provisions were properly applied by the sports franchise. Because the application of IRC section 467 involves the timing of the sports franchise's lease expenses, IRC section 467 issues constitute a change in the sports franchise's method of accounting for leases. Accordingly, examiners need to follow the change in method of accounting issue procedures in raising an IRC section 467 issue.  8-9   This page intentionally left blank.   Chapter 9 AMORTIZATION  OVERVIEW Amortization issues are likely to have more examination potential for sports franchises than for most other categories of taxpayers. There are two reasons for this. The first is the significance of player contracts to a sports franchise. Player contracts are likely to represent the most significant asset category of a sports franchise. Because player contracts are amortized over the useful lives of the individual player contracts, which typically range from 3 to 6 years, this is likely to represent the greatest expense category of the sports franchise. With respect to player contracts not acquired in connection with the acquisition of the sports franchise, issues arise on the tax treatment of player signing bonuses, performance bonuses, and other contract contingencies. In addition to determining the amount subject to amortization, issues arise in the determination of the useful lives of the individual player contracts and the dates the contracts are placed in service. The second reason amortization has greater audit potential for most sports franchises than taxpayers in other market segments is the fact that IRC section 197(e)(6) provides that if a franchise is engaged in professional sports, any item acquired in connection with such a franchise is excluded from IRC section 197 amortization. Because a sports franchise does not have a determinable useful life, the franchise intangible asset is not eligible for amortization under IRC section 197. Issues exist on whether items treated as separate intangible assets are, instead, part of the franchise intangible asset. For items determined to be separate from the franchise intangible asset, the question then becomes whether the intangible asset has an ascertainable value and a determinable useful life. Although the government has not always been successful in arguing that an intangible asset does not have an ascertainable value separate from goodwill, going concern value, and the franchise intangible asset, the government has been successful in arguing most separate intangible assets do not have determinable useful lives. For example, as addressed in this chapter, the government has successfully established in court that broadcasting rights are not subject to amortization because they do not have determinable useful lives. The following summarizes the likely intangible asset categories of a sports franchise and their general amortization periods:  9-1   Intangible Asset Category Organizational expenses  General Amortization Period Amortized over 60 months if an IRC section 248 or 709 election is made Amortized over the useful lives of the specific player contracts (which average between 3 to 6 years) No amortization, not an IRC section 197 intangible, has an indefinite useful life Not an IRC section 197 intangible, only eligible for amortization if it has: (1) an ascertainable value separate from goodwill, going concern value, and the franchise intangible asset, and (2) has a determinable useful life; this usually results in not being amortizable Amortized over 60 months if IRC section 195 is elected Amortized over the life of the lease or loan  Player contracts  The franchise  Other intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of the sports franchise  Start-up expenses  Lease and loan costs  PLAYER CONTRACTS AUDIT ISSUES 1. Whether the cost basis of player contracts not acquired in the acquisition of the sports franchise have been properly computed. Whether the useful lives used for the individual player contracts are proper.  2.  Tax Law Application A player contract is an intangible asset to the sports franchise. Player contracts are likely to represent the most significant costs incurred in the operation of a sports franchise. A player contract is a contract for the services of an athlete employed by the sports franchise. A player contract is likely to obligate the player to: (1) play the sport solely for the sports franchise, 9-2   (2) not participate in certain other sports, (3) attend team practices, meetings, and perhaps promotional events, and (4) keep himself in top physical condition. Player signing bonuses have become common. Some player contracts may contain performance bonuses. More than the specified period of the player contract, most player contracts contain renewal and team option provisions which extend the useful life of the contract. The provisions of IRC section 461 are applied in determining a sports franchise's cost basis for player contract amortization. Under Treas. Reg. section 1.446-1(c)(1)(ii)(A), a liability is incurred, and generally is taken into account for federal income tax purposes in the taxable year in which all events have occurred that establish the fact of the liability, and the amount of the liability can be determined with reasonable accuracy. Under IRC section 461(h)(2)(A), economic performance for services provided to a taxpayer occurs as the services are provided. The cost of a player contract to a sports franchise is the total amount incurred by the sports franchise on the player contract under IRC section 461. Signing bonuses are included in the cost of the player contract. Performance bonuses and other contingent payments are not taken into account until the sports franchise's obligation to pay becomes certain. While the contractual terms of player contracts vary with contract will provide employment for more than one year for one year, the employer usually has a unilateral option or more at a specified percentage of the player's previous the type of sport involved, the typical . Even when the player contract is just to renew the contract an additional year salary.  Generally, an accrual basis taxpayer is entitled to deduct unpaid expenses for the taxable year in which all the events have occurred which determine the fact of liability and in which the amount can be determined with reasonable accuracy. Under this general rule, accrued salaries would ordinarily be deductible expenses for the taxable year in which the salaries are earned by the employees, even if paid in the following taxable year. Any expenditure, however, that results in the acquisition of an asset having a useful life which extends beyond the close of the taxable year may not be deductible for the taxable year in which the liability for the expenditure was incurred. Treas. Reg. section 1.263(a)-2. The cost of a player contract having a useful life of more than a year must be capitalized and amortized over the useful life of the contract. The sports franchise's player contracts are amortized under IRC section 167. Amortization is computed on each individual player contract based on the useful life of the individual player contract. Treas. Reg. section 1.167(a)-1(b) provides the estimated useful life of an asset is the period over which it may reasonably be expected to be useful to the taxpayer. In general, the period over which the cost of a player contract is amortizable includes periods in which the club controls the player through options to renew the contract or restrictions on the ability of the player to contract with other clubs. In Rev. Rul. 67-379, 1967-2 C.B. 127, the 9-3   Service ruled that due to reserve clauses, a player contract often has a useful life extending beyond the taxable year in which the contract was acquired. The Service ruled the same for option clauses or any other clause which gives the sport franchise the opportunity to unilaterally extend the existing contract. Although the useful life varies from sport to sport and player to player, the sports franchise's player contracts typically have useful lives averaging from 3 to 6 years. The placed-in-service date of the player's signing bonus is the date all required signatures are affixed to the contract. Accordingly, a sports franchise begins claiming amortization on the player contract, including the signing bonus, when the necessary signatures are affixed to the player contract. General guidance on the amortization of the sports franchise's player contracts can be found in: 1. 2. 3. Rev. Rul. 67-379, 1967-2 C.B. 127, Rev. Rul. 70-318, 1970-1 C.B. 113, and Rul. Rul. 71-137, 1971-1 C.B. 104.  In amortizing player contracts, care must be taken to distinguish payments made to third parties to acquire a player contract, as opposed to payments made to a player pursuant to the underlying contract. Payments made to acquire a player contract are to be amortized over the life of the contract. Payments made to a player pursuant to the contract may constitute straight salary which is deducted as economic performance occurs. On the other hand, such payments may constitute disguised payments for other contract rights (for example, options to extend the contract, exclusivity agreements extending beyond the ""salary"" payment period, etc.). In such cases, the ostensible salary payments should be divided into two portions; amounts allocable to services and amounts allocable to other contract rights. Amounts allocated to payments for services should be deducted as economic performance occurs. Amounts allocated to other contract rights should be amortized over the life of the contract. EXAMPLE -- PLAYER CONTRACT AMORTIZATION BCD sports franchise, a calendar year taxpayer, and STAR athlete agree to a player contract for STAR. The player contract is signed by all parties on July 1, 1994. The player contract is for 3 years from the signing date and includes 2 renewal periods. BCD sports franchise has the option to extend STAR's contract to a fourth and fifth year. Under the contract, STAR can request salary renegotiation at the end of the third year. If STAR chooses salary renegotiation, and STAR and the BCD sports franchise do not agree on the renegotiated contract terms, then BCD sports franchise has the right to sell or trade STAR's player contract to another sports franchise in the league.  9-4   Under the player contract, STAR receives a $200,000 signing bonus. STAR's base salary (payable monthly) is $150,000 the first year, $120,000 the second year, and $150,000 for the third year, and each season runs from July 1 to June 30. The base salary for the fourth and fifth years (renewal option years) is $150,000 each year. The examiner makes a factual determination that $50,000 of the first year's ""salary"" is actually a disguised payment for the option to extend the contract for the fourth and fifth years. The contract also provides for both team and player performance bonuses. In any season in which the sports franchise's team meets a specified team goal, STAR is paid a team performance bonus. In any season in which the team plays in the league conference championship game, STAR receives a $30,000 team performance bonus. In any season in which the team wins the league's championship game, STAR is paid an additional team bonus of $50,000. In any season in which STAR is named to the league's all star team, STAR receives a $20,000 performance bonus. In any season in which STAR is voted the league's most valuable player, STAR is to receive an additional $50,000 player performance bonus. In year two, STAR made the league's all star team ($20,000 player performance bonus). In year three, the sports franchise made it to the league's championship game ($30,000 team performance bonus). The useful life of the player contract is 5 years (the 3 year contract period plus the two 1year renewal option years). Amortization begins on July 1, 1994, the date all parties signed the player contract. The amortized player contract tax basis does not include performance bonuses since these are contingencies. Accordingly, the amortized tax basis in the player contract consists of the $200,000 player signing bonus and the $50,000 disguised first year payment for options. BCD's amortized tax basis in the STAR player contract is computed as follows: $200,000 $ 50,000 $250,000 Player Signing Bonus Disguised First Year Payment for Options Amount to be Amortized  9-5   BCD's yearly amortization on its STAR player contract is: First Tax Year Second Tax Year Third Tax Year Fourth Tax Year Fifth Tax Year Total Amortization $ $ $ $ $ 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 000 000 000 000 000  $250,000  Additionally, salary amounts are to be deducted as economic performance occurs. Because ratable amortization is allowed as STAR furnishes the services to the BCD sports franchise, economic performance occurs under the provisions of IRC section 461(h) as the ratable amortization is allowed. BCD is also entitled to additional deductions for the second year player performance bonus ($20,000) and the third year team performance player bonus ($30,000). The tax year in which BCD deducts these bonuses is the year in which these are allowed under BCD's overall method of accounting (which is usually the cash method or the accrual method of accounting). EXAMINATION TECHNIQUES Documents and information that should be obtained in developing sports franchise player contract amortization issues include: 1. For the prior, current, and subsequent tax years: a. the sports franchise's schedules and workpapers reflecting: 1) the player contracts owned by the sports franchise, 2) the sports franchise's tax basis in each player contract, and 3) the useful life used by the sports franchise for each player contract. b. to the extent not included in ""a,"" copies of the schedules and workpapers used to compute player contract amortization. This should include any schedules and workpapers necessary to reconcile this with the total player contract amortization amount reflected on return Form 4562.  2.  Depending on the number of player contracts owned by the sports franchise, copies of all or a sampling of the player contracts. 9-6   To reduce taxpayer burden and sharpen your examination focus, you may want to address the sports franchise's player contract business practices before deciding which player contract to request. For sports franchises with a large number of player contracts, you should consider conducting a skewed sampling of player contracts based on their likely issue potential. For example, consider first focusing on: 1. the sports franchise's marque player contracts (likely to be higher dollar contract amounts and more likely to have bonuses, options, and contingencies), player contracts that have certain characteristics (such as bonus provisions, options, or contingencies), and player contracts with short useful lives.  2.  3.  A common examination technique many examiners use for taxpayers claiming significant amounts of depreciation or amortization is to analyze the taxpayer's prior and subsequent years' depreciation and amortization schedules. Due to the significance of player contract amortization, this is likely to be a good examination technique for most sport franchise examinations. Check to ensure the cost basis and useful lives used are consistent from year to year. Player contracts on the prior or current year's schedule that are omitted from the current or subsequent year's schedule should be reconciled to the sports franchise's player contract gain and loss return schedules. The following player contract issues constitute a change in the sports franchise's method of accounting for player contracts: 1. a change from expensing to capitalizing all player contracts or categories of player contracts, and a change in the sports franchise's method or policies in determining its tax basis in player contracts under IRC section 461.  2.  The IRC section 481(a) and IRC section 446 change in accounting method adjustment computation procedures (versus the allowed or allowable depreciation rule) apply to player contract change in method of accounting issues. Because the change is a change in the useful life under IRC section 167 versus a change in recovery period under IRC section 168, a change in the useful lives of individual player contracts is not a change in the method of accounting. Accordingly, the allowed or allowable depreciation rule applies to player contract useful life changes.  9-7   INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED IN THE ACQUISITION OF A SPORTS FRANCHISE Audit Issues 1. Whether in the acquisition of a sports franchise, the allocation of the purchase price among player contracts, the franchise, other intangible assets, and other assets is proper. This is addressed in Chapter 10. Whether intangible assets other than player contracts acquired in connection with the acquisition of a sports franchise have an ascertainable value and determinable useful life: A major issue area is broadcasting rights, which the government has successfully argued do not have a determinable useful life.  2.  Tax Law Application The franchise intangible assets and other intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of a sports franchise are specifically excluded from the definition of an IRC section 197 intangible. Accordingly, unlike most other taxpayers, a sports franchise is not entitled to 15 year amortization on the intangible assets acquired with the acquisition of the sports franchise. This includes goodwill, going concern value, the franchise intangible asset, and other intangible assets such as broadcasting rights. This means that pre-IRC section 197 law applies in determining whether the intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of sports franchises are eligible for amortization. To be subject to amortization, the sports franchise's intangible asset must have: (1) an ascertainable value separate and apart from goodwill, going concern value, and the franchise intangible asset, and (2) a determinable useful life. IRC section 197(f)(4)(A) uses the definition in IRC section 1253(b)(1) for the definition of a franchise under IRC section 197. IRC section 1253(b)(1) states ""the term 'franchise' includes an agreement which gives one of the parties to the agreement the right to distribute, sell, or provide goods, services, or facilities, within a specified area."" IRC section 197(e)(6) excludes from the definition of an IRC section 197 intangible, ""A franchise to engage in professional football, basketball, baseball, or other professional sport, and any item acquired in connection with such a franchise."" After stating the above IRC section 197(e)(6) statement, H.R. Rep. No. 103-213, 103rd Cong., 1st Sess. (1993), 1993-3 C.B. 560, states: ""Consequently, the cost of acquiring a professional sports franchise and related assets (including any goodwill, going concern value, or other section 197 intangibles) is to be allocated among the assets acquired as provided under present law (see, for example, section 1056 of the Code) and is to be taken into account under the provisions of 9-8   present law."" To be subject to amortization, the intangible asset must have: (1) an ascertainable value separate and apart from goodwill and going concern value, and (2) a determinable useful life. Because the franchise intangible asset acquired with the acquisition of a sports franchise has an indefinite useful life, it is not subject to amortization. Player contracts acquired in the acquisition of a sports franchise do have an ascertainable value separate and apart from goodwill, going concern value, and the franchise intangible asset. Player contracts also have determinable useful lives. Therefore, the non-IRC section 197 intangible issue centers on whether intangible assets other than the franchise intangible asset and player contracts acquired in connection with the acquisition of a sports franchise have: (1) an ascertainable value separate and apart from goodwill, going concern value, and the franchise intangible asset, and (2) have a determinable useful life. This is addressed further by covering the tax treatment given to broadcasting rights. Broadcasting Rights One of the intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of a sports franchise is the right to share in the income from national broadcasting rights along with the other sports franchises in the league. The national broadcasting contracts are between the commissioner of the respective league, on behalf of the league's sports franchises, and the networks. A sports franchise in a particular league confers a right to receive a pro rata share of this revenue as long as the sports franchise is a member of the league. National broadcasting rights acquired with the acquisition of a sports franchise are not subject to amortization under IRC section 197. Thus, to be depreciable or amortizable as a ""wasting asset,"" intangible property must have (1) an ascertainable value separate from goodwill, and (2) a limited useful life ascertainable with reasonable accuracy. See Newark Morning Ledger Co. v. United States, 507 U.S. 546, 113 S. Ct. 1670 (1993). The burden of proving that an intangible asset has these characteristics is on the taxpayer. In Laird v. United States, 556 F.2d 1224 (5th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1014 (1978), one of the issues addressed by the Fifth Circuit was whether amortization was allowable on the national broadcast intangible asset acquired on the taxpayer's acquisition of a National Football League (NFL) sports franchise. The Commissioner of the NFL had executed a 4-year contract on behalf of the league's sports franchises with the CBS Television Network under which CBS received the right to televise the NFL's games. The NFL sports franchises ratably shared the revenue generated under the national broadcasting contract.  9-9   The taxpayer argued the broadcast intangible asset was a wasting asset, and therefore amortizable, because it had a proven value (present value of the guaranteed future income under the contract) and a limited useful life (the 4-year term of the contract). Although the Court rejected the government's argument that the broadcasting rights did not have an ascertainable value separate from goodwill, going concern value, and the sports franchise intangible asset, it noted the television rights were to continue as long as the sports franchise remained a member of the NFL. The court adopted the government's ""link in a perpetual chain"" analogy and stated: ""As the government correctly points out, the rights under the CBS contract were only a 'four year link' in a 'perpetual chain' of television income. Though the existing contract provided a measure of [the purchaser's] television rights over a particular four year period, nevertheless the rights were to continue indefinitely. *** Because the rights pursuant to the CBS contract were only a link in a chain of revenue which would continue as long as the Atlanta Club chain holds an NFL franchise, they did not constitute a wasting asset."" The tax court reached the same conclusion, in First Northwest Industries v. Commissioner, 70 T.C. 817 (1978), rev'd on other grounds, 649 F.2d 707 (9th Cir. 1981). This case involved the purchase of a National Basketball Association (NBA) sports franchise. Included among the rights acquired in the purchase was the right to an equal share of all revenues from national broadcasting of NBA games. In response to the claim that the current broadcasting contract was a wasting asset, the Tax Court held the contract was not amortizable because it merely represented a ""link in a continuing chain of national television income"" which would continue as long as the sports franchise remained a member of the NBA. The Sixth Circuit also reached this conclusion in McCarthy v. United States, 807 F.2d 1306 (6th Cir. 1986). This case involved the purchase of a Major League Baseball (MLB) sports franchise. Included among the inherent rights acquired in the purchase of the sports franchise was the right to broadcast the sports franchise's games. The three broadcasting contracts at the time of purchase were: (1) a network contract among the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) and the Commissioner of MLB, (2) a local television broadcasting contract with the sports franchise, and (3) a local radio broadcasting contract with the sports franchise. In deciding the broadcast intangible assets were not amortizable because they did not have limited useful lives, the Sixth Circuit stated ""the current broadcasting contracts likewise are merely links in a perpetual chain of broadcasting revenues"" which the sports franchise will have the rights to as long as it remains in the MLB. Although the government has not yet been successful in arguing that a broadcasting right intangible asset is not separable from goodwill, going concern value, and the franchise intangible asset, the government has been successful in arguing the broadcasting rights acquired on the acquisition of a sports franchise do not have a determinable useful life. Accordingly, like the 9-10   franchise intangible asset, broadcasting rights are not subject to amortization.  ORGANIZATIONAL EXPENDITURES AND START-UP EXPENSES Audit Issues 1. Whether expenses treated as organizational expenses and start-up expenses are qualifying expenditures under IRC sections 248, 709, and 195. More specifically, whether expenses directly connected with the acquisition of a sports franchise are improperly amortized under these IRC sections. Whether organizational expenses and start-up costs are improperly characterized by the sports franchise as current period deductions.  2.  Tax Law Application IRC section 248 for corporations and IRC section 709 for partnerships prescribe that organizational expenditures be treated as deferred expenses amortizable over a period of not less than 60 months. Both sections define ""organizational expenditures"" as any expenditure which: 1. 2. 3. is incident to the creation of the corporation or partnership, is chargeable to a capital account, and is of a character which, if expended incident to the creation of a corporation or partnership having a limited life, would be amortizable over such life.  Costs of issuing stock in a corporation, syndication fees in the case of a partnership, and expenditures connected with the transfer of assets are examples of costs that are not organizational expenditures. Under IRC section 195, start up costs are defined as any amount paid or incurred in connection with investigating the creation or acquisition of an active trade or business, creating an active trade or business, or any activity engaged in for profit or production of income before the day on which the activity begins, and which, if paid or incurred in connection with the operation of an existing active trade or business, would be allowable as a deduction for the tax year in which it was paid or incurred. Start up costs are amortizable over a period of not less than 60 months. Potential Emerging Issue For Start-up Expenses For a league expansion sports franchise there may be a potential emerging issue of whether amortization of qualifying IRC section 195 start-up expenses begins when: 1. the sports franchise first solicits ticket subscriptions, 9-11   2. 3.  the league awards the sports franchise, or the sports franchise plays its first league game.  9-12   Chapter 10 PURCHASE AND SALE OF A SPORTS FRANCHISE  OVERVIEW This chapter furnishes general guidance on the tax issues associated with the purchase and sale of a sports franchise. Because the tax issues (including numerous asset acquisition elections) are often quite complex, the guidance given is not a substitute for examiner tax law research and analysis based on the specifics of the particular sports franchise acquired or sold. This chapter addresses the purchase and sale of an existing sports franchise. The acquisition of a league expansion franchise and league expansion revenue are addressed in Chapter 11. The sales and exchanges of player contracts not associated with the purchase, and sale of an entire sports franchise are addressed in Chapter 12. There are two unique aspects to the purchase/sale of a sports franchise from the purchase/sale of other types of businesses. The most significant distinction is the allocation and tax treatment with respect to player contracts. Special rules apply to the purchase/sale price allocations to a sports franchise's total amount of player contracts along with rules on the allocations among individual player contracts because: (1) this is likely to be the most significant asset category of the sports franchise, (2) the buyer and seller are required to make consistent allocations, and (3) the buyer and seller often have competing tax consequences on player contract allocations. This is an area warranting significant consideration during the examination of the purchaser or seller of a sports franchise. Another unique aspect on the purchase and sale of a sports franchise is that, unlike most all other categories of taxpayers, there are no IRC section 197 intangibles. As addressed in Chapter 9, to claim amortization, the buyer has to apply pre-IRC section 197 law to establish: (1) the intangible has an ascertainable value separate from goodwill, going concern value, and the franchise intangible asset, and (2) a determinable useful life. The inapplicability of IRC section 197 to the intangibles acquired on the purchase of a sports franchise, is likely to result in valuation and life studies on intangibles that are no longer relevant for most other categories of taxpayers. In addition, the inapplicability of IRC section 197 may impact the buyer's negotiating posture with the seller on the amounts allocated to intangible assets other than player contracts. The purchaser and seller of a sports franchise are required to use the same allocation of the purchase/sale price to the assets acquired/sold. This chapter addresses both the purchase and sale of a sports franchise. Whether you are initially assigned the purchaser's or the seller's return for examination, adequate issue consideration requires full consideration of the other party's 10-1   allocations and tax treatment. In addition, if a purchase/sale price allocation issue is raised during the examination of either the buyer or seller, then the issue is almost always a ""whipsaw"" issue requiring a related case pick-up or collateral examination request of the other party to the transaction. AUDIT ISSUES 1. Whether the buy/sell agreement allocations among the sport franchise's assets properly reflect the relative fair market values of the asset categories. Specific consideration of the IRC section 1056 player contract allocation provisions are warranted. Whether the residual allocation method of IRC section 1060 is properly applied in the buy/sell agreement allocations. Whether both the buyer and the seller used the buy/sell agreement allocations in their respective tax returns. Whether the buyer under examination properly computed its basis in the franchise assets acquired. Specific consideration of IRC section 1056 is warranted. Whether the seller under examination properly computed its gain on the sale of its sports franchise.  2.  3.  4.  5.  VALUATION OF THE SPORTS FRANCHISE As with other businesses, the valuation of a sports franchise generally involves professional studies of the sports franchise and the arms-length negotiations among the parties. Generally, the resulting purchase/sale price reflected in the executed buy/sell agreement constitutes the total fair market value of the sport franchise's assets for tax purposes. In arriving at the total fair market value of the sports franchise, the fair market values of individual asset categories are often addressed. The fair market values given in the studies to specific asset categories are relevant because they are likely to be the basis for, or at least influence, the buy/sell agreement allocations among asset categories. Like most business valuations, the valuation of a sports franchise is generally determined utilizing a combination of: 1. 2. 3. a valuation of the entire sports franchise, a valuation of the specific assets acquired, an analysis of historical and future income streams. 10-2   The market method of valuing the entire sports franchise is based on the premise that the value of an asset can be estimated by analyzing the publicly known and verifiable prices paid for similar assets or property. For many sports leagues, the market values of the sports franchises in the league have skyrocketed over the last decade. The potential resale value may have a greater impact on the resulting purchase/sale price than the valuation of specific assets or the estimated future revenue/costs of operating the sports franchise. A sports franchise includes the assets common to most other businesses, plus player contracts, exclusive territorial rights, sponsorship rights, and participation in shared league revenue such as national broadcasting revenue. The asset categories involved in the purchase/sale of a sports franchise are likely to include: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. cash equivalents season ticket advance payments/deposits various receivables long-term ticket subscriptions player contracts lease agreements fixed assets (perhaps including a stadium or sports arena) goodwill, going concern value, and the franchise intangible asset, and other non-IRC section 197 intangible assets.  In valuing individual asset categories and individual assets, the appraiser may rely on a combination of replacement value, market value, and the income method. Fair market value is generally used for valuing player contracts. The amounts allocated to player contracts are addressed later in this chapter. Allocations to intangible assets that the buyer asserts have an ascertainable value separate from goodwill, going concern value, and the franchise intangible asset may be a significant issue area. Amortization of a sports franchise's intangible assets is addressed in Chapter 9. In some cases, determination of the actual purchase/sale price in the buy/sell agreement may be complicated by contingencies. Contingent payments may be provided for contingencies involving future league expansion, stadium agreements, food and beverage concessions, and relocation of the sports franchise contingency provisions. These are just some of the contingencies that may be 10-3   included in a sports franchise buy/sell agreement. The cutoff date used in determining the valuation of the sports franchise can have relevant consequences for accrued and deferred items of revenue and expense. The cutoff date used can also significantly impact the valuation of benefits the sports franchise is entitled to such as season ticket revenues, sponsorship revenues, broadcasting rights, and expansion revenue. Accordingly, consideration should be given to time span accounting and valuation differences from the cutoff date used in valuation studies and the actual purchase/sale date in the buy/sell agreement. As with other businesses, the valuation of a sports franchise and its component assets often involves complex methodologies, approaches, and computations. A complete valuation of the entire sports franchise may be necessary for the best approach. Obtaining the formal assistance of an IRS engineer or economist may be necessary or advisable. THE RESIDUAL ALLOCATION METHOD As provided in IRC section 1060 and the regulations, both the buyer and seller in asset acquisitions are required to allocate the purchase/sale price in the buy/sell agreement among the component asset categories using the residual method. The residual method is set forth in Temp. Tres. Reg. section 1.1060-1T, 1997-12 I.R.B. 35 (March 24, 1997), which generally applies to asset acquisitions after February 14, 1997. Under Treas. Reg. section 1.1060-1T, assets are divided into five categories or ""classes."" They are: Class I assets (consisting of cash and cash equivalents, like bank accounts), Class II assets (liquid assets, like certificates of deposit, government securities, and readily marketable stock or securities), Class III assets (all assets other than Class I, II, IV, and V assets), Class IV assets (all IRC section 197 intangibles except intangibles in the nature of goodwill and going concern value), and Class V assets (intangibles in the nature of goodwill and going concern value). The purchase price is allocated first to the Class I assets (on a dollar for dollar basis), then to Class II assets to the extent of their fair market value, to the Class III assets to the extent of their fair market value, to the Class IV assets to the extent of their fair market value, and finally, any residual is allocated to the Class V assets. The differing tax treatment of the assets in each class, for example, the extent to which depreciation or amortization is available, provides an incentive to manipulate the valuation or character of the assets in order to affect the purchase price allocation. With regard to asset acquisitions made prior to February 14, 1997, Treas. Reg. 1.1060-1T provides that the previous regulations apply. The previous regulations provide that the assets are divided into four, rather than five, categories or ""classes."" Under this provision, Class III assets are all assets other than Class I, II, and IV assets. Class IV assets are intangible assets in the nature of goodwill and going concern value. There is no Class V asset category. These allocations are subject to other applicable limitations under the Code. For example, in the context of a sports franchise, the allocation provisions of IRC section 1056(a) for player contracts 10-4   have to be taken into account in applying the residual allocation method rules. Often high values are placed on player contracts, so that under the residual method as little as 10 percent is allocated to franchise rights. The Service has the authority to value the franchise rights to determine the reasonableness of the player contracts valuations. The mandatory use of the residual method does not restrict the Service's ability to challenge the taxpayer's determination of any asset's fair market value. Treas. Reg. section 1.1060-1T(e)(4) specifically provides: ""In connection with the examination of a return, the Internal Revenue Service may challenge the taxpayer's determination of the fair market value of any asset by any appropriate method and take into account all factors, including any lack of adverse tax interests between the parties. For example, in certain cases the Internal Revenue Service may make an independent showing of the value of goodwill and going concern value as a means of calling into question the validity of the taxpayer's valuation of other assets."" PLAYER CONTRACTS IRC section 1056, Basic limitation for player contracts transferred in connection with the sale of a franchise, reads as follows: (a) General Rule If a franchise conducting any sports enterprise is sold or exchanged, and if, in connection with such sale or exchange, there is a transfer of a contract for the services of an athlete, the basis of such contract in the hands of the transferee shall not exceed the sum of-- (1) the adjusted basis of such contract in the hands of the transferor immediately before the transfer, plus (2) the gain (if any) recognized by the transferor on the transfer of such contract. ******* Accordingly, under IRC section 1056 the purchaser's basis in a player contract is the seller's adjusted basis in the player contract plus the seller's recognized gain on the player contract. This provision is explained in S. Rep. No. 94-938, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 90 (1976), 1976-3 Vol. 3 C.B. 128, which reflects: ""The committee amendment provides that in the case of the sale or exchange of a sports franchise (or the creation of a new franchise) the amount of consideration 10-5   allocated to a player contract by the transferee shall not exceed the sum of the adjusted basis of the contract in the hands of the transferor immediately before the transfer and gain (if any) recognized by the transferor on the transfer of the player contract. In this way, the committee believes that a more appropriate allocation will be achieved since, to a substantial extent the buyer and seller will be adverse parties with respect to the allocation (i.e., to the extent that the amount of gain attributable to player contracts will be fully recaptured as ordinary income, the buyer and seller will be operating at arms-length with respect to the allocation)."" IRC section 1056(d), Presumption as to amount allowable to player contracts provides: ""In the case of any sale or exchange described in subsection (a), it shall be presumed that not more than 50 percent of the consideration is allocable to contracts for the services of athletes unless it is established to the satisfaction of the Secretary that a specified amount in excess of 50 percent is properly allocable to such contracts. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall give rise to a presumption that an allocation of less than 50 percent of the consideration to contracts for the services of athletes is a proper allocation."" The legislative history to IRC section 1056(d) indicates that Congress intended only to provide a rebuttal upper limit to the amount allocable to player contracts. H. R. Rep. No. 94-658, 94th Cong. 1st Sess. 117-118, 1976-3 Vol. 2 C.B. 809 - 810, reflects: ""The bill also provides that in the case of the sale or exchange of a sports franchise, it is presumed that not more than 50 percent of the consideration is allocable to player contracts unless the taxpayer can satisfy the Secretary of the Treasury that under the facts and circumstances of the particular case, it is proper to allocate an amount in excess of 50 percent. However, your committee's bill makes it clear that the presumption does not mean that an allocation of less than 50 percent of the consideration to player contracts is proper. The proper allocation is to depend upon the facts and circumstances of each particular case. Factors to be taken into account by the Secretary are to include the amount of gate receipts received by the past owner of the franchise (as well as the amount to be received in the future), the amount of radio and television receipts that were received by the past owner of the franchise (as well as the amount to be received in the future), etc. Your committee recognizes that there are differences among the various sports which are relevant to the proper allocation and, therefore intends that factors peculiar to each sport (and to each team) be taken into account."" Thus, the legislative history indicates that IRC section 1056(d) does not provide that 50 percent of the purchase price of a sports franchise should be allocated to IRC section 1056(d) merely provides a presumed upper limit on the amount allo contracts. The exact amount to be allocated depends on the particular facts and 10-6 a presumption player contracts. cable to player circumstances of   each case. See Laird v. United States, 556 F.2d 1224 (5th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1014 (1978). In First Northwest Industries v. Commissioner, 70 T.C. 817 (1978), rev'd on other grounds, 649 F.2d 707 (9th Cir. 1981), an opinion issued after the enactment of IRC section 1056 but dealing with taxable years before its effective date, the Tax Court rejected the Service's assertion that player contracts should be treated as a mass asset. In reaching this conclusion the Tax Court noted that IRC section 1056 also envisions an allocation among player contracts. IRC section be allocated on the other period that t 1056 provides a basis limitation as to the percent of the total purchase price that can to player contracts. The portion of the purchase price allocated to player contracts, hand, is further allocated to the individual players' contracts and amortized over the he club is expected to have control over each respective player.  With respect to the seller of a sports franchise, the player contract amalgamation rule of IRC section 1245(a)(4) applies. Under the player contract amalgamation rule, player contracts are treated as a consolidated asset (or mass or pooled asset) to the seller on the sale of a sports franchise. IRC section 1245(a)(4)(D) defines a player contract as ""any contract for the services of an athlete which, in the hands of the taxpayer, is of a character subject to the allowance for depreciation provided in section 167."" Under the player contract amalgamation rule, the seller's IRC section 1245 recapture is based on the IRC section 167 amortization claimed on all player contracts. If the total amount allocated to player contracts in the buy/sell agreement exceeds the seller's adjusted basis in all of its player contracts and also exceeds the total amortization previously claimed by the seller on its player contracts, then, to the extent gain is recognized, the seller has IRC section 1245 ordinary income equal to the amortization previously claimed. If, however, the amount allocated to player contracts in the buy/sell agreement is less than the seller's original cost basis in all its player contracts then the seller's IRC section 1245 recapture is limited to the gain recognized. As addressed earlier, the buyer's basis in the player contracts under IRC section 1056 is the seller's adjusted basis in the player contracts plus the gain reported by the seller on the player contracts. Whether the seller's gain on the player contract is an IRC section 1231 gain or IRC section 1245 ordinary gain has no impact on the buyer's basis. Both an IRC section 1231 gain and an IRC section 1245 ordinary gain increase the buyer's basis by an equal amount. Extract IRC section 1056(c) (c) Transferor required to furnish certain information. Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, the transfer[or] shall, at the time and in the manner provided in such regulations, furnish to the Secretary and the transferee the 10-7   following information: (1) the amount which the transferor believes to be the adjusted basis referred to in paragraph (1) of subsection (a), (2) the amount which the transferor believes to be the gain referred to in paragraph (2) of subsection (a), and (3) any subsequent modification of either such amount. To the extent provided in such regulations, the amounts furnished pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be binding on the transferor and the transferee. The Treasury has not promulgated regulations under IRC section 1056.  TAX PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS In addition to the usual tax planning considerations given to buy/sell agreements on the purchase/sale of the assets of a trade or business, in the context of sports franchises, additional tax planning considerations involve the amounts allocated to player contracts and other intangible assets. Generally relevant to both the buyer and the seller is the amount allocated in the buy/sell agreement to player contracts. The amount allocated in the buy/sell agreement to player contracts determines the seller's gain on the player contracts and the buyer's basis in the player contracts. Due to IRC section 1245 recapture, the amounts allocated to player contracts is likely to increase the amount of the seller's ordinary gain versus IRC section 1231 gain on the sale. Accordingly, the seller may have a tax incentive to minimize the purchase/sale price allocation to player contracts. Because player contracts lead to amortization (with useful lives of player contracts averaging 3 to 6 years), buyers have a tax incentive to maximize the amount allocated to player contracts. Unlike most other categories of taxpayers, the intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of a sports franchise are not IRC section 197 intangibles, the amounts the buyer wants allocated to intangible assets may be subjected to tax planning. Because they are not amortizable, the buyer has a tax incentive to minimize the amounts allocated to goodwill, going concern value, and the franchise intangible asset. Buyers taking aggressive tax positions, may negotiate for buy/sell agreement allocations to what they believe are intangible assets with short useful lives (such as 3 to 4 years). An example of this is broadcasting rights which are addressed in Chapter 9. Clearly, a 3 to 4 year amortization period beats the 15 year amortization period under IRC section 197 that is mandated for buyers of most other categories of businesses. This creates tax planning opportunities on the acquisition of 10-8   a sports franchise. ECONOMIC REALITY, STRONG PROOF DOCTRINE, AND THE DANIELSON RULE As with the purchase/sale of other types of businesses, the Service is not bound by the buy/sell agreement allocations of the purchase/sale amount to the component assets in the purchase/sale of a sport franchise. Upon examination, the Service can re-allocate the purchase/sale amount to reflect the economic reality of the transaction and the relative fair market value of asset components. In this regard, substance versus form is controlling for tax purposes. In First Northwest Industries v. Commissioner, 70 T.C. 817, 843 (1978), rev'd on other grounds, 649 F.2d 707 (9th Cir. 1981) the Tax Court found the IRS was not bound by the allocation of costs by the NBA and the expansion team. Although there is no bar on the Service to challenge the buy/sell agreement allocations, taxpayers (either the buyer, the seller, or both) have significant hurdles to overcome if they attempt to disregard the buy/sell agreement allocations for tax purposes. As noted earlier, IRC section 1060(a) provides that the allocation of the purchase/sale amount among component assets in the buy/sell agreement ""shall be binding on both the transferor and the transferee unless the Secretary determines that such allocation (or fair market value) is not appropriate."" In addition, IRC section 1056(a) provides that the adjusted basis and gain amounts on player contracts the seller furnishes to the buyer, as required by IRC section 1056(c) ""shall be binding on the transferor and on the transferee."" Under general case law, allocations in a written buy/sell agreement are usually binding upon the parties to the agreement. Where the parties clearly and unequivocally allocated amounts to asset components, the courts have refused to allow one of the parties subsequently to alter the tax consequences of the expressed amount unless he/she can overcome the contract terms by strong proof that the agreement does not reflect the parties' true intentions. This is known as the strong proof doctrine. Major v. Commissioner, 76 T.C. 239 (1981); Sonnleitner v. Commissioner, 598 F.2d 464 (5th Cir. 1979). The Service and some appellate courts, relying on Commissioner v. Danielson, 389 U.S. 858 (1967), require an even stronger degree of proof before one party will be permitted to alter the allocation for tax purposes. Under the Danielson rule, a party may contradict an unambiguous contractual term, for tax purposes, only by offering proof which would be admissible in an action between the parties to alter that construction or to show its unenforceability because of mistake, undue influence, fraud, or duress. Although the Tax Court has rejected the Danielson rule, preferring the less stringent strong proof rule, under the rule given in Golsen v. Commissioner, 54 T.C. 742 (1970), aff'd, 445 F.2d 985 (10th Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 940 (1971), the Tax Court will follow a United States 10-9   Court of Appeals opinion which is squarely on point where appeal of the Tax Court decision would lie in that circuit. The Danielson rule has been adopted by the Third, Fifth, Sixth, and Eleventh Circuits. See Danielson; Spector v. Commissioner, 641 F.2d 376 (5th Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 868 (1981); Schatten v. United States, 746 F.2d 319 (6th Cir. 1984); and Bradley v. United States, 730 F.2d 718 (11th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 882 (1984). In addition, H.R. Rep. No. 101-964, 101 st Cong., 2nd Sess. (1990), reflects that taxpayers are bound by their IRC 1060 asset acquisition allocations unless they are able to refute the allocation or valuation under the standard set forth in Danielson. EXAMINATION TECHNIQUES The examiner should determine in the early stage of the examination whether valuation assistance from an IRS engineer or economist is warranted. If so, submit Form 5202 to request the assistance of an IRS engineer or follow local procedures to request the assistance of an IRS economist. The national sports franchise ISP team, which is working with the engineering group in South Florida on sports franchise valuation issues, is another sports franchise valuation guidance resource. Documents and information that should be obtained in developing sports franchise purchase/sale issues include: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. the buy/sell agreement, all buyer and seller correspondence on the buy/sell negotiations, understandings, etc., all valuation studies conducted by or for either the buyer or seller, the sports franchise agreement, the required information previously furnished by the seller to the buyer and the Service in accordance with IRC section 1060(b), and IRC section 1056(c), and the regulations, and your taxpayer's tax return schedules and workpapers on the purchase/sale.  6.  Whether you are initially assigned the purchaser's or the seller's return for examination, adequate issue consideration requires full consideration of the other party's allocations and tax treatment. If the other party did not follow the buy/sell agreement component asset allocations, this may indicate the allocations have no economic substance or are not at fair market value. In addition, if a purchase/sale price allocation issue is in fact raised during the examination of either the buyer or seller, then the issue is almost always a ""whipsaw"" issue requiring a related case pick-up or collateral examination request of the other party to the transaction.  10-10   If you are assigned the buyer's return, obtain a copy of the seller's return, and if you are assigned the seller's return, obtain a copy of the buyer's return. First, check AIMS to see if the other party is under examination and verify the service center and district with which the other party files. If the other party is an out of district taxpayer, consider pursuing collateral examination procedures in the early stages of your examination. The IRC section 1056 player contract provisions and IRC section 1060 are based on an assumed adversity of tax interests among the buyer and the seller. To the extent this is not the case, the buy/sell agreement allocations may warrant additional consideration. Consider determining to what extent the buyer and seller have adverse tax interests in the various asset component allocations. Because the assumed tax adversity may not exist for the seller, this is especially the case if you are assigned the buyer's tax return. Factors impacting the seller's tax posture include the tax differential between the ordinary income tax rate and the capital gains tax rate and whether the seller has unused net operating losses or capital losses. Since a CCorporation's capital gains are taxed at the regular corporate tax rate, whether the seller is a CCorporation, S-Corporation, or a partnership can be relevant. Determine if the total amount allocated to player contracts in the buy/sell agreement reflects the fair market value of the sports franchise's player contracts. Consider whether the player contract terms, contract periods, and the athletes' fair market trade values on the buy/sell agreement date are in line with the amount allocated to player contracts. The buyer has a tax incentive to allocate more to player contracts with shorter useful lives than player contracts with longer useful lives. If you are assigned the buyer's tax return, consider the buyer's allocation of the total amount allocated to player contracts in the buy/sell agreement to the individual player contracts. Compare the seller's adjusted basis in the individual player contracts and the gains reported with the buyer's individual player contract purchase/sale price allocations. If you are assigned the seller's tax return and there is a tax consequence in whether gains are ordinary versus capital, verify the seller's IRC section 1245 recapture amount on the player contracts.  10-11   This page intentionally left blank.   Chapter 11 LEAGUE EXPANSION  OVERVIEW Over the last decade, many sports leagues have added new sports franchises to their leagues through league expansion. League expansion results in a significant payment by the expansion sports franchise ownership group to the league, which is then usually divided among the established sports franchises in the league. The expansion sports franchise grants the new franchisee the exclusive right to hold league games in a specified geographical area. Ancillary assets and rights are also transferred to the expansion sports franchise. As part of its sports franchise, the expansion sports franchise generally has an equal right to share in future league revenue. A major source of league revenue is revenue from national broadcasting rights and league sponsorship rights. In most instances, the expansion sports franchise obtains the same rights and obligations as the already established sports franchises in the league. This includes participation in league voting. An expansion draft is often included, in which the expansion sports franchise is able to obtain the rights to player contracts held by the established sports franchises in the league. In addition, league expansion often grants the new sports franchise additional draft picks in future player drafts. The two major asset categories transferred for tax purposes to the expansion sports franchise are: (1) the sports franchise intangible asset, and (2) the right to acquire player contracts from the established sports franchises in the sports league. Potential issues exist concerning whether additional intangible assets that are separable from the franchise intangible asset are also transferred from the league and the established sports franchises to the expansion sports franchise. There will typically be an expansion agreement between the league and the expansion sports franchise. As a general rule, both the expansion sports franchise and the established sports franchises are bound by the allocation of the expansion price among the asset components reflected in the expansion agreement. However, the Service is not bound by the expansion price allocation among the asset components reflected in the expansion agreement. In First Northwest Industries v. Commissioner, 70 T.C. 817, 843 (1978), rev'd on other grounds, 649 F.2d 707 (9th Cir. 1981) the Tax Court held the Service was not bound by the allocation of costs by the sports league and the expansion sports franchise.  11-1   Generally, what is addressed in Chapter 10 on the purchase and sale of a sports franchise also applies to new sports franchises created in a sports league expansion. Instead of reiterating what is addressed in Chapter 10, this chapter focuses on aspects unique to league expansion. AUDIT ISSUES 1. Whether the expansion agreement allocations among the assets transferred properly reflect the relative fair market values of the asset categories. Specific consideration of the IRC section 1056 player contract allocation provisions are warranted. Whether the residual allocation method of IRC section 1060 is properly applied in the expansion agreement allocations. Whether the existing sports franchises in the league and the expansion sports franchise used the expansion agreement purchase/sale price allocations in their respective tax returns. Whether the expansion sports franchise properly computed its basis in the assets acquired. Specific consideration of IRC section 1056 is warranted. Whether the established sports franchises properly computed their gains on the league expansion.  2.  3.  4.  5.  TAX LAW APPLICATION Established Sports Franchises Rev. Rul. 71-123, 1971-1 C.B. 227, addresses a professional football league expansion. The expansion agreement granting the new sports franchise provided that the expansion sports franchise was to pay a stated amount to the sports league. A portion of the payment was to be retained by the league, with the balance distributed among the league's established sports franchises. Under the expansion agreement, the new sports franchise made the payments in question as consideration for the assignment of three player contracts by each of the established sports franchises to the expansion sports franchise. The amount distributed to each of the established sports franchises exceeded the value of the three player contracts transferred. The Service concluded that the amount received by the established player contracts transferred to the expansion sports franchise were given in Rev. Rul. 67-380, 1967-2 C.B. 291. This resulted in IRC section 1245 ordinary income recapture to the established sports fr player contracts. sports franchises for their three taxed based on the guidance section 1231 gains and IRC anchises on the sale of their  11-2   The player contract amalgamation rule of IRC section 1245(a)(4), which is addressed in Chapter 10, does not apply in computing an existing sports franchise's IRC section 1245 gains on player contracts transferred to the expansion sports franchise. This is based on the legislative history behind IRC section 1245(a)(4), which indicates the player amalgamation rule only applies if a sports franchise, together with substantially all of its player contracts, is sold. S. Rep. No. 94-938, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 90 (1976), 1976-3 Vol. 3 C.B. 128, reflects ""The special recapture rules [IRC section 1245(a)(4)] would only apply in the case of the sale or exchange of the entire sports franchise and not in the case of the sale or exchange of individual player contracts.""2 Footnote 2 reflects ""The sale of an individual player contract will continue to be governed by the general recapture rule of sec. 1245."" Refer to Chapter 12 for additional guidance on the sale of individual player contracts. In Rev. Rul, 71-123, the Service also concluded that the amounts received by the existing sports franchises in excess of the amounts allocable to player contracts was received by them for their franchise property right. The Service held ""the new franchise is a valuable property right that was created by the old teams *** the grant of the franchise was the sale of a capital asset by the old teams to the new team."" Therefore, the gain attributable to the franchise property rights was held to be capital gain under IRC section 1222. In Rev. Rul. 71-583, 1971-2 C.B. 312, the Service addressed a similar situation. In conjunction with the league's expansion, an expansion team was established in the same geographical area as an existing league franchise. Because of this, the existing franchise was awarded a greater share of the expansion payment from the new sports franchise. This was due to the existing franchise's relinquishment of part of its exclusive right to host games within its geographical area. The Service concluded that even though the existing sports franchise received more than the league's other franchises (due to its greater relinquishment of property rights), the Service's ruling in Rev. Rul. 71-123 applies. The Service held that ""the amount received by the instant taxpayer for the relinquishment of its exclusive territorial rights is an amount received for the sale of a capital asset and resulted in a capital gain to the extent of the amount received."" [underlining added.] ""To the extent of the amount received"" is significant in that it reflects the established sports franchise has no tax basis in the relinquishment of part of its exclusive territorial rights which is part of the franchise intangible asset. This reflects the Service's position that the established sports franchises do not have a determinable tax basis in the portion of their franchise property rights transferred in a league expansion. Since they do not have a determinable tax basis in the portion of their franchise property rights transferred to the new sports franchise, the full amount allocated to their franchise property rights constitutes capital gains to the established sports franchises.  11-3   However, in First Northwest Industries v. Commissioner, 649 F.2d 707 (9th Cir. 1981), remanding 70 T.C. 817, 843 (1978), the Tax Court rejected the government's argument that the taxpayer did not have a tax basis in the franchise property rights transferred to an expansion sports franchise. In its April 26, 1979 Action on Decision, the Service stated ""The court [Tax Court] erred in holding that an existing team may offset expansion proceeds by a ratable portion of its franchise acquisition costs."" Whether the taxpayer was entitled to claim a tax basis in the franchise property rights was appealed to the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit concluded: ""A portion of the remaining 'basic nonterminable rights' was transferred.9 The Tax Court made no attempt, however, to determine the cost of these rights. Only if their cost can be satisfactorily ascertained may taxpayer subtract its basis in the portion transferred.10 See United States v. Laird, 556 F.2d 1224 (5th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1014, 98 S.Ct. 729, 54 L. Ed. 2d 758 (1978) (permitting amortization of player contracts because they had ascertainable value and limited useful life); Ralph W. Fullerton Co. v. United States, 550 F.2d 548 (9th Cir. 1977) (refusing to permit loss deduction for lost accounts where cost of individual accounts could not be satisfactorily ascertained). All of the 'basic nonterminable rights' acquired by taxpayer derive value from the league's goodwill, and sale of new teams is a 'portioning out' of NBA goodwill. See Rev. Rul. 71-583. The critical question on remand will be whether there is sufficient evidence to allocate the $1,000,000 cost between those rights which were and those which were not transferred. Recognizing that they all are related to goodwill does not resolve the question. On remand, the Tax Court will determine whether there is sufficient evidence to ascertain the cost of the rights which were transferred. If there is, taxpayer may subtract its basis."" Footnote number 9 reflects the rights in question, to ""include the right to share in national broadcasting revenues, all-star and playoff game proceeds, expansion proceeds, and proceeds of NBA promotional and advertising activities."" As addressed above in Rev. Rul. 71-123 and Rev. Rul. 71-583, the Service's position remains that the franchise property rights transferred in a league expansion (1) do not have an ascertainable value separate from the retained franchise property rights, and (2) do not have a determinable useful life.  Expansion Sports Franchises 11-4   The same general tax provisions that apply to the purchase of an existing sports franchise also apply to the purchase of an expansion sports franchise. Refer to Chapter 10 for additional guidance on the tax treatment given to the acquisition of a sports franchise through league expansion. It has been asserted that IRC section 1056 does not apply to the creation of a new sports franchise via league expansion, because it does not constitute the sale or exchange of an existing sports franchise. The government's position is that IRC section 1056 applies to the creation of a new sports franchise as part of a league expansion. The above coverage of Rev. Rul. 71-123 and 71-583 reflects how the Service treats the creation of a new sports franchise in a league expansion as the sale or exchange of player contracts and relinquishment of part of each of the established teams' franchise property rights. In addition, S. Rep. No. 94-938, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 90 (1976), 1976-3 C. B. 128, in addressing IRC section 1056 specifically states: "" The committee amendment provides that in the case of the sale or exchange of a sports franchise (or the creation of a new franchise) the amount of consideration allocated to a player contract by the transferee shall not exceed the sum of the adjusted basis of the contract in the hands of the transferor immediately before the transfer and gain (if any recognized by the transferor on the transfer of the player contract. [underlining added]"" Accordingly, just as the provisions of IRC section 1056 apply to the purchase/sale of an existing sports franchise, the provisions of IRC section 1056 also apply to the creation of a new sports franchise via league expansion. The IRC section 1056 provisions are addressed in detail in Chapter 10. EXAMPLE -- LEAGUE EXPANSION The successful sports league decides to expand by one sports franchise. The expansion sports franchise purchase/sale price is established to be $100 million. In addition to the numerous sports franchise property rights transferred on the awarding of the expansion franchise, the expansion franchise is entitled to acquire 3 player contracts from each of the 10 established sports franchises in the Successful sports league. A Successful sports league committee is to negotiate with the expansion sports franchise's representatives on the fair market value of each of 30 player contracts to be transferred to the expansion sports franchise.  11-5   Each of the 10 established sports franchises is to receive an amount equal to the agreed on fair market value of its 3 player contracts transferred to the expansion franchise. Since the total fair market value of all 30 player contracts is anticipated to be substantially less than $100 million, the expansion agreement provides that the balance of the $100 million ($100 million less the agreed on fair market value of the 30 player contracts transferred) is to be distributed equally among the ten established sports franchises. The expansion agreement provides that $10 million of the balance of the $100 million not allocated to player contracts is allocated to XYZ intangible asset. The remaining balance of the $100 million is to then be allocated to the sports franchise property right. The sports league committee and expansion sports franchise subsequently agree that the fair market value of the 30 player contracts transferred to the expansion sports franchise is $50 million. Accordingly, under the expansion agreement: --$50 million is allocated to player contracts, --$10 million is allocated to the XYZ intangible, and --$40 million is allocated to the sports franchise property rights. ABC, one of the 10 established Successful sports league franchises, had its 3 player contracts transferred to the expansion sports franchise valued under the agreement at $6 million ($6 million of the total $50 million fair market value of the 30 player contracts is attributable to ABC's 3 player contracts). Accordingly, under the expansion agreement, ABC received $6 million for its player contracts, $1 million (1/10 of $10 million) for its share of the XYZ intangible, and $4 million (1/10 of $40 million) for its sports franchise property rights. ABC's tax consequences include a likely $1 million capital gain on the XYZ intangible and a $4 million capital gain on the franchise property rights. If ABC claimed a tax basis in either the XYZ intangible or its franchise property rights, then this would appear to be an examination issue. Because the player amalgamation rule of IRC section 1245(a)(4) does not apply, the computation of ABC's IRC section 1245 recapture gains on the 3 player contracts is computed individually for each player contract. The following summarizes for each of ABC's 3 player contracts (1) the sales price (fair market value) under the expansion agreement, (2) ABC's adjusted basis, (3) ABC's total gain, and (4) ABC's prior player contract amortization.  11-6   Fair Market Value  ABC's Adjusted Basis  ABC's Gain  ABC's Prior Year Amortization  Strong Player Contract Fast Player Contract Big Player Contract Totals  $3 M $2 M $1 M $6 M  $1 M $1 M $1 M $3 M  $2 M $1 M 0 $3 M  $1 M $2 M $1 M $4 M  $1 million of ABC's Strong Player Contract gain of $2 million is IRC section 1245 recapture income, and the $1 million balance is an IRC section 1231 gain. ABC's Fast Player Contract gain of $1 million is all IRC section 1245 recapture income. ABC has no gain on its Big player contract. Accordingly, ABC's player contract gains are summarized as follows: IRC Sec. 1245 Recapture Strong Player Contract Fast Player Contract Big Player Contract Totals $1 M $1 M 0 $2 M IRC Sec. 1231 Gain $1 M 0 0 $1 M ABC's Total Gain $2 M $1 M 0 $3 M  If the player contract amalgamation rule was improperly used, the entire $3 million gain on player contracts would all be IRC section 1245 recapture income since the prior year amortization on all 3 player contracts exceeded the $3 million total gain. Under IRC section 1056, the new sports franchise's tax basis in the 3 player contracts acquired from ABC is $6 million. This consists of ABC's adjusted basis in the 3 contracts of $3 million plus ABC's gain on the 3 player contracts of $3 million. Based on the expansion agreement and the application of IRC section 1056, the expansion sports franchise's tax basis is: Player Contracts $ XX million (see comment below) The XYZ intangible asset $ 10 million The franchise intangible asset $ 40 million Total Basis $ 50 million plus $ XX million The expansion sports franchise's tax basis includes its player contract basis amount of $6 11-7   million from ABC's 3 player contracts plus its player contract basis amounts (under IRC section 1056) from each of the 9 other established sports franchises in the Successful sports league. The IRC section 1056 basis amount in the 3 contracts transferred from ABC equal the fair market value assigned to ABC's player contracts because ABC reported (recognized) the realized gain on each of its 3 player contracts. This is not necessarily the case for the player contracts received from the 9 other established sports franchises. This will not be the case to the extent that the other established sports franchises have a tax loss, or realized but unrecognized gains on any of their player contracts transferred to the expansion sports franchise. If the expansion sports franchise claims amortization on the XYZ intangible, this would appear to be an examination issue. EXAMINATION TECHNIQUES Documents and information that should be obtained in developing sports league expansion purchase/sale issues include: 1. 2. the expansion agreement, all league and expansion sports franchise correspondence on the expansion agreement negotiations, understandings, etc., all valuation studies conducted, the expansion sports franchise agreement, the required information previously furnished by the established league sports franchises to the expansion sports franchise and the Service in accordance with IRC section 1060(b), and IRC section 1056(c) and the regulations, and your taxpayer's tax return schedules and workpapers on the league expansion purchase/sale.  3. 4. 5.  6.  Refer to Chapter 10 for coverage of examination techniques common to both a purchase/sale of an existing sports franchise and the purchase/sale of an expansion sports franchise. As noted in Chapter 10, examination changes to the purchase/sale agreement are usually ""whipsaw"" adjustments that have tax consequences to both parties in the purchase/sale of an established sports franchise. The ""whipsaw"" issue tax consequences of a reallocation in a sports league expansion agreement can be significant.  11-8   For example, consider the NFL which had 28 sports franchises prior to its expansion in 1993. An examination issue on one of the NFL's 31 sports franchises, in which the expansion agreement allocation is changed, has ""whipsaw"" issue potential for the other 30 teams in the sports league. Accordingly, the national ISP sports team is considering a requirement that before a sports franchise league expansion agreement allocation is challenged during an examination, the examiner must first coordinate the potential reallocation issue with the ISP sports team.  11-9   This page intentionally left blank.   Chapter 12 SALES AND EXCHANGES OF INDIVIDUAL PLAYER CONTRACTS  INDUSTRY PRACTICE Occasionally, a sports franchise will sell a player contract. However, more frequently, a sports franchise will trade one or more player contracts for player contracts owned by another sports franchise in the league. Future draft picks are often included in these trades. The special provisions under IRC section 1245(a)(4) and IRC section 1056 for the transfer of player contracts on the purchase/sale of a sports franchise are addressed in Chapter 10. Transfers of player contracts in a sports league expansion are addressed in Chapter 11. This chapter addresses the tax treatment of player contract trades among established sports franchises in a sports league not associated with the purchase/sale of an established or expansion sports franchise. AUDIT ISSUES Potential audit issues for purchases, sales, or trades of player contracts not connected with the purchase/sale of an established or expansion sports franchise include: 1. Whether the seller or transferor (player trades) properly reported the amount of IRC section 1245 and IRC section 1231 gains. Whether the purchaser or transferee (player trades) properly computed its tax basis under IRC section 1012 and IRC section 1031in the player contracts acquired.  2.  TAX LAW APPLICATION Gains and Losses on Player Contracts Given Up Player contracts constitute intangible personal property. As addressed in Chapter 9, if the player contract has a useful life of more than a year, it must be capitalized and amortized over the life of the player contract under IRC section 167. Gains and losses on the sale or exchange of player contracts held by the sports franchise for more than a year constitute IRC section 1231 gains and losses. However, to the extent of amortization claimed under IRC section 167, player contract gains are subject to IRC section 1245 ordinary income recapture.  12-1   In general, player contract trades qualify for IRC section 1031 nonrecognition treatment for like kind exchanges. Gains recognized on player contract trades are limited to the amount of boot and, if applicable, non-qualifying property received by the transferor. Rev. Rul. 67-380, 1967-2 C.B. 291 and Rev. Rul. 71-137, 1971-1 C.B. 104, specifically address these general provisions for sports franchise player contracts. IRC section 1031(a) provides that no gain or loss is recognized if property used in a trade or business is exchanged solely for like kind property. Under IRC section 1031(b), any realized gain is recognized to the extent money or property that is not like kind is received in the exchange. Treas. Reg. section 1.1031(b)-1(c) provides: Consideration received in the form of an assumption of liabilities (or a transfer subject to a liability) is to be treated as ""other property or money"" for the purposes of section 1031(b). Where, on an exchange described in section 1031(b), each party to the exchange either assumes a liability of the other party or acquires property subject to a liability; then, in determining the amount of ""other property or money"" for purposes of section 1031(b), consideration given in the form of an assumption of liabilities (or a receipt of property subject to a liability) shall be offset against consideration received in the form of an assumption of liabilities (or a transfer subject to a liability). See section 1.1031(d)-2, examples (1) and (2). To the extent of IRC section 1245 recapture, gains recognized on player trades are ordinary gains. The IRC section 1245(a)(4) amalgamation rule for player contracts (addressed in chapter 10) only applies to player contracts transferred in connection with the purchase/sale of an entire sports franchise. Accordingly, the IRC section 1245(a)(4) amalgamation rule does not apply to the sale or trade of two or more player contracts by a sports franchise to another sports franchise. This means the IRC section 1245 recapture provisions are applied on an individual player contract basis versus an aggregate player contract basis. Accordingly, the tax treatment to the transferor on the sale or exchange of a player contract is the same as the tax treatment given the sale or exchange of tangible personal property, such as machinery, used in any trade or business. In the sports franchise's tax year in which a player is cut, the sports franchise is entitled to an ordinary deduction under IRC section 165 for its adjusted basis in the player contract. Generally, a sports franchise does not have an ascertainable tax basis in future draft picks given up in a player trade (treated as an inseparable part of the franchise intangible asset). Accordingly, in determining the sports franchise's basis in player contracts acquired in trades, a zero adjusted basis should be used for future draft picks given up in the trade. To the extent a gain on a future draft pick given up in a trade is recognized under IRC section 1031, the gain is an IRC section 1231 gain. 12-2   A potential emerging issue, that future draft picks and existing player contracts do not constitute like kind property for purposes of IRC section 1031, is addressed at the end of this chapter. Tax Basis in Acquired Player Contracts If a sports franchise purchases a player contract, the cost basis provisions of IRC Section 1012 apply. If a sports franchise acquires a player contract in a player trade, the basis provisions of IRC section 1031 apply. In a player trade the sports franchise's basis in the player contract(s) acquired is: 1. 2. 3. 4. its adjusted basis in the player contracts given up in the trade, less the player contract liabilities transferred, plus player contract liabilities assumed in the exchange, plus any gain recognized due to the receipt of boot.  IRC section 1056, which is addressed in Chapter 10, only applies to player contracts transferred in connection with the purchase/sale of an entire sports franchise. Accordingly, the IRC section 1056 sports franchise buyer basis rules do not apply to the sale or trade of two or more player contracts among sports franchises. A sports franchise acquiring future draft picks in a player trade will have a tax basis in the draft picks acquired based on the application of IRC section 1031. The sports franchise's tax basis in the future draft pick becomes part of the sports franchise's capitalized cost basis in the player contract signed as a result of the draft pick. Accordingly, except for the future draft pick basis ""wrinkle"" addressed above, the tax basis rules on the acquisition of player contracts is the same as the tax basis rules on the purchase or exchange of tangible personal property, such as machinery, used in any trade or business.  EXAMPLE -- PLAYER CONTRACT TRADE Sports franchise A and sports franchise B are unrelated calendar year TEFRA partnerships. Sports franchise A trades the player contract of athlete Strong (Strong player contract) for sports franchise's B player contract of athlete Fast (Fast player contract) on January 1, 1996.  12-3   Sport franchise A's Strong player contract was entered into on January 1, 1994. On January 1, 1996, there are 2 years remaining on the original 4 year contract. A's original amortizable basis in the Strong player contract was $800,000, and A claimed $200,000 of amortization for the year 1994 and $200,000 for the year 1995. Accordingly, A's adjusted basis in the Strong player contract on January 1, 1996, is $400,000. The payments remaining on the Strong Player contract on January 1, 1996, are $300,000. Sports franchise B's Fast player contract was entered into on January 1, 1995. On January 1, 1996, there are 3 years remaining on the original 4-year contract. B's original amortizable basis in the Fast player contract was $600,000, and B claimed $150,000 of amortization for the year 1995. Accordingly, B's adjusted basis in the Fast player contract is $450,000 on January 1, 1996. The payments remaining on the Fast Player contract on January 1, 1996, are $400,000. Due to the team needs of market values of the two performance) on January other property considerat Fast player. both sports franchises, and taking into account the player contracts (based on Strong's and Fast's prior 1, 1996, sports franchise A agrees to an even trade ion by either A or B) of its Strong player for sports relative fair season (no cash or franchises B's  Sports franchise A and sports franchise B agree that on January 1, 1996, the fair market value of the Strong player contract is $500,000, and the fair market value of the Fast player contract is $600,000. The gain computed by sports franchise A and sports franchise B is determined as follows: Sports Franchise A Consideration Received: FMV of Fast Player Contract Strong Contract Liability Transferred FMV of Strong Player Contract Fast Contract Liability Transferred Total Consideration Received Less Adjusted Basis In Contract Transferred Gain Realized Gain Recognized $900,000 $600,000 Sports Franchise B  $300,000 $500,000  $400,000 $900,000  $400,000 $500,000 $ 0  $450,000 $450,000 $100,000  12-4   Sports franchise A does not have a gain recognized because it received no boot. It received no boot because the player contract liability assumed of $400,000 exceeded its player contract liability transferred of $300,000. Sports franchise B has a recognized gain of $100,000 since this is the amount of boot received. Sports franchise B received $100,000 of boot in the exchange because the player contract liability it transferred of $400,000 exceeded the player contract liability it assumed of $300,000. Due to the $150,000 amortization claimed in 1995, all of B's recognized gain of $100,000 is IRC section 1245 recapture ordinary income. Sport franchise A's and sports franchise B's tax basis in the player contracts acquired in the trade are computed as follows: Sports Franchise A Adjusted Basis In Contract Given Up Less liability Transferred Plus Liability Assumed Plus Gain Recognized Tax Basis in Contract Acquired Sports Franchise B  $400,000 (300,000) 400,000 0 $500,000  $450,000 (400,000) 300,000 100,000 $450,000  Sport franchise A's tax basis in its newly acquired Fast player contract is $500,000 as computed above. This is comprised of its $400,000 adjusted basis in the Strong player contract it traded to B plus the additional $100,000 player contract liability A assumed in the trade. A amortizes its $500,000 adjusted basis in its newly acquired Fast player contract over the three years remaining on the Fast player contract. Sport franchise B's tax basis in its newly acquired Strong Player contract is $450,000 as computed above. This is comprised of its $450,000 adjusted basis in the Fast player contract it traded to sports franchise A less the net $100,000 contract liability relieved of on the trade plus the $100,000 gain it recognized on the trade. Sports franchise B amortizes its $450,000 adjusted basis in its newly acquired Strong player contract over the two years remaining on the Strong player contract. EXAMINATION TECHNIQUES Documents and information that should be obtained include: 1. A copy of all player contract sale or trade agreements for the tax year under examination.  12-5   2.  The sports franchise's workpapers and schedules on the computations of gains and losses for the tax year under examination. This includes workpapers and schedules which reconcile with the return Form 4797 amounts. For the prior, current, and subsequent tax years: a. the sports franchise's schedules and workpapers reflecting: 1) the player contracts owned by the sports franchise, 2) the sports franchise's tax basis in each player contract, and 3) the useful life used by the sports franchise for each player contract, b. to the extent not included in (a), copies of the schedules and workpapers used to compute player contract amortization. This should include any schedules and workpapers necessary to reconcile this with the total player contract amortization amount reflected on return Form 4562.  3.  Gains and Losses on Player Contracts Given Up For player trades, focus on the player trades in which your sports franchise received cash or other taxable boot (such as player contract liabilities given up in excess of player contract liabilities assumed) in the IRC section 1031 exchange. Detailed guidance on the computation of the IRC section 1231 and 1245 gains on player contracts is not addressed in this guide because it is the same as for sales and exchanges of tangible personal property by any business taxpayer. For general guidance, refer to the coverage given earlier in this chapter under tax law application. IRC section 165 abandonment losses on players cut shortly after the player's contract was acquired may warrant consideration. If the player contract was acquired in connection with the acquisition of the sports franchise (either the purchase of an existing sports franchise or an expansion sports franchise), consider the basis allocated to player contract in the acquisition. To obtain IRC section 165 loss deductions, a new sports franchise may allocate more of the purchase price than warranted to players contracts of players it plans on cutting. A common examination technique is to analyze the taxpayer's prior and subsequent year's player contract listings, depreciation, and amortization schedules. Player contracts on the prior or current year's schedule that are omitted from the current or subsequent year's schedule should be reconciled to the sports franchise's player contract gain and loss return schedules  12-6   Tax Basis in Acquired Player Contracts Detailed guidance on the computation of the tax basis under IRC section 1012 and 1031 on player contracts is the same as for tangible personal property of other business taxpayers. For general guidance, refer to the coverage given earlier in this chapter under tax law application. In player contracts acquired in a multiple player contract trade, you may want to ascertain that more basis than warranted is not allocated to the player contracts acquired with the shortest useful lives. POTENTIAL EMERGING ISSUE ON FUTURE DRAFT PICKS The coverage given above on IRC section 1031 exchanges assumes that a player contract and a future draft pick are like kind property. There may be a potential emerging issue on whether this is, in fact, the case. This potential emerging issue impacts whether the trade of a single future draft pick for a single existing player contract can qualify for IRC section 1031 nonrecognition. For multiple future draft and player contract trades, it impacts whether other property (nonlike kind) is received in the exchange. Treas. Reg. section 1.1031(a)-2(c)(1) provides the general rule that exchanges of intangible personal property qualify under IRC section 103 *** only if the exchanges of properties are of a like kind. No like classes are provided for these properties. Whether intangible personal property is of a like kind to other intangible personal property generally depends on the nature or character of the rights involved (e.g., a patent or a copyright) and also on the nature or character of the underlying property to which the intangible personal property relates. Treas. Reg. section 1.1031(a)-2(c)(2) provides ""The goodwill or going concern value of a business is not of a like kind to the goodwill or going concern value of another business."" The underlying property for both a future draft pick and a current player contract is the future or current contractual services of a professional athlete. However, while a sports franchise has a separable ascertainable value and basis in player contracts (separable from goodwill, going concern value, and the franchise intangible asset), this does not appear to be the case for future draft picks. It appears that future draft picks of a sports franchise are inseparable from its franchise intangible asset. Accordingly, it appears that future draft picks and existing player contracts do not constitute like kind property for purposes of IRC section 1031.

In baseball, the box seats are behind home plate, whereas in football, the box seats are around the 50 yard line. Draft system for sports franchises to bid on college players. In general, the teams with the worst records select earlier than teams with better records. The rules for drafting players among the leagues vary, in some leagues the number of players drafted are limited, whereas in the baseball there is no limitation. Draft system whereby expansion sports franchises obtain players from the existing sports franchises in their league.  College Draft  Expansion Draft  Expansion Sports Franchise  The addition of a new sports franchise to the league through league expansion (increase in the number of sports franchises in the league). A farm team is where the big league clubs ""grow"" players. Skills are refined and worked on, and then as a player develops, he moves up through the system until he reaches the major league level. Most big league teams have at least 4 minor league farm teams: AAA being the highest, followed by AA, then at least one, and sometimes two A clubs. If there are two A clubs, one is usually high and one is low. There are also various short season, winter leagues, etc., where players can go to retain their skill level year round. Free agency in its purest form, is a status in which the rights to a player's athletic services are not owned by a sports franchise and may be shopped around by the player in a quest for the most attractive bid. Before 1970, many player contracts contained a reserve clause which bound a player to a team for life unless a team chose to sell the contract.  Farm Team  Free Agency  Salary Cap System A salary cap system establishes an overall wage framework that provides both a maximum amount of payroll allowed for each sports franchise and a minimum payroll floor that each sports franchise must pay. Salary caps are generally expressed as a percentage of gross average sports franchise revenues for the league.  G-1   Sports Franchise  A sports franchise in a professional sports league generally includes the right to: 1. be the sports league's sole provider of the professional sport within a given geographical area, be protected by league rules and regulations from intra-league business competition, share in the proceeds of future league expansion, share equally with other sports franchises in the league in the revenue from all single network television contracts negotiated on a league-wide basis, sell local broadcast rights for preseason television and for both preseason and regular season radio, share with other sports franchises in the league in revenue from national merchandising, sell programs and advertising space therein at home games, participate in the college draft and the expansion draft (for expansion sports franchises), and share in the league's goodwill.  2.  3. 4.  5.  6.  7. 8.  9.  Right of First Refusal  A right of first refusal permits a sports franchise to match any offer made to one of its current players by another sports franchise and thus retain the player's services. The right of first refusal generally applies only to restricted free agents, that is; for example players having a specified amount of limited experience.  Uniform Player Contract  The major sports leagues require that all players sign a uniform player contract that contains provisions prescribed by the league.  G-2"
GX265-09-14730957	"October 24, 2003  MEMORANDUM FOR LMSB INDUSTRY DIRECTORS DIRECTORS, FIELD OPERATIONS COMMUNICATIONS, TECHNOLOGY & MEDIA DIRECTOR, FIELD SPECIALISTS DIRECTOR, PREFILING AND TECHNICAL GUIDANCE FROM: Thomas W. Wilson, Jr. /s/Thomas W. Wilson, Jr. Industry Director Communications, Technology & Media Examination Procedures for Sports Franchise Acquisitions  SUBJECT:  In a simultaneously issued field directive titled ""Examination of Sports Franchise Acqui sitions"" examiners are provided with a compliance measure tool to be used in the classification and examination of taxpayers who acquire sports franchises. This tool allows agents to resolve sports franchise acquisitions issues in limited and expedited examinations. This memorandum provides examiners with directions in applying the compliance measure to cases within the classification and in the examination process. A taxpayer's acceptance of the Service's use of the compliance measure still requires examiners to conduct a review of the acquisition to verify that the taxpayer falls within the scope of the measure. Revenue agents assigned sports franchise acquisition cases should complete and forward referrals to the Engineering program during their pre examination analysis. Examiners in conducting their review should utilize the procedures outlined below. VERIFY THE EXISTENCE , BASES AND USEFUL LIVES OF ACQUIRED INTA NGIBLE ASSETS 1. Verifications and Examination Techniques Taxpayers are required to allocate the purchase price among the acquired intangibles. In any case in which a taxpayer claims amortization deductions for an intangible asset, the taxpayer is required to verify the existence, value and useful life of the asset to establish that the asset qualifies for amortization. Therefore, taxpayers are expected to have an appraisal, which is to be requested and reviewed by the examiner. When a taxpayer makes an amended return to claim additional amortization deductions, the taxpayer is expected to provide a new or revised appraisal. Examiners in conducting their review of the appraisal should use the following audit steps and request the following documents:   2 a. Request and reconcile the appraised values and useful lives to the values and lives reported on the return, the taxpayer's financial statements and depreciation schedules. b. Request, review and reconcile player contracts to the lives detailed on the taxpayer's appraisal and depreciation schedules. Due to the volume of contracts, examiners may elect to review and reconcile a sampling of the contracts. c. Request, review and reconcile contracts for the sale of luxury suites, club seats, in-stadium advertising, naming rights, and other acquired assets to the lives detailed on the taxpayer's appraisal and depreciation schedules. Due to the volume of contracts, examiners may elect to review and reconcile a sampling of the contracts. d. Request and review sales documents including the due diligence letter, if any. Reconcile the sales price (includ ing a reconciliation of liabilities assumed) to the value reported in the appraisal. In examining the useful lives of acquired intangible assets, agents generally should expect to see the following:   Player contracts with a composite useful life between four and five years. Other amortizable assets (not including any media rights) with a composite useful life of between nine and 10 years.  With respect to a purchase price allocation for an existing franchise, agents generally should see allocations to:   Player contracts of approximately 55% of the total amount allocable to all intangibles. Other amortizable assets (not including any media rights) including , but not limited to , playing facility naming rights, concession agreements, club seat contracts, and luxury suite contracts of approximately 15% of the total amount allocable to all intangibles. Non-amortizable intangible assets (exclusive of media rights) such as equity interests in related entities, franchise rights, and goodwill and going conce rn value of approximately 10% of the total amount allocable to all intangibles. Media rights of approximately 20% of the total amount allocable to all intangibles, split relatively evenly between the current value of the rights represented by the contracts in place as of the date of acquisition, and the residual (terminal) value of all rights in all future media contracts.       3 2. Expansion Teams A taxpayer who acquires an expansion team will normally have allocations different than those described above. When a taxpayer acquires an expansion team , the taxpayer, unlike a taxpayer who acquires an existing team, generally does not acquire preexisting agreements that provide the taxpayer the contractual rights to income sources such as those generated by the sale of luxury box seating or playing facilities naming rights. Instead, the grant of an expansion team provides the owner with the right to continually enter into and renew such agreements. Agents should therefore expect to see a lower allocation to a mortizable assets relative to such allocation for an existing team that has exercised its rights to enter into and renew amortizable agreements . 3. Media Rights Taxpayers usually determine the acquisition cost allocable to acquired media rights in one of two ways. Taxpayers may use a discounted cash flow analysis to value both current and future media rights. In using this approach, the taxpayer bifurcates the media rights value between the rights represented by the current media contacts and the rights represented by all expected future media contracts. Taxpayers claim amortization deductions for the cost allocated to the value of media rights represented by the current contracts. Amortization claims are not made for the cost allocated to the ongoing rights to revenues from expected future contracts because those rights do not have an ascertainable useful life. In the other approach, the taxpayer does not independently value the media rights and instead considers the value to be in the ""residual"" class of assets. Under this approach, taxpayers do not claim amortization deductions for media rights. A taxpayer's media rights may include national TV rights, local TV rights, national radio rights, local radio rights, foreign TV and radio rights, and satellite broadcast rights. Examiners are not to allow any amortization deductions for any media rights. Taxpayers will be free to pursue any claim for amortization deductions from media rights in Appeals or in the courts. We encourage the use of Fast Track procedures to resolve the issue in the field. 4. Closing Agreements Examination must secure a closing agreement that sets out the resolution of the acquisition issues under the compliance measure. The closing agreement will reflect the li mited nature of the compliance measure. Thus, the closing agreement will reflect that application of the measure in and of itself will not preclude the Service from subsequent examination of the basis of any specific asset as may be necessary in applying any provision of the Code. The language of the closing agreement will vary depending on the treatment of media rights. If at the close of an examination, the issue of the amortization of media rights   4 has not been considered under the Fast Track procedures, the closing agreement prepared in Examination would set out the determination of the taxpayer's amortization deductions for all acquired amortizable intangible assets (not including any media rights) under the compliance measure. The closing agreement must also set out the purchase price allocation to media rights as determined under the compliance measure, and that the taxpayer has not conceded in Examination any amortization claim for media rights represented by current media contracts. Taxpaye rs will be free to pursue any denied deduction for amortization of the purchase price allocable to current media rights (as determined under the compliance measure) in Appeals or in the courts. Alternatively, if the taxpayer chooses to concede in Examination all claims for amortization deductions for all media rights in all years, that concession must be included in the closing agreement. If, during the time the acquisition issues are in the jurisdiction of Examination, the issue of the allowance of amortization deductions for any media rights was resolve in Appeals under the Fast Track procedures, the resolution must be set out in the closing agreement. PRESENT VALUE CALCULATIONS AND BASIS ADJUSTMENTS After verifying the existence, bases and useful live s of the acquired amortizable intangible assets, the next step to be taken by examiners is to determine whether the taxpayer's present value percentage of the amortizable intangible assets comes within the compliance measure. An adjustment must be made to the bases of the taxpayer's acquired amortizable intangible assets if the taxpayer's present value percentage is greater than the compliance measure percentage. In such case, a corresponding adjustment will be made to the bases of the remaining ( non-amortizable ) intangible assets. Calculating the taxpayer's present value percentage and any necessary bases adjustments is a multi -step process that requires the following determinations: (1) the percentage of total intangibles represented by each intangible asset, (2) the present value table factor for each amortizable intangible asset, (3) the present value of the deductions to recover the cost allocable to the amortizable intangible assets individually and as a group, (4) the basis reduction needed in order to come within the compliance measure percentage and the allocation of that basis reduction to each of the amortizable intangible assets, and (5) a reallocation of the basis reduction so as to step up the bases of the remaining ( non-amortizable ) intangible assets. Step One - CALCULATE EACH AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASS ET'S PERCENTAGE OF TOTA L INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GROUP TOTAL: The applicable percentage is determined by dividing the cost allocable to each intangible asset by the total cost allocable to all intangible assets. Add the result for each amortizable asset together to calculate the group total. Step Two - DETERMINE THE PRESENT VALUE FACTOR FOR EACH AMORTIZABLE INTA NGIBLE ASSET (NOT INCLUDING ANY ME DIA RIGHTS ): In applying the compliance measure, agents will use a discount rate of 5.5% per annum. The discount rate will be applied to the stream of amortization deductions claimed (and to be claimed) assuming that the   5 deductions are allowable at the close of each calendar year. The present value factor may be determined via the use of the attached present value table (see Attachment A  Present Value Table). The table has two columns, one showing useful life and the other the corresponding present value factor for that life. The table states a n asset's useful life in quarter- year increments. The present value factor for each amortizable asset is determined by matching the asset's useful life to the useful life on the table (to the nearest quarter- year increment) , and using the corresponding present value factor shown on the table. Step Three - CALCULATE THE PRESENT VALUE PERCENTAGE OF THE RECOVERY OF TH E COST ALLOCABLE TO THE AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS (NOT INCLUDING ANY ME DIA RIGHTS ) INDIVIDUALLY AND AS A GROUP : This is computed by multiplying the percentage calculated in Step One by the factor determined in Step Two for each asset individually. Add the results for each amortizable asset together to calculate the present value recovery percentage for the group as a whole. Step Four - DETERMINE IF AN ADJUSTM ENT TO BASES OF THE AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSE T (NOT INCLUDING ANY ME DIA RIGHTS ) IS REQUIRED. IF REQUIRED, CALCULATE THE GROSS STEP DOWN OF BASES NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE A GROUP PRESENT VALUE PERCENTAGE OF THE RECOVERY OF THE COST ALLOCA BLE TO THE AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT DOES NOT EXCEED THE COMPLIANCE MEASURE PERCENTAGE AND ALLOCATE THAT GROSS STEP-DOWN TO EACH OF THE AMORTIZA BLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS: To determine whether an adjustment to  basis is required, compare the resulting group present value percentage achieved in Step Three to the compliance measure percentage. If the group present value percentage achieved in Step Three is greater than the 60% maximum compliance measure, the bases of the amortizable intangible assets mus t be reduced by an amount that will achieve a group present value percentage that does not exceed the compliance measure percentage. Conversely, if the group present value percentage achieved in Step Three is less than the 60% maximum compliance measure, no adjustment to the bases of the amortizable intangible assets would be warranted . The following calculations are required to determine the basis reduction amounts. 1. The present value difference calculated in Step Four must be converted to its face amount to determine the full adjustment to the purchase price allocations (and bases) of amortizable intangible assets. 2. The face amount calculated in (1 ) above is allocated pro-rata among the amortizable intangible assets. Step Five - REALLOCATE THE GROSS BASES REDUCTION AMOUNT AMONG THE REMAINING INTANGIBLE ASSETS : Once the step-down of the bases of amortizable assets has been completed, a corresponding step -up in the bases of the remaining (non-amortizable) intangible assets, including media rights, must b e made. The allocation of the gross step-up will not require a revaluation of the remaining intangible assets. Generally, as   6 noted above, the remaining intangibles will represent about 30% of the value of all intangibles. Media rights will generally account for about 20% (about 10% to current and 10% to future rights) of the purchase price for all intangibles. Franchise and other non-amortizable franchise rights will generally account for about 10% of the intangibles. These percentages will be used as a base for an allocation process to determine the bases step- up. General Allocation Process: Agents generally will allocate the step- up to three groups of assets: (1) current media rights, (2) future media rights, and (3) franchise and other non-amortizable assets. Within each group, the allocation will be made pro- rata among the distinct assets within the group. The step- up will initially be allocated equally to each of the three groups up to an amount (taking into account any existing purchase price allocation) that does not exceed 10% of the total purchase price of all intangibles. When the existing purchase price allocation to a group is at or exceeds 10%, or when the step- up (together with any existing purchase price allocation) allocated to a group reaches the 10% mark, no additional step- up will be allocated to that group at that time. The allocation will then be made to any remaining group (up to the 10 % mark) until such time as all three groups have reached the 10% mark. When all three groups have reached the 10% mark, the step- up will be allocated in a manner so as to result (to the greatest extent possible) in three groups with the same percentage share of the total purchase price allocable to all intangibles. In accomplishing this step, any remaining unallocated step- up will initially be allocated equally among the groups up to (but not exceeding) the percentage that is the highest percentage of total intangibles allocable to any group. When, if at all, all three groups have reached the highest percentage of total intangibles, any remaining unallocated step- up will be allocated equally among the three groups. In the overall allocation process, the purchase price ultimately allocated to a group may ultimately be less than or greater t han the 10% average generally seen for a group . With one exception, the starting point in performing the allocation will be the purchase price allocation as reported (whether by original or amended return) by the taxpayer. In any initial instance in which franchise exceeds 10% of the total purchase price of all intangibles and future media rights are less than that 10% mark, the excess of franchise over the10% mark will be reallocated to future media rights (even in cases in which the taxpayer does not initially value future media rights) up to , but not exceeding , 10%. Thus, if both future media and franchise exceed 10%, there will be no reallocation between franchise and future media rights. Similarly, if franchise is 10% or less, there will be no reallocation between franchise and future media rights. In no event will there be a reallocation of reported purchase price for franchise or future media rights to current media rights (whether or not valued by the taxpayer) . Agents should not reallocate the reported purchase price among the reported non-amortizable assets except as otherwise noted in this paragraph.   7 EXAMPLES EXAMPLE 1  B, in an asset acquisition, acquired the assets of sports franchise S for $200 million. B allocated $180 million of the purchase to intangible assets. Of the $180 million allocated to intangible assets, B allocated $38 million to non-amortizable assets (including $15 million to future media rights and $23 million to franchise and all other non-amortizable assets and league membership rights), and $142 million to intangible assets for which B claimed amortization deductions. Of the $142 million, B allocated $15 million to current media rights (as represented by the current TV and radio contracts), and $127 million to player contracts and all other amortizable assets as follows: Assets Player Contracts Season Ticket Holder List Concession Agreement Sponsorship Agreements Luxury Suite Contracts National TV Contracts Local TV Contacts Local Radio Contracts Group Total Original Allocation $115,000,000 $ 4,000,000 $ 3,000,000 $ 2,500,000 $ 2,500,000 $ 12,500,000 $ 2,000,000 $ 500,000 $142,000,000 Useful Life 3.29 years 21 years 5.5 years 2.5 years 2 years 4 years 3 years 3 years  Step One  CALCULATE THE PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL INTANGIBLE ASSETS ALLOCATED TO EACH AMORTIZABLE INTANGIB LE ASSET (NOT INCLUDING ANY ME DIA RIGHTS ) AND THE GROUP TOTAL.

CATEGORIZE THE REMAINING ASSETS INTO THRE E GROUPS : (1) CURRENT MEDIA RIGHTS , (2) FUTURE MEDIA RIGHTS , AND (3) FRANCHISE AND OTHER NON-AMORTIZABLE ASSETS . The groups' respective percentage of total intangible assets is as follows : Current Media = 8.33% Future Media = 8.33% Franchise, etc. = 12.78 % a. Because franchise exceeds 10%, and future media rights is less than 10%, allocate the excess of franchise over 10% to future media rights up to, but not exceeding 10%. Thus, 1.67% of franchise value will be allocated to future media rights to bring that value up to 10%. As a result of this re -allocation, the starting place for the bases step up is 11.11% (12.7 8% - 1.67%) for franchise, etc., and 10% (8.33% + 1.67%) for future media rights. b. Because both franchise and future media are at or above the 10% mark, the step- up will first be allocated exc lusively to current media rights to bring that group up to 10%. Current media rights will be increased initially (as a percentage of total intangibles) by 1.67%, the amount necessary to bring that group up to the 10% mark. As a result of this re allocati on: Current Media = 10.00% (8.33% + 1.67%) Future Media = 10.00% Franchise, etc. = 11.11% c. Following these initial reallocations, the three groups are at or above 10%. At this stage, the remaining step- up of .95% (2.616-1.67%) will be allocated in a ma nner so as to achieve to the greatest extent possible   11 three equal groups of the highest percentage of purchase price allocable to total intangibles. The highest percentage allocable to total intangible s is 11.11%, the amount allocable to franchise, etc. Since current and future media rights are below 11.11%, the remaining .95% step- up will be allocated equally to each of those two groups so as to bring each group up to 11.11%. An equal allocation will exhaust the remaining step- up and result in .475% of step- up to both current and future media. The final step up allocation to the three groups of assets as a percentage of total intangible assets both individually and as a group is as follows: Current Media Rights: Future Media Rights: Franchise, etc.: Group Total 10.475% (8.33% + 1.67% + .475%). 10.475% (8.33% + 1.67% +.475%). 11.11%.

The portion of the $57,708,233 to be allocated to a group is the product of the $57,708,233 and the ratio of the percentage of total intangible assets for the group to the percentage of total intangible assets for the remaining intangible assets. a. Current Media Rights Gross Step- up Amount is $ 3,855,076 . This amount is calculated by subtracting from the portion of the $57,708,076 to be allocated to current media rights the original allocation to current media rights . The portion of the $57,708,233 to be allocated to current media rights is $18,855,076, the product of (10.475%/32.06%) 2 * $57,708,233. The original allocation to current media rights was $15,000,000. Thus, the gross step- up amount of $3,855,076 is $18,855,076 minus $15,000,000.  2  The ratio of the percent age of total intangible assets for current media rights to the percent age o f total intangible assets for the remaining intangible assets.   12 Original Allocation $12,500,000 $ 2,000,000 $ 500,000  Assets  Step-up Computation $12,500,000 + ($3,855,076 * ($12,500,000/$15,000,000)) $2,000,000 + ($3,855,076 * ($2,000,000/$15,000,000)) $500,000 + ($3,855,076  ($3,212,563 + $514,010))  Step- Up  Revised Allocation  National TV Current Local TV Current Local Radio Current Group Total  $3,212,563 $15,712,563 $ 514,010 $ 2,514,010 $ 128,503 $ 628,503  $15,000,000  $18,855,076  b.  Future Media Rights Gross Step- up Amount is $ 3,855,076. This amount is calculated by subtracti ng from the portion of the $57,708,076 to be allocated to future media rights the original allocation to future media rights . The portion of the $57,708,233 to be allocated to future media rights is $18,855,076, the product of (10.475%/32.06%) 3 * $57,708,233. The original allocation to future media rights was $15,000,000. Thus, the gross step- up amount of $3,855,076 is $18,855,076 minus $15,000,000. The $ 3,855,0 76 is made up of a $3,001,919 reallocation from franchise, etc. (as determined below) plus $853,157 of additional step-up ( the difference between the $ 3,855,076 gross step- up amount and the $3,001,919 reallocation form franchise, etc.).

Introduction The Internal Revenue Bulletin is the authoritative instrument of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue for announcing official rulings and procedures of the Internal Revenue Service and for publishing Treasury Decisions, Executive Orders, Tax Conventions, legislation, court decisions, and other items of general interest. It is published weekly and may be obtained from the Superintendent of Documents on a subscription basis. Bulletin contents are consolidated semiannually into Cumulative Bulletins, which are sold on a single-copy basis. It is the policy of the Service to publish in the Bulletin all substantive rulings necessary to promote a uniform application of the tax laws, including all rulings that supersede, revoke, modify, or amend any of those previously published in the Bulletin. All published rulings apply retroactively unless otherwise indicated. Procedures relating solely to matters of internal management are not published; however, statements of internal practices and procedures that affect the rights and duties of taxpayers are published. Revenue rulings represent the conclusions of the Service on the application of the law to the pivotal facts stated in the revenue ruling. In those based on positions taken in rulings to taxpayers or technical advice to Service field offices, identifying details and information of a confidential nature are deleted to prevent unwarranted invasions of privacy and to comply with statutory requirements. Rulings and procedures reported in the Bulletin do not have the force and effect of Treasury Department Regulations, but they may be used as precedents. Unpublished rulings will not be relied on, used, or cited as precedents by Service personnel in the disposition of other cases. In applying published rulings and procedures, the effect of subsequent legislation, regulations, court decisions, rulings, and procedures must be considered, and Service personnel and others concerned are cautioned against reaching the same conclusions in other cases unless the facts and circumstances are substantially the same. The Bulletin is divided into four parts as follows: Part I. -- 1986 Code. This part includes rulings and decisions based on provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Part II.--Treaties and Tax Legislation. This part is divided into two subparts as follows: Subpart A, Tax Conventions and Other Related Items, and Subpart B, Legislation and Related Committee Reports. Part III.--Administrative, Procedural, and Miscellaneous. To the extent practicable, pertinent cross references to these subjects are contained in the other Parts and Subparts. Also included in this part are Bank Secrecy Act Administrative Rulings. Bank Secrecy Act Administrative Rulings are issued by the Department of the Treasury's Office of the Assistant Secretary (Enforcement). Part IV.--Items of General Interest. This part includes notices of proposed rulemakings, disbarment and suspension lists, and announcements. The first Bulletin for each month includes a cumulative index for the matters published during the preceding months. These monthly indexes are cumulated on a semiannual basis, and are published in the first Bulletin of the succeeding semiannual period, respectively.  The contents of this publication are not copyrighted and may be reprinted freely. A citation of the Internal Revenue Bulletin as the source would be appropriate.

On January 12, 2001, the IRS and the Treasury Department issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (REG10173900, 20011 C.B. 996 [66 FR 2854]), published in the Federal Register, to amend the existing elective business entity classification regime under section 7701 known as the check-thebox regulations, and to amend the existing temporary rules providing for the income of entities owned by foreign governments as described under section 892. No public hearing was requested or held. Written comments responding to the notice of proposed rulemaking were received. After consideration of all the comments, the proposed regulations are adopted as revised by this Treasury decision. The revisions are discussed below. Explanation and Summary of Comments On December 18, 1996, the IRS and Treasury published the elective Federal tax classification regime under section 7701 known as the check-the-box regulations, 61 FR 66584. On January 12, 2001, the IRS and Treasury issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (REG10173900, 20011 C.B. 996) that proposed to amend the Procedure and Administration Regulations (26 CFR Part 301) to address the Federal tax classification of an entity wholly owned by a foreign government (as defined in  1.8922T) and to address the Federal tax treatment to a foreign bank of income and assets and liabilities of an otherwise disregarded nonbank entity that it owns. As noted in the preamble to the notice of proposed rulemaking, the purpose of the proposed regulations was to ensure  Section 892.--Income of Foreign Governments and of International Organizations 26 CFR 1.8925: Controlled commercial entity.  parity between the treatment of entities wholly owned by State governments and entities wholly owned by foreign governments, as well as to ensure parity between the treatment of nonbank subsidiaries owned by U.S. banks and the treatment of nonbank subsidiaries owned by foreign banks engaged in a U.S. banking business. The January 12, 2001, notice of proposed rulemaking also proposed to provide that a partnership can be a controlled commercial entity under section 892. A.  301.77012(b)(6) A commentator suggested that the rule in the proposed regulations that a business entity wholly owned by a foreign government (as defined in  1.8922T) is a per se corporation should be limited to those entities directly owned by the foreign government. As indicated above, the proposed regulations were issued because the IRS and Treasury believe that it is appropriate to treat controlled entities owned by foreign governments similarly to controlled entities owned by State governments. The per se rule relating to controlled entities owned by State governments is not limited to those entities directly owned by a State government. Thus, except for minor changes to language, the final regulations retain the proposed rule that a business entity wholly owned by a foreign government, like a business entity wholly owned by a State government, will be treated as a per se corporation. B.  301.77012(c)(2)(ii) Two comments were received on the proposed regulation that provides that foreign banks, like domestic banks, would be precluded from treating their wholly owned nonbank subsidiaries as disregarded entities for purposes of the special rules of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) applicable to banks. Both comments asked for guidance on the phrase ""special rules of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to banks"" and the circumstances under which the regulation would apply to entities owned by foreign banks. As noted above, the regulations are intended to ensure parity of treatment between domestic banks and foreign banks engaged in a U.S. trade or business by providing that neither domestic banks as defined in section 581 nor foreign banks  T.D. 9012 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Internal Revenue Service 26 CFR Parts 1 and 301 Clarification of Entity Classification Rules AGENCY: Internal (IRS), Treasury. ACTION: regulations. Final Revenue and Service  temporary  SUMMARY: This document contains final regulations under section 7701 that address the Federal tax classification of a business entity wholly owned by a foreign government and that also provide that a nonbank entity wholly owned by a foreign bank cannot be disregarded as an entity separate from its owner (disregarded entity) for purposes of applying the special rules applicable to banks under the Internal Revenue Code. This document also contains final regulations providing that a partnership can be a controlled commercial entity for purposes of section 892(a)(2)(B) and reissues certain section 892 temporary regulations with references to the final regulations. DATES: Effective date:These regulations are effective August 1, 2002. Applicability Dates:The regulations that address the Federal tax classification of business entities wholly owned by a foreign government under  301.77012 apply on or after January 14, 2002, to such  August 26, 2002  389  200234 I.R.B.   as defined in section 585(a)(2)(B) (without regard to the second sentence thereof) may apply the special rules applicable to banks to their nonbank subsidiaries. A foreign bank is described in section 585(a)(2)(B) only when it is engaged in a U.S. trade or business that meets the requirements of section 581 but for the fact the bank is a foreign corporation. Accordingly, a foreign bank will be subject to the provisions of these final regulations only if the foreign bank is engaged in a U.S. trade or business that meets the requirements of section 581 but for the fact that the bank is a foreign corporation. The reference to ""special rules applicable to banks"" includes not only provisions of the Code but also regulations and other published guidance under the Code. One of these comments specifically requested clarification on how  301. 77012(c)(2)(ii) would affect a foreign bank's treatment of its disregarded entity for purposes of applying the fixed ratio election in the interest allocation rules under  1.8825(c)(4). Because under  1.8825 a foreign bank that meets the definition of section 585(a)(2)(B) does not distinguish between its banking and nonbanking activities for purposes of taking assets, liabilities and interest expense into account in the interest allocation formula, the IRS and Treasury do not believe the regulations under  1.8825 are appropriately considered ""special rules applicable to banks"" for purposes of the  301.77012(c)(2)(ii) regulations. Accordingly, the final regulations clarify that a foreign bank that is defined in section 585(a)(2)(B) is entitled to use the 93 percent fixed ratio under  1.8825 for the assets, liabilities and interest expense of a nonbank subsidiary that otherwise is treated as a disregarded entity for federal income tax purposes. Similarly, in calculating the amount of excess interest that may be treated as interest expense paid or accrued on deposits under 1.884 4(a)(2)(iii), a foreign bank defined in section 585(a)(2)(B) is entitled to take into account its combined banking and nonbanking U.S. assets (as defined in  1.8841(d)), including the assets of a nonbank subsidiary that is otherwise treated as a disregarded entity for federal income tax purposes.  A similar analysis applies to the rules under  1.8644(c)(5), 1.8645, and 1.8646, which relate to the determination of the effectively connected income of a banking, financing or similar business. Because those rules apply to both section 585(a)(2)(B) banks and to foreign corporations that are not regulated as banks but otherwise engage in financial services activities (See Inverworld v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 1996301, supplemented by T.C. Memo 1997226), the final regulations clarify that these rules are not considered ""special rules applicable to banks."" Effective Dates The regulations that address the Federal tax classification of business entities wholly owned by a foreign government under  301.77012 apply on or after January 14, 2002, to such business entities regardless of any prior entity classification, and the regulations that address the definition of the term entity for purposes of section 892(a)(2)(B) apply on or after January 14, 2002. The regulations relating to a nonbank entity that is wholly owned by a foreign bank apply to taxable years beginning after January 12, 2001. Special Analyses It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations. Therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Code, the notice of proposed rulemaking preceding these regulations was submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on their impact on small businesses. Drafting Information The principal author of these regulations is Camille B. Evans of the Office of Associate Chief Counsel (International). However, other personnel from the IRS  and Treasury Department participated in their development. ***** Adoption of Amendments to the Regulations Accordingly, 26 CFR parts 1 and 301 are amended as follows: PART 1--INCOME TAXES Paragraph 1. The authority citation for part 1 is amended by removing the entry for ""Sections 1.8921T through 1.8927T"" and adding the following entries in numerical order: Authority: 26 U.S.C. 7805 * * * Section 1.8921T also issued under 26 U.S.C. 892(c).

If the single owner of a business entity is a bank (as defined in section 581, or, in the case of a foreign bank, as defined in section 585(a)(2)(B) without regard to the second sentence thereof), then the special rules applicable to banks under the Internal Revenue Code will continue to apply to the single owner as if the wholly owned entity were a separate entity. For this purpose, the special rules applicable to banks under the Internal Revenue Code do not include the rules under sections 864(c), 882(c), and 884. *****  (e) Effective date.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Paperwork Reduction Act The collections of information contained in this notice of proposed rulemaking have been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3507(d)). Comments on the collections of information should be sent to the Office of Management and Budget, Attn: Desk Officer for the Department of the Treasury, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503, with copies to the Internal Revenue Service, Attn: IRS Reports Clearance Officer, W:CAR:MP: FP:S; Washington, DC 20224. Comments on the collections of information should be received by September 24, 2002. The collections of information in this proposed regulation are in  1.1445 2(d)(2) and 1.14453. The collections of information relate to the requirement that notices of nonrecognition or applications for withholding certificates be filed with the IRS with respect to (1) dispositions of U.S. real property interests that have been used by foreign persons as a principal residence within the prior 5 years and excluded from gross income under section 121 and (2) dispositions of U.S. real property interests by foreign persons in deferred like kind exchanges that qualify for nonrecognition under section 1031. This collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the IRS because it notifies the IRS of dispositions of U.S. real property interests by foreign persons that otherwise are subject to taxation under section 897 and the collection of a withholding tax under section 1445 except as provided in these provisions. The likely respondents will be individuals and business or other for-profit institutions. Estimated total annual reporting burden: 600 hours. The estimated annual burden per respondent varies from 3 hours to 5 hours, depending on individual circumstances, with an estimated average of 4 hours. Estimated number of respondents: 150. Estimated annual frequency of responses: On occasion. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a valid control number assigned by the Office of Management and Budget. Books or records relating to a collection of information must be retained as long as their contents may become material in the administration of any internal revenue law. Generally, tax returns and tax return information are confidential, as required by 26 U.S.C. 6103. Background Under section 897, a foreign transferor of a U.S. real property interest (USRPI) is generally taxed on gain from the disposition of the USRPI as if the taxpayer were engaged in a U.S. trade or business and as if such gain were effectively connected with such trade or business under section 871 or 882 (ECI). As a means to ensure the collection of the tax, the transferee of the USRPI generally has a withholding tax obligation under section 1445, which is generally 10 percent of the amount realized on the disposition. The withholding agent must report and pay over the tax withheld under section 1445 on Form 8288, ""U.S. Withholding Tax Return for Dispositions by Foreign Persons of U.S. Real Property Interests"", by the 20th day after the disposition of the USRPI. The foreign transferor also must report the gain subject to tax under section 897 by filing a U.S. income tax return. Any amounts withheld under section 1445 are credited against the foreign transferor's U.S. tax liability. Withholding under section 1445 can be reduced or eliminated pursuant to various nonrecognition provisions (e.g., certain re-  ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking and notice of public hearing. SUMMARY: This document contains proposed regulations to require the use of taxpayer identifying numbers on submissions under sections 897 and 1445. The proposed regulations are necessary to properly identify foreign taxpayers for which submissions are made for the reduction or elimination of tax under sections 897 and 1445. The proposed regulations also address miscellaneous items, such as the amendment to section 1445(e)(3) under the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996. This document also provides notice of a public hearing on these proposed regulations. DATES: Electronic or written comments and requests to speak (with outlines of oral comments) at the public hearing scheduled for November 13, 2002, must be submitted by October 23, 2002. ADDRESSES: Send submissions to: CC: ITA:RU (REG10687600), room 5226 Internal Revenue Service, POB 7604, Ben Franklin Station, Washington, DC 20044. In the alternative, submissions may be hand delivered Monday through Friday between the hours of 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. to: CC:ITA:RU (REG10687600), Courier's Desk, Internal Revenue Service, 1111 Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC. Alternatively, taxpayers may submit comments electronically directly to the IRS Internet site at www.irs.gov/regs. The  200234 I.R.B.  392  August 26, 2002   organizations under section 368(a)), pursuant to an applicable U.S. income tax treaty, by reason of the tax-exempt status of the foreign transferor, or in situations where the transferor's maximum tax liability under section 897 is less than the withholding tax. To reduce or eliminate the amount to be withheld under section 1445, either the transferor or transferee (acting as the withholding agent) may request a withholding certificate from the IRS citing the grounds for the reduction or elimination of withholding and including any supporting documentation or other evidence substantiating the request. A withholding certificate that is issued by the IRS prior to the disposition of the USRPI serves to notify the withholding agent that no withholding or reduced withholding is required. If an application for a withholding certificate is submitted before or on the date of the transfer (so it is considered to be pending with the IRS at the time of transfer), the withholding agent is not required to file the withholding tax return and pay over the withholding tax until 20 days after the date the IRS mails the withholding certificate or notice of denial. See  1.14451(c)(2)(A). An application for a withholding certificate after the date of transfer can be combined with an application for an early claim for refund. See  1.14453(g). Under section 6109(a)(1), Treasury and the IRS have the authority to issue regulations requiring taxpayers to obtain taxpayer identifying numbers (TINs) for placement on returns, statements, or other documents for the purpose of securing the proper identification of taxpayers. Under the section 6109 regulations, which govern the extent to which foreign persons must have TINs, a foreign person is not required to have a TIN for inclusion on a return, statement, or other document, unless the foreign person: (1) has ECI at any time during the taxable year, (2) has a U.S. office, U.S. place of business, or a U.S. fiscal or paying agent during the taxable year, or (3) files a tax return, an amended return, or a refund claim, excluding information returns, statements, or other documents. See  301.61091(b)(2). Explanation of Provisions The sections 897 and 1445 regulations do not require foreign transferors of USRPIs to provide TINs on withholding  tax returns, applications for withholding certificates, and other notices and elections unless the foreign transferor otherwise has previously obtained a TIN. The IRS proposes to amend regulations under sections 897 and 1445 (each discussed in greater detail below) to require foreign transferors to include TINs on such documents so that the IRS can better identify the foreign taxpayer and more easily match the applications, withholding tax returns, notices, and elections with the transferor's tax return for compliance purposes. For example, the use of the foreign transferor's TIN to match the withholding tax return with the foreign transferor's income tax return will facilitate verification of the amount of withholding tax that the foreign taxpayer may credit on its return. The use of the foreign transferor's TIN also will facilitate verification that the foreign transferor files a U.S. tax return reporting the transaction (which could be matched against a withholding tax return and any application for a withholding certificate that has been filed). In most cases, the requirement of including a TIN under the proposed regulations will not impose a new obligation on the foreign person. Such foreign person typically will be required to file a tax return for the year in which the property was sold, which requires the foreign person to obtain a TIN at that time. Accordingly, the proposed regulations simply would accelerate the time by which the foreign person is required to obtain a TIN. The IRS is considering ways to facilitate obtaining TINs in connection with transactions subject to sections 897 and 1445. For example, the IRS is considering approaches for combining an application for a reduced withholding certificate under  1.14453 with an application for a TIN. 1. Section 6109 Regulations Under section 6109, every person who makes a return, statement, or other document is required to furnish its TIN as required by regulation. Under the section 6109 regulations, a foreign person generally is required to have a TIN if (1) the foreign person has ECI at any time during the taxable year; (2) the foreign person has a U.S. office or place of business or a U.S. fiscal or paying agent during the taxable year; (3) the foreign person files a tax return, amended return, or a refund  claim (excluding information returns, statements, or documents).  301.61091(b)(2). A person is required to furnish the TIN of another person (including a foreign person) when filing a return, statement, or other document which requires the TIN of the other person, and the other person is required to have a TIN under the section 6109 regulations. If the person does not know the TIN of the other person, the first person must request it, and if this request is denied, then the first person must file an affidavit with the filing so stating. See  301.61091(c). The IRS and Treasury propose to amend the section 6109 regulations to include a specific reference to the new provisions requiring TINs for foreign taxpayers under sections 897 and 1445. The section 6109 regulations would be amended to provide that foreign persons will be required to have TINs for placement on any return, statement, or other document required by the regulations under section 897 or section 1445. See  301.61091(b)(2). The section 6109 regulations also would be amended to provide that another person (e.g., the transferee as withholding agent) making a return, statement, or other document will be required to furnish the TIN of a foreign person as required by the regulations under section 897 or section 1445. See  301.61091(c). 2. Section 1445 Regulations (a)  1.14451 In connection with the withholding requirements under section 1445, the transferee generally must report and pay over any tax withheld by the 20th day after the date of the transfer.  1.14451(b)(1). Form 8288 ""Withholding Tax Return"" and Form 8288A ""Statement of Withholding"" are used for this purpose. Form 8288A serves as a receipt of withholding tax reported and paid over and is stamped by the IRS upon receipt and mailed to the transferor. The transferor must attach the Form 8288A to its U.S. income tax return to verify the amount of withholding tax creditable on its return. Under  1.14451(d), Forms 8288 and 8288A only require the TIN of the transferor and the transferee to the extent the transferor and transferee otherwise have TINs. If the transferee is a U.S. person it  August 26, 2002  393  200234 I.R.B.   will have a TIN, and if the transferee is a foreign person, it must have or obtain a TIN under the section 6109 regulations when filing a Form 8288 (which is considered to be a tax return). A foreign transferor, however, will not have a TIN for placement on the Forms 8288 and 8288A, unless it is otherwise required to have one under the section 6109 regulations (e.g., the foreign person otherwise has ECI). The section 1445 regulations will be amended to provide that the transferors and transferees must have TINs for placement on the Forms 8288 and 8288A. Finally, the section 1445 regulations provide for various documents (including applications for withholding certificates) to be sent to the Assistant Commissioner (International). Section 1.14451(g)(10) provides the address of the Assistant Commissioner (International). Because of the restructuring of the IRS, the Office of the Assistant Commissioner (International) no longer exists, and its duties regarding the administration of the section 1445 regulations are performed, in general, by the Philadelphia Service Center. Section 1.14451(g)(10) and other provisions in the section 1445 regulations will be amended to reflect this change. (b)  1.14452 Under  1.14452(d)(2), a transferee is not required to withhold under section 1445, if, by reason of a nonrecognition provision of the Internal Revenue Code or a U.S. income tax treaty provision, the transferor is not required to recognize gain or loss with respect to the transfer. The transferor must notify the transferee of the nonrecognition provision or treaty provision, and the transferee must provide a copy of the transferor's notice to the IRS by the 20th day after the date of the transfer. Section 1.14459T specifies the information the notice must contain, such as identifying information of the transferor, a description of the transaction, and a brief summary of the law and facts supporting the claim of nonrecognition of gain on the transaction. The notice is required to include a TIN of the transferor only if the foreign transferor otherwise has a TIN.  The notice forwarded by the transferee to the IRS must include a cover letter identifying the transferee. The transferee must include its TIN on the cover letter only if it has one. The proposed regulations would withdraw section 1.14459T and incorporate it into  1.14452(d)(2). In addition, the information required for inclusion on the notice would be revised to provide that the transferor must have a TIN for inclusion on the notice of nonrecognition. The regulations also would be amended to provide that the transferee must have a TIN for placement on the cover letter. Certificates of Non-foreign Status Under  1.14452 Under  1.14452(b), no withholding is required under section 1445 if the transferor of a U.S. real property interest is not a foreign person. If the transferor provides a certificate of non-foreign status to the transferee of the U.S. real property interest prior to or at the time of the transfer, the transferee is not required to withhold under section 1445(a). The certificate of non-foreign status must certify that the transferor is not a foreign person, must set forth the transferor's name, identifying number and address, and must contain the transferor's signature under penalties of perjury. The IRS is considering requiring Form W9 to be used as certificates of nonforeign status under  1.14452(b). Form W9 generally contains the same information as a certificate of non-foreign status and currently is used in the context of section 1441 withholding to determine a taxpayer's non-foreign status. Because Form W9 is not now required in real estate transactions and because payments with respect to real estate transactions are exempt from backup withholding under  31.3406(g)2(e) (although Form W9 can be used to provide the TIN of the seller to the reporting person required to report the transaction on Form 1099 under  1.60454(l)), the IRS requests comments on the use of Form W9 in real estate transactions to avoid withholding under section 1445. The IRS believes that the use of Form W9 could ease compliance with section 1445.  (c)  1.14453 Section 1.14453 provides procedures for the reduction or elimination of withholding under section 1445 pursuant to a withholding certificate issued by the IRS. A withholding certificate may be issued by the IRS in cases where the transferor is exempt from U.S. tax, the transferor's maximum tax liability under section 897 is less than the withholding tax, or where the transferor or transferee enters into an agreement for the payment of tax with the IRS. A withholding certificate that is applied for prior to or on the date of the transfer notifies the transferee that reduced or no withholding is required. A withholding certificate that is applied for after a transfer has been made may authorize a normal refund or an early refund. Either the transferor or transferee may apply for a withholding certificate. Section  1.14453(b)(2) identifies the information that must be furnished on an application for a withholding certificate. It includes the name and address of the transferee and the transferee's TIN, but only if the transferee has a TIN. It also includes the name and address of all other parties to the transaction (e.g., transferors) and their TINs, but only if they have TINs. The applicant must determine if each party has a TIN, and if none exists for a particular party, the application must so state. The regulations would be amended to provide that the transferee and all other parties (e.g., transferors) must have TINs for placement on an application for a withholding certificate. The regulations would further provide that the application will be denied if the TINs of all the parties are not provided. (d)  1.14455 Under  1.14455, special rules are provided concerning withholding required under section 1445(e) on distributions and other transactions involving domestic or foreign corporations, partnerships, trusts, and estates. Paragraph (b)(2) provides that no withholding is required for transfers of a USRPI described in section 1445(e) if no gain or loss is required to be recognized by a foreign person under a nonrecognition provision of the Internal Revenue  200234 I.R.B.  394  August 26, 2002   Code or a provision of a U.S. income tax treaty. The entity or fiduciary otherwise required to withhold must deliver a notice of the nonrecognition transfer to the IRS by the 20th day after the transfer of the USRPI. The entity or fiduciary may obtain a withholding certificate from the IRS to confirm the applicability of a nonrecognition provision, but is not required to do so. The notice of a nonrecognition transfer delivered to the IRS must contain a description of the transfer and a supporting explanation of the claim of nonrecognition treatment, as well as identifying information of the entity or fiduciary submitting the notice and each foreign person with respect to which withholding would otherwise be required. The TINs of the entity or fiduciary and each foreign person are required to be furnished only if such persons otherwise have TINs. The regulations under 1.14455(b)(2)(ii) would be amended to provide that the entity or fiduciary and all foreign persons must have TINs to be furnished on the notice of nonrecognition. (e)  1.14456 Section 1.14456 provides procedures for obtaining a withholding certificate for distributions and other transactions involving domestic or foreign corporations, partnerships, trusts, and estates subject to withholding tax under section 1445(e) and  1.14455. The procedures for obtaining a withholding certificate are modeled after  1.14453, which provides the procedures for obtaining a withholding certificate under section 1445(a). Hence, the entity or fiduciary (acting as withholding agent) or the foreign taxpayer subject to section 897 can apply for a withholding certificate on the basis that the foreign person is exempt from U.S. tax, the transferor's maximum tax liability under section 897 is less than the withholding tax, or an agreement is entered into by the transferor or transferee for the payment of tax. Section 1.14456(b) identifies the information that must be furnished on an application for a withholding certificate. It includes the name, address of the foreign taxpayer subject to section 897 and the foreign taxpayer's TIN, but only if the taxpayer otherwise has a TIN. The regula-  tions will be amended to require the foreign taxpayer to have a TIN for placement on an application for a withholding certificate. 3. Section 897 Regulations (a)  1.8973 Section 1.8973 provides rules enabling a foreign corporation to make a section 897(i) election to be treated as a domestic corporation for purposes of sections 897 and 1445. A foreign corporation making a section 897(i) election is subject to all of the rules under section 897 and 1445 that apply to domestic corporations. For example, if a foreign corporation that has made the section 897(i) election is a USRPHC, interests in it are USRPIs that are subject to taxation under section 897 and withholding tax under section 1445. A foreign corporation that makes an election under section 897(i) is not treated as a domestic corporation for purposes of any other provision of the Code or regulations, except to the extent that it is required to consent to such treatment as a condition of making the election. The election under section 897(i) must include the name, address, and place and date of incorporation of the foreign corporation and the foreign corporation's TIN but only if the foreign corporation otherwise has a TIN. The regulations would be amended to require the electing foreign corporation to have a TIN for placement on the election. (b)  1.8975T Section  1.8975T provides that certain distributions of USRPIs (which otherwise qualify for nonrecognition treatment) are not subject to section 897 if any gain from a subsequent disposition of the USRPIs would be included in gross income of the distributee or transferee receiving the USRPI in the distribution. See, e.g.,  1.8975T(c)(2)(i). An interest will be considered subject to U.S. tax upon its subsequent disposition only if certain reporting requirements are satisfied. See  1.8975T(d)(1)(i). Under the reporting requirements, the distributor must file an income tax return for the taxable year of the distribution. The person filing the return must attach a document describing the distribution or exchange, including the  name and address of the distributee, and its TIN, but only to the extent it has one. See  1.8975T(d)(1)(iii). The regulations would be amended to require that the document attached to the return includes the TIN of the distributee. This is necessary to properly identify the foreign distributee which will be subject to section 897 upon a subsequent disposition of the USRPI. 4. Miscellaneous Items (a)  1445(e)(3) Section 1445(e)(3) provides that if a domestic corporation which is a U.S. real property holding corporation (or at any time during the preceding five year period was a U.S. real property holding corporation) distributes property to a foreign shareholder in redemption of stock under section 302 or in liquidation of the corporation, the corporation must withhold 10 percent of the amount distributed to the foreign shareholder. Withholding is not required if the domestic corporation was ""purged"" of its U.S. real property holding corporation status by disposing of all of its U.S. real property interests within the prior five-year period and recognizing gain (if any) pursuant to section 897(c)(1)(B). Section 1445(e)(3) was amended by the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 (Public Law 104188, Sec. 1704(c)) to provide that similar rules apply in the case of any distribution to which section 301 applies and which is not made out of earnings and profits of the domestic corporation. Because a section 301 distribution by a domestic corporation to a foreign shareholder is also governed by section 1441 (or 1442 or 1443), the section 1441 regulations provide coordination rules between withholding under sections 1445 and 1441 (or 1442 or 1443) in the case of section 301 distributions to foreign shareholders by a domestic corporation which is a U.S. real property holding corporation or was one at any time within the prior five-year period. See  1.14413(c)(4). In general,  1.14413(c)(4) provides that a domestic corporation may elect to withhold on the entire distribution under section 1441 (or 1442 or 1443), and not under section 1445, regardless of whether a portion of the distribution constitutes a return of basis or capital gain. Alternatively, a domestic corporation may elect to  August 26, 2002  395  200234 I.R.B.   withhold under both sections 1445 and 1441 (or 1442 or 1443), in which case the domestic corporation must withhold under section 1441 (or 1442 or 1443) on the portion of the distribution that is estimated to be a dividend under  1.1441 3(c)(2)(ii)(A) and must withhold under section 1445(e)(3) on the remainder of the distribution. A domestic corporation may withhold a reduced amount on the distribution under section 1445(e)(3) by obtaining a withholding certificate establishing that the amount of capital gain under section 301(c)(3) is less than the withholding tax otherwise due under section 1445(e)(3). Section 1.14455(e) currently provides that if a domestic corporation, the stock of which is a U.S. real property interest, distributes property to a foreign shareholder in a redemption of stock under section 302 or in liquidation of the corporation, the domestic corporation must withhold 10 percent of the fair market value of the property distributed to the foreign shareholder. Section 1.14455(e) would be amended to provide that withholding is required in the case of a distribution of property under section 301(c). A crossreference to  1.14413(c)(4), which provides the coordination rules for withholding between sections 1445 and 1441 (or 1442 or 1443), is provided. (b) Section 121 exclusion Prior to the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (Public Law 10534; 111 Stat. 788) (TRA 97), section 121 provided a one-time exclusion from gross income up to $125,000 for certain gains from the sale of a principal residence by a taxpayer that was 55 years or older. The amendment of section 121 under TRA 97 expanded the exclusion to all taxpayers (not just those 55 years of age and older) and increased the amount of the exclusion to $250,000 (or $500,000, in the case of a husband and wife filing a joint return). Section 121(e) denies the exclusion to nonresident alien taxpayers who expatriated from the United States and are subject to the provisions of section 877(a). For section 121 to apply, the taxpayer must have owned and used the property as a personal residence for periods aggregating 2 years or more during the 5-year period ending on the date of the sale. Section 121(a). An alien individual who owns and  has used a U.S. real property interest as a personal residence during the 5-year period prior to the date of sale may nevertheless be a nonresident alien at the time of sale and subject to sections 897 and 1445. In addition, certain alien individuals (for example, full-time diplomats or employees of international organizations), who may own and use a U.S. real property interest as a personal residence at the time of sale, are treated as nonresident alien individuals for tax purposes under section 7701(b). In connection with the amendments to section 121, section 1034 was repealed. Section 1034 had provided for nonrecognition of gain upon the sale of a personal residence provided that another personal residence of greater value was purchased within a specified period of time. Prior to the repeal of section 1034, withholding agents could rely on a notice of nonrecognition under  1.14452(b)(2) on certain section 1034 exchanges because section 1034 exchanges were treated as nonrecognition exchanges for purposes of sections 897 and 1445. See  1.8976T(a)(5). Section 121 is not treated as a nonrecognition exchange for purposes of sections 897 and 1445. See  1.8976T(a)(2). Therefore, withholding agents cannot rely on a notice of nonrecognition under  1.14452(b)(2) with respect to the section 121 exclusion, and dispositions of personal residences entitled to the section 121 exclusion are not entitled to a reduction in withholding absent a withholding certificate. Accordingly, the withholding certificate provisions of  1.14453(c) are proposed to be amended to provide that a claimed adjustment to the maximum tax liability on the disposition of a U.S. real property interest will include the section 121 exclusion if the claim includes information establishing that the transferor is entitled to the benefits of section 121. Because section 1034 has been repealed, the following regulatory provisions concerning section 1034 will be withdrawn effective on the date of its repeal:  1.8976T(a)(5),  1.8976T(a)(7), Examples 2 and 3, and  1.14459T(b)(6). (c) Section 1031 like-kind exchanges Section 1031(a) provides for the nonrecognition of gain or loss on the exchange of like-kind property which is held for productive use in a trade or business or  held for investment. Section 1031(a)(3) provides for the exchange of like-kind property in deferred exchanges, where the taxpayer has 45 days after it relinquishes the property to the transferee to identify replacement property and the transferee has until the earlier of 180 days or the due date of the tax return for the year of transfer to deliver such property to the transferor. In cases where there is a simultaneous exchange of like-kind U.S. real property interests, the foreign transferor can provide a notice of recognition under  1.14452(d)(2) to the transferee, and the transferee can rely on such notice because the like-kind exchange will be fully completed on the day of the exchange. In the case of a deferred like-kind exchange of U.S. real property interests, the issue has been raised whether the transferee can rely on a notice of nonrecognition under  1.14452(d)(2) when the exchange is not completed (because of the 45 day and 180 day rule) and the determination of nonrecognition is not known by the 20th day after receipt of the relinquished property by the transferee (when it has the obligation to pay withholding tax and file a withholding tax return, Form 8288). It has been the view of the IRS and Treasury that the transferee cannot rely on a notice of nonrecognition in the case of a deferred like-kind exchange, because the transferee cannot be assured that the exchange will qualify for nonrecognition treatment under section 1031. Although  1.14452(d)(2) does not apply to section 1031 transactions, taxpayers have requested withholding certificates under  1.14453 in the case of deferred likekind exchanges. This practice will be incorporated in the regulations by amending  1.14453(c) to provide that taxpayers may obtain withholding certificates in the case of deferred like-kind exchanges under section 1031(a)(3) (see also the safeharbor for reverse like-kind exchanges under Rev. Proc. 200037, 20002 C.B. 308). (d) Transfers by an entity treated as a disregarded entity for U.S. tax purposes Under  1.14452(a), a transferee generally has the duty to withhold under section 1445(a) if the transferor is a foreign person and the transferee is acquiring a U.S. real property interest. A transferee  200234 I.R.B.  396  August 26, 2002   generally is not required to withhold under section 1445(a) if the transferee receives a certificate of non-foreign status from the transferor without actual knowledge (or notice from an agent of the transferor or transferee) that the certificate is false.  1.14452(b)(2). While the transferee is not required to request a certificate of non-foreign status and may rely on other means to determine the non-foreign status of the transferor, the transferee will be subject to the liability imposed under section 1445 if the transferor is in fact a foreign person and the transferor has not received a certificate of non-foreign status.  1.14452(b)(1). Thus, the transferee may demand a certificate of non-foreign status and is entitled to withhold under section 1445 if a certificate of non-foreign status is not provided. Id. Taxpayers have inquired about the operation of sections 897 and 1445 where the legal entity transferring a U.S. real property interest is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for U.S. tax purposes, for example, under  301.77013 (disregarded entity). If the transferor is a disregarded entity, the owner (and not the entity) is treated as the transferor of property for U.S. tax purposes, including sections 897 and 1445. See, e.g.,  301.7701 3(a). Accordingly, if a disregarded entity disposes of a U.S. real property interest and its owner is a foreign person, the foreign person is treated as the transferor of the property and is subject to tax under sections 897 and 1445. If a disregarded entity disposes of a U.S. real property interest and its owner is a U.S. person, then the U.S. person is the transferor of the property and may provide a certificate of non-foreign status. In order to clarify the treatment of disregarded entities, the regulations are amended to provide that a disregarded entity may not provide a certificate of nonforeign status because the disregarded entity is not the transferor. The sample certifications which an entity may provide to the transferee with respect to its nonforeign status (as provided in  1.1445 2(b)(2)) are amended to include a certifi-  cation that the entity is not a disregarded entity for U.S. tax purposes. Proposed Effective Date These regulations are proposed to apply to transactions occurring 30 days or more after the date final regulations are published in the Federal Register. Special Analyses It has been determined that this notice of proposed rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) does not apply to these regulations, and because these regulations do not impose a collection of information on U.S. small entities, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) does not apply. Therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, this notice of proposed rulemaking will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business. Comments and Public Hearing Before these proposed regulations are adopted as final regulations, consideration will be given to any written comments (preferably a signed original and eight (8) copies) that are submitted timely to the IRS. The IRS and Treasury request comments on the clarity of the proposed regulations and how they may be made easier to understand. All comments will be available for public inspection and copying. A public hearing has been scheduled for November 13, 2002, beginning at 10:00 am, in room 6718, Internal Revenue Building, 1111 Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC. Because of access restrictions, visitors will not be admitted beyond the Internal Revenue Building lobby more than 30 minutes before the hearing starts. Remove Director, Foreign Operations District (""Director"")  The rules of 26 CFR 601.601(a)(3) apply to the hearing. Persons that wish to present oral comments at the hearing must submit timely written comments and an outline of the topics to be discussed and the time to be devoted to each topic (preferably a signed original and eight (8) copies) by October 23, 2002. A period of 10 minutes will be allotted to each person for making comments. An agenda showing the scheduling of the speakers will be prepared after the deadline for receiving outlines has passed. Copies of the agenda will be available free of charge at the hearing. Drafting Information The principal author of these regulations is Robert W. Lorence, Jr., of the Office of Associate Chief Counsel (International). However, other personnel from the IRS and Treasury Department participated in their development. ***** Proposed Amendments Regulations to the  Accordingly, 26 CFR part 1 is proposed to be amended as follows: PART 1-- INCOME TAXES Paragraph 1.

A disregarded entity may not certify that it is the transferor of a U.S. real property interest, as the disregarded entity is not the transferor for U.S. tax purposes, including sections 897 and 1445. Rather, the owner of the disregarded entity is treated as the transferor of property and must provide a certificate of non-foreign status to avoid withholding under section 1445. A disregarded entity for these purposes means an entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner under  301.77013 of this chapter, a qualified REIT subsidiary as defined in section 856(i), or a qualified subchapter S subsidiary under section 1361(b)(3)(B). Any domestic entity must include in its certification of non-foreign status with respect to the transfer a certification that it is not a disregarded entity. (iv) * * * (B) Entity transferor. ""Section 1445 of the Internal Revenue Code provides that a transferee of a U.S. real property interest must withhold tax if the transferor is a foreign person. For U.S. tax purposes (including section 1445), the owner of a disregarded entity (which has legal title to a U.S. real property interest under local law) will be the transferor of the property and not the disregarded entity. To inform the transferee that withholding of tax is not required upon the disposition of a U.S. real property interest by [name of transferor] , the undersigned hereby certifies the following on behalf of [name of the transferor]:  1. [Name of transferor] is not a foreign corporation, foreign partnership, foreign trust, or foreign estate (as those terms are defined in the Internal Revenue Code and Income Tax Regulations); 2.

No particular form is required for a transferor's notice to a transferee that the transferor is not required to recognize gain or loss with respect to a transfer. The notice must be verified as true and signed under penalties of perjury by the transferor, by a responsible officer in the case of a corporation, by a general partner in the case of a partnership, and by a trustee or equivalent fiduciary in the case of a trust or estate. The following information must be set forth in paragraphs labeled to correspond with the designation set forth as follows-- (A) A statement that the document submitted constitutes a notice of a nonrecognition transaction or a treaty provision pursuant to the requirements of  1.1445 2(d)(2); (B) The name, identifying number, and home address (in the case of an individual) or office address (in the case of an entity) of the transferor submitting the notice;  (C) A statement that the transferor is not required to recognize any gain or loss with respect to the transfer; (D) A brief description of the transfer; and (E) A brief summary of the law and facts supporting the claim that recognition of gain or loss is not required with respect to the transfer. (iv) No notice allowed. The provisions of this paragraph (d)(2) do not apply to exclusions from income under section 121 and to non-simultaneous like-kind exchanges under section 1031 where the transferee cannot determine that the exchange has been completed and all the conditions for nonrecognition have been satisfied at the time it is otherwise required to pay the section 1445 withholding tax and file the withholding tax return (Form 8288, ""U.S. Withholding Tax Return for Dispositions by Foreign Persons of U.S. Real Property Interests""). In these cases, the transferee is excused from withholding only upon the timely application for and receipt of a withholding certificate under  1.14453 (see  1.14453(b)(5) and (6) for specific rules applicable to transactions under sections 121 and 1031). ***** Par. 10.

The application must set forth the name, address, and identifying number of the person submitting the application (specifying whether that person is the transferee or transferor), and the name, address, and identifying number of other parties to the transaction (specifying whether each such party is a transferee or transferor). The Service will deny the application if complete information, including the identifying numbers of all the parties, is not provided. Thus, for example, the applicant should determine if an identifying number exists for each party, and, if none exists for a particular party, the applicant should notify the particular party of the obligation to get an identifying number before the application can be submitted to the Service. The address provided in the case of an individual must be that individual's home address, and the address provided in the case of an entity must be that entity's office address. A mailing address may be provided in addition to, but not in lieu of, a home address or office address. ***** (5) Special rule for exclusions from income under section 121. A withholding certificate may be sought on the basis of a section 121 exclusion as a reduction in the amount of tax due under paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section. The application must include information establishing that the transferor, who is a nonresident alien individual at the time of the sale (and is therefore subject to sections 897 and 1445) is entitled to claim the benefits of section 121. For example, a claim for reduced withholding as a result of section 121 must include information that the transferor occupied the U.S. real property interest as his or her personal residence for the required period of time. (6) Special rule for like-kind exchanges under Section 1031. A withholding certificate may be requested with respect to a like-kind exchange under section 1031 as a transaction subject to a nonrecognition  provision under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. The application must include information substantiating the requirements of section 1031. The IRS may require additional information during the course of the application process to determine that the requirements of section 1031 are satisfied. In the case of a deferred like-kind exchange, the transferee is excused from withholding only if the transferee or transferor submits an application for a withholding certificate prior to or on the date of transfer, in which case the withholding tax will be placed in escrow pursuant to procedures established by the IRS and ultimately paid to the IRS if the withholding certificate is denied or released for the benefit of the taxpayer if the withholding certificate is granted. See  1.14451(c)(2) for rules concerning delayed reporting and payment where an application for a withholding certificate has been submitted to the IRS prior to or on the date of transfer. *****  1.14454 [Amended] Par. 11.

Section 301.61091 is amended as follows: 1. In paragraph (b)(2)(v), remove the word ""and"".  ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking and notice of public hearing. SUMMARY: This document contains proposed regulations under section 1503(d) regarding the events that require the recapture of dual consolidated losses. These regulations are issued to facilitate compliance by taxpayers with the dual consolidated loss provisions. The proposed regulations generally provide that certain events will not trigger recapture of a dual consolidated loss or payment of the associated interest charge. The proposed regulations provide for the reporting of certain information in such cases. This document  The collection of information contained in this notice of proposed rulemaking has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3507(d)). Comments on the collection of information should be sent to the Office of Management and Budget, Attn: Desk Officer for the Department of the Treasury, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503, with copies to the Internal Revenue Service, Attn: IRS Reports Clearance Officer, W:CAR:MP:FP:S, Washington, DC 20224. Comments on the collection of information should be received by September 30, 2002. Comments are specifically requested concerning:  200234 I.R.B.  402  August 26, 2002   Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the Internal Revenue Service, including whether the information will have practical utility; The accuracy of the estimated burden associated with the proposed collection of information (see below); How the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected may be enhanced; How the burden of complying with the proposed collection of information may be minimized, including through the application of automated collection techniques or other forms of information technology; and Estimates of capital or start-up costs and costs of operation, maintenance, and purchase of service to provide information. The collection of information in this proposed regulation is in  1.1503 2(g)(2)(iv)(A)(4) and (5). This information is required to ensure the proper performance of the function of the IRS because it notifies the IRS that a future triggering event may require the recapture of specified dual consolidated losses by the new consolidated group. This information will be used to identify the acquisition of an unaffiliated dual resident corporation, an unaffiliated domestic owner of a dual resident corporation, or a consolidated group that includes a dual resident corporation or a domestic owner. The identification of such an acquisition pursuant to these regulations may allow taxpayers to avoid or defer recapture of a dual consolidated loss and the payment of an interest charge. The collection of information is mandatory. The likely respondents will be corporations acquiring overseas business operations. Estimated total annual reporting and/or recordkeeping burden: 60 hours. Estimated average annual burden hours per respondent and/or recordkeeper: 2 hours. Estimated number of respondents and/or recordkeepers: 30 Estimated annual frequency of responses: On occasion. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a valid control number assigned by the Office of Management and Budget.  Books or records relating to a collection of information must be retained as long as their contents may become material in the administration of any internal revenue law. Generally, tax returns and tax return information are confidential, as required by 26 U.S.C. 6103. Background On September 8, 1989, proposed and temporary regulations implementing  1503(d) were published in the Federal Register at 54 FR 37314. Written comments were received in response to the proposed regulations, and a public hearing was held on March 2, 1990. After consideration of all the comments, the proposed regulations were amended and adopted as final regulations by, T.D. 8434, 19922 C.B. 240, on September 9, 1992, and published in the Federal Register at 57 FR 41079. Explanation of Provisions Section 1503(d) generally provides that a ""dual consolidated loss"" of a domestic corporation cannot offset the taxable income of any other member of the corporation's consolidated group. The statute, however, authorizes the issuance of regulations permitting the use of a dual consolidated loss to offset the income of a domestic affiliate if the loss does not offset the income of a foreign corporation under foreign law. Section 1.15032(g)(2) of the final regulations permits a taxpayer to elect to use a dual consolidated loss of a dual resident corporation or separate unit to offset the income of a domestic affiliate by entering into an agreement under which the taxpayer certifies that the dual consolidated loss has not been, and will not be, used to offset the income of another person under the laws of a foreign country. Section 1.15032(g)(2)(iii) of the final regulations provides that, in the year of a so-called ""triggering event,"" the taxpayer must recapture and report as gross income the amount of a dual consolidated loss subject to this agreement, as well as pay an interest charge. Two such triggering events are (1) an unaffiliated dual resident corporation that filed the agreement or an unaffiliated domestic owner of a separate unit that filed the agreement becomes a member of a  consolidated group, consisting of itself and a formerly unaffiliated domestic corporation or an existing consolidated group; and (2) a consolidated group that filed the agreement and that includes a dual resident corporation or domestic owner of a separate unit is acquired by an unaffiliated domestic corporation or a consolidated group, resulting in a new consolidated group. Section 1.15032(g)(2)(iv)(B) of the final regulations, however, provides that these events are not considered to be triggering events under certain conditions. One such condition is that the parties to the transaction enter into a closing agreement with the IRS, as provided in section 7121 of the Code. Thus, in the first case described above, the unaffiliated dual resident corporation or unaffiliated domestic owner that filed the agreement and the unaffiliated domestic corporation or consolidated group must enter into a closing agreement; or, in the second case described above, the acquired consolidated group and the acquiring unaffiliated domestic corporation or consolidated group must enter into a closing agreement. The closing agreement must provide that the unaffiliated dual resident corporation, unaffiliated domestic owner, or consolidated group and the unaffiliated domestic corporation or existing consolidated group will be jointly and severally liable for the total amount of the recapture of the dual consolidated loss and the interest charge if there is a subsequent triggering event. The IRS and Treasury believe that this requirement, that the parties to the transaction enter into a closing agreement with the IRS, imposes an unnecessary administrative burden in cases where liability for the dual consolidated loss recapture amount and interest charge would be imposed by  1.15026. Section 1.15026 generally provides that the common parent corporation and each member of a consolidated group are severally liable for the tax computed on their consolidated U.S. income tax return for the taxable year. In certain circumstances, the several liability imposed by  1.15026 provides for liability comparable to that provided by a closing agreement under  1.1503 2(g)(2)(iv)(B)(2) and section 7121 of the Code. Accordingly, the proposed regulations amend the final regulations by providing that a triggering event generally does not  August 26, 2002  403  200234 I.R.B.   occur when an unaffiliated dual resident corporation or unaffiliated domestic owner becomes a member of a consolidated group. Under  1.15026, the dual resident corporation or domestic owner, as well as the other members of the consolidated group of which it becomes a member, are liable for the recapture amount and the interest charge in the event of a subsequent triggering event. The proposed regulations would remove  1.1503 2(g)(2)(iv)(B)(1)(ii) of the final regulations, which addresses this particular set of circumstances only. The proposed regulations similarly would amend the final regulations by providing that a triggering event generally does not occur when a dual resident corporation or domestic owner that is a member of a consolidated group that filed an agreement under  1.15032(g)(2) becomes a member of another consolidated group in an acquisition, so long as each member of the acquired group that is an includible corporation under  1504(b) is included immediately after the acquisition in a consolidated U.S. income tax return filed by the acquiring group. Under  1.15026, each member of the new consolidated group, including each member of the former group that included the dual resident corporation or domestic owner, is liable for the recapture amount and the interest charge upon the occurrence of a subsequent triggering event. In both cases described in the proposed regulations, a statement must be attached to the first consolidated return of the new consolidated group that includes the dual resident corporation or domestic owner. The statement must reference these proposed regulations and must set forth the information required in  1.1503 2(g)(2)(i)(B), the amount of each dual consolidated loss, and the year incurred. The proposed regulations further require the continued reporting of certain information, when applicable, by the new consolidated group on its subsequently filed consolidated U.S. income tax returns, as provided in  1.15032(g)(2)(vi). Proposed Effective Date These regulations amending the dual consolidated loss rules under  1.15032 are proposed to apply to transactions otherwise constituting triggering events occurring on or after August 1, 2002.  Special Analyses It has been determined that this notice of proposed rule making is not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It is hereby certified that these regulations do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This certification is based on the fact that these regulations will primarily affect affiliated groups of corporations that also have a foreign affiliate, which tend to be larger businesses. Moreover, the number of taxpayers affected and the average burden are minimal. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) does not apply to these regulations, and because these regulations do not impose a collection of information on small entities, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) does not apply. Therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Code, these regulations will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on their impact on small business.

The authority citation for part 1 is amended by adding an entry in numerical order to read in part as follows: Authority: 26 U.S.C. 7805 * * *  1.15032 also issued under 26 U.S.C. 1502 * * * Par. 2. In  1.15032, paragraphs (g)(2)(iv)(A)(4), (5) and (D) are added; paragraph (g)(2)(iv)(B)(1)(ii) is removed and paragraphs (g)(2)(iv)(B)(1)(iii) and (iv) are redesignated as paragraphs (g)(2)(iv)(B)(1)(ii) and (iii), respectively; and a sentence is added to paragraph (h)(1) to read as follows:  1.15032 Dual Consolidated Loss. ***** (g) * * * (2) * * * (iv) * * * (A) Acquisition by a member of the consolidated group. ***** (4) An unaffiliated dual resident corporation or unaffiliated domestic owner that filed an agreement under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section becomes a member of a consolidated group. A statement referencing this paragraph (g)(2)(iv)(A)(4) must be attached to the timely filed (including extensions) consolidated income tax return of the consolidated group, setting forth the information required in paragraph (g)(2)(i)(B) of this section, the amount of each dual consolidated loss, and  200234 I.R.B.  404  August 26, 2002   the year incurred. The consolidated group also must continue to comply in subsequent years with the reporting requirements in paragraph (g)(2)(vi) of this section for each dual consolidated loss. (5) A dual resident corporation, or domestic owner, that is a member of a consolidated group that filed an agreement under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section (the acquired group) becomes a member of another consolidated group (the acquiring group), provided that each member of the acquired group that is an includible corporation (within the meaning of section 1504(b)) in the new consolidated group must be included immediately after the acquisition in a consolidated income tax return filed by the acquiring group. A statement referencing this paragraph (g)(2)(iv)(A)(5) must be attached to the timely filed (including extensions) consolidated income tax return of the acquiring group, setting forth the information required in paragraph (g)(2)(i)(B) of this section, the amount of each dual consolidated loss, and the year incurred. The acquiring group also must continue to comply in subsequent years with the reporting requirements in paragraph (g)(2)(vi) of this section for each dual consolidated loss. ***** (D) Example. The following example illustrates the operation of paragraph (g)(2)(iv)(A)(5) of this section. Example.(i) Facts. C is the common parent of a consolidated group (the ""C Group"") that includes DRC, a domestic corporation. DRC is a dual resident corporation and incurs a dual consolidated loss in its taxable year ending December 31, Year 1. The C Group complies with paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section and its associated requirements with respect to the Year 1 dual consolidated loss. The C Group does not incur a dual consolidated loss in Year 2. On December 31, Year 2, stock constituting section 1504(a)(2) ownership of C is acquired by D, an unaffiliated domestic corporation. Immediately after and as a result of the acquisition, the C Group ceases to exist, and all the C Group members, including DRC, become includible members of a consolidated group of which D is the common parent (the ""D Group""). (ii) Acquisition not a triggering event. Under paragraph (g)(2)(iv)(A)(5) of this section, the acquisition by D of the C Group is not an event requiring the recapture of the Year 1 dual consolidated loss of DRC, or the payment of an interest charge, as described in paragraph (g)(2)(vii) of this section, provided that the D Group files the statement described in paragraph (g)(2)(iv)(A)(5) of this section and continues to comply with the reporting requirements of paragraph (g)(2)(vi) of this section.  (iii) Subsequent event. A triggering event occurs on December 31, Year 3, that requires recapture by DRC of the dual consolidated loss it incurred for Year 1 and any dual consolidated loss incurred in Year 3, as well as the payment of an interest charge, as provided in paragraph (g)(2)(vii) of this section. Each member of the D Group, including DRC and the other former members of the C Group, is severally liable under  1.15026 for the additional tax (and the interest charge) due upon the recapture of the dual consolidated loss of DRC.

(Filed by the Office of the Federal Register on July 31, 2002, 8:45 a.m., and published in the issue of the Federal Register for August 1, 2002, 67 F.R. 49892)  Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and Notice of Public Hearing Compensatory Stock Options Under Section 482 REG10635902 AGENCY: Internal (IRS), Treasury. Revenue Service  ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking and notice of public hearing. SUMMARY: This document contains proposed regulations that provide guidance regarding the application of the rules of section 482 governing qualified cost sharing arrangements. These proposed regulations provide guidance regarding the treatment of stock-based compensation for purposes of the rules governing qualified cost sharing arrangements and for purposes of the comparability factors to be considered under the comparable profits method. This document also provides notice of a public hearing on these proposed regulations.  August 26, 2002  405  200234 I.R.B.   The accuracy of the estimated burden associated with the proposed collection of information (see below); How the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected may be enhanced; How the burden of complying with the proposed collection of information may be minimized, including through the application of automated collection techniques or other forms of information technology; and Estimates of capital or start-up costs and costs of operation, maintenance, and purchase of services to provide information. The collection of information requirements are in proposed  1.482 7(d)(2)(iii)(B) and 1.4827(j)(2)(i)(F). This information is required by the IRS to monitor compliance with the federal tax rules for determining stock-based compensation costs related to intangible development to be shared among controlled participants in qualified cost sharing arrangements. The likely respondents are taxpayers who enter into these arrangements. Responses to this collection of information are required to determine these taxpayers' proper shares of stock-based compensation costs incurred with respect to these arrangements. Section 1.4827(d)(2)(iii)(B) of the proposed regulations provides that controlled participants may elect an alternative method of measurement of certain stockbased compensation by clearly referring to the election in the written cost sharing agreement required under existing regulations or by amending a cost sharing agreement already in effect to refer to the election. Section 1.4827(j)(2)(i)(F) requires controlled participants to maintain documentation necessary to establish the amount taken into account as operating expenses attributable to stock-based compensation, including the method of measurement and timing used in computing that amount, and the data, as of the date of grant, used to identify stock-based compensation related to the development of intangibles. Estimated total annual reporting and/or recordkeeping burden: 2,000 hours. Estimated average annual burden hours per respondent and/or recordkeeper: The estimated annual burden per respondent  varies from 2 hours to 7 hours, depending on individual circumstances, with an estimated average of 4 hours. Estimated number of respondents and/or recordkeepers: 500. Estimated frequency of responses: Annually. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a valid control number assigned by the Office of Management and Budget. Books or records relating to a collection of information must be retained as long as their contents may become material in the administration of any internal revenue law. Generally, tax returns and tax return information are confidential, as required by 26 U.S.C. 6103. Background Section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code generally provides that the Secretary may allocate gross income, deductions and credits between or among two or more taxpayers owned or controlled by the same interests in order to prevent evasion of taxes or clearly to reflect income. On July 8, 1994, Treasury and the IRS published in the Federal Register (59 FR 34988) final regulations (T.D. 8552, 19942 C.B. 93) under section 482 in areas other than cost sharing. On December 20, 1995, Treasury and the IRS published in the Federal Register (60 FR 65553) final cost sharing regulations (T.D. 8632, 19961 C.B. 85), effective for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1996. Amendments to T.D. 8632 were published in the Federal Register on May 13, 1996, at 61 FR 21955 (T.D. 8670, 19961 C.B. 99), and on January 3, 2001, at 66 FR 280 (T.D. 8930, 20011 C.B. 433). The 1994 final regulations under section 482 contain general provisions at  1.4821 describing the arm's length standard and the best method rule. The final cost sharing regulations at  1.4827 generally require that controlled participants in a qualified cost sharing arrangement share intangible development costs in proportion to their shares of the reasonably anticipated benefits attributable to the development of the intangibles covered by the arrangement. These proposed regulations clarify that stock-based compensation is taken into account in determining  the operating expenses treated as a controlled participant's intangible development costs for purposes of the cost sharing provisions; provide rules for measuring the cost associated with stock-based compensation; clarify that the utilization and treatment of stock-based compensation is appropriately taken into account as a comparability factor for purposes of the comparable profits method under  1.4825; and clarify the coordination of the cost sharing rules of  1.4827 with the arm's length standard as set forth in  1.4821. Explanation of Provisions Overview The Tax Reform Act of 1986, Public Law 99514, 100 Stat. 2085, 2561 et seq. (reprinted at 19863 C.B. (Vol 1) 1, 478) (the Act), amended section 482 to require that consideration for intangible property transferred in a controlled transaction be commensurate with the income attributable to the intangible. The legislative history of the Act indicated that in adding this commensurate with income standard to section 482, Congress did not intend to preclude the use of bona fide research and development cost sharing arrangements as an appropriate method of allocating income attributable to intangibles among related parties, ""if and to the extent such agreements are consistent with the purpose of this provision that the income allocated among the parties reasonably reflect the actual economic activity undertaken by each. Under such a bona fide cost-sharing arrangement, the cost-sharer would be expected to bear its portion of all research and development costs. . . ."" H.R. Rep. No. 99841, at II638 (1986) (the Conference Report). The Conference Report recommended that the IRS conduct a comprehensive study and consider whether the regulations under section 482 (issued in 1968) should be modified in any respect. In response to this directive, on October 18, 1988, Treasury and the IRS issued a study of intercompany pricing (the White Paper), published as Notice 88123, 19882 C.B. 458. With respect to cost sharing arrangements, the White Paper observed that Congress intended such arrangements to produce results consistent with the purposes of the commensurate with income standard in section 482, and in particular that allocations of income among the par-  200234 I.R.B.  406  August 26, 2002   ticipants reasonably reflect the participants' respective economic activity. 19882 C.B. at 459, 495. The White Paper further observed that Congress intended that Treasury and the IRS apply and interpret the commensurate with income standard consistently with the arm's length standard. 19882 C.B. at 458, 477. Section 1.4821 of the 1994 final regulations provides that a controlled transaction meets the arm's length standard if the results of the transaction are consistent with the results that would have been realized if uncontrolled taxpayers had engaged in the same transaction under the same circumstances. A method selected under the best method rule is used to determine whether a controlled transaction produces an arm's length result. The regulations reference  1.4822 through 1.4826 as providing specific methods to be used in this determination. Section 1.4827 of the 1995 final regulations implements the commensurate with income standard in the context of cost sharing arrangements. The final cost sharing regulations require that controlled participants in a qualified cost sharing arrangement share all costs incurred that are related to the development of intangibles in proportion to their shares of the reasonably anticipated benefits attributable to that development. Section 1.4827(d)(1) defines these intangible development costs as including operating expenses as defined in  1.4825(d)(3), other than depreciation or amortization, plus an arm's length rental charge determined under  1.482 2(c) for the use of any tangible property made available to the qualified cost sharing arrangement. Section 1.4825(d)(3) defines operating expenses, for purposes of the comparable profits method under section 482, as including all expenses not included in cost of goods sold except for interest expense, foreign and domestic income taxes, and any other expenses not related to the operation of the relevant business activity. In the context of cost sharing, the relevant business activity is the development of intangibles covered by the cost sharing arrangement. Since the promulgation of the final cost sharing regulations in 1995, the issue has been raised whether operating expenses within the meaning of  1.4827(d)(1) include compensation provided by a controlled participant in the form of stock  options. Related questions have been posed in this context regarding the interaction between the arm's length standard and the cost sharing regulations. These proposed regulations amend the final regulations to clarify that stock-based compensation must be taken into account in determining operating expenses under  1.4827(d)(1) and to provide rules for measuring stock-based compensation costs. These proposed regulations also clarify that stock-based compensation should be taken into account in comparability determinations pursuant to the comparable profits method under  1.4825. Finally, the proposed regulations amend the final regulations to include express provisions to coordinate the cost sharing rules of  1.4827 with the arm's length standard as set forth in  1.4821. Inclusion of Stock-Based Compensation in Intangible Development Costs The proposed regulations provide that in determining a controlled participant's operating expenses within the meaning of  1.4827(d)(1), all compensation, including stock-based compensation, must be taken into account. The proposed regulations also provide rules for measuring the operating expenses attributable to stockbased compensation. The definition of stock-based compensation for purposes of these proposed regulations is broad, comprising any compensation provided by a controlled participant to an employee or independent contractor in the form of equity instruments, stock options, or rights in (or determined by reference to) such instruments or options, regardless of whether the compensation ultimately is settled in the form of cash, stock, or other property. Thus, these proposed regulations are intended to reach such forms of compensation as restricted stock, nonstatutory stock options, statutory stock options (incentive stock options described in section 422(b) and options granted under an employee stock purchase plan described in section 423(b)), stock appreciation rights, and phantom stock. Statutory stock options are within the scope of the definition regardless of whether the employer is entitled to an income tax deduction with respect to those options.  The proposed regulations provide that the determination of whether stock-based compensation is related to the development of intangibles covered by the qualified cost sharing arrangement is to be made as of the date the stock-based compensation is granted. For example, controlled participants must share the costs attributable to stock-based compensation that is granted to an employee who, at the time of grant, is performing research services related to the qualified cost sharing arrangement. Treasury and the IRS believe that this rule appropriately identifies the stock-based compensation to be shared because the grant of compensation generally is the economic event most closely associated in time with the services being compensated. Because a controlled participant may choose whether to provide stockbased or cash compensation, this rule also promotes neutrality of treatment as among various forms of compensation. Finally, because the grant-date identification rule applies irrespective of the method used by the controlled participant to measure or determine the timing of inclusion of stockbased compensation in the intangible development costs to be shared, the rule ensures that the same items of stock-based compensation will be taken into account under any method, thus promoting neutrality in the choice of measurement method afforded by the proposed regulations. In applying the grant-date identification rule in cases where a stock option is repriced or otherwise modified, the rules of section 424(h) and related regulations will be used to determine whether the grant of a new stock option has occurred. Treasury and the IRS recognize that tax and other accounting principles permit the cost associated with stock-based compensation to be measured and taken into account as of different points in time and under various methodologies for different purposes. For example, for general income tax purposes, the amount of compensation taxed to an employee and deductible by an employer upon exercise of a stock option not governed by sections 421424 (commonly referred to as a nonstatutory stock option) generally is measured by the ""spread"" between the option price and the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of exercise. See  83(a), 83(h), 1.831(a)(1), 1.836(a)(1).  August 26, 2002  407  200234 I.R.B.   For various other tax purposes, however, the IRS has adopted modified versions of economic pricing models, such as the Black-Scholes model, for valuing stock options at specific points in time prior to exercise. See Rev. Proc. 9834, 19981 C.B. 983 (estate and gift tax valuation); Rev. Proc. 200213, 20028 I.R.B. 549, as modified by Rev. Proc. 200245, 200227 I.R.B. 40 (measurement of stock-optionbased golden parachute payments under sections 280G and 4999). Pricing models also have been adopted in the context of financial accounting. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) refers to pricing models for measurement of the stock-based compensation expense that a company is required to report at ""fair value,"" either as a charge to income or, at the company's option, in a pro forma footnote disclosure. See FASB Statement 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (October 1995). Generally accepted pricing models can be applied at the date of grant to estimate the economic cost of a stock option to the issuer. General support for the use of economic measures of cost in the transfer pricing context may be found in the legislative history of the commensurate with income standard and in the White Paper, which state that to be consistent with the commensurate with income standard, cost sharing arrangements must ""reflect the actual economic activity"" of participants. Conference Report at II-638 and White Paper at 19882 C.B. 495. In establishing rules for measurement of the operating expenses attributable to stock-based compensation for cost sharing purposes, Treasury and the IRS believe that due regard must be given to the emphasis placed on economic factors in the legislative history of the commensurate with income standard and in the White Paper. Treasury and the IRS also recognize the importance of providing rules that are administrable. The proposed regulations prescribe a general rule of measurement based primarily on the amount and timing of the income tax deduction associated with stockbased compensation, while in certain cases permitting controlled participants in a qualified cost sharing arrangement to elect a rule of measurement with respect to stock options based on the amount and timing of the fair value of the option that  is required to be computed for purposes of financial accounting in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). To provide for uniform measurement of the cost associated with both statutory and nonstatutory stock options, the general deduction-based measurement rule is applied as if section 421 did not apply upon the exercise of a statutory stock option. Thus, although section 421 generally disallows compensation deductions with respect to the exercise of statutory stock options except in the case of certain disqualifying dispositions, the proposed regulations treat the exercise of a statutory stock option as giving rise to a deduction for purposes of the deduction-based measurement rule. Consequently, the operating expense with respect to all stock options, whether statutory or nonstatutory, generally will be measured by the ""spread"" and taken into account as of the date the stock option is exercised. To place a foreign controlled participant on an equal footing with a United States controlled participant, an amount is treated as deductible by a foreign controlled participant, solely for purposes of the general deduction-based measurement rule, as if the amount were paid or incurred by a United States taxpayer, even if the foreign controlled participant is not subject to United States taxing jurisdiction and so would not otherwise be entitled to a deduction under United States income tax law. Solely for purposes of the general deduction-based measurement rule, any item of stock-based compensation that is eligible to be exercised and that remains outstanding on the expiration or termination of a qualified cost sharing arrangement will be treated as being exercised immediately before the expiration or termination, provided that the fair market value of the underlying stock at that time exceeds the price at which the stock-based compensation is exercisable. The result of this treatment is that the excess of the fair market value of the underlying stock over the price at which the stock-based compensation is exercisable is taken into account as an operating expense for the taxable year in which the qualified cost sharing arrangement expires or terminates. This special rule would apply, for example, in the case of a currently exercis-  able statutory stock option or a substantially vested nonstatutory stock option where the fair market value of the underlying stock exceeds the option price at the time the qualified cost sharing arrangement is terminated. The rule ensures that controlled participants take into account for cost sharing purposes all stock-based compensation that is attributable to the development of intangibles and has become exercisable during the term of the cost sharing arrangement. In cases where significant amounts of stock-based compensation have been granted, but are not exercisable at the time of the termination of the arrangement, the IRS anticipates that factual issues regarding the termination of the qualified cost sharing arrangement will arise if the arrangement is reinstated. A similar rule applies if, during the term of the qualified cost sharing arrangement, a newly granted stock option is determined to result from a repricing or other modification of another stock option and is not related to the development of intangibles at the time of the modification. In this situation, an amount is taken into account for purposes of the general deduction-based measurement rule as if the original stock option had been exercised immediately before the modification. The proposed regulations permit an elective method of measurement and timing with respect to options on publicly traded stock of companies subject to financial reporting under U.S. GAAP, provided that the stock is traded on a United States securities market. Under the election, the amount of the operating expense associated with compensatory stock options is their ""fair value,"" generally measured by reference to economic pricing models as of the date of grant, as reflected either as a charge against income or as a footnote disclosure in the company's audited financial statements, in compliance with current U.S. GAAP. Where the election is made with respect to stock in a company that does not take stock-based compensation expense as a charge against income for financial accounting purposes but rather chooses, as permitted by current U.S. GAAP (for example, FASB Statement 123), to disclose such compensation in a footnote to the financial statements, stockbased compensation is taken into account  200234 I.R.B.  408  August 26, 2002   in the same amount, and as of the same time, as the pro forma fair value figures reflected in the footnote. The election to measure the operating expense associated with compensatory stock options in accordance with financial accounting rules must be clearly referenced in the written cost sharing agreement required under  1.4827(b)(4) and must bind all controlled participants. A transition rule permits controlled participants to amend pre-existing cost sharing agreements not later than the latest due date (without regard to extensions) for an income tax return of a controlled participant for the first taxable year beginning after the effective date of final regulations incorporating this rule. The proposed regulations contain consistency rules to ensure that all controlled participants in a qualified cost sharing arrangement normally will use the same method of measurement for all options on publicly traded stock with respect to that arrangement. Once a method of measurement has been adopted with respect to stock options granted in a taxable year following the effective date of the proposed regulations, the method of measurement may not be changed for those stock options. With respect to subsequently granted stock options to which the transition rule does not apply, the proposed regulations provide that a method of measurement different from that adopted following the effective date of the proposed regulations may be adopted only with the consent of the Commissioner. To ensure that taxpayers maintain documentation supporting all amounts taken into account as operating expenses attributable to stock-based compensation, these proposed regulations add to the documentation requirements of  1.4827(j)(2)(i) an item specifically relating to stock-based compensation. Treatment of Stock-Based Compensation Under Other Provisions The treatment of stock-based compensation as a cost or operating expense for purposes of the transfer pricing of services and for purposes of applying the comparable profits method will be considered by Treasury and the IRS in a separate regulation project. Accordingly, these regulations do not propose amendments to the definitions of cost or operating expense in   1.4822(b) or  1.4825(d)(3). However, these proposed regulations amend  1.4825(c)(2)(iv) to clarify that in applying the comparable profits method, material differences among the tested party and uncontrolled comparables with respect to the utilization or treatment of stockbased compensation are an appropriate basis for comparability adjustments. Coordination of Cost Sharing With the Arm's Length Standard These proposed regulations add express provisions coordinating the cost sharing rules of  1.4827 with the arm's length standard as set forth in  1.4821. New  1.4827(a)(3) clarifies that in order for a qualified cost sharing arrangement to produce results consistent with an arm's length result within the meaning of  1.4821(b)(1), all requirements of  1.4827 must be met, including the requirement that each controlled participant's share of intangible development costs equal its share of reasonably anticipated benefits attributable to the development of intangibles. The proposed regulations also make amendments to  1.4821 to clarify that  1.4827 provides the specific method to be used to evaluate whether a qualified cost sharing arrangement produces results consistent with an arm's length result, and to clarify that under the best method rule, the provisions of  1.4827 set forth the applicable method with respect to qualified cost sharing arrangements. Through these new provisions, Treasury and the IRS intend to clarify that all of the specific rules necessary to the determination of costs, reasonably anticipated benefits and other aspects of qualified cost sharing arrangements are either contained or cross-referenced within  1.4827. Thus, for example, regarding buy-in payments with respect to pre-existing intangibles made available to qualified cost sharing arrangements,  1.4827(a)(2) and 1.4827(g) cross-reference various other sections of the regulations under section 482. For the determination of reasonably anticipated benefits,  1.4827(f)(3) expressly requires that certain comparability factors described in  1.4821(c)(2)(ii) under the best method rule be considered. With respect to identification of the costs to be shared, the rules are contained within  1.4827(d)(1), which refers to ""all"" in-  tangible development costs and crossreferences the definition of operating expenses in  1.4825(d)(3) and the provisions of  1.4822(c) governing determination of arm's length rental charges for tangible property. The  1.4827(d)(1) definition of intangible development costs is supplemented by the provisions of  1.4827(c)(2), which cross-references the provisions of  1.4824(f)(3)(iii) to determine arm's length consideration for research assistance performed by a controlled taxpayer that is not a controlled participant. Proposed Effective Date These regulations are proposed to apply to stock-based compensation granted in taxable years beginning on or after the date these regulations are published as a Treasury Decision promulgating final regulations in the Federal Register. Notwithstanding this prospective effective date, Treasury and the IRS intend that taxpayers may rely on these proposed regulations until the effective date of the final regulations. No inference is intended with respect to the treatment of stock-based compensation granted in taxable years beginning before the effective date of the final regulations. Special Analyses It has been determined that this notice of proposed rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) does not apply to these regulations. It is hereby certified that the collections of information in these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This certification is based upon the fact that few small entities are expected to enter into qualified cost sharing arrangements involving stock-based compensation, and that for those who do, the burdens imposed under  1.482 7(d)(2)(iii)(B) and 1.4827(j)(2)(i)(F) will be minimal. Therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f), this notice of proposed rulemaking will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy  August 26, 2002  409  200234 I.R.B.   of the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business. Comments and Public Hearing Before these proposed regulations are adopted as final regulations, consideration will be given to any electronic or written comments (a signed original and eight (8) copies) that are submitted timely to the IRS. Treasury and the IRS specifically request comments on the clarity of the proposed regulations and how they may be made easier to understand. All comments will be available for public inspection and copying. A public hearing has been scheduled for October 21, 2002, at 10 a.m., in Room 4718, Internal Revenue Building, 1111 Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC. Because of access restrictions, visitors will not be admitted beyond the building lobby more than 30 minutes before the hearing starts. For information about having your name placed on the building access list to attend the hearing, see the ""FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT"" section of this preamble. The rules of 26 CFR 601.601(a)(3) apply to the hearing. Persons who wish to present oral comments at the hearing must submit written comments and an outline of the topics to be discussed and the time to be devoted to each topic (signed original and eight (8) copies) by September 30, 2002. A period of 10 minutes will be allotted to each person for making comments. An agenda showing the scheduling of the speakers will be prepared after the deadline for receiving outlines has passed. Copies of the agenda will be available free of charge at the hearing. Drafting Information The principal author of these proposed regulations is Douglas Giblen of the Office of Associate Chief Counsel (International). However, other personnel from the Treasury and the IRS participated in their development. ***** Proposed Amendments Regulations to the  PART 1 -- INCOME TAXES Paragraph 1.

The additions and revisions read as follows:  1.4827 Sharing of costs. (a) * * * (3) Coordination with  1.4821. A qualified cost sharing arrangement produces results that are consistent with an arm's length result within the meaning of  1.4821(b)(1) if, and only if, each controlled participant's share of the costs (as determined under paragraph (d) of this section) of intangible development under the qualified cost sharing arrangement equals its share of reasonably anticipated benefits attributable to such development (as required by paragraph (a)(2) of this section) and all other requirements of this section are satisfied. (4) Cross references. * * * ***** (d) * * * (2) Stock-based compensation.--(i) In general. For purposes of this section, a controlled participant's operating expenses include all costs attributable to compensation, including stock-based compensation. As used in this section, the term stockbased compensation means any compensation provided by a controlled participant to an employee or independent contractor in the form of equity instruments, options to acquire stock (stock options), or rights with respect to (or determined by reference to) equity instruments or stock options, including but not limited to property to which section 83 applies and stock options to which section 421 applies, regardless of whether ultimately settled in the form of cash, stock, or other property. (ii) Identification of stock-based compensation related to intangible development. The determination of whether stockbased compensation is related to the intangible development area within the  meaning of paragraph (d)(1) of this section is made as of the date that the stockbased compensation is granted. Accordingly, all stock-based compensation that is granted during the term of the qualified cost sharing arrangement and is related at date of grant to the development of intangibles covered by the arrangement is included as an intangible development cost under paragraph (d)(1) of this section. In the case of a repricing or other modification of a stock option, the determination of whether the repricing or other modification constitutes the grant of a new stock option for purposes of this paragraph (d)(2)(ii) will be made in accordance with the rules of section 424(h) and related regulations. (iii) Measurement and timing of stockbased compensation expense.--(A) In general. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d)(2)(iii), the operating expense attributable to stock-based compensation is equal to the amount allowable to the controlled participant as a deduction for federal income tax purposes with respect to that stock-based compensation (for example, under section 83(h)) and is taken into account as an operating expense under this section for the taxable year for which the deduction is allowable. (1) Transfers to which section 421 applies. Solely for purposes of this paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(A), section 421 does not apply to the transfer of stock pursuant to the exercise of an option that meets the requirements of section 422(a) or 423(a). (2) Deductions of foreign controlled participants. Solely for purposes of this paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(A), an amount is treated as deductible by a foreign controlled participant otherwise not entitled to a deduction under United States income tax law as if the amount were paid or incurred by a United States taxpayer. (3) Modification of stock option. Solely for purposes of this paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(A), if the repricing or other modification of a stock option is determined, under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, to constitute the grant of a new stock option not related to the development of intangibles, the stock option that is repriced or otherwise modified will be treated as being exercised immediately before the modification, provided that the stock option is then substantially vested within the meaning of  1.833(b) (or, in the case of stock options to which section  421 applies, exercisable) and the fair market value of the underlying stock then exceeds the price at which the stock option is exercisable. Accordingly, the amount of the deduction that would be allowable (or treated as allowable under this paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(A)) to the controlled participant upon exercise of the stock option immediately before the modification must be taken into account as an operating expense as of the date of the modification. (4) Expiration or termination of qualified cost sharing arrangement. Solely for purposes of this paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(A), if an item of stock-based compensation related to the development of intangibles is not exercised during the term of a qualified cost sharing arrangement, that item of stock-based compensation will be treated as being exercised immediately before the expiration or termination of the qualified cost sharing arrangement, provided that the stock-based compensation is then substantially vested within the meaning of  1.83 3(b) (or, in the case of stock options to which section 421 applies, exercisable) and the fair market value of the underlying stock then exceeds the price at which the stock-based compensation is exercisable. Accordingly, the amount of the deduction that would be allowable (or treated as allowable under this paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(A)) to the controlled participant upon exercise of the stock-based compensation must be taken into account as an operating expense as of the date of the expiration or termination of the qualified cost sharing arrangement. (B) Election with respect to options on publicly traded stock. With respect to stock-based compensation in the form of options on publicly traded stock, the controlled participants in a qualified cost sharing arrangement may elect to take into account all operating expenses attributable to those stock options in the same amount, and as of the same time, as the fair value of the stock options reflected as a charge against income in audited financial statements or disclosed in footnotes to such financial statements, prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles by or on behalf of the company issuing the publicly traded stock. As used in this section, the term publicly traded stock means stock that is regularly traded on an established United States securities market and is issued by a company whose financial statements are prepared in  August 26, 2002  411  200234 I.R.B.   accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles for the taxable year. The election described in this paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B) is made by an explicit reference to the election in the written cost sharing agreement required by paragraph (b)(4) of this section or in a written amendment to the cost sharing agreement entered into with the consent of the Commissioner pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(C) of this section. In the case of a qualified cost sharing arrangement in existence on the effective date of this paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B), the election must be made by written amendment to the cost sharing agreement not later than the latest due date (without regard to extensions) of a federal income tax return of any controlled participant for the first taxable year beginning after the effective date of this paragraph, and the consent of the Commissioner is not required. (C) Consistency. Generally, all controlled participants in a qualified cost sharing arrangement taking options on publicly traded stock into account under paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(A) or (d)(2)(iii)(B) of this section must use that same method of measurement and timing for all options on publicly traded stock with respect to that qualified cost sharing arrangement. Controlled participants may change their method only with the consent of the Commissioner and only with respect to stock options granted during taxable years subsequent to the taxable year in which the Commissioner's consent is obtained. All controlled participants in the qualified cost sharing arrangement must join in requests for the Commissioner's consent under this paragraph. Thus, for example, if the controlled participants make the election described in paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B) of this section upon the formation of the qualified cost sharing arrangement, the election may be revoked only with the consent of the Commissioner, and the consent will apply only to stock options granted in taxable years subsequent to the taxable year in which consent is obtained. Similarly, if controlled participants already have granted stock options that have been or will be taken into account under the general rule of paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, then except in cases specified in the last sentence of paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B)  of this section, the controlled participants may make the election described in paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B) of this section only with the consent of the Commissioner, and the consent will apply only to stock options granted in taxable years subsequent to the taxable year in which consent is obtained. (3) Examples. * * * ***** (j) * * * (2) * * * (i) * * * (F) The amount taken into account as operating expenses attributable to stockbased compensation, including the method of measurement and timing used with respect to that amount as well as the data, as of date of grant, used to identify stockbased compensation related to the development of intangibles covered by the qualified cost sharing arrangement. ***** (k) Effective date. This section is generally effective for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1996. However, paragraphs (a)(3), (d)(2), and (j)(2)(i)(F) of this section are effective for taxable years beginning on or after the date of publication of the Treasury Decision adopting those rules as final regulations in the Federal Register.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Paperwork Reduction Act The collection of information contained in this notice of proposed rulemaking has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3507(d)). Comments on the collection of information should be sent to the Office of Management and Budget, Attn: Desk Officer for the Department of the Treasury, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503, with copies to the Internal Revenue Service, Attn: IRS Reports Clearance Officer, W:CAR:MP:FP:S, Washington, DC 20224. Comments on the collections of information should be received by October 1, 2002. Comments are specifically requested concerning: Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the proper operation of the functions of the Internal Revenue Service, including whether the information will have practical utility; The accuracy of the estimated burden associated with the proposed collection of information (see below); How the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected may be enhanced; How the burden of complying with the proposed collection of information may be minimized, including through the application of automated collection techniques or other forms of information technology; and  Estimates of capital or start-up costs and costs of operation, maintenance, and purchase of service to provide information. The collection of information in these proposed regulations is in  1.6049 4(b)(5)(i) and 1.60496(e)(4)(i) and (ii). This information is required to determine if taxpayers have properly reported amounts received as income. The collection of information is mandatory. The likely respondents are businesses and other for-profit institutions. The estimated average annual burden per respondent and/or recordkeeper required by  1.60494(b)(5)(i) and 1.60496(e)(4)(i) and (ii) will be reflected in the burdens of Forms 1042, 1042S and the income tax return of a foreign person. Further, the estimated average annual burden per respondent and/or recordkeeper for the statement required by  1.60496(e)(4)(i) is as follows: Estimated total annual reporting burden: 500 hours. Estimated average annual burden per respondent: 15 minutes. Estimated number of respondents: 2000. Estimated annual frequency of responses: annually. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless the collection of information displays a valid control number assigned by the Office of Management and Budget. Books or records relating to a collection of information must be retained as long as their contents may become material in the administration of any internal revenue law. Generally, tax returns and tax return information are confidential, as required by 26 U.S.C. 6103. Background and Explanation of Provisions On January 17, 2001, the IRS and Treasury published a notice of proposed rulemaking (REG12610000) in the Federal Register (66 FR 3925, corrected by REG12610000, 20011 C.B. 862 [66 FR 15820] and Ann. 200150, 20011 C.B. 1184 [66 FR 16019]) under Section 6049 (the 2001 proposed regulations), which would provide that U.S. bank deposit interest paid to any nonresident alien individual must be reported annually to the IRS. Under regulations currently in effect,  reporting of U.S. bank deposit interest is required only if the interest is paid to a U.S. person or a nonresident alien individual who is a resident of Canada. The IRS and Treasury requested comments on the 2001 proposed regulations, and a public hearing regarding the 2001 proposed regulations was held on June 21, 2001. The IRS and Treasury received numerous comments on the proposed regulations, and several commentators spoke at the public hearing on the 2001 proposed regulations. After careful consideration of all the comments received, the IRS and Treasury have concluded that the 2001 proposed regulations should be withdrawn and a new notice of proposed rulemaking should be issued on this subject. Accordingly, this document withdraws the 2001 proposed regulations and provides new proposed regulations (the 2002 proposed regulations). Most of the comments received on the 2001 proposed regulations were highly critical of the regulations. In particular, many commentators expressed the view that the administrative burden imposed by the 2001 proposed regulations would significantly outweigh any benefits obtained by the IRS from the additional information collected. Some commentators also stated that the 2001 proposed regulations could have a severe negative impact on U.S. banks, particularly U.S. banks with a deposit base that included a significant number of nonresident alien individuals, some of whom had expressed concerns that the information collected under the 2001 proposed regulations might be misused. Other commentators raised certain technical concerns regarding the 2001 proposed regulations, particularly with respect to the reporting requirements for bank deposit interest paid to joint account holders. After consideration of the comments received, the IRS and Treasury have concluded that the 2001 proposed regulations were overly broad in requiring annual information reporting with respect to U.S. bank deposit interest paid to any nonresident alien. The IRS and Treasury have decided instead that reporting should be required only for nonresident alien individuals that are residents of certain designated countries. The IRS and Treasury believe that limiting reporting to residents of these countries will facilitate the goals  August 26, 2002  413  200234 I.R.B.   of improving compliance with U.S. tax laws and permitting appropriate information exchange without imposing an undue administrative burden on U.S. banks. Accordingly, the 2002 proposed regulations would modify the current regulations (which require reporting of U.S. bank deposit interest only if paid to Canadian residents) by requiring in addition reporting of U.S. bank deposit interest paid to residents of Australia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Payors may, however, at their option, choose to report bank deposit interest paid to all nonresident aliens or to any nonresident alien who is a resident of a country other than the countries listed above. If the IRS and Treasury determine that this list of countries should be modified in the future, regulations providing such a modification will be proposed and comments will be requested on those proposed regulations. In other respects, the 2002 proposed regulations generally follow the approach set forth in the 2001 proposed regulations. Thus, the 2002 proposed regulations provide that, if a nonresident alien who is a recipient of U.S. bank deposit interest is a resident of a country for which reporting of such interest is required, a copy of Form 1042S, ""Foreign Person's U.S. Source Income Subject to Withholding"", must be furnished to the nonresident alien. Like the 2001 proposed regulations, the 2002 proposed regulations provide that the payor or middleman can satisfy this requirement by furnishing a copy of Form 1042S either in person or to the last known address of the nonresident alien. In addition, to conform to the changes made in the 2002 proposed regulations, the Form 1042S requirements have been modified with respect to joint accounts. For example, the 2001 proposed regulations provide that, if a joint account holder is a U.S. non-exempt recipient, the payor or middleman must report the entire payment to that person. If all joint account holders are foreign persons, the 2001 proposed regulations require the payor or middleman to report the payment to the nonresident alien individual that is a resident of a country with which the United States has an income tax treaty or a tax information exchange agreement (TIEA).  The 2002 proposed regulations retain the requirement that the entire payment be reported to a U.S. non-exempt recipient if there is a U.S. non-exempt recipient that is a joint account holder. However, the 2002 proposed regulations modify the 2001 proposed regulations by providing that, if all joint account holders are foreign persons, reporting is required to any one of the joint account holders that is a resident of one of the listed countries. Section 1.60498(a) currently provides, for purposes of the requirement that U.S. bank deposit interest paid to individuals who are Canadian residents must be reported, that the payor or middleman may rely on the permanent address found on an applicable withholding certificate described in  1.14411(c)(16) (Form W8) to make the determination of whether the nonresident alien individual resides in Canada. However, the regulation also provides that a payor or middleman may rely on its actual knowledge of the individual's residence address in Canada, even if a valid Form W8 has not been provided, to make such a determination. The 2002 proposed regulations, like the 2001 proposed regulations, eliminate this ""actual knowledge of the individual's residence address"" rule because it creates a result that is contrary to the presumption rules contained in  1.14411(b)(3)(iii) (and made applicable to reportable payments by  1.6049 5(d)(2)). In this regard, the presumption rules generally provide that interest on a U.S. bank deposit that cannot be reliably associated with a valid Form W8 or Form W9, ""Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification"", must be presumed to be paid to an undocumented U.S. non-exempt recipient. Accordingly, the 2002 proposed regulations clarify that a payor of interest on such a deposit must report the payment on a Form 1099 as made to a U.S. non-exempt recipient in accordance with the presumption rules. Further, such payment is subject to backup withholding under section 3406. Proposed Effective Date These regulations are proposed to apply to payments made after December 31 of the year in which they are published as final regulations in the Federal Register.  Special Analyses It has been determined that this notice of proposed rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) does not apply to these regulations, and, because the regulations do not impose a collection of information on small entities, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) does not apply. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Code, this notice of proposed rulemaking will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business. Comments and Public Hearing Before these proposed regulations are adopted as final regulations, consideration will be given to any written comments (a signed original and eight (8) copies) that are submitted timely (in the manner described in the ""ADDRESSES"" portion of this preamble) to the IRS. The IRS and Treasury Department request comments on the clarity of the proposed rules and how they can be made easier to understand. All comments will be available for public inspection and copying. A public hearing has been scheduled for December 5, 2002, beginning at 10 a.m. in Room 4718, Internal Revenue Building, 1111 Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC. Due to building security procedures, visitors must enter at the main entrance, located at 1111 Constitution Avenue, NW. In addition, all visitors must present photo identification to enter the building. Because of access restrictions, visitors will not be admitted beyond the immediate entrance area more than 30 minutes before the hearing starts.

In the case of interest aggregating $10 or more paid to a nonresident alien individual (as defined in section 7701(b)(1)(B)) that is reportable under  1.60498(a), the payor shall make an information return on Form 1042S, ""Foreign Person's U.S. Source Income Subject to Withholding"", for the calendar year in which the interest is paid. The payor or middleman shall prepare and file Form 1042S at the time and in the manner prescribed by section 1461 and the  nished to the United States Internal Revenue Service and may be furnished to the government of the foreign country where the recipient resides. (ii) Joint account holders. In the case of joint account holders, a payor or middleman must report the entire amount of interest as paid to any one of the joint account holders that provides a valid Form W9, ""Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification,"" or, if any account holder has not furnished an applicable withholding certificate described in  1.14411(c)(16) (Form W8) or Form W9, any one of the joint account holders that is presumed to be a U.S. nonexempt recipient under  1.60495(d)(2) and 1.14411(b)(3)(iii). If all of the joint account holders have furnished valid Forms W8 certifying their status as foreign persons and any joint account holder is a resident of one of the countries specified in  1.60498(a), then the payor or middleman must report the payment to any one of the joint account holders that is a resident of one of the countries specified in  1.60498(a) (selected account holder).

If the selected account holder makes such request, the payor or middleman must report the corrected amount to the selected account holder and report the remaining amount to any other joint account holder that is a resident of one of the countries specified in  1.60498(a).

In  1.60498, the section heading and paragraph (a) are revised to read as follows:  1.60498 Certain Interest and original issue discount paid to nonresident alien individuals.

For purposes of  1.60494, 1.60496, and this section and except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the term interest means interest described in section 871(i)(2)(A) with respect to a deposit maintained at an office within the United States by a nonresident alien individual who is a resident of any of the following countries: Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. For purposes of the regulations under section 6049, a nonresident alien individual is a person described in section 7701(b)(1)(B). The payor or middleman may rely upon an applicable withholding certificate described in  1.14411(c)(16) (Form W8) that is valid to determine whether the payment is made to a nonresident alien individual who is a resident of one of the countries for which reporting is required. Generally, amounts described in this paragraph (a) are not subject to backup withholding under section 3406. See  31. 3406(g)1(d) of this chapter. However, if the payor or middleman does not have either a valid Form W8 or valid Form W9, ""Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification"", the payor or middleman must report the payment as made to a U.S. non-exempt recipient if it must so treat the payee under the presumption rules of  1.60495(d)(2) and 1.14411(b)(3)(iii) and must also backup withhold under section 3406.

The Director of Practice, in his discretion, may accept the offered resignation. The Director of Practice has accepted offers of resignation as an enrolled agent from the following individuals:  Name Fuener, Donald C. Clark, Robert A. Sarmiento, Romulo B. Goetz, Roger H.  Address Springfield, IL Chico, CA San Francisco, CA Waseca, MN  Date of Resignation Effective December 31, 2001 Effective January 1, 2002 Effective March 31, 2002 Effective June 24, 2002   Definition of Terms Revenue rulings and revenue procedures (hereinafter referred to as""rulings"") that have an effect on previous rulings use the following defined terms to describe the effect: Amplified describes a situation where no change is being made in a prior published position, but the prior position is being extended to apply to a variation of the fact situation set forth therein. Thus, if an earlier ruling held that a principle applied to A, and the new ruling holds that the same principle also applies to B, the earlier ruling is amplified. (Compare with modified, below). Clarified is used in those instances where the language in a prior ruling is being made clear because the language has caused, or may cause, some confusion. It is not used where a position in a prior ruling is being changed. Distinguished describes a situation where a ruling mentions a previously published ruling and points out an essential difference between them. Modified is used where the substance of a previously published position is being changed. Thus, if a prior ruling held that a principle applied to A but not to B, and the new ruling holds that it applies to both A and B, the prior ruling is modified because it corrects a published position. (Compare with amplified and clarified, above). Obsoleted describes a previously published ruling that is not considered determinative with respect to future transactions. This term is most commonly used in a ruling that lists previously published rulings that are obsoleted because of changes in law or regulations. A ruling may also be obsoleted because the substance has been included in regulations subsequently adopted. Revoked describes situations where the position in the previously published ruling is not correct and the correct position is being stated in the new ruling. Superseded describes a situation where the new ruling does nothing more than restate the substance and situation of a previously published ruling (or rulings). Thus, the term is used to republish under the 1986 Code and regulations the same position published under the 1939 Code and regulations. The term is also used when it is desired to republish in a single ruling a series of situations, names, etc., that were previously published over a period of time in separate rulings. If the new ruling does more than restate the substance of a prior ruling, a combination of terms is used. For example, modified and superseded describes a situation where the substance of a previously published ruling is being changed in part and is continued without change in part and it is desired to restate the valid portion of the previously published ruling in a new ruling that is self contained. In this case, the previously published ruling is first modified and then, as modified, is superseded. Supplemented is used in situations in which a list, such as a list of the names of countries, is published in a ruling and that list is expanded by adding further names in subsequent rulings. After the original ruling has been supplemented several times, a new ruling may be published that includes the list in the original ruling and the additions, and supersedes all prior rulings in the series. Suspended is used in rare situations to show that the previous published rulings will not be applied pending some future action such as the issuance of new or amended regulations, the outcome of cases in litigation, or the outcome of a Service study.

GX230-82-3717177	"New York State Department of Taxation and Finance  Office of Tax Policy Analysis Technical Services Division  TSB-A-00(4)R Mortgage Recording Tax November 20, 2000  STATE OF NEW YORK COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION AND FINANCE ADVISORY OPINION PETITION NO. M000727B  On July 27, 2000, the Department of Taxation and Finance received a Petition for Advisory Opinion from Habitat for Humanity Housing Development Fund Company, Inc., 334 Furman Street, Brooklyn, New York 11201. The issue raised by Petitioner, Habitat for Humanity Housing Development Fund Company, Inc. is whether section 577(2) of Article XI of the Private Housing Finance Law exempts a housing development fund company from payment of the mortgage recording tax imposed pursuant to Article 11 of the Tax Law when such housing development fund company is the lender/mortgagee. Petitioner presents the following facts. Habitat for Humanity - New York City (""HFH-NY"") is a not-for-profit corporation whose mission is to build simple, decent and affordable housing for clients in need through its volunteer and paid labor force. Petitioner is the contracting entity for HFH-NY. In its capacity as contracting entity, Petitioner holds title to real estate on which projects are constructed until conveyance to the housing recipient. Petitioner also contracts with construction and tradespeople, and purchases construction materials. Petitioner's activities are funded by HFH-NY. HFH-NY is one of more than 1,500 United States affiliates of Habitat for Humanity International, an ecumenical housing ministry that seeks to eliminate substandard housing throughout the world. HFH-NY was founded as a chapter of Habitat for Humanity International in 1984, when New York City was selected as the site of the first Jimmy Carter Work Project. Since 1984, HFH-NY has built 66 homes in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan and Queens. HFH-NY builds and rehabilitates these homes with the help of the future homeowners, volunteer labor and tax-deductible donations of money and materials. The homes are sold to families at no profit and are financed with affordable, no-interest loans. The homeowners' monthly mortgage payments are deposited into a revolving Fund for Humanity that is used to build more homes. It is not a giveaway program, but rather a joint venture in which those who benefit from the housing are involved in the work. In the course of its program, Petitioner enters into twenty to thirty year interest free mortgage loans with low income home buyers in order to finance the costs of construction as inexpensively as possible. To secure repayment of these loans, the homeowners give Petitioner a mortgage and Petitioner seeks to record such mortgages exempt from payment of any mortgage recording tax. Petitioner is duly organized pursuant to Article XI of the Private Housing Finance Law (""Article XI"") as a housing development fund company for the exclusive purpose of developing   -2TSB-A-00(4)R Mortgage Recording Tax November 20, 2000 housing for low income persons and families. Petitioner is sponsoring the financing of housing development projects located in New York State pursuant to Article XI. Applicable Law Article 11 of the Tax Law imposes taxes on the recording of mortgages of real property measured by the principal debt or obligation secured or which under any contingency may be secured by the mortgage. Section 252 of Article 11 of the Tax Law, which sets forth the preponderance of the exemptions from the mortgage recording tax, provides, with certain exceptions not relevant here, that ""[n]o mortgage of real property situated within this state shall be exempt, and no person or corporation owning any debt or obligation secured by mortgage of real property situated within this state shall be exempt, from the taxes imposed by this article by reason of anything contained in any other statute."" Section 252 of the Tax Law does not provide a specific exemption from the mortgage recording tax for housing development fund companies. Subdivision (2) of section 577 of the Private Housing Finance Law provides: Any inconsistent provision of law to the contrary notwithstanding, mortgages of a housing development fund company shall be exempt from the mortgage recording taxes imposed by article eleven of the tax law. Additionally, subdivision (b) of section 644.1 of the Mortgage Recording Tax regulations provides, in part: The recording of the following mortgages is exempt from the taxes described in Part 642 of this Title by reason of express statutory provision relating to such taxes: * * *  (9) mortgages of housing development fund companies formed pursuant to article 11 of the Private Housing Finance Law (section 577[2] of the Private Housing Finance Law). . . . Conclusions An apparent inconsistency exists between the Tax Law and the Private Housing Finance Law. Where a conflict exists between two enactments relating to the same subject matter, the later specific enactment governs the earlier general enactment. (Williamsburgh Power Plant Corp. v. City of New York, 255 App Div 214, affd 280 NY 551.) Therefore, as the pertinent provisions of section 252 of the Tax Law as cited previously in this opinion were enacted in 1909, they must yield to the exemption provisions contained in the Private Housing Finance Law, which were enacted in 1966.   -3TSB-A-00(4)R Mortgage Recording Tax November 20, 2000 Indeed, the provisions of Section 577(2) of the Private Housing Finance Law have been incorporated into and are specifically cited in Section 644.1 of the Mortgage Recording Tax regulations. Based on the foregoing, it is concluded that the mortgage recording tax is not due upon the recording of a mortgage by a housing development fund company where such housing development fund company is the lender/mortgagee. Accordingly, mortgages entered into by Petitioner in connection with the HFH-NY program described above are not subject to the mortgage recording tax.

Temporary regulations have been adopted and are available in the Indiana Register for December 2003.

Introduction The Internal Revenue Bulletin is the authoritative instrument of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue for announcing official rulings and procedures of the Internal Revenue Service and for publishing Treasury Decisions, Executive Orders, Tax Conventions, legislation, court decisions, and other items of general interest. It is published weekly and may be obtained from the Superintendent of Documents on a subscription basis. Bulletin contents are consolidated semiannually into Cumulative Bulletins, which are sold on a single-copy basis. It is the policy of the Service to publish in the Bulletin all substantive rulings necessary to promote a uniform application of the tax laws, including all rulings that supersede, revoke, modify, or amend any of those previously published in the Bulletin. All published rulings apply retroactively unless otherwise indicated. Procedures relating solely to matters of internal management are not published; however, statements of internal practices and procedures that affect the rights and duties of taxpayers are published. Revenue rulings represent the conclusions of the Service on the application of the law to the pivotal facts stated in the revenue ruling. In those based on positions taken in rulings to taxpayers or technical advice to Service field offices, identifying details and information of a confidential nature are deleted to prevent unwarranted invasions of privacy and to comply with statutory requirements. Rulings and procedures reported in the Bulletin do not have the force and effect of Treasury Department Regulations, but they may be used as precedents. Unpublished rulings will not be relied on, used, or cited as precedents by Service personnel in the disposition of other cases. In applying published rulings and procedures, the effect of subsequent legislation, regulations, court decisions, rulings, and procedures must be considered, and Service personnel and others concerned are cautioned against reaching the same conclusions in other cases unless the facts and circumstances are substantially the same. The Bulletin is divided into four parts as follows: Part I. -- 1986 Code. This part includes rulings and decisions based on provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Part II.--Treaties and Tax Legislation. This part is divided into two subparts as follows: Subpart A, Tax Conventions and Other Related Items, and Subpart B, Legislation and Related Committee Reports. Part III.--Administrative, Procedural, and Miscellaneous. To the extent practicable, pertinent cross references to these subjects are contained in the other Parts and Subparts. Also included in this part are Bank Secrecy Act Administrative Rulings. Bank Secrecy Act Administrative Rulings are issued by the Department of the Treasury's Office of the Assistant Secretary (Enforcement). Part IV.--Items of General Interest. This part includes notices of proposed rulemakings, disbarment and suspension lists, and announcements. The first Bulletin for each month includes a cumulative index for the matters published during the preceding months. These monthly indexes are cumulated on a semiannual basis, and are published in the first Bulletin of the succeeding semiannual period, respectively.  The contents of this publication are not copyrighted and may be reprinted freely. A citation of the Internal Revenue Bulletin as the source would be appropriate.

On January 12, 2001, the IRS and the Treasury Department issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (REG10173900, 20011 C.B. 996 [66 FR 2854]), published in the Federal Register, to amend the existing elective business entity classification regime under section 7701 known as the check-thebox regulations, and to amend the existing temporary rules providing for the income of entities owned by foreign governments as described under section 892. No public hearing was requested or held. Written comments responding to the notice of proposed rulemaking were received. After consideration of all the comments, the proposed regulations are adopted as revised by this Treasury decision. The revisions are discussed below. Explanation and Summary of Comments On December 18, 1996, the IRS and Treasury published the elective Federal tax classification regime under section 7701 known as the check-the-box regulations, 61 FR 66584. On January 12, 2001, the IRS and Treasury issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (REG10173900, 20011 C.B. 996) that proposed to amend the Procedure and Administration Regulations (26 CFR Part 301) to address the Federal tax classification of an entity wholly owned by a foreign government (as defined in  1.8922T) and to address the Federal tax treatment to a foreign bank of income and assets and liabilities of an otherwise disregarded nonbank entity that it owns. As noted in the preamble to the notice of proposed rulemaking, the purpose of the proposed regulations was to ensure  Section 892.--Income of Foreign Governments and of International Organizations 26 CFR 1.8925: Controlled commercial entity.  parity between the treatment of entities wholly owned by State governments and entities wholly owned by foreign governments, as well as to ensure parity between the treatment of nonbank subsidiaries owned by U.S. banks and the treatment of nonbank subsidiaries owned by foreign banks engaged in a U.S. banking business. The January 12, 2001, notice of proposed rulemaking also proposed to provide that a partnership can be a controlled commercial entity under section 892. A.  301.77012(b)(6) A commentator suggested that the rule in the proposed regulations that a business entity wholly owned by a foreign government (as defined in  1.8922T) is a per se corporation should be limited to those entities directly owned by the foreign government. As indicated above, the proposed regulations were issued because the IRS and Treasury believe that it is appropriate to treat controlled entities owned by foreign governments similarly to controlled entities owned by State governments. The per se rule relating to controlled entities owned by State governments is not limited to those entities directly owned by a State government. Thus, except for minor changes to language, the final regulations retain the proposed rule that a business entity wholly owned by a foreign government, like a business entity wholly owned by a State government, will be treated as a per se corporation. B.  301.77012(c)(2)(ii) Two comments were received on the proposed regulation that provides that foreign banks, like domestic banks, would be precluded from treating their wholly owned nonbank subsidiaries as disregarded entities for purposes of the special rules of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) applicable to banks. Both comments asked for guidance on the phrase ""special rules of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to banks"" and the circumstances under which the regulation would apply to entities owned by foreign banks. As noted above, the regulations are intended to ensure parity of treatment between domestic banks and foreign banks engaged in a U.S. trade or business by providing that neither domestic banks as defined in section 581 nor foreign banks  T.D. 9012 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Internal Revenue Service 26 CFR Parts 1 and 301 Clarification of Entity Classification Rules AGENCY: Internal (IRS), Treasury. ACTION: regulations. Final Revenue and Service  temporary  SUMMARY: This document contains final regulations under section 7701 that address the Federal tax classification of a business entity wholly owned by a foreign government and that also provide that a nonbank entity wholly owned by a foreign bank cannot be disregarded as an entity separate from its owner (disregarded entity) for purposes of applying the special rules applicable to banks under the Internal Revenue Code. This document also contains final regulations providing that a partnership can be a controlled commercial entity for purposes of section 892(a)(2)(B) and reissues certain section 892 temporary regulations with references to the final regulations. DATES: Effective date:These regulations are effective August 1, 2002. Applicability Dates:The regulations that address the Federal tax classification of business entities wholly owned by a foreign government under  301.77012 apply on or after January 14, 2002, to such  August 26, 2002  389  200234 I.R.B.   as defined in section 585(a)(2)(B) (without regard to the second sentence thereof) may apply the special rules applicable to banks to their nonbank subsidiaries. A foreign bank is described in section 585(a)(2)(B) only when it is engaged in a U.S. trade or business that meets the requirements of section 581 but for the fact the bank is a foreign corporation. Accordingly, a foreign bank will be subject to the provisions of these final regulations only if the foreign bank is engaged in a U.S. trade or business that meets the requirements of section 581 but for the fact that the bank is a foreign corporation. The reference to ""special rules applicable to banks"" includes not only provisions of the Code but also regulations and other published guidance under the Code. One of these comments specifically requested clarification on how  301. 77012(c)(2)(ii) would affect a foreign bank's treatment of its disregarded entity for purposes of applying the fixed ratio election in the interest allocation rules under  1.8825(c)(4). Because under  1.8825 a foreign bank that meets the definition of section 585(a)(2)(B) does not distinguish between its banking and nonbanking activities for purposes of taking assets, liabilities and interest expense into account in the interest allocation formula, the IRS and Treasury do not believe the regulations under  1.8825 are appropriately considered ""special rules applicable to banks"" for purposes of the  301.77012(c)(2)(ii) regulations. Accordingly, the final regulations clarify that a foreign bank that is defined in section 585(a)(2)(B) is entitled to use the 93 percent fixed ratio under  1.8825 for the assets, liabilities and interest expense of a nonbank subsidiary that otherwise is treated as a disregarded entity for federal income tax purposes. Similarly, in calculating the amount of excess interest that may be treated as interest expense paid or accrued on deposits under 1.884 4(a)(2)(iii), a foreign bank defined in section 585(a)(2)(B) is entitled to take into account its combined banking and nonbanking U.S. assets (as defined in  1.8841(d)), including the assets of a nonbank subsidiary that is otherwise treated as a disregarded entity for federal income tax purposes.  A similar analysis applies to the rules under  1.8644(c)(5), 1.8645, and 1.8646, which relate to the determination of the effectively connected income of a banking, financing or similar business. Because those rules apply to both section 585(a)(2)(B) banks and to foreign corporations that are not regulated as banks but otherwise engage in financial services activities (See Inverworld v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 1996301, supplemented by T.C. Memo 1997226), the final regulations clarify that these rules are not considered ""special rules applicable to banks."" Effective Dates The regulations that address the Federal tax classification of business entities wholly owned by a foreign government under  301.77012 apply on or after January 14, 2002, to such business entities regardless of any prior entity classification, and the regulations that address the definition of the term entity for purposes of section 892(a)(2)(B) apply on or after January 14, 2002. The regulations relating to a nonbank entity that is wholly owned by a foreign bank apply to taxable years beginning after January 12, 2001. Special Analyses It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations. Therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Code, the notice of proposed rulemaking preceding these regulations was submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on their impact on small businesses. Drafting Information The principal author of these regulations is Camille B. Evans of the Office of Associate Chief Counsel (International). However, other personnel from the IRS  and Treasury Department participated in their development. ***** Adoption of Amendments to the Regulations Accordingly, 26 CFR parts 1 and 301 are amended as follows: PART 1--INCOME TAXES Paragraph 1.

Revenue Service public hearing will be held in room 6718, Internal Revenue Building, 1111 Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Concerning the regulations, Robert W.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Paperwork Reduction Act The collections of information contained in this notice of proposed rulemaking have been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3507(d)). Comments on the collections of information should be sent to the Office of Management and Budget, Attn: Desk Officer for the Department of the Treasury, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503, with copies to the Internal Revenue Service, Attn: IRS Reports Clearance Officer, W:CAR:MP: FP:S; Washington, DC 20224. Comments on the collections of information should be received by September 24, 2002. The collections of information in this proposed regulation are in  1.1445 2(d)(2) and 1.14453. The collections of information relate to the requirement that notices of nonrecognition or applications for withholding certificates be filed with the IRS with respect to (1) dispositions of U.S. real property interests that have been used by foreign persons as a principal residence within the prior 5 years and excluded from gross income under section 121 and (2) dispositions of U.S. real property interests by foreign persons in deferred like kind exchanges that qualify for nonrecognition under section 1031. This collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the IRS because it notifies the IRS of dispositions of U.S. real property interests by foreign persons that otherwise are subject to taxation under section 897 and the collection of a withholding tax under section 1445 except as provided in these provisions. The likely respondents will be individuals and business or other for-profit institutions. Estimated total annual reporting burden: 600 hours. The estimated annual burden per respondent varies from 3 hours to 5 hours, depending on individual circumstances, with an estimated average of 4 hours. Estimated number of respondents: 150. Estimated annual frequency of responses: On occasion. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a valid control number assigned by the Office of Management and Budget. Books or records relating to a collection of information must be retained as long as their contents may become material in the administration of any internal revenue law. Generally, tax returns and tax return information are confidential, as required by 26 U.S.C. 6103. Background Under section 897, a foreign transferor of a U.S. real property interest (USRPI) is generally taxed on gain from the disposition of the USRPI as if the taxpayer were engaged in a U.S. trade or business and as if such gain were effectively connected with such trade or business under section 871 or 882 (ECI). As a means to ensure the collection of the tax, the transferee of the USRPI generally has a withholding tax obligation under section 1445, which is generally 10 percent of the amount realized on the disposition. The withholding agent must report and pay over the tax withheld under section 1445 on Form 8288, ""U.S. Withholding Tax Return for Dispositions by Foreign Persons of U.S. Real Property Interests"", by the 20th day after the disposition of the USRPI. The foreign transferor also must report the gain subject to tax under section 897 by filing a U.S. income tax return. Any amounts withheld under section 1445 are credited against the foreign transferor's U.S. tax liability. Withholding under section 1445 can be reduced or eliminated pursuant to various nonrecognition provisions (e.g., certain re-  ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking and notice of public hearing. SUMMARY: This document contains proposed regulations to require the use of taxpayer identifying numbers on submissions under sections 897 and 1445. The proposed regulations are necessary to properly identify foreign taxpayers for which submissions are made for the reduction or elimination of tax under sections 897 and 1445. The proposed regulations also address miscellaneous items, such as the amendment to section 1445(e)(3) under the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996. This document also provides notice of a public hearing on these proposed regulations. DATES: Electronic or written comments and requests to speak (with outlines of oral comments) at the public hearing scheduled for November 13, 2002, must be submitted by October 23, 2002. ADDRESSES: Send submissions to: CC: ITA:RU (REG10687600), room 5226 Internal Revenue Service, POB 7604, Ben Franklin Station, Washington, DC 20044. In the alternative, submissions may be hand delivered Monday through Friday between the hours of 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. to: CC:ITA:RU (REG10687600), Courier's Desk, Internal Revenue Service, 1111 Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC. Alternatively, taxpayers may submit comments electronically directly to the IRS Internet site at www.irs.gov/regs. The  200234 I.R.B.  392  August 26, 2002   organizations under section 368(a)), pursuant to an applicable U.S. income tax treaty, by reason of the tax-exempt status of the foreign transferor, or in situations where the transferor's maximum tax liability under section 897 is less than the withholding tax. To reduce or eliminate the amount to be withheld under section 1445, either the transferor or transferee (acting as the withholding agent) may request a withholding certificate from the IRS citing the grounds for the reduction or elimination of withholding and including any supporting documentation or other evidence substantiating the request. A withholding certificate that is issued by the IRS prior to the disposition of the USRPI serves to notify the withholding agent that no withholding or reduced withholding is required. If an application for a withholding certificate is submitted before or on the date of the transfer (so it is considered to be pending with the IRS at the time of transfer), the withholding agent is not required to file the withholding tax return and pay over the withholding tax until 20 days after the date the IRS mails the withholding certificate or notice of denial. See  1.14451(c)(2)(A). An application for a withholding certificate after the date of transfer can be combined with an application for an early claim for refund. See  1.14453(g). Under section 6109(a)(1), Treasury and the IRS have the authority to issue regulations requiring taxpayers to obtain taxpayer identifying numbers (TINs) for placement on returns, statements, or other documents for the purpose of securing the proper identification of taxpayers. Under the section 6109 regulations, which govern the extent to which foreign persons must have TINs, a foreign person is not required to have a TIN for inclusion on a return, statement, or other document, unless the foreign person: (1) has ECI at any time during the taxable year, (2) has a U.S. office, U.S. place of business, or a U.S. fiscal or paying agent during the taxable year, or (3) files a tax return, an amended return, or a refund claim, excluding information returns, statements, or other documents. See  301.61091(b)(2). Explanation of Provisions The sections 897 and 1445 regulations do not require foreign transferors of USRPIs to provide TINs on withholding  tax returns, applications for withholding certificates, and other notices and elections unless the foreign transferor otherwise has previously obtained a TIN. The IRS proposes to amend regulations under sections 897 and 1445 (each discussed in greater detail below) to require foreign transferors to include TINs on such documents so that the IRS can better identify the foreign taxpayer and more easily match the applications, withholding tax returns, notices, and elections with the transferor's tax return for compliance purposes. For example, the use of the foreign transferor's TIN to match the withholding tax return with the foreign transferor's income tax return will facilitate verification of the amount of withholding tax that the foreign taxpayer may credit on its return. The use of the foreign transferor's TIN also will facilitate verification that the foreign transferor files a U.S. tax return reporting the transaction (which could be matched against a withholding tax return and any application for a withholding certificate that has been filed). In most cases, the requirement of including a TIN under the proposed regulations will not impose a new obligation on the foreign person. Such foreign person typically will be required to file a tax return for the year in which the property was sold, which requires the foreign person to obtain a TIN at that time. Accordingly, the proposed regulations simply would accelerate the time by which the foreign person is required to obtain a TIN. The IRS is considering ways to facilitate obtaining TINs in connection with transactions subject to sections 897 and 1445. For example, the IRS is considering approaches for combining an application for a reduced withholding certificate under  1.14453 with an application for a TIN. 1. Section 6109 Regulations Under section 6109, every person who makes a return, statement, or other document is required to furnish its TIN as required by regulation. Under the section 6109 regulations, a foreign person generally is required to have a TIN if (1) the foreign person has ECI at any time during the taxable year; (2) the foreign person has a U.S. office or place of business or a U.S. fiscal or paying agent during the taxable year; (3) the foreign person files a tax return, amended return, or a refund  claim (excluding information returns, statements, or documents).  301.61091(b)(2). A person is required to furnish the TIN of another person (including a foreign person) when filing a return, statement, or other document which requires the TIN of the other person, and the other person is required to have a TIN under the section 6109 regulations. If the person does not know the TIN of the other person, the first person must request it, and if this request is denied, then the first person must file an affidavit with the filing so stating. See  301.61091(c). The IRS and Treasury propose to amend the section 6109 regulations to include a specific reference to the new provisions requiring TINs for foreign taxpayers under sections 897 and 1445. The section 6109 regulations would be amended to provide that foreign persons will be required to have TINs for placement on any return, statement, or other document required by the regulations under section 897 or section 1445. See  301.61091(b)(2). The section 6109 regulations also would be amended to provide that another person (e.g., the transferee as withholding agent) making a return, statement, or other document will be required to furnish the TIN of a foreign person as required by the regulations under section 897 or section 1445. See  301.61091(c). 2. Section 1445 Regulations (a)  1.14451 In connection with the withholding requirements under section 1445, the transferee generally must report and pay over any tax withheld by the 20th day after the date of the transfer.  1.14451(b)(1). Form 8288 ""Withholding Tax Return"" and Form 8288A ""Statement of Withholding"" are used for this purpose. Form 8288A serves as a receipt of withholding tax reported and paid over and is stamped by the IRS upon receipt and mailed to the transferor. The transferor must attach the Form 8288A to its U.S. income tax return to verify the amount of withholding tax creditable on its return. Under  1.14451(d), Forms 8288 and 8288A only require the TIN of the transferor and the transferee to the extent the transferor and transferee otherwise have TINs. If the transferee is a U.S. person it  August 26, 2002  393  200234 I.R.B.   will have a TIN, and if the transferee is a foreign person, it must have or obtain a TIN under the section 6109 regulations when filing a Form 8288 (which is considered to be a tax return). A foreign transferor, however, will not have a TIN for placement on the Forms 8288 and 8288A, unless it is otherwise required to have one under the section 6109 regulations (e.g., the foreign person otherwise has ECI). The section 1445 regulations will be amended to provide that the transferors and transferees must have TINs for placement on the Forms 8288 and 8288A. Finally, the section 1445 regulations provide for various documents (including applications for withholding certificates) to be sent to the Assistant Commissioner (International). Section 1.14451(g)(10) provides the address of the Assistant Commissioner (International). Because of the restructuring of the IRS, the Office of the Assistant Commissioner (International) no longer exists, and its duties regarding the administration of the section 1445 regulations are performed, in general, by the Philadelphia Service Center. Section 1.14451(g)(10) and other provisions in the section 1445 regulations will be amended to reflect this change. (b)  1.14452 Under  1.14452(d)(2), a transferee is not required to withhold under section 1445, if, by reason of a nonrecognition provision of the Internal Revenue Code or a U.S. income tax treaty provision, the transferor is not required to recognize gain or loss with respect to the transfer. The transferor must notify the transferee of the nonrecognition provision or treaty provision, and the transferee must provide a copy of the transferor's notice to the IRS by the 20th day after the date of the transfer. Section 1.14459T specifies the information the notice must contain, such as identifying information of the transferor, a description of the transaction, and a brief summary of the law and facts supporting the claim of nonrecognition of gain on the transaction. The notice is required to include a TIN of the transferor only if the foreign transferor otherwise has a TIN.  The notice forwarded by the transferee to the IRS must include a cover letter identifying the transferee. The transferee must include its TIN on the cover letter only if it has one. The proposed regulations would withdraw section 1.14459T and incorporate it into  1.14452(d)(2). In addition, the information required for inclusion on the notice would be revised to provide that the transferor must have a TIN for inclusion on the notice of nonrecognition. The regulations also would be amended to provide that the transferee must have a TIN for placement on the cover letter. Certificates of Non-foreign Status Under  1.14452 Under  1.14452(b), no withholding is required under section 1445 if the transferor of a U.S. real property interest is not a foreign person. If the transferor provides a certificate of non-foreign status to the transferee of the U.S. real property interest prior to or at the time of the transfer, the transferee is not required to withhold under section 1445(a). The certificate of non-foreign status must certify that the transferor is not a foreign person, must set forth the transferor's name, identifying number and address, and must contain the transferor's signature under penalties of perjury. The IRS is considering requiring Form W9 to be used as certificates of nonforeign status under  1.14452(b). Form W9 generally contains the same information as a certificate of non-foreign status and currently is used in the context of section 1441 withholding to determine a taxpayer's non-foreign status. Because Form W9 is not now required in real estate transactions and because payments with respect to real estate transactions are exempt from backup withholding under  31.3406(g)2(e) (although Form W9 can be used to provide the TIN of the seller to the reporting person required to report the transaction on Form 1099 under  1.60454(l)), the IRS requests comments on the use of Form W9 in real estate transactions to avoid withholding under section 1445. The IRS believes that the use of Form W9 could ease compliance with section 1445.  (c)  1.14453 Section 1.14453 provides procedures for the reduction or elimination of withholding under section 1445 pursuant to a withholding certificate issued by the IRS. A withholding certificate may be issued by the IRS in cases where the transferor is exempt from U.S. tax, the transferor's maximum tax liability under section 897 is less than the withholding tax, or where the transferor or transferee enters into an agreement for the payment of tax with the IRS. A withholding certificate that is applied for prior to or on the date of the transfer notifies the transferee that reduced or no withholding is required. A withholding certificate that is applied for after a transfer has been made may authorize a normal refund or an early refund. Either the transferor or transferee may apply for a withholding certificate. Section  1.14453(b)(2) identifies the information that must be furnished on an application for a withholding certificate. It includes the name and address of the transferee and the transferee's TIN, but only if the transferee has a TIN. It also includes the name and address of all other parties to the transaction (e.g., transferors) and their TINs, but only if they have TINs. The applicant must determine if each party has a TIN, and if none exists for a particular party, the application must so state. The regulations would be amended to provide that the transferee and all other parties (e.g., transferors) must have TINs for placement on an application for a withholding certificate. The regulations would further provide that the application will be denied if the TINs of all the parties are not provided. (d)  1.14455 Under  1.14455, special rules are provided concerning withholding required under section 1445(e) on distributions and other transactions involving domestic or foreign corporations, partnerships, trusts, and estates. Paragraph (b)(2) provides that no withholding is required for transfers of a USRPI described in section 1445(e) if no gain or loss is required to be recognized by a foreign person under a nonrecognition provision of the Internal Revenue  200234 I.R.B.  394  August 26, 2002   Code or a provision of a U.S. income tax treaty. The entity or fiduciary otherwise required to withhold must deliver a notice of the nonrecognition transfer to the IRS by the 20th day after the transfer of the USRPI. The entity or fiduciary may obtain a withholding certificate from the IRS to confirm the applicability of a nonrecognition provision, but is not required to do so. The notice of a nonrecognition transfer delivered to the IRS must contain a description of the transfer and a supporting explanation of the claim of nonrecognition treatment, as well as identifying information of the entity or fiduciary submitting the notice and each foreign person with respect to which withholding would otherwise be required. The TINs of the entity or fiduciary and each foreign person are required to be furnished only if such persons otherwise have TINs. The regulations under 1.14455(b)(2)(ii) would be amended to provide that the entity or fiduciary and all foreign persons must have TINs to be furnished on the notice of nonrecognition. (e)  1.14456 Section 1.14456 provides procedures for obtaining a withholding certificate for distributions and other transactions involving domestic or foreign corporations, partnerships, trusts, and estates subject to withholding tax under section 1445(e) and  1.14455. The procedures for obtaining a withholding certificate are modeled after  1.14453, which provides the procedures for obtaining a withholding certificate under section 1445(a). Hence, the entity or fiduciary (acting as withholding agent) or the foreign taxpayer subject to section 897 can apply for a withholding certificate on the basis that the foreign person is exempt from U.S. tax, the transferor's maximum tax liability under section 897 is less than the withholding tax, or an agreement is entered into by the transferor or transferee for the payment of tax. Section 1.14456(b) identifies the information that must be furnished on an application for a withholding certificate. It includes the name, address of the foreign taxpayer subject to section 897 and the foreign taxpayer's TIN, but only if the taxpayer otherwise has a TIN. The regula-  tions will be amended to require the foreign taxpayer to have a TIN for placement on an application for a withholding certificate. 3. Section 897 Regulations (a)  1.8973 Section 1.8973 provides rules enabling a foreign corporation to make a section 897(i) election to be treated as a domestic corporation for purposes of sections 897 and 1445. A foreign corporation making a section 897(i) election is subject to all of the rules under section 897 and 1445 that apply to domestic corporations. For example, if a foreign corporation that has made the section 897(i) election is a USRPHC, interests in it are USRPIs that are subject to taxation under section 897 and withholding tax under section 1445. A foreign corporation that makes an election under section 897(i) is not treated as a domestic corporation for purposes of any other provision of the Code or regulations, except to the extent that it is required to consent to such treatment as a condition of making the election. The election under section 897(i) must include the name, address, and place and date of incorporation of the foreign corporation and the foreign corporation's TIN but only if the foreign corporation otherwise has a TIN. The regulations would be amended to require the electing foreign corporation to have a TIN for placement on the election. (b)  1.8975T Section  1.8975T provides that certain distributions of USRPIs (which otherwise qualify for nonrecognition treatment) are not subject to section 897 if any gain from a subsequent disposition of the USRPIs would be included in gross income of the distributee or transferee receiving the USRPI in the distribution. See, e.g.,  1.8975T(c)(2)(i). An interest will be considered subject to U.S. tax upon its subsequent disposition only if certain reporting requirements are satisfied. See  1.8975T(d)(1)(i). Under the reporting requirements, the distributor must file an income tax return for the taxable year of the distribution. The person filing the return must attach a document describing the distribution or exchange, including the  name and address of the distributee, and its TIN, but only to the extent it has one. See  1.8975T(d)(1)(iii). The regulations would be amended to require that the document attached to the return includes the TIN of the distributee. This is necessary to properly identify the foreign distributee which will be subject to section 897 upon a subsequent disposition of the USRPI. 4. Miscellaneous Items (a)  1445(e)(3) Section 1445(e)(3) provides that if a domestic corporation which is a U.S. real property holding corporation (or at any time during the preceding five year period was a U.S. real property holding corporation) distributes property to a foreign shareholder in redemption of stock under section 302 or in liquidation of the corporation, the corporation must withhold 10 percent of the amount distributed to the foreign shareholder. Withholding is not required if the domestic corporation was ""purged"" of its U.S. real property holding corporation status by disposing of all of its U.S. real property interests within the prior five-year period and recognizing gain (if any) pursuant to section 897(c)(1)(B). Section 1445(e)(3) was amended by the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 (Public Law 104188, Sec. 1704(c)) to provide that similar rules apply in the case of any distribution to which section 301 applies and which is not made out of earnings and profits of the domestic corporation. Because a section 301 distribution by a domestic corporation to a foreign shareholder is also governed by section 1441 (or 1442 or 1443), the section 1441 regulations provide coordination rules between withholding under sections 1445 and 1441 (or 1442 or 1443) in the case of section 301 distributions to foreign shareholders by a domestic corporation which is a U.S. real property holding corporation or was one at any time within the prior five-year period. See  1.14413(c)(4). In general,  1.14413(c)(4) provides that a domestic corporation may elect to withhold on the entire distribution under section 1441 (or 1442 or 1443), and not under section 1445, regardless of whether a portion of the distribution constitutes a return of basis or capital gain. Alternatively, a domestic corporation may elect to  August 26, 2002  395  200234 I.R.B.   withhold under both sections 1445 and 1441 (or 1442 or 1443), in which case the domestic corporation must withhold under section 1441 (or 1442 or 1443) on the portion of the distribution that is estimated to be a dividend under  1.1441 3(c)(2)(ii)(A) and must withhold under section 1445(e)(3) on the remainder of the distribution. A domestic corporation may withhold a reduced amount on the distribution under section 1445(e)(3) by obtaining a withholding certificate establishing that the amount of capital gain under section 301(c)(3) is less than the withholding tax otherwise due under section 1445(e)(3). Section 1.14455(e) currently provides that if a domestic corporation, the stock of which is a U.S. real property interest, distributes property to a foreign shareholder in a redemption of stock under section 302 or in liquidation of the corporation, the domestic corporation must withhold 10 percent of the fair market value of the property distributed to the foreign shareholder. Section 1.14455(e) would be amended to provide that withholding is required in the case of a distribution of property under section 301(c). A crossreference to  1.14413(c)(4), which provides the coordination rules for withholding between sections 1445 and 1441 (or 1442 or 1443), is provided. (b) Section 121 exclusion Prior to the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (Public Law 10534; 111 Stat. 788) (TRA 97), section 121 provided a one-time exclusion from gross income up to $125,000 for certain gains from the sale of a principal residence by a taxpayer that was 55 years or older. The amendment of section 121 under TRA 97 expanded the exclusion to all taxpayers (not just those 55 years of age and older) and increased the amount of the exclusion to $250,000 (or $500,000, in the case of a husband and wife filing a joint return). Section 121(e) denies the exclusion to nonresident alien taxpayers who expatriated from the United States and are subject to the provisions of section 877(a). For section 121 to apply, the taxpayer must have owned and used the property as a personal residence for periods aggregating 2 years or more during the 5-year period ending on the date of the sale. Section 121(a). An alien individual who owns and  has used a U.S. real property interest as a personal residence during the 5-year period prior to the date of sale may nevertheless be a nonresident alien at the time of sale and subject to sections 897 and 1445. In addition, certain alien individuals (for example, full-time diplomats or employees of international organizations), who may own and use a U.S. real property interest as a personal residence at the time of sale, are treated as nonresident alien individuals for tax purposes under section 7701(b). In connection with the amendments to section 121, section 1034 was repealed. Section 1034 had provided for nonrecognition of gain upon the sale of a personal residence provided that another personal residence of greater value was purchased within a specified period of time. Prior to the repeal of section 1034, withholding agents could rely on a notice of nonrecognition under  1.14452(b)(2) on certain section 1034 exchanges because section 1034 exchanges were treated as nonrecognition exchanges for purposes of sections 897 and 1445. See  1.8976T(a)(5). Section 121 is not treated as a nonrecognition exchange for purposes of sections 897 and 1445. See  1.8976T(a)(2). Therefore, withholding agents cannot rely on a notice of nonrecognition under  1.14452(b)(2) with respect to the section 121 exclusion, and dispositions of personal residences entitled to the section 121 exclusion are not entitled to a reduction in withholding absent a withholding certificate. Accordingly, the withholding certificate provisions of  1.14453(c) are proposed to be amended to provide that a claimed adjustment to the maximum tax liability on the disposition of a U.S. real property interest will include the section 121 exclusion if the claim includes information establishing that the transferor is entitled to the benefits of section 121. Because section 1034 has been repealed, the following regulatory provisions concerning section 1034 will be withdrawn effective on the date of its repeal:  1.8976T(a)(5),  1.8976T(a)(7), Examples 2 and 3, and  1.14459T(b)(6). (c) Section 1031 like-kind exchanges Section 1031(a) provides for the nonrecognition of gain or loss on the exchange of like-kind property which is held for productive use in a trade or business or  held for investment. Section 1031(a)(3) provides for the exchange of like-kind property in deferred exchanges, where the taxpayer has 45 days after it relinquishes the property to the transferee to identify replacement property and the transferee has until the earlier of 180 days or the due date of the tax return for the year of transfer to deliver such property to the transferor. In cases where there is a simultaneous exchange of like-kind U.S. real property interests, the foreign transferor can provide a notice of recognition under  1.14452(d)(2) to the transferee, and the transferee can rely on such notice because the like-kind exchange will be fully completed on the day of the exchange. In the case of a deferred like-kind exchange of U.S. real property interests, the issue has been raised whether the transferee can rely on a notice of nonrecognition under  1.14452(d)(2) when the exchange is not completed (because of the 45 day and 180 day rule) and the determination of nonrecognition is not known by the 20th day after receipt of the relinquished property by the transferee (when it has the obligation to pay withholding tax and file a withholding tax return, Form 8288). It has been the view of the IRS and Treasury that the transferee cannot rely on a notice of nonrecognition in the case of a deferred like-kind exchange, because the transferee cannot be assured that the exchange will qualify for nonrecognition treatment under section 1031. Although  1.14452(d)(2) does not apply to section 1031 transactions, taxpayers have requested withholding certificates under  1.14453 in the case of deferred likekind exchanges. This practice will be incorporated in the regulations by amending  1.14453(c) to provide that taxpayers may obtain withholding certificates in the case of deferred like-kind exchanges under section 1031(a)(3) (see also the safeharbor for reverse like-kind exchanges under Rev. Proc. 200037, 20002 C.B. 308). (d) Transfers by an entity treated as a disregarded entity for U.S. tax purposes Under  1.14452(a), a transferee generally has the duty to withhold under section 1445(a) if the transferor is a foreign person and the transferee is acquiring a U.S. real property interest. A transferee  200234 I.R.B.  396  August 26, 2002   generally is not required to withhold under section 1445(a) if the transferee receives a certificate of non-foreign status from the transferor without actual knowledge (or notice from an agent of the transferor or transferee) that the certificate is false.  1.14452(b)(2). While the transferee is not required to request a certificate of non-foreign status and may rely on other means to determine the non-foreign status of the transferor, the transferee will be subject to the liability imposed under section 1445 if the transferor is in fact a foreign person and the transferor has not received a certificate of non-foreign status.  1.14452(b)(1). Thus, the transferee may demand a certificate of non-foreign status and is entitled to withhold under section 1445 if a certificate of non-foreign status is not provided. Id. Taxpayers have inquired about the operation of sections 897 and 1445 where the legal entity transferring a U.S. real property interest is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for U.S. tax purposes, for example, under  301.77013 (disregarded entity). If the transferor is a disregarded entity, the owner (and not the entity) is treated as the transferor of property for U.S. tax purposes, including sections 897 and 1445. See, e.g.,  301.7701 3(a). Accordingly, if a disregarded entity disposes of a U.S. real property interest and its owner is a foreign person, the foreign person is treated as the transferor of the property and is subject to tax under sections 897 and 1445. If a disregarded entity disposes of a U.S. real property interest and its owner is a U.S. person, then the U.S. person is the transferor of the property and may provide a certificate of non-foreign status. In order to clarify the treatment of disregarded entities, the regulations are amended to provide that a disregarded entity may not provide a certificate of nonforeign status because the disregarded entity is not the transferor. The sample certifications which an entity may provide to the transferee with respect to its nonforeign status (as provided in  1.1445 2(b)(2)) are amended to include a certifi-  cation that the entity is not a disregarded entity for U.S. tax purposes. Proposed Effective Date These regulations are proposed to apply to transactions occurring 30 days or more after the date final regulations are published in the Federal Register. Special Analyses It has been determined that this notice of proposed rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) does not apply to these regulations, and because these regulations do not impose a collection of information on U.S. small entities, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) does not apply. Therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, this notice of proposed rulemaking will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business. Comments and Public Hearing Before these proposed regulations are adopted as final regulations, consideration will be given to any written comments (preferably a signed original and eight (8) copies) that are submitted timely to the IRS. The IRS and Treasury request comments on the clarity of the proposed regulations and how they may be made easier to understand. All comments will be available for public inspection and copying. A public hearing has been scheduled for November 13, 2002, beginning at 10:00 am, in room 6718, Internal Revenue Building, 1111 Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC. Because of access restrictions, visitors will not be admitted beyond the Internal Revenue Building lobby more than 30 minutes before the hearing starts. Remove Director, Foreign Operations District (""Director"")  The rules of 26 CFR 601.601(a)(3) apply to the hearing. Persons that wish to present oral comments at the hearing must submit timely written comments and an outline of the topics to be discussed and the time to be devoted to each topic (preferably a signed original and eight (8) copies) by October 23, 2002. A period of 10 minutes will be allotted to each person for making comments. An agenda showing the scheduling of the speakers will be prepared after the deadline for receiving outlines has passed. Copies of the agenda will be available free of charge at the hearing. Drafting Information The principal author of these regulations is Robert W. Lorence, Jr., of the Office of Associate Chief Counsel (International). However, other personnel from the IRS and Treasury Department participated in their development. ***** Proposed Amendments Regulations to the  Accordingly, 26 CFR part 1 is proposed to be amended as follows: PART 1-- INCOME TAXES Paragraph 1.

The revision and additions read as follows:  1.14452 Situations in which withholding is not required under section 1445(a). ***** (b) * * * (2) * * * (iii) Disregarded entities. A disregarded entity may not certify that it is the transferor of a U.S. real property interest, as the disregarded entity is not the transferor for U.S. tax purposes, including sections 897 and 1445. Rather, the owner of the disregarded entity is treated as the transferor of property and must provide a certificate of non-foreign status to avoid withholding under section 1445. A disregarded entity for these purposes means an entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner under  301.77013 of this chapter, a qualified REIT subsidiary as defined in section 856(i), or a qualified subchapter S subsidiary under section 1361(b)(3)(B). Any domestic entity must include in its certification of non-foreign status with respect to the transfer a certification that it is not a disregarded entity. (iv) * * * (B) Entity transferor. ""Section 1445 of the Internal Revenue Code provides that a transferee of a U.S. real property interest must withhold tax if the transferor is a foreign person. For U.S. tax purposes (including section 1445), the owner of a disregarded entity (which has legal title to a U.S. real property interest under local law) will be the transferor of the property and not the disregarded entity. To inform the transferee that withholding of tax is not required upon the disposition of a U.S. real property interest by [name of transferor] , the undersigned hereby certifies the following on behalf of [name of the transferor]:  1. [Name of transferor] is not a foreign corporation, foreign partnership, foreign trust, or foreign estate (as those terms are defined in the Internal Revenue Code and Income Tax Regulations); 2. [Name of transferor] is not a disregarded entity as defined in  1.1445 2(b)(2)(iii); 3. [Name of transferor]'s U.S. employer identification number is _______; and 4.

No particular form is required for a transferor's notice to a transferee that the transferor is not required to recognize gain or loss with respect to a transfer. The notice must be verified as true and signed under penalties of perjury by the transferor, by a responsible officer in the case of a corporation, by a general partner in the case of a partnership, and by a trustee or equivalent fiduciary in the case of a trust or estate. The following information must be set forth in paragraphs labeled to correspond with the designation set forth as follows-- (A) A statement that the document submitted constitutes a notice of a nonrecognition transaction or a treaty provision pursuant to the requirements of  1.1445 2(d)(2); (B) The name, identifying number, and home address (in the case of an individual) or office address (in the case of an entity) of the transferor submitting the notice;  (C) A statement that the transferor is not required to recognize any gain or loss with respect to the transfer; (D) A brief description of the transfer; and (E) A brief summary of the law and facts supporting the claim that recognition of gain or loss is not required with respect to the transfer. (iv) No notice allowed. The provisions of this paragraph (d)(2) do not apply to exclusions from income under section 121 and to non-simultaneous like-kind exchanges under section 1031 where the transferee cannot determine that the exchange has been completed and all the conditions for nonrecognition have been satisfied at the time it is otherwise required to pay the section 1445 withholding tax and file the withholding tax return (Form 8288, ""U.S. Withholding Tax Return for Dispositions by Foreign Persons of U.S. Real Property Interests""). In these cases, the transferee is excused from withholding only upon the timely application for and receipt of a withholding certificate under  1.14453 (see  1.14453(b)(5) and (6) for specific rules applicable to transactions under sections 121 and 1031). ***** Par. 10.

The application must set forth the name, address, and identifying number of the person submitting the application (specifying whether that person is the transferee or transferor), and the name, address, and identifying number of other parties to the transaction (specifying whether each such party is a transferee or transferor). The Service will deny the application if complete information, including the identifying numbers of all the parties, is not provided. Thus, for example, the applicant should determine if an identifying number exists for each party, and, if none exists for a particular party, the applicant should notify the particular party of the obligation to get an identifying number before the application can be submitted to the Service. The address provided in the case of an individual must be that individual's home address, and the address provided in the case of an entity must be that entity's office address. A mailing address may be provided in addition to, but not in lieu of, a home address or office address. ***** (5) Special rule for exclusions from income under section 121. A withholding certificate may be sought on the basis of a section 121 exclusion as a reduction in the amount of tax due under paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section. The application must include information establishing that the transferor, who is a nonresident alien individual at the time of the sale (and is therefore subject to sections 897 and 1445) is entitled to claim the benefits of section 121. For example, a claim for reduced withholding as a result of section 121 must include information that the transferor occupied the U.S. real property interest as his or her personal residence for the required period of time. (6) Special rule for like-kind exchanges under Section 1031. A withholding certificate may be requested with respect to a like-kind exchange under section 1031 as a transaction subject to a nonrecognition  provision under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. The application must include information substantiating the requirements of section 1031. The IRS may require additional information during the course of the application process to determine that the requirements of section 1031 are satisfied. In the case of a deferred like-kind exchange, the transferee is excused from withholding only if the transferee or transferor submits an application for a withholding certificate prior to or on the date of transfer, in which case the withholding tax will be placed in escrow pursuant to procedures established by the IRS and ultimately paid to the IRS if the withholding certificate is denied or released for the benefit of the taxpayer if the withholding certificate is granted. See  1.14451(c)(2) for rules concerning delayed reporting and payment where an application for a withholding certificate has been submitted to the IRS prior to or on the date of transfer. *****  1.14454 [Amended] Par. 11.

Section 301.61091 is amended as follows: 1. In paragraph (b)(2)(v), remove the word ""and"".  ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking and notice of public hearing. SUMMARY: This document contains proposed regulations under section 1503(d) regarding the events that require the recapture of dual consolidated losses. These regulations are issued to facilitate compliance by taxpayers with the dual consolidated loss provisions. The proposed regulations generally provide that certain events will not trigger recapture of a dual consolidated loss or payment of the associated interest charge. The proposed regulations provide for the reporting of certain information in such cases. This document  The collection of information contained in this notice of proposed rulemaking has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3507(d)). Comments on the collection of information should be sent to the Office of Management and Budget, Attn: Desk Officer for the Department of the Treasury, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503, with copies to the Internal Revenue Service, Attn: IRS Reports Clearance Officer, W:CAR:MP:FP:S, Washington, DC 20224. Comments on the collection of information should be received by September 30, 2002. Comments are specifically requested concerning:  200234 I.R.B.  402  August 26, 2002   Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the Internal Revenue Service, including whether the information will have practical utility; The accuracy of the estimated burden associated with the proposed collection of information (see below); How the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected may be enhanced; How the burden of complying with the proposed collection of information may be minimized, including through the application of automated collection techniques or other forms of information technology; and Estimates of capital or start-up costs and costs of operation, maintenance, and purchase of service to provide information. The collection of information in this proposed regulation is in  1.1503 2(g)(2)(iv)(A)(4) and (5). This information is required to ensure the proper performance of the function of the IRS because it notifies the IRS that a future triggering event may require the recapture of specified dual consolidated losses by the new consolidated group. This information will be used to identify the acquisition of an unaffiliated dual resident corporation, an unaffiliated domestic owner of a dual resident corporation, or a consolidated group that includes a dual resident corporation or a domestic owner. The identification of such an acquisition pursuant to these regulations may allow taxpayers to avoid or defer recapture of a dual consolidated loss and the payment of an interest charge. The collection of information is mandatory. The likely respondents will be corporations acquiring overseas business operations. Estimated total annual reporting and/or recordkeeping burden: 60 hours. Estimated average annual burden hours per respondent and/or recordkeeper: 2 hours. Estimated number of respondents and/or recordkeepers: 30 Estimated annual frequency of responses: On occasion. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a valid control number assigned by the Office of Management and Budget.  Books or records relating to a collection of information must be retained as long as their contents may become material in the administration of any internal revenue law. Generally, tax returns and tax return information are confidential, as required by 26 U.S.C. 6103. Background On September 8, 1989, proposed and temporary regulations implementing  1503(d) were published in the Federal Register at 54 FR 37314. Written comments were received in response to the proposed regulations, and a public hearing was held on March 2, 1990. After consideration of all the comments, the proposed regulations were amended and adopted as final regulations by, T.D. 8434, 19922 C.B. 240, on September 9, 1992, and published in the Federal Register at 57 FR 41079. Explanation of Provisions Section 1503(d) generally provides that a ""dual consolidated loss"" of a domestic corporation cannot offset the taxable income of any other member of the corporation's consolidated group. The statute, however, authorizes the issuance of regulations permitting the use of a dual consolidated loss to offset the income of a domestic affiliate if the loss does not offset the income of a foreign corporation under foreign law. Section 1.15032(g)(2) of the final regulations permits a taxpayer to elect to use a dual consolidated loss of a dual resident corporation or separate unit to offset the income of a domestic affiliate by entering into an agreement under which the taxpayer certifies that the dual consolidated loss has not been, and will not be, used to offset the income of another person under the laws of a foreign country. Section 1.15032(g)(2)(iii) of the final regulations provides that, in the year of a so-called ""triggering event,"" the taxpayer must recapture and report as gross income the amount of a dual consolidated loss subject to this agreement, as well as pay an interest charge. Two such triggering events are (1) an unaffiliated dual resident corporation that filed the agreement or an unaffiliated domestic owner of a separate unit that filed the agreement becomes a member of a  consolidated group, consisting of itself and a formerly unaffiliated domestic corporation or an existing consolidated group; and (2) a consolidated group that filed the agreement and that includes a dual resident corporation or domestic owner of a separate unit is acquired by an unaffiliated domestic corporation or a consolidated group, resulting in a new consolidated group. Section 1.15032(g)(2)(iv)(B) of the final regulations, however, provides that these events are not considered to be triggering events under certain conditions. One such condition is that the parties to the transaction enter into a closing agreement with the IRS, as provided in section 7121 of the Code. Thus, in the first case described above, the unaffiliated dual resident corporation or unaffiliated domestic owner that filed the agreement and the unaffiliated domestic corporation or consolidated group must enter into a closing agreement; or, in the second case described above, the acquired consolidated group and the acquiring unaffiliated domestic corporation or consolidated group must enter into a closing agreement. The closing agreement must provide that the unaffiliated dual resident corporation, unaffiliated domestic owner, or consolidated group and the unaffiliated domestic corporation or existing consolidated group will be jointly and severally liable for the total amount of the recapture of the dual consolidated loss and the interest charge if there is a subsequent triggering event. The IRS and Treasury believe that this requirement, that the parties to the transaction enter into a closing agreement with the IRS, imposes an unnecessary administrative burden in cases where liability for the dual consolidated loss recapture amount and interest charge would be imposed by  1.15026. Section 1.15026 generally provides that the common parent corporation and each member of a consolidated group are severally liable for the tax computed on their consolidated U.S. income tax return for the taxable year. In certain circumstances, the several liability imposed by  1.15026 provides for liability comparable to that provided by a closing agreement under  1.1503 2(g)(2)(iv)(B)(2) and section 7121 of the Code. Accordingly, the proposed regulations amend the final regulations by providing that a triggering event generally does not  August 26, 2002  403  200234 I.R.B.   occur when an unaffiliated dual resident corporation or unaffiliated domestic owner becomes a member of a consolidated group. Under  1.15026, the dual resident corporation or domestic owner, as well as the other members of the consolidated group of which it becomes a member, are liable for the recapture amount and the interest charge in the event of a subsequent triggering event. The proposed regulations would remove  1.1503 2(g)(2)(iv)(B)(1)(ii) of the final regulations, which addresses this particular set of circumstances only. The proposed regulations similarly would amend the final regulations by providing that a triggering event generally does not occur when a dual resident corporation or domestic owner that is a member of a consolidated group that filed an agreement under  1.15032(g)(2) becomes a member of another consolidated group in an acquisition, so long as each member of the acquired group that is an includible corporation under  1504(b) is included immediately after the acquisition in a consolidated U.S. income tax return filed by the acquiring group. Under  1.15026, each member of the new consolidated group, including each member of the former group that included the dual resident corporation or domestic owner, is liable for the recapture amount and the interest charge upon the occurrence of a subsequent triggering event. In both cases described in the proposed regulations, a statement must be attached to the first consolidated return of the new consolidated group that includes the dual resident corporation or domestic owner. The statement must reference these proposed regulations and must set forth the information required in  1.1503 2(g)(2)(i)(B), the amount of each dual consolidated loss, and the year incurred. The proposed regulations further require the continued reporting of certain information, when applicable, by the new consolidated group on its subsequently filed consolidated U.S. income tax returns, as provided in  1.15032(g)(2)(vi). Proposed Effective Date These regulations amending the dual consolidated loss rules under  1.15032 are proposed to apply to transactions otherwise constituting triggering events occurring on or after August 1, 2002.  Special Analyses It has been determined that this notice of proposed rule making is not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It is hereby certified that these regulations do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This certification is based on the fact that these regulations will primarily affect affiliated groups of corporations that also have a foreign affiliate, which tend to be larger businesses. Moreover, the number of taxpayers affected and the average burden are minimal. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) does not apply to these regulations, and because these regulations do not impose a collection of information on small entities, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) does not apply. Therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Code, these regulations will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on their impact on small business. Comments and Public Hearing A public hearing has been scheduled for, December 3, 2002, at 10 a.m., room 4718, in the Internal Revenue Building, 1111 Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC.

However, other personnel from the IRS and Treasury Department participated in their development. ***** Proposed Amendments Regulations to the  Accordingly, 26 CFR part 1 is proposed to be amended as follows: PART 1--INCOME TAXES Paragraph 1. The authority citation for part 1 is amended by adding an entry in numerical order to read in part as follows: Authority: 26 U.S.C. 7805 * * *  1.15032 also issued under 26 U.S.C. 1502 * * * Par. 2. In  1.15032, paragraphs (g)(2)(iv)(A)(4), (5) and (D) are added; paragraph (g)(2)(iv)(B)(1)(ii) is removed and paragraphs (g)(2)(iv)(B)(1)(iii) and (iv) are redesignated as paragraphs (g)(2)(iv)(B)(1)(ii) and (iii), respectively; and a sentence is added to paragraph (h)(1) to read as follows:  1.15032 Dual Consolidated Loss. ***** (g) * * * (2) * * * (iv) * * * (A) Acquisition by a member of the consolidated group. ***** (4) An unaffiliated dual resident corporation or unaffiliated domestic owner that filed an agreement under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section becomes a member of a consolidated group. A statement referencing this paragraph (g)(2)(iv)(A)(4) must be attached to the timely filed (including extensions) consolidated income tax return of the consolidated group, setting forth the information required in paragraph (g)(2)(i)(B) of this section, the amount of each dual consolidated loss, and  200234 I.R.B.  404  August 26, 2002   the year incurred. The consolidated group also must continue to comply in subsequent years with the reporting requirements in paragraph (g)(2)(vi) of this section for each dual consolidated loss. (5) A dual resident corporation, or domestic owner, that is a member of a consolidated group that filed an agreement under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section (the acquired group) becomes a member of another consolidated group (the acquiring group), provided that each member of the acquired group that is an includible corporation (within the meaning of section 1504(b)) in the new consolidated group must be included immediately after the acquisition in a consolidated income tax return filed by the acquiring group. A statement referencing this paragraph (g)(2)(iv)(A)(5) must be attached to the timely filed (including extensions) consolidated income tax return of the acquiring group, setting forth the information required in paragraph (g)(2)(i)(B) of this section, the amount of each dual consolidated loss, and the year incurred. The acquiring group also must continue to comply in subsequent years with the reporting requirements in paragraph (g)(2)(vi) of this section for each dual consolidated loss. ***** (D) Example. The following example illustrates the operation of paragraph (g)(2)(iv)(A)(5) of this section. Example.(i) Facts. C is the common parent of a consolidated group (the ""C Group"") that includes DRC, a domestic corporation. DRC is a dual resident corporation and incurs a dual consolidated loss in its taxable year ending December 31, Year 1. The C Group complies with paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section and its associated requirements with respect to the Year 1 dual consolidated loss. The C Group does not incur a dual consolidated loss in Year 2. On December 31, Year 2, stock constituting section 1504(a)(2) ownership of C is acquired by D, an unaffiliated domestic corporation. Immediately after and as a result of the acquisition, the C Group ceases to exist, and all the C Group members, including DRC, become includible members of a consolidated group of which D is the common parent (the ""D Group""). (ii) Acquisition not a triggering event. Under paragraph (g)(2)(iv)(A)(5) of this section, the acquisition by D of the C Group is not an event requiring the recapture of the Year 1 dual consolidated loss of DRC, or the payment of an interest charge, as described in paragraph (g)(2)(vii) of this section, provided that the D Group files the statement described in paragraph (g)(2)(iv)(A)(5) of this section and continues to comply with the reporting requirements of paragraph (g)(2)(vi) of this section.  (iii) Subsequent event. A triggering event occurs on December 31, Year 3, that requires recapture by DRC of the dual consolidated loss it incurred for Year 1 and any dual consolidated loss incurred in Year 3, as well as the payment of an interest charge, as provided in paragraph (g)(2)(vii) of this section. Each member of the D Group, including DRC and the other former members of the C Group, is severally liable under  1.15026 for the additional tax (and the interest charge) due upon the recapture of the dual consolidated loss of DRC.

(Filed by the Office of the Federal Register on July 31, 2002, 8:45 a.m., and published in the issue of the Federal Register for August 1, 2002, 67 F.R. 49892)  Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and Notice of Public Hearing Compensatory Stock Options Under Section 482 REG10635902 AGENCY: Internal (IRS), Treasury. Revenue Service  ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking and notice of public hearing. SUMMARY: This document contains proposed regulations that provide guidance regarding the application of the rules of section 482 governing qualified cost sharing arrangements. These proposed regulations provide guidance regarding the treatment of stock-based compensation for purposes of the rules governing qualified cost sharing arrangements and for purposes of the comparability factors to be considered under the comparable profits method. This document also provides notice of a public hearing on these proposed regulations.  August 26, 2002  405  200234 I.R.B.   The accuracy of the estimated burden associated with the proposed collection of information (see below); How the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected may be enhanced; How the burden of complying with the proposed collection of information may be minimized, including through the application of automated collection techniques or other forms of information technology; and Estimates of capital or start-up costs and costs of operation, maintenance, and purchase of services to provide information. The collection of information requirements are in proposed  1.482 7(d)(2)(iii)(B) and 1.4827(j)(2)(i)(F). This information is required by the IRS to monitor compliance with the federal tax rules for determining stock-based compensation costs related to intangible development to be shared among controlled participants in qualified cost sharing arrangements. The likely respondents are taxpayers who enter into these arrangements. Responses to this collection of information are required to determine these taxpayers' proper shares of stock-based compensation costs incurred with respect to these arrangements. Section 1.4827(d)(2)(iii)(B) of the proposed regulations provides that controlled participants may elect an alternative method of measurement of certain stockbased compensation by clearly referring to the election in the written cost sharing agreement required under existing regulations or by amending a cost sharing agreement already in effect to refer to the election. Section 1.4827(j)(2)(i)(F) requires controlled participants to maintain documentation necessary to establish the amount taken into account as operating expenses attributable to stock-based compensation, including the method of measurement and timing used in computing that amount, and the data, as of the date of grant, used to identify stock-based compensation related to the development of intangibles. Estimated total annual reporting and/or recordkeeping burden: 2,000 hours. Estimated average annual burden hours per respondent and/or recordkeeper: The estimated annual burden per respondent  varies from 2 hours to 7 hours, depending on individual circumstances, with an estimated average of 4 hours. Estimated number of respondents and/or recordkeepers: 500. Estimated frequency of responses: Annually. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a valid control number assigned by the Office of Management and Budget. Books or records relating to a collection of information must be retained as long as their contents may become material in the administration of any internal revenue law. Generally, tax returns and tax return information are confidential, as required by 26 U.S.C. 6103. Background Section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code generally provides that the Secretary may allocate gross income, deductions and credits between or among two or more taxpayers owned or controlled by the same interests in order to prevent evasion of taxes or clearly to reflect income. On July 8, 1994, Treasury and the IRS published in the Federal Register (59 FR 34988) final regulations (T.D. 8552, 19942 C.B. 93) under section 482 in areas other than cost sharing. On December 20, 1995, Treasury and the IRS published in the Federal Register (60 FR 65553) final cost sharing regulations (T.D. 8632, 19961 C.B. 85), effective for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1996. Amendments to T.D. 8632 were published in the Federal Register on May 13, 1996, at 61 FR 21955 (T.D. 8670, 19961 C.B. 99), and on January 3, 2001, at 66 FR 280 (T.D. 8930, 20011 C.B. 433). The 1994 final regulations under section 482 contain general provisions at  1.4821 describing the arm's length standard and the best method rule. The final cost sharing regulations at  1.4827 generally require that controlled participants in a qualified cost sharing arrangement share intangible development costs in proportion to their shares of the reasonably anticipated benefits attributable to the development of the intangibles covered by the arrangement. These proposed regulations clarify that stock-based compensation is taken into account in determining  the operating expenses treated as a controlled participant's intangible development costs for purposes of the cost sharing provisions; provide rules for measuring the cost associated with stock-based compensation; clarify that the utilization and treatment of stock-based compensation is appropriately taken into account as a comparability factor for purposes of the comparable profits method under  1.4825; and clarify the coordination of the cost sharing rules of  1.4827 with the arm's length standard as set forth in  1.4821. Explanation of Provisions Overview The Tax Reform Act of 1986, Public Law 99514, 100 Stat. 2085, 2561 et seq. (reprinted at 19863 C.B. (Vol 1) 1, 478) (the Act), amended section 482 to require that consideration for intangible property transferred in a controlled transaction be commensurate with the income attributable to the intangible. The legislative history of the Act indicated that in adding this commensurate with income standard to section 482, Congress did not intend to preclude the use of bona fide research and development cost sharing arrangements as an appropriate method of allocating income attributable to intangibles among related parties, ""if and to the extent such agreements are consistent with the purpose of this provision that the income allocated among the parties reasonably reflect the actual economic activity undertaken by each. Under such a bona fide cost-sharing arrangement, the cost-sharer would be expected to bear its portion of all research and development costs. . . ."" H.R. Rep. No. 99841, at II638 (1986) (the Conference Report). The Conference Report recommended that the IRS conduct a comprehensive study and consider whether the regulations under section 482 (issued in 1968) should be modified in any respect. In response to this directive, on October 18, 1988, Treasury and the IRS issued a study of intercompany pricing (the White Paper), published as Notice 88123, 19882 C.B. 458. With respect to cost sharing arrangements, the White Paper observed that Congress intended such arrangements to produce results consistent with the purposes of the commensurate with income standard in section 482, and in particular that allocations of income among the par-  200234 I.R.B.  406  August 26, 2002   ticipants reasonably reflect the participants' respective economic activity. 19882 C.B. at 459, 495. The White Paper further observed that Congress intended that Treasury and the IRS apply and interpret the commensurate with income standard consistently with the arm's length standard. 19882 C.B. at 458, 477. Section 1.4821 of the 1994 final regulations provides that a controlled transaction meets the arm's length standard if the results of the transaction are consistent with the results that would have been realized if uncontrolled taxpayers had engaged in the same transaction under the same circumstances. A method selected under the best method rule is used to determine whether a controlled transaction produces an arm's length result. The regulations reference  1.4822 through 1.4826 as providing specific methods to be used in this determination. Section 1.4827 of the 1995 final regulations implements the commensurate with income standard in the context of cost sharing arrangements. The final cost sharing regulations require that controlled participants in a qualified cost sharing arrangement share all costs incurred that are related to the development of intangibles in proportion to their shares of the reasonably anticipated benefits attributable to that development. Section 1.4827(d)(1) defines these intangible development costs as including operating expenses as defined in  1.4825(d)(3), other than depreciation or amortization, plus an arm's length rental charge determined under  1.482 2(c) for the use of any tangible property made available to the qualified cost sharing arrangement. Section 1.4825(d)(3) defines operating expenses, for purposes of the comparable profits method under section 482, as including all expenses not included in cost of goods sold except for interest expense, foreign and domestic income taxes, and any other expenses not related to the operation of the relevant business activity. In the context of cost sharing, the relevant business activity is the development of intangibles covered by the cost sharing arrangement. Since the promulgation of the final cost sharing regulations in 1995, the issue has been raised whether operating expenses within the meaning of  1.4827(d)(1) include compensation provided by a controlled participant in the form of stock  options. Related questions have been posed in this context regarding the interaction between the arm's length standard and the cost sharing regulations. These proposed regulations amend the final regulations to clarify that stock-based compensation must be taken into account in determining operating expenses under  1.4827(d)(1) and to provide rules for measuring stock-based compensation costs. These proposed regulations also clarify that stock-based compensation should be taken into account in comparability determinations pursuant to the comparable profits method under  1.4825. Finally, the proposed regulations amend the final regulations to include express provisions to coordinate the cost sharing rules of  1.4827 with the arm's length standard as set forth in  1.4821. Inclusion of Stock-Based Compensation in Intangible Development Costs The proposed regulations provide that in determining a controlled participant's operating expenses within the meaning of  1.4827(d)(1), all compensation, including stock-based compensation, must be taken into account. The proposed regulations also provide rules for measuring the operating expenses attributable to stockbased compensation. The definition of stock-based compensation for purposes of these proposed regulations is broad, comprising any compensation provided by a controlled participant to an employee or independent contractor in the form of equity instruments, stock options, or rights in (or determined by reference to) such instruments or options, regardless of whether the compensation ultimately is settled in the form of cash, stock, or other property. Thus, these proposed regulations are intended to reach such forms of compensation as restricted stock, nonstatutory stock options, statutory stock options (incentive stock options described in section 422(b) and options granted under an employee stock purchase plan described in section 423(b)), stock appreciation rights, and phantom stock. Statutory stock options are within the scope of the definition regardless of whether the employer is entitled to an income tax deduction with respect to those options.  The proposed regulations provide that the determination of whether stock-based compensation is related to the development of intangibles covered by the qualified cost sharing arrangement is to be made as of the date the stock-based compensation is granted. For example, controlled participants must share the costs attributable to stock-based compensation that is granted to an employee who, at the time of grant, is performing research services related to the qualified cost sharing arrangement. Treasury and the IRS believe that this rule appropriately identifies the stock-based compensation to be shared because the grant of compensation generally is the economic event most closely associated in time with the services being compensated. Because a controlled participant may choose whether to provide stockbased or cash compensation, this rule also promotes neutrality of treatment as among various forms of compensation. Finally, because the grant-date identification rule applies irrespective of the method used by the controlled participant to measure or determine the timing of inclusion of stockbased compensation in the intangible development costs to be shared, the rule ensures that the same items of stock-based compensation will be taken into account under any method, thus promoting neutrality in the choice of measurement method afforded by the proposed regulations. In applying the grant-date identification rule in cases where a stock option is repriced or otherwise modified, the rules of section 424(h) and related regulations will be used to determine whether the grant of a new stock option has occurred. Treasury and the IRS recognize that tax and other accounting principles permit the cost associated with stock-based compensation to be measured and taken into account as of different points in time and under various methodologies for different purposes. For example, for general income tax purposes, the amount of compensation taxed to an employee and deductible by an employer upon exercise of a stock option not governed by sections 421424 (commonly referred to as a nonstatutory stock option) generally is measured by the ""spread"" between the option price and the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of exercise. See  83(a), 83(h), 1.831(a)(1), 1.836(a)(1).  August 26, 2002  407  200234 I.R.B.   For various other tax purposes, however, the IRS has adopted modified versions of economic pricing models, such as the Black-Scholes model, for valuing stock options at specific points in time prior to exercise. See Rev. Proc. 9834, 19981 C.B. 983 (estate and gift tax valuation); Rev. Proc. 200213, 20028 I.R.B. 549, as modified by Rev. Proc. 200245, 200227 I.R.B. 40 (measurement of stock-optionbased golden parachute payments under sections 280G and 4999). Pricing models also have been adopted in the context of financial accounting. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) refers to pricing models for measurement of the stock-based compensation expense that a company is required to report at ""fair value,"" either as a charge to income or, at the company's option, in a pro forma footnote disclosure. See FASB Statement 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (October 1995). Generally accepted pricing models can be applied at the date of grant to estimate the economic cost of a stock option to the issuer. General support for the use of economic measures of cost in the transfer pricing context may be found in the legislative history of the commensurate with income standard and in the White Paper, which state that to be consistent with the commensurate with income standard, cost sharing arrangements must ""reflect the actual economic activity"" of participants. Conference Report at II-638 and White Paper at 19882 C.B. 495. In establishing rules for measurement of the operating expenses attributable to stock-based compensation for cost sharing purposes, Treasury and the IRS believe that due regard must be given to the emphasis placed on economic factors in the legislative history of the commensurate with income standard and in the White Paper. Treasury and the IRS also recognize the importance of providing rules that are administrable. The proposed regulations prescribe a general rule of measurement based primarily on the amount and timing of the income tax deduction associated with stockbased compensation, while in certain cases permitting controlled participants in a qualified cost sharing arrangement to elect a rule of measurement with respect to stock options based on the amount and timing of the fair value of the option that  is required to be computed for purposes of financial accounting in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). To provide for uniform measurement of the cost associated with both statutory and nonstatutory stock options, the general deduction-based measurement rule is applied as if section 421 did not apply upon the exercise of a statutory stock option. Thus, although section 421 generally disallows compensation deductions with respect to the exercise of statutory stock options except in the case of certain disqualifying dispositions, the proposed regulations treat the exercise of a statutory stock option as giving rise to a deduction for purposes of the deduction-based measurement rule. Consequently, the operating expense with respect to all stock options, whether statutory or nonstatutory, generally will be measured by the ""spread"" and taken into account as of the date the stock option is exercised. To place a foreign controlled participant on an equal footing with a United States controlled participant, an amount is treated as deductible by a foreign controlled participant, solely for purposes of the general deduction-based measurement rule, as if the amount were paid or incurred by a United States taxpayer, even if the foreign controlled participant is not subject to United States taxing jurisdiction and so would not otherwise be entitled to a deduction under United States income tax law. Solely for purposes of the general deduction-based measurement rule, any item of stock-based compensation that is eligible to be exercised and that remains outstanding on the expiration or termination of a qualified cost sharing arrangement will be treated as being exercised immediately before the expiration or termination, provided that the fair market value of the underlying stock at that time exceeds the price at which the stock-based compensation is exercisable. The result of this treatment is that the excess of the fair market value of the underlying stock over the price at which the stock-based compensation is exercisable is taken into account as an operating expense for the taxable year in which the qualified cost sharing arrangement expires or terminates. This special rule would apply, for example, in the case of a currently exercis-  able statutory stock option or a substantially vested nonstatutory stock option where the fair market value of the underlying stock exceeds the option price at the time the qualified cost sharing arrangement is terminated. The rule ensures that controlled participants take into account for cost sharing purposes all stock-based compensation that is attributable to the development of intangibles and has become exercisable during the term of the cost sharing arrangement. In cases where significant amounts of stock-based compensation have been granted, but are not exercisable at the time of the termination of the arrangement, the IRS anticipates that factual issues regarding the termination of the qualified cost sharing arrangement will arise if the arrangement is reinstated. A similar rule applies if, during the term of the qualified cost sharing arrangement, a newly granted stock option is determined to result from a repricing or other modification of another stock option and is not related to the development of intangibles at the time of the modification. In this situation, an amount is taken into account for purposes of the general deduction-based measurement rule as if the original stock option had been exercised immediately before the modification. The proposed regulations permit an elective method of measurement and timing with respect to options on publicly traded stock of companies subject to financial reporting under U.S. GAAP, provided that the stock is traded on a United States securities market. Under the election, the amount of the operating expense associated with compensatory stock options is their ""fair value,"" generally measured by reference to economic pricing models as of the date of grant, as reflected either as a charge against income or as a footnote disclosure in the company's audited financial statements, in compliance with current U.S. GAAP. Where the election is made with respect to stock in a company that does not take stock-based compensation expense as a charge against income for financial accounting purposes but rather chooses, as permitted by current U.S. GAAP (for example, FASB Statement 123), to disclose such compensation in a footnote to the financial statements, stockbased compensation is taken into account  200234 I.R.B.  408  August 26, 2002   in the same amount, and as of the same time, as the pro forma fair value figures reflected in the footnote. The election to measure the operating expense associated with compensatory stock options in accordance with financial accounting rules must be clearly referenced in the written cost sharing agreement required under  1.4827(b)(4) and must bind all controlled participants. A transition rule permits controlled participants to amend pre-existing cost sharing agreements not later than the latest due date (without regard to extensions) for an income tax return of a controlled participant for the first taxable year beginning after the effective date of final regulations incorporating this rule. The proposed regulations contain consistency rules to ensure that all controlled participants in a qualified cost sharing arrangement normally will use the same method of measurement for all options on publicly traded stock with respect to that arrangement. Once a method of measurement has been adopted with respect to stock options granted in a taxable year following the effective date of the proposed regulations, the method of measurement may not be changed for those stock options. With respect to subsequently granted stock options to which the transition rule does not apply, the proposed regulations provide that a method of measurement different from that adopted following the effective date of the proposed regulations may be adopted only with the consent of the Commissioner. To ensure that taxpayers maintain documentation supporting all amounts taken into account as operating expenses attributable to stock-based compensation, these proposed regulations add to the documentation requirements of  1.4827(j)(2)(i) an item specifically relating to stock-based compensation. Treatment of Stock-Based Compensation Under Other Provisions The treatment of stock-based compensation as a cost or operating expense for purposes of the transfer pricing of services and for purposes of applying the comparable profits method will be considered by Treasury and the IRS in a separate regulation project. Accordingly, these regulations do not propose amendments to the definitions of cost or operating expense in   1.4822(b) or  1.4825(d)(3). However, these proposed regulations amend  1.4825(c)(2)(iv) to clarify that in applying the comparable profits method, material differences among the tested party and uncontrolled comparables with respect to the utilization or treatment of stockbased compensation are an appropriate basis for comparability adjustments. Coordination of Cost Sharing With the Arm's Length Standard These proposed regulations add express provisions coordinating the cost sharing rules of  1.4827 with the arm's length standard as set forth in  1.4821. New  1.4827(a)(3) clarifies that in order for a qualified cost sharing arrangement to produce results consistent with an arm's length result within the meaning of  1.4821(b)(1), all requirements of  1.4827 must be met, including the requirement that each controlled participant's share of intangible development costs equal its share of reasonably anticipated benefits attributable to the development of intangibles. The proposed regulations also make amendments to  1.4821 to clarify that  1.4827 provides the specific method to be used to evaluate whether a qualified cost sharing arrangement produces results consistent with an arm's length result, and to clarify that under the best method rule, the provisions of  1.4827 set forth the applicable method with respect to qualified cost sharing arrangements. Through these new provisions, Treasury and the IRS intend to clarify that all of the specific rules necessary to the determination of costs, reasonably anticipated benefits and other aspects of qualified cost sharing arrangements are either contained or cross-referenced within  1.4827. Thus, for example, regarding buy-in payments with respect to pre-existing intangibles made available to qualified cost sharing arrangements,  1.4827(a)(2) and 1.4827(g) cross-reference various other sections of the regulations under section 482. For the determination of reasonably anticipated benefits,  1.4827(f)(3) expressly requires that certain comparability factors described in  1.4821(c)(2)(ii) under the best method rule be considered. With respect to identification of the costs to be shared, the rules are contained within  1.4827(d)(1), which refers to ""all"" in-  tangible development costs and crossreferences the definition of operating expenses in  1.4825(d)(3) and the provisions of  1.4822(c) governing determination of arm's length rental charges for tangible property. The  1.4827(d)(1) definition of intangible development costs is supplemented by the provisions of  1.4827(c)(2), which cross-references the provisions of  1.4824(f)(3)(iii) to determine arm's length consideration for research assistance performed by a controlled taxpayer that is not a controlled participant. Proposed Effective Date These regulations are proposed to apply to stock-based compensation granted in taxable years beginning on or after the date these regulations are published as a Treasury Decision promulgating final regulations in the Federal Register. Notwithstanding this prospective effective date, Treasury and the IRS intend that taxpayers may rely on these proposed regulations until the effective date of the final regulations. No inference is intended with respect to the treatment of stock-based compensation granted in taxable years beginning before the effective date of the final regulations. Special Analyses It has been determined that this notice of proposed rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) does not apply to these regulations. It is hereby certified that the collections of information in these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This certification is based upon the fact that few small entities are expected to enter into qualified cost sharing arrangements involving stock-based compensation, and that for those who do, the burdens imposed under  1.482 7(d)(2)(iii)(B) and 1.4827(j)(2)(i)(F) will be minimal. Therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f), this notice of proposed rulemaking will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy  August 26, 2002  409  200234 I.R.B.   of the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business. Comments and Public Hearing Before these proposed regulations are adopted as final regulations, consideration will be given to any electronic or written comments (a signed original and eight (8) copies) that are submitted timely to the IRS. Treasury and the IRS specifically request comments on the clarity of the proposed regulations and how they may be made easier to understand. All comments will be available for public inspection and copying. A public hearing has been scheduled for October 21, 2002, at 10 a.m., in Room 4718, Internal Revenue Building, 1111 Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC. Because of access restrictions, visitors will not be admitted beyond the building lobby more than 30 minutes before the hearing starts. For information about having your name placed on the building access list to attend the hearing, see the ""FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT"" section of this preamble. The rules of 26 CFR 601.601(a)(3) apply to the hearing. Persons who wish to present oral comments at the hearing must submit written comments and an outline of the topics to be discussed and the time to be devoted to each topic (signed original and eight (8) copies) by September 30, 2002. A period of 10 minutes will be allotted to each person for making comments. An agenda showing the scheduling of the speakers will be prepared after the deadline for receiving outlines has passed. Copies of the agenda will be available free of charge at the hearing. Drafting Information The principal author of these proposed regulations is Douglas Giblen of the Office of Associate Chief Counsel (International). However, other personnel from the Treasury and the IRS participated in their development. ***** Proposed Amendments Regulations to the  PART 1 -- INCOME TAXES Paragraph 1.

Removing the period and adding a semicolon and adding the word ""and"" at the end of paragraph (j)(2)(i)(E). 7. Adding paragraph (j)(2)(i)(F). 8. Revising paragraph (k). The additions and revisions read as follows:  1.4827 Sharing of costs. (a) * * * (3) Coordination with  1.4821. A qualified cost sharing arrangement produces results that are consistent with an arm's length result within the meaning of  1.4821(b)(1) if, and only if, each controlled participant's share of the costs (as determined under paragraph (d) of this section) of intangible development under the qualified cost sharing arrangement equals its share of reasonably anticipated benefits attributable to such development (as required by paragraph (a)(2) of this section) and all other requirements of this section are satisfied. (4) Cross references. * * * ***** (d) * * * (2) Stock-based compensation.--(i) In general. For purposes of this section, a controlled participant's operating expenses include all costs attributable to compensation, including stock-based compensation. As used in this section, the term stockbased compensation means any compensation provided by a controlled participant to an employee or independent contractor in the form of equity instruments, options to acquire stock (stock options), or rights with respect to (or determined by reference to) equity instruments or stock options, including but not limited to property to which section 83 applies and stock options to which section 421 applies, regardless of whether ultimately settled in the form of cash, stock, or other property. (ii) Identification of stock-based compensation related to intangible development. The determination of whether stockbased compensation is related to the intangible development area within the  meaning of paragraph (d)(1) of this section is made as of the date that the stockbased compensation is granted. Accordingly, all stock-based compensation that is granted during the term of the qualified cost sharing arrangement and is related at date of grant to the development of intangibles covered by the arrangement is included as an intangible development cost under paragraph (d)(1) of this section. In the case of a repricing or other modification of a stock option, the determination of whether the repricing or other modification constitutes the grant of a new stock option for purposes of this paragraph (d)(2)(ii) will be made in accordance with the rules of section 424(h) and related regulations. (iii) Measurement and timing of stockbased compensation expense.--(A) In general. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d)(2)(iii), the operating expense attributable to stock-based compensation is equal to the amount allowable to the controlled participant as a deduction for federal income tax purposes with respect to that stock-based compensation (for example, under section 83(h)) and is taken into account as an operating expense under this section for the taxable year for which the deduction is allowable. (1) Transfers to which section 421 applies. Solely for purposes of this paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(A), section 421 does not apply to the transfer of stock pursuant to the exercise of an option that meets the requirements of section 422(a) or 423(a). (2) Deductions of foreign controlled participants. Solely for purposes of this paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(A), an amount is treated as deductible by a foreign controlled participant otherwise not entitled to a deduction under United States income tax law as if the amount were paid or incurred by a United States taxpayer. (3) Modification of stock option. Solely for purposes of this paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(A), if the repricing or other modification of a stock option is determined, under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, to constitute the grant of a new stock option not related to the development of intangibles, the stock option that is repriced or otherwise modified will be treated as being exercised immediately before the modification, provided that the stock option is then substantially vested within the meaning of  1.833(b) (or, in the case of stock options to which section  421 applies, exercisable) and the fair market value of the underlying stock then exceeds the price at which the stock option is exercisable. Accordingly, the amount of the deduction that would be allowable (or treated as allowable under this paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(A)) to the controlled participant upon exercise of the stock option immediately before the modification must be taken into account as an operating expense as of the date of the modification. (4) Expiration or termination of qualified cost sharing arrangement. Solely for purposes of this paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(A), if an item of stock-based compensation related to the development of intangibles is not exercised during the term of a qualified cost sharing arrangement, that item of stock-based compensation will be treated as being exercised immediately before the expiration or termination of the qualified cost sharing arrangement, provided that the stock-based compensation is then substantially vested within the meaning of  1.83 3(b) (or, in the case of stock options to which section 421 applies, exercisable) and the fair market value of the underlying stock then exceeds the price at which the stock-based compensation is exercisable. Accordingly, the amount of the deduction that would be allowable (or treated as allowable under this paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(A)) to the controlled participant upon exercise of the stock-based compensation must be taken into account as an operating expense as of the date of the expiration or termination of the qualified cost sharing arrangement. (B) Election with respect to options on publicly traded stock. With respect to stock-based compensation in the form of options on publicly traded stock, the controlled participants in a qualified cost sharing arrangement may elect to take into account all operating expenses attributable to those stock options in the same amount, and as of the same time, as the fair value of the stock options reflected as a charge against income in audited financial statements or disclosed in footnotes to such financial statements, prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles by or on behalf of the company issuing the publicly traded stock. As used in this section, the term publicly traded stock means stock that is regularly traded on an established United States securities market and is issued by a company whose financial statements are prepared in  August 26, 2002  411  200234 I.R.B.   accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles for the taxable year. The election described in this paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B) is made by an explicit reference to the election in the written cost sharing agreement required by paragraph (b)(4) of this section or in a written amendment to the cost sharing agreement entered into with the consent of the Commissioner pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(C) of this section. In the case of a qualified cost sharing arrangement in existence on the effective date of this paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B), the election must be made by written amendment to the cost sharing agreement not later than the latest due date (without regard to extensions) of a federal income tax return of any controlled participant for the first taxable year beginning after the effective date of this paragraph, and the consent of the Commissioner is not required. (C) Consistency. Generally, all controlled participants in a qualified cost sharing arrangement taking options on publicly traded stock into account under paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(A) or (d)(2)(iii)(B) of this section must use that same method of measurement and timing for all options on publicly traded stock with respect to that qualified cost sharing arrangement. Controlled participants may change their method only with the consent of the Commissioner and only with respect to stock options granted during taxable years subsequent to the taxable year in which the Commissioner's consent is obtained. All controlled participants in the qualified cost sharing arrangement must join in requests for the Commissioner's consent under this paragraph. Thus, for example, if the controlled participants make the election described in paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B) of this section upon the formation of the qualified cost sharing arrangement, the election may be revoked only with the consent of the Commissioner, and the consent will apply only to stock options granted in taxable years subsequent to the taxable year in which consent is obtained. Similarly, if controlled participants already have granted stock options that have been or will be taken into account under the general rule of paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, then except in cases specified in the last sentence of paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B)  of this section, the controlled participants may make the election described in paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B) of this section only with the consent of the Commissioner, and the consent will apply only to stock options granted in taxable years subsequent to the taxable year in which consent is obtained. (3) Examples. * * * ***** (j) * * * (2) * * * (i) * * * (F) The amount taken into account as operating expenses attributable to stockbased compensation, including the method of measurement and timing used with respect to that amount as well as the data, as of date of grant, used to identify stockbased compensation related to the development of intangibles covered by the qualified cost sharing arrangement. ***** (k) Effective date. This section is generally effective for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1996. However, paragraphs (a)(3), (d)(2), and (j)(2)(i)(F) of this section are effective for taxable years beginning on or after the date of publication of the Treasury Decision adopting those rules as final regulations in the Federal Register.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Paperwork Reduction Act The collection of information contained in this notice of proposed rulemaking has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3507(d)). Comments on the collection of information should be sent to the Office of Management and Budget, Attn: Desk Officer for the Department of the Treasury, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503, with copies to the Internal Revenue Service, Attn: IRS Reports Clearance Officer, W:CAR:MP:FP:S, Washington, DC 20224. Comments on the collections of information should be received by October 1, 2002. Comments are specifically requested concerning: Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the proper operation of the functions of the Internal Revenue Service, including whether the information will have practical utility; The accuracy of the estimated burden associated with the proposed collection of information (see below); How the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected may be enhanced; How the burden of complying with the proposed collection of information may be minimized, including through the application of automated collection techniques or other forms of information technology; and  Estimates of capital or start-up costs and costs of operation, maintenance, and purchase of service to provide information. The collection of information in these proposed regulations is in  1.6049 4(b)(5)(i) and 1.60496(e)(4)(i) and (ii). This information is required to determine if taxpayers have properly reported amounts received as income. The collection of information is mandatory. The likely respondents are businesses and other for-profit institutions. The estimated average annual burden per respondent and/or recordkeeper required by  1.60494(b)(5)(i) and 1.60496(e)(4)(i) and (ii) will be reflected in the burdens of Forms 1042, 1042S and the income tax return of a foreign person. Further, the estimated average annual burden per respondent and/or recordkeeper for the statement required by  1.60496(e)(4)(i) is as follows: Estimated total annual reporting burden: 500 hours. Estimated average annual burden per respondent: 15 minutes. Estimated number of respondents: 2000. Estimated annual frequency of responses: annually. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless the collection of information displays a valid control number assigned by the Office of Management and Budget. Books or records relating to a collection of information must be retained as long as their contents may become material in the administration of any internal revenue law. Generally, tax returns and tax return information are confidential, as required by 26 U.S.C. 6103. Background and Explanation of Provisions On January 17, 2001, the IRS and Treasury published a notice of proposed rulemaking (REG12610000) in the Federal Register (66 FR 3925, corrected by REG12610000, 20011 C.B. 862 [66 FR 15820] and Ann. 200150, 20011 C.B. 1184 [66 FR 16019]) under Section 6049 (the 2001 proposed regulations), which would provide that U.S. bank deposit interest paid to any nonresident alien individual must be reported annually to the IRS. Under regulations currently in effect,  reporting of U.S. bank deposit interest is required only if the interest is paid to a U.S. person or a nonresident alien individual who is a resident of Canada. The IRS and Treasury requested comments on the 2001 proposed regulations, and a public hearing regarding the 2001 proposed regulations was held on June 21, 2001. The IRS and Treasury received numerous comments on the proposed regulations, and several commentators spoke at the public hearing on the 2001 proposed regulations. After careful consideration of all the comments received, the IRS and Treasury have concluded that the 2001 proposed regulations should be withdrawn and a new notice of proposed rulemaking should be issued on this subject. Accordingly, this document withdraws the 2001 proposed regulations and provides new proposed regulations (the 2002 proposed regulations). Most of the comments received on the 2001 proposed regulations were highly critical of the regulations. In particular, many commentators expressed the view that the administrative burden imposed by the 2001 proposed regulations would significantly outweigh any benefits obtained by the IRS from the additional information collected. Some commentators also stated that the 2001 proposed regulations could have a severe negative impact on U.S. banks, particularly U.S. banks with a deposit base that included a significant number of nonresident alien individuals, some of whom had expressed concerns that the information collected under the 2001 proposed regulations might be misused. Other commentators raised certain technical concerns regarding the 2001 proposed regulations, particularly with respect to the reporting requirements for bank deposit interest paid to joint account holders. After consideration of the comments received, the IRS and Treasury have concluded that the 2001 proposed regulations were overly broad in requiring annual information reporting with respect to U.S. bank deposit interest paid to any nonresident alien. The IRS and Treasury have decided instead that reporting should be required only for nonresident alien individuals that are residents of certain designated countries. The IRS and Treasury believe that limiting reporting to residents of these countries will facilitate the goals  August 26, 2002  413  200234 I.R.B.   of improving compliance with U.S. tax laws and permitting appropriate information exchange without imposing an undue administrative burden on U.S. banks. Accordingly, the 2002 proposed regulations would modify the current regulations (which require reporting of U.S. bank deposit interest only if paid to Canadian residents) by requiring in addition reporting of U.S. bank deposit interest paid to residents of Australia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Payors may, however, at their option, choose to report bank deposit interest paid to all nonresident aliens or to any nonresident alien who is a resident of a country other than the countries listed above. If the IRS and Treasury determine that this list of countries should be modified in the future, regulations providing such a modification will be proposed and comments will be requested on those proposed regulations. In other respects, the 2002 proposed regulations generally follow the approach set forth in the 2001 proposed regulations. Thus, the 2002 proposed regulations provide that, if a nonresident alien who is a recipient of U.S. bank deposit interest is a resident of a country for which reporting of such interest is required, a copy of Form 1042S, ""Foreign Person's U.S. Source Income Subject to Withholding"", must be furnished to the nonresident alien. Like the 2001 proposed regulations, the 2002 proposed regulations provide that the payor or middleman can satisfy this requirement by furnishing a copy of Form 1042S either in person or to the last known address of the nonresident alien. In addition, to conform to the changes made in the 2002 proposed regulations, the Form 1042S requirements have been modified with respect to joint accounts. For example, the 2001 proposed regulations provide that, if a joint account holder is a U.S. non-exempt recipient, the payor or middleman must report the entire payment to that person. If all joint account holders are foreign persons, the 2001 proposed regulations require the payor or middleman to report the payment to the nonresident alien individual that is a resident of a country with which the United States has an income tax treaty or a tax information exchange agreement (TIEA).  The 2002 proposed regulations retain the requirement that the entire payment be reported to a U.S. non-exempt recipient if there is a U.S. non-exempt recipient that is a joint account holder. However, the 2002 proposed regulations modify the 2001 proposed regulations by providing that, if all joint account holders are foreign persons, reporting is required to any one of the joint account holders that is a resident of one of the listed countries. Section 1.60498(a) currently provides, for purposes of the requirement that U.S. bank deposit interest paid to individuals who are Canadian residents must be reported, that the payor or middleman may rely on the permanent address found on an applicable withholding certificate described in  1.14411(c)(16) (Form W8) to make the determination of whether the nonresident alien individual resides in Canada. However, the regulation also provides that a payor or middleman may rely on its actual knowledge of the individual's residence address in Canada, even if a valid Form W8 has not been provided, to make such a determination. The 2002 proposed regulations, like the 2001 proposed regulations, eliminate this ""actual knowledge of the individual's residence address"" rule because it creates a result that is contrary to the presumption rules contained in  1.14411(b)(3)(iii) (and made applicable to reportable payments by  1.6049 5(d)(2)). In this regard, the presumption rules generally provide that interest on a U.S. bank deposit that cannot be reliably associated with a valid Form W8 or Form W9, ""Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification"", must be presumed to be paid to an undocumented U.S. non-exempt recipient. Accordingly, the 2002 proposed regulations clarify that a payor of interest on such a deposit must report the payment on a Form 1099 as made to a U.S. non-exempt recipient in accordance with the presumption rules. Further, such payment is subject to backup withholding under section 3406. Proposed Effective Date These regulations are proposed to apply to payments made after December 31 of the year in which they are published as final regulations in the Federal Register.  Special Analyses It has been determined that this notice of proposed rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) does not apply to these regulations, and, because the regulations do not impose a collection of information on small entities, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) does not apply. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Code, this notice of proposed rulemaking will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business. Comments and Public Hearing Before these proposed regulations are adopted as final regulations, consideration will be given to any written comments (a signed original and eight (8) copies) that are submitted timely (in the manner described in the ""ADDRESSES"" portion of this preamble) to the IRS. The IRS and Treasury Department request comments on the clarity of the proposed rules and how they can be made easier to understand. All comments will be available for public inspection and copying. A public hearing has been scheduled for December 5, 2002, beginning at 10 a.m. in Room 4718, Internal Revenue Building, 1111 Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC. Due to building security procedures, visitors must enter at the main entrance, located at 1111 Constitution Avenue, NW. In addition, all visitors must present photo identification to enter the building. Because of access restrictions, visitors will not be admitted beyond the immediate entrance area more than 30 minutes before the hearing starts. For information about having your name placed on the building access list to attend the hearing, see the ""FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT"" portion of this preamble. The rules of 26 CFR 601.601(a)(3) apply to the hearing. Persons who wish to present oral comments must submit written comments and an outline of the topics to be discussed and the time to be devoted to each topic (a signed original and eight (8) copies) by November 14,  200234 I.R.B.  414  August 26, 2002   2002. A period of 10 minutes will be allotted to each person for making comments. An agenda showing the scheduling of the speakers will be prepared after the deadline for reviewing outlines has passed. Copies of the agenda will be available free of charge at the hearing. Drafting Information The principal author of the regulations is Alexandra K. Helou, Office of Associate Chief Counsel (International). However, other personnel from the IRS and Treasury Department participated in their development. Withdrawal of Proposed Amendments Accordingly, under the authority of 26 U.S.C. 7805, the proposed amendment to 26 CFR parts 1 and 31 that was published in the Federal Register on Wednesday, January 17, 2001 (66 FR 3925, corrected by 66 FR 15820 and 66 FR 16019) is withdrawn. Proposed Amendments Regulations to the  regulations under that section and by the form and its accompanying instructions. See  1.60496(e)(4) for furnishing a copy of the Form 1042S to the payee.

(For interest paid to a Canadian nonresident alien individual on or before December 31 of the year in which final regulations are published in the Federal Register, see  1.60494(b)(5) in effect prior to (effective date of final rules) (see 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 2002.) ***** Par. 3. Section 1.60496 is amended as follows: 1. Paragraph (e)(4) is revised. 2. In paragraph (e)(5), the first sentence is revised and a new sentence is added at the end of the paragraph.

The statement shall include a copy of the Form 1042-S required to be prepared pursuant to  1.6049 4(b)(5) and a statement to the effect that the information on the form is being fur-  Accordingly, 26 CFR parts 1 and 31 are proposed to be amended as follows: PART 1--INCOME TAXES Paragraph 1. The authority citation for part 1 continues to read in part as follows: Authority: 26 U.S.C. 7805 * * * Par. 2. In  1.60494, paragraph (b)(5) is revised to read as follows:  1.60494 Return of information as to interest paid and original issue discount includible in gross income after December 31, 1982. ***** (b) * * * (5) Interest payments to nonresident alien individuals--(i) General rule. In the case of interest aggregating $10 or more paid to a nonresident alien individual (as defined in section 7701(b)(1)(B)) that is reportable under  1.60498(a), the payor shall make an information return on Form 1042S, ""Foreign Person's U.S. Source Income Subject to Withholding"", for the calendar year in which the interest is paid. The payor or middleman shall prepare and file Form 1042S at the time and in the manner prescribed by section 1461 and the  nished to the United States Internal Revenue Service and may be furnished to the government of the foreign country where the recipient resides. (ii) Joint account holders. In the case of joint account holders, a payor or middleman must report the entire amount of interest as paid to any one of the joint account holders that provides a valid Form W9, ""Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification,"" or, if any account holder has not furnished an applicable withholding certificate described in  1.14411(c)(16) (Form W8) or Form W9, any one of the joint account holders that is presumed to be a U.S. nonexempt recipient under  1.60495(d)(2) and 1.14411(b)(3)(iii). If all of the joint account holders have furnished valid Forms W8 certifying their status as foreign persons and any joint account holder is a resident of one of the countries specified in  1.60498(a), then the payor or middleman must report the payment to any one of the joint account holders that is a resident of one of the countries specified in  1.60498(a) (selected account holder). If, however, any joint account holder, including the selected account holder, requests its own Form 1042S and provides information regarding the correct amount to be reported to him, the payor or middleman must furnish a Form 1042S to such account holder and make a corresponding reduction to the amount reported to the selected account holder. If the selected account holder makes such request, the payor or middleman must report the corrected amount to the selected account holder and report the remaining amount to any other joint account holder that is a resident of one of the countries specified in  1.60498(a).

For purposes of the regulations under section 6049, a nonresident alien individual is a person described in section 7701(b)(1)(B). The payor or middleman may rely upon an applicable withholding certificate described in  1.14411(c)(16) (Form W8) that is valid to determine whether the payment is made to a nonresident alien individual who is a resident of one of the countries for which reporting is required. Generally, amounts described in this paragraph (a) are not subject to backup withholding under section 3406. See  31. 3406(g)1(d) of this chapter. However, if the payor or middleman does not have either a valid Form W8 or valid Form W9, ""Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification"", the payor or middleman must report the payment as made to a U.S. non-exempt recipient if it must so treat the payee under the presumption rules of  1.60495(d)(2) and 1.14411(b)(3)(iii) and must also backup withhold under section 3406.

Thus, if an earlier ruling held that a principle applied to A, and the new ruling holds that the same principle also applies to B, the earlier ruling is amplified. (Compare with modified, below). Clarified is used in those instances where the language in a prior ruling is being made clear because the language has caused, or may cause, some confusion. It is not used where a position in a prior ruling is being changed. Distinguished describes a situation where a ruling mentions a previously published ruling and points out an essential difference between them. Modified is used where the substance of a previously published position is being changed. Thus, if a prior ruling held that a principle applied to A but not to B, and the new ruling holds that it applies to both A and B, the prior ruling is modified because it corrects a published position. (Compare with amplified and clarified, above). Obsoleted describes a previously published ruling that is not considered determinative with respect to future transactions. This term is most commonly used in a ruling that lists previously published rulings that are obsoleted because of changes in law or regulations. A ruling may also be obsoleted because the substance has been included in regulations subsequently adopted. Revoked describes situations where the position in the previously published ruling is not correct and the correct position is being stated in the new ruling. Superseded describes a situation where the new ruling does nothing more than restate the substance and situation of a previously published ruling (or rulings). Thus, the term is used to republish under the 1986 Code and regulations the same position published under the 1939 Code and regulations. The term is also used when it is desired to republish in a single ruling a series of situations, names, etc., that were previously published over a period of time in separate rulings. If the new ruling does more than restate the substance of a prior ruling, a combination of terms is used. For example, modified and superseded describes a situation where the substance of a previously published ruling is being changed in part and is continued without change in part and it is desired to restate the valid portion of the previously published ruling in a new ruling that is self contained. In this case, the previously published ruling is first modified and then, as modified, is superseded. Supplemented is used in situations in which a list, such as a list of the names of countries, is published in a ruling and that list is expanded by adding further names in subsequent rulings. After the original ruling has been supplemented several times, a new ruling may be published that includes the list in the original ruling and the additions, and supersedes all prior rulings in the series. Suspended is used in rare situations to show that the previous published rulings will not be applied pending some future action such as the issuance of new or amended regulations, the outcome of cases in litigation, or the outcome of a Service study.

GX069-25-15093917	New Jersey          Division of Revenue                   Processing        Branch                                                                 This unit is responsible for          the initial processing of all State tax returns, license and registration          applications, and the depositing of accompanying revenue. The unit also          receives, sorts, and routes general correspondence concerning tax matters          for the Division of Taxation and billing notices for various State agencies.                    Incoming documents and checks          are extracted from their envelopes and reviewed for completeness by the          Remittance and Document Processing Sections. These documents and checks          are then prepared and routed to the appropriate area for additional processing          by one of three methods: remittance processing devices, digital image          scanners, or traditional data entry.           Image-enabled remittance processors          create a digitized image of the documents and remittances, read specific          information encoded on the document and check, read hand-written information          from the documents, and balance the amount due to the amount paid. Over          3.3 million returns and checks, and 4.4 million licenses and registrations          were processed through remittance processing devices during fiscal year          1998.           Gross Income Tax returns and          Homestead Property Tax Rebate applications are processed through full-page          digital imaging scanners. Intelligent Character Recognition devices read          information from hand-printed returns and information entered into a machine-readable          area generated by commercial tax preparation software packages. Over 3          million returns were processed through this system during the last tax          season. This represents 90% of all Gross Income Tax returns received by          the Division. Enhancements will continue to be made so that other type          documents will be scanned through the Document Processing System.           The Data Capture Section performs          verification or correction of information not recognized through the automated          process of Intelligent Character Recognition (ICR) and performs traditional          data entry of those items requiring this method of processing. After processing          activities are completed, all remittances are prepared for deposit and          the revenue is recorded into the New Jersey Comprehensive Financial System          (NJCFS) through an automated interface or through on-line entries.           In fiscal year 1998, this unit          received and processed over 8.7 million tax returns and documents with          associated revenue of $14 billion.

The terrorist attacks and the subsequent anthrax scare made it a realistic possibility that multiple IRS locations simultaneously could be incapacitated. Since September 11th, IRS has worked aggressively to gain an understanding of these new risks and to deal with them. The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) has been participating in IRS' security efforts in two ways. First, the Office of Investigations (OI) meets daily with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to stay abreast of new threats and is acting as the primary conduit of that information to IRS. Second, the Office of Audit (OA) is working in coordination with the General Accounting Office (GAO) to provide a comprehensive evaluation of IRS' security initiatives. Since  IRS is a highly visible potential target for domestic and international terrorism, appropriate congressional groups receive interim briefings. TIGTA will report formally on the results of its ongoing assessments in its next Semiannual Report to Congress.  Activities  Significant Activities  Providing Emergency and Investigative Assistance Immediately following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, TIGTA provided extensive emergency and investigative assistance to federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. Initial recovery efforts required temporarily relocating the TIGTA staff and operations from the World Trade Center complex and maintaining the investigative continuity of the office. Congress approved supplemental funds to replace TIGTA's New York City office and the equipment destroyed at the World Trade Center. TIGTA Headquarters temporarily ceased normal activities on September 11, 2001, and dedicated all available investigative resources towards the terrorist attack investigation. This included the implementation of a 24-hour TIGTA command post, participation at various command posts established in the area, and enhanced participation at the  TIGTA's FY 2002 Semiannual Report to Congress    March 31, 2002    Significant Activities 1   Significant Activities FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTF) around the country. TIGTA personnel worked expanded schedules and assisted in various investigative efforts, to include conducting pertinent interviews and the collection of evidence at both the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. TIGTA continues to maintain a presence at the FBI's JTTF and support efforts combating terrorism. Under Section 7212 of Title 26 of the United States Code1 and the Restructuring and Reform Act of 19982 (RRA 98), TIGTA has statutory responsibility to investigate and pursue attempts to corrupt or forcibly interfere with the administration of internal revenue laws. A violation of this statute includes threats against IRS personnel and facilities. TIGTA immediately redirected assets to support both the New York staff, as well as the national investigative efforts coordinated by the FBI. This included 24-hour staffing at the FBI command post for all agencies supporting the investigation. It served as the central location and repository for information and investigative results. TIGTA temporarily assigned 10 special agents and maintained coverage at the command post from September 2001 through January 2002. OI's Technical Services Section (TSS) provided extensive emergency and investigative assistance to federal, state and local law enforcement agencies during its response to the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City. TSS deployed its mobile communications command post to coordinate two-way radio communications among United States (U.S.) Treasury bureaus and various elements of the state and local law enforcement first responders.  Diverting the Strategic Enforcement Division (SED) Staff The entire SED staff assisted the FBI in the investigation of international and domestic terrorism. SED secured data and provided summaries of the information to the FBI. As a result of this effort, OI provided the FBI with vital information on data requests. In October 2001, SED expended approximately 2,700 staff hours in direct support of this investigation.  Pictured left to right: TIGTA Special Agent Al Rolek, Investigative Specialist Dave Verhun, Asst.Special Agent-in-Charge Mike Doak and Investigative Specialist Dave Weaver.  Participating in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Air Marshal Program Along with other participating agencies, TIGTA detailed special agents to participate in the FAA Air Marshal Program, which enabled the FAA to quickly strengthen the safety and security of air travel in the U.S. The newly created Transportation Security Administration is now deploying recently hired Air Marshals, which permits the return of TIGTA and other Treasury agents. TIGTA's participation in this effort concluded on April 1, 2002, and allowed the special agents who assisted in the Air Marshal Program to return to their posts of duty to resume their investigative responsibilities.  The Internal Revenue Code (I.R.C.) is contained in Title 26 of the United States Code (U.S.C.). Thus, I.R.C.  7212 and 26 U.S.C.  7212 refer to the same code section. 2  1  Pub. L.

The TIGTA agent participated by using specialized forensic software to examine over 168 hard drives and 30 additional pieces of evidence to identify graphic image files that would otherwise not be detected. Leads from the examination were forwarded to a separate NIPC unit for further analysis and investigation.  federal law enforcement agencies. That day approximately 50 employees were evacuated from the service center. Two employees underwent a thorough decontamination process. While the letter later tested negative for anthrax, criminal proceedings are pending against the individual who allegedly mailed the letter.  Bomb Threat Resulted In Arrest In October 2001, TIGTA special agents arrested an individual who threatened to blow up IRS buildings during telephone contact with agency officials. When interviewed by TIGTA, the individual made reference to the ""World Trade Center bombing."" In November 2001, a federal grand jury returned an indictment charging this person with 18 U.S.C.  844(e), Threat of Explosive. Additionally, a charge of 18 U.S.C.  111, Assaulting, Resisting, or Impeding Federal Officers is pending since the individual assaulted TIGTA special agents at the time of arrest.  Investigations TIGTA, and its predecessor agency, IRS Inspection Service, have a 50-year history of investigating threats to IRS and its employees. Since the terrorist attacks of September 11th, TIGTA has investigated more than 40 incidents involving a suspicious biological or chemical material either mailed to or identified at an IRS lockbox or IRS facility, including anthrax hoax mailings and bomb threats.  Taxpayer Perpetrated Anthrax Hoax An envelope containing a white powdery substance was discovered at an IRS lockbox facility in December 2001. The envelope also contained a note that said, ""This is anthrax."" A female's name was listed as the sender of the envelope. Although the return address on the envelope was fictitious, TIGTA special agents identified the actual address and interviewed an individual who was subsequently cleared of involvement. A former suitor, however, confessed to sending the letter in an attempt to implicate his girlfriend. Although the powder in the envelope tested negative for anthrax, in January 2002 a federal grand jury indicted the individual on one count of violating 18 U.S.C.  876 and one count of violating 26 U.S.C.  7212, Attempting to Interfere with the Administration of Internal Revenue Laws.  Examples of these investigations follow.  Domestic Terrorism Disrupted IRS Service Center Operations In an October 2001 incident that cost IRS almost $16,000 in lost labor, an individual was arrested and indicted for mailing threatening communications to an IRS service center. The letter contained a newspaper article related to anthrax, a handwritten statement that read, ""Call the FBI,"" and a diagram of a human body with marks where surgical incisions would be made. Inside the package was a brown paper bag folded several times. Due to the contents of the letter, a hazardous materials response team was notified, as well as state, local and  TIGTA's FY 2002 Semiannual Report to Congress    March 31, 2002  3   Significant Activities  IRS Employee Pled Guilty to Anti-Muslim Hate Crime In September 2001, subsequent to the terrorist acts at the World Trade Center and Pentagon, the FBI reported to TIGTA that an IRS employee was a suspect in a federal civil rights investigation concerning an anti-Muslim hate crime. It was alleged that the IRS employee vandalized an automobile. The FBI and a local police department substantiated the initial allegation, as well as additional violations of law. In November 2001, the IRS employee was charged with two counts of racial and religious harassment, one count of malicious destruction of property, one count of theft and one count of breaking and entering. In January 2002, the IRS employee pled guilty to one count of malicious destruction of property.  Engines of Change The organization is currently undertaking four major management initiatives. The four initiatives are: Alignment, Leveraging Technology, Human Capital and Performance Driven Organization. These initiatives are designed to restructure and realign the organization to meet the challenges confronting it both today and in the future. By strategically addressing these initiatives, TIGTA plans to transform its work environment.  Inspector General (IG) Community Support Dual IG Function TIGTA's Inspector General, David C. Williams, served as the acting Inspector General for the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) from July 2001 through March 2002. This dual responsibility was a temporary assignment until the permanent HUD Inspector General was confirmed on March 22, 2002.  Other TIGTA Activities Initiatives Virtual Resource Solution (VRS) TIGTA has fully embraced the concept of moving workers out of the traditional office environment and into a Telework environment. As a first step in this evolutionary process, eligible TIGTA employees have the flexibility to work remotely while still meeting the business needs of the organization. TIGTA believes this initiative will maximize its use of technology to improve productivity while still providing a safe, secure and family-friendly work environment for its employees. VRS is an integral part of TIGTA's Engines of Change (see below), which are designed to restructure and realign the organization to meet the challenges of the future workplace.  President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency (PCIE) TIGTA's IG serves as the editor-in-chief of The Journal of Public Inquiry, the twice yearly publication of the PCIE. Journal articles are written by members of the IG community, scholars, and professionals outside the federal government on topics important to the PCIE and the Executive Council on Integrity and Efficiency (ECIE). The Fall/Winter 2001 edition focused on the IG community's ""War on Corruption."" The edition was dedicated to the memory of those who died as a result of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.  4 4 TIGTA's FY 2002 Semiannual Report to Congress  March 31, 2002 TIGTA's FY 2002 Semiannual Report to Congress  March 31, 2002   Significant Activities  2002 Winter Olympics TIGTA supported the security efforts at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah. For three weeks in February 2002, special agents were assigned at both the Coordination Center and the Soldier Hollow venue at the Olympics. The Soldier Hollow venue was the location of several Alpine competition events, including biathlon and cross-country skiing, while the coordination center served as the command post for federal agencies involved in the security efforts. Due largely to the overall preparation and implementation of a sound security plan, the 2002 Winter Olympic Games concluded without the occurrence of any significant security incidents.  terrorism investigation. Specifically, Commissioner Rossotti acknowledged the New York Field Division efforts to assist the FBI's JTTF and the TIGTA presence at the multi-agency Leads Desk and the Command Center. Commissioner Rossotti also acknowledged TIGTA's Technical Services, TIGTA's Office of Audit, Office of Information Technology, Office of Management Services and the Management Assistants in the New York Field Division for their efforts in our nation's resumption efforts and our fight against terrorism.  Deputy Inspector General for Audit Awarded Presidential Rank Award Each year the President recognizes a small percentage of the Senior Executive Service for their ability to lead a Government that delivers great service, achieves results and continually pushes to get the job done more effectively and efficiently. This year, TIGTA's Deputy Inspector General for Audit, Pamela J. Gardiner, was awarded the Presidential Rank Award for Meritorious Service for her achievements within the Audit community.  Employee Recognition Employees are TIGTA's most important assets. It is through their hard work and dedication that TIGTA is able to successfully accomplish its mission. While the organization is proud of all its employees, TIGTA would like to give special recognition to those individuals who have been honored by individuals and organizations outside of TIGTA.  IRS Commissioner Recognizes TIGTA Employees On November 5, 2001, IRS Commissioner Charles O. Rossotti, presented the Commissioner's Award to the TIGTA employees in the New York Field Division. Special Agent-in-Charge Michael Delgado accepted the award on behalf of the New York Field Division. Commissioner Rossotti commended the New York Field Division for the manner in which they responded to the events of September 11, 2001, and their participation in the government business resumption effort. Additionally, Commissioner Rossotti praised the Division special agents for their significant contribution toward the  Special Agent Recognized by U.S. Attorney's Office On December 7, 2001, the United States Attorney of Los Angeles, California, recognized TIGTA Special Agent William Schafer for his ""distinguished service"" and leadership in an identity theft investigation conducted by the U.S. Attorney's Organized Crime Strike Force. The task force was composed of members from various federal and local law enforcement agencies. Special Agent Schafer was the lead agent on the investigation that led to the successful prosecution of 18 individuals and courtordered restitution and fines in excess of $12 million dollars.

The PARIS system has quickly drawn the interest of other agencies in the Inspector General community. Those TIGTA employees recognized for this award included: Cammie Weaver, Steven McConville, Laura West, J. Robert Donnan, Christine Orcutt, Thomas Salter, Sunghee Heil, Jan Flowers, Samuel Wilcox, Lois Gray, Candace Farr, Wilma Figueroa, and Kathleen Johnson.  The TIGTA employees recognized included: Terry Freedy, Kay Arthur, Emily Ball, Rick Barrett, Ron Hudson, Suzanne Smith Courtney, and Sue Wainwright.  Special Agent Receives Accolades from United States Attorney On December 20, 2001, the United States Attorney and Assistant United States Attorney of Grand Rapids, Michigan recognized TIGTA Special Agent Jon Street for his performance during an investigation and subsequent trial. Special Agent Street's recollection of the specific events throughout the enormous investigation was described by the United States Attorney as ""fantastic,"" and ultimately led to the conviction by a unanimous jury on all 67 counts.

This focus allows taxpayers to more easily assess the relative effectiveness of any program for which their money is spent.  TIGTA's Results  Each agency's budget submission is now being scrutinized for such a link. As the Office of Management and Budget's Comptroller of Federal Financial Management points out, ""... (we are) asking agencies and advocates to supply evidence of program effectiveness instead of assuming effectiveness in the absence of evidence to the contrary.""3 To embrace this new direction, for this six-month reporting period, TIGTA highlights the results of its work related to its strategic goals.4 These are:  I mproving the economy, efficiency, and effectiveness of tax a dministration.  TIGTA's audit work supporting this goal revolves around information security; business systems modernization; returns processing; compliance; earned income credit; Government Performance and Results Act; and, the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act.    Detecting and deterring fraud, waste, abuse or misconduct by employees, as well as persons outside the IRS.  Investigative and audit work supporting this area revolves around internal and external fraud.  3 Testimony of the Honorable Mark W.

By conducting comprehensive, independent performance and financial audits of IRS programs and operations, TIGTA promoted the sound administration of the nation's tax laws through timely reports on program and operational deficiencies. TIGTA audits made recommendations to improve tax administration services and to strengthen controls over IRS programs and operations. Sufficient and capable staffing was not assigned to administer firewalls. In addition, many Internet gateways still did not have intrusion detection installed. Internal networks were also vulnerable. Audits have shown that IRS cannot detect many unauthorized accesses because it still does not routinely review audit trails for its sensitive systems except for one major system and possibly a small number of others. This weakness has persisted over several years and sufficient actions have not been taken to address these issues. IRS has cited a lack of computer capacity, a lack of tools and guidelines, and insufficient staffing as contributing to these problems. OA attributes many of these conditions to: The networking of computers and increased use of the Internet, combined with the growing number of destructive computer viruses, has made the IRS more vulnerable to the risk of data loss or theft. During this reporting period, OA conducted six reviews related to information systems security.  A reluctance by program managers to take responsibility for the security of the systems they operate. The Chief Information Officer's Office of Security has primary accountability, contrary to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) policy, which states that program managers are responsible for the systems they own. Many IRS employees with key security responsibilities do not have the requisite knowledge and skills. IRS employees are not sufficiently aware of security risks and their own responsibilities. During a recent test of security awareness, 71 of 100 employees agreed to change their password to one requested by a TIGTA contractor posing as a ""help desk"" employee. The extremely high percentage of employees willing to compromise their passwords indicates that the IRS has not done enough to  Information Systems Security  The following summarizes the results of those reviews. OA continues to identify significant security weaknesses in IRS' computer systems and networks. Recent audits indicate that IRS remains vulnerable to attacks by outside hackers, and to internal abuses by unethical or disgruntled employees. For example, the agency's Internet gateways are vulnerable. Audits have shown that Internet gateway firewalls and routers were not patched when new security weaknesses were identified and their configurations were weak. Activity logs were not generated and reviewed. 8 TIGTA's FY 2002 Semiannual Report to Congress       March 31, 2002   TIGTA's Results train employees on their security obligations. Even the best security procedures and controls can easily be circumvented if employees are not aware of their responsibilities. OA made recommendations to correct the weaknesses identified and, generally, IRS has taken or planned appropriate corrective actions. A list of information systems security related reports issued during this period are included in Appendix V on page 71.  improvements in some management capabilities, such as configuration and change management, and has also stabilized its funding process so it has funds available for the projects scheduled for 2002. However, IRS continues to struggle with developing and integrating the discipline and repeatable processes needed to effectively and efficiently modernize its technology. OA continues to monitor and report on the areas that, at this stage, pose potential barriers to the success of BSM (see page 10). OA recommended corrective actions to strengthen the controls over the conditions identified. For those reports where a response has been received, IRS management agreed with most of the recommendations and has taken or planned corrective actions to implement the recommendations. All Information Systems and Business Systems reviews are considered statutory based on RRA 98. A listing of all statutory reports, including the reports summarized above, are listed in Appendix V, page 68.  Business Systems Modernization (BSM) During this reporting period, BSM's program success is considered at significant risk due to several factors including: the cost of implementation; IRS' continued struggle to accomplish modernization efforts; and because IRS reforms, such as improved debt collection, are dependent on modernized systems. OA conducted three reviews in this area during this reporting period. Findings show that the IRS has made progress in modernizing its information technology systems, but the overall pace of the modernization has been considerably slower than expected. Examples of the progress made since October 1, 2001 include the recent deployment of an improved Computer User Helpdesk that will eventually consolidate 19 separate help desks, and an Asset Inventory System that should help address a chronic problem of tracking the IRS' computers and other technology assets. The IRS has also developed and updated an Integrated Master Schedule to help sequence new projects and identify dependencies among the various projects. IRS is working on several key projects that are scheduled for release later in 2002. The IRS has made incremental  TIGTA's FY 2002 Semiannual Report to Congress    March 31, 2002  9   TIGTA's Results  Business Modernization Issues To date, virtually all BSM projects controlled by the PRIME contractor have been delayed and have incurred cost increases. As of September 30, 2001, IRS had spent or obligated over $575 million in modernization funds, and it plans to spend or obligate $390 million in 2002. The IRS intends to deliver several projects with direct taxpayer benefits in 2002; however, some of these projects will be deployed later than planned, and others have been scaled back in order to meet delivery dates. The IRS and the PRIME contractor continue to be unreasonably optimistic about their timetable for delivering modernized systems given the immaturity of their management processes. Performance-based contracting processes have not been fully implemented. Although quality review processes had been established to monitor contractor deliverables, most of the task orders OA evaluated did not contain incentives or disincentives to encourage contractor timeliness and quality. While IRS can withhold payment to the contractor until quality products are delivered, this option does not provide any compensation for delays in delivering promised improvements to taxpayers. Additionally, when quality problems were identified, IRS did not always require that the contractor stop and address the problems before progressing to the next project phase. Project monitoring processes have not adequately captured project cost information. Currently, actual costs are measured against estimated costs for the current phase (milestone) of the project rather than the project's full budget. In addition, accurate measurements of internal IRS costs are not included in project monitoring data, and the measurement system has not been validated. Without an accurate accounting of all project costs, it is difficult for IRS and Congress to determine if a project is worth the investment. The IRS and the PRIME contractor have not implemented adequate application testing processes. Neither IRS nor the PRIME contractor could provide evidence that all critical capabilities of the project intended to increase taxpayer telephone and communication service levels to those similar to the private sector were sufficiently tested to ensure they were working as intended. Further, there was a lack of documentation to show how problems or defects identified during these tests were resolved. Without this documentation, the IRS had no evidence to support how or if detected problems or defects were corrected. Project teams have experienced problems in implementing key systems development processes. Project teams are having problems implementing and following key processes, such as requirements gathering, risk management, and investment decision management. OA found similar problems on non-BSM projects. For example, the IRS' project to consolidate its many mid-range systems was not following any structured systems life cycle methodologies, nor has IRS implemented a process to properly fund or monitor the project. These contributed to significant consolidation risks, including inadequate staffing at the project office and computing centers, insufficient training for systems and database administrators, and a delay in implementing an automated disaster recovery process. Lastly, the consolidation of mid-range systems has already encountered significant delays in consolidating applications which, when combined with the unresolved risks and project management issues, increase the likelihood of cost overruns and possible failure of the project to achieve intended goals.  10  TIGTA's FY 2002 Semiannual Report to Congress    March 31, 2002   TIGTA's Results  Returns Processing Tax law complexity is the highest-ranking IRS problem area faced by individual and business taxpayers. It is further compounded as IRS proceeds with its multi-year computer modernization effort. Some affected areas include IRS' internal processing procedures and IRS' communication of tax law changes to taxpayers through publications and notices.  1994, in accordance with the Federal Managers' Financial Integrity Act,5 the IRS reported this issue as a material weakness in its internal control system. As a result, the IRS established a goal to reduce its high number of erroneous restricted interest assessments. While IRS has achieved some success in increasing the automation of interest calculations overall, IRS' actions taken to address the material weakness have not been effective. From CYs 1995 to 1999, the number of business accounts for which interest calculations were restricted increased by more than 4,500. OA identified 35,580 business accounts that became restricted in 1999 (12,792 with restricted interest transactions for zero dollars and 22,788 with restricted interest transactions containing dollar amounts). From a statistical sample of 380 accounts, 44 percent (169 accounts) contained errors in interest amounts computed by IRS employees. These accounts were unnecessarily restricted or contained errors in interest amounts computed by IRS employees, or both (see Figure 1 on page 12). Based on the results of this sample, OA estimated that, over a five-year period, the IRS could overcharge some taxpayers over $247 million in interest, and undercharge other taxpayers more than $145 million. OA recommended that IRS management limit the calculation of restricted interest to centralized staffs within IRS functions and locations of IRS; establish a national quality review process that includes all restricted interest cases; ensure employees receive appropriate training before working on restricted interest cases; authorize a standard interest computation tool; and explore all available options to provide the technology and programming necessary to allow more computerized interest calculations to be performed by computer. 5  Audit highlights in these areas follow.  The Internal Revenue Service Has Made Some Progress, But Significant Improvements Are Still Needed to Reduce Errors in Manual Interest Calculations (Reference No. 2002-30-042) IRS employees must manually calculate interest on some accounts because the computer system is not programmed to apply numerous changes in laws, regulations and policies. This is referred to as ""restricted interest"" because the computer system is ""restricted"" from making the interest computations. Over the years these changes, as well as the complexity of the calculations and supporting analyses, have increased the number of accounts requiring restricted interest calculations. Between Calendar Years (CY) 1995 and 1999, over 198,000 business tax accounts became restricted, totaling over $7 billion in restricted interest assessments or abatements. Restricted interest calculations are very complex, time-consuming, and highly subject to human error. Because it is well known that the IRS makes a significant number of errors in these calculations, accounting firms, law firms and others have actively marketed consulting services to assist taxpayers in recalculating interest and filing claims for refunds of amounts incorrectly assessed. In  31 U.S.C.  1105, 1113, and 3512 (1994 & Supp. IV 1998).  TIGTA's FY 2002 Semiannual Report to Congress    March 31, 2002  11   TIGTA's Results actions on frozen accounts. Instead of implementing the recommendations as agreed, IRS increased the threshold for automatically freezing refunds from $1 million to $10 million. However, increasing the threshold did not correct the problem, and IRS continues to pay millions of dollars in additional interest to taxpayers with frozen accounts. This follow-up review of 412 frozen accounts identified 209 (51 percent) improperly frozen accounts that resulted in IRS eventually issuing approximately $185.8 million in refunds and paying taxpayers an additional $15.4 million in interest. Table 1 shows a comparison between the accounts identified as frozen in the previous review and the frozen accounts identified in this review.  IRS management agreed with the report findings and proposed a number of creative actions to address the problems identified in the report.  The Internal Revenue Service Continues to Owe Millions of Dollars in Interest to Taxpayers with Frozen Refunds (Reference No. 2002-30-062) OA first reported in September 19996 that IRS was experiencing problems in releasing large dollar refunds because of the automatic freeze placed on accounts containing a credit balance of $1 million or more. Findings included: (1) controls did not ensure that frozen refunds were timely released, and (2) additional interest of approximately $17.5 million was paid to taxpayers with frozen accounts. OA recommended that IRS change its computer system to systemically release refunds that fall below the Million Dollar Freeze threshold and establish alerts for employees to take appropriate resolution 6 Controls Should Be Strengthened Over Business Taxpayer Accounts with Frozen Million Dollar Refunds (Reference No. 199940057).  Source: Extracts from IRS' Masterfile on April 4, 1998 and March 31, 2001  Two reasons why IRS' corrective actions were not effective were:  Refunds can drop below the Million Dollar Freeze threshold, which is now set at $10 million. IRS employees are not always aware of the need to take appropriate resolution actions on accounts frozen for extended periods.    12 TIGTA's FY 20022002 Semiannual Report to Congress  March20022002 TIGTA's FY Semiannual Report to Congress  March 31, 31,   TIGTA's Results As reported in 1999, the Million Dollar Freeze indicator was not displayed on key computer screens used by employees to resolve problem accounts. In addition, the system did not generate periodic alert notices to employees on frozen accounts. OA recommended that IRS management should initiate action to modify IRS' computer system to systemically release refunds that fall below the Million Dollar Freeze threshold and establish alert mechanisms for employees to take appropriate resolution actions to correct the problem with frozen refunds. Taking these actions will provide the government an opportunity over a five-year period to put an estimated $12.9 million (an average of $2.5 million a year) that it paid in interest to better use. IRS management agreed with the findings in the report and proposed a number of actions to correct the problems identified. First, IRS did not accurately calculate the advance refund amount for some taxpayers. OA alerted IRS to this condition on July 3, 2001. The IRS timely addressed this problem, which included changing computer programming. For all returns processed as of July 5, the change prevented 535,000 taxpayers from receiving advance refunds totaling at least $117.6 million more than the amount allowed by law. However, IRS' initial mail-out included advance refund notices that reflected amounts greater than the taxpayers would receive. Second, 5.3 million taxpayers who timely filed their tax returns would have delays from one to nine weeks in receiving their advance refund notices. These delays were due to the way IRS processed timely filed returns received with payments that fully paid the amount owed and the way programming was developed to generate advance refund notices. To address IRS' problem in calculating the advance refund, OA recommended that IRS management correct the computer programming problem, issue corrected advance refund notices to affected taxpayers, issue a press release informing the public that advance refund notices with incorrect amounts were sent out, and update its Customer Service procedures. To address the 5.3 million delayed advance refund notices, OA recommended that IRS management inform its employees and issue a press release to advise taxpayers about the advance refund notice delays. OA also recommended that IRS management change the programming used to generate the advance refund notices to prevent additional delays. IRS management agreed and took immediate corrective action on all the recommendations, except to change the programming used to generate the advance refund notices. IRS management stated that to help minimize the risk of any errors occurring, the programming would not be changed. OA understood the   While Most Taxpayers Received Accurate and Timely Notification of Their Advance Refunds, Millions Did Not (Reference No. 2002-40-016) This report presents the results of the initial phase of OA's reviews of the advance refund provisions of H.R. 1836, also known as the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001.7 This initial phase was to determine whether IRS would timely and accurately notify taxpayers about their advance refunds. The IRS developed an extensive plan, implemented new computer programming, and hired a private vendor to print and mail more than 120 million advance refund notices. While this significant accomplishment was performed in a very limited amount of time, OA identified two problems that affected the calculation of the advance refunds and the timely issuance of the advance refund notices. 7  Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, Pub.

However, IRS management stated that they would work closely with the private sector as they develop tax preparation software by providing current and accurate information.  Improvements Need to Be Made to Publications and Instructions to Assist Taxpayers in Successfully Signing Their Tax Returns Electronically (Reference No. 2002-40-046) In an effort to move towards paperless tax return filing, IRS successfully implemented the Self-Select Personal Identification Number (PIN) Program in Filing Season 2001. This program enabled nine million of the 35 million taxpayers who filed an electronic tax return to sign their tax returns electronically. However, for Filing Season 2001, one-quarter of the tax returns submitted with electronic signatures were rejected because the authentication information the IRS required taxpayers to provide (e.g., name and date of birth) did not match IRS' records for the taxpayer. The publications and instructions for taxpayers' to use when signing tax returns electronically contained inaccurate, inconsistent and unclear information. OA recommended that IRS management: (1) create a quality review process for the Self-Select PIN Program to ensure guidance is appropriate to enable electronic signatures, (2) develop procedures to ensure tax guidance in electronic tax return preparation software packages is accurate and clear, and (3) follow the oversight review and approval process for preparing and revising electronic filing guidance. IRS management agreed with the first and third recommendations and has already implemented corrective actions. A process for the development and approval of public information already existed, but was not previously published as an employee guide. The IRS will follow this established process in the future. While IRS management did not  Compliance The IRS' goal of providing world-class service to taxpayers hinges on the theory that, if the IRS provides taxpayers with the right mix of education, support, up-front problem solving, and targeted enforcement, the overall rate of voluntary taxpayer compliance with the tax laws will increase. The challenge to IRS management is to establish a tax compliance program that identifies those citizens who do not meet their tax obligations, either by not paying the correct amount of tax or by not filing proper tax returns.  Audit highlights in this area follow.  Interim Actions Can Be Taken to Determine Partnerships' Compliance in Withholding Taxes on Foreign Partners (Reference No. 2002-30-076) I.R.C.  1446 requires partnerships to withhold taxes on effectively connected income allocable8 to foreign partners. ""Effectively connected income"" is taxable income connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the U.S. The number of U.S. partnerships with foreign partners increased from about 22,000 in 1995 to over 30,000 in 1999, an increase of more than 36 percent.  8  The provision applies to allocable income, regardless of whether distributions were made during the partnership's tax year.  14 TIGTA's FY 2002 Semiannual Report to Congress  March 31,31, 2002 TIGTA's FY 2002 Semiannual Report to Congress  March 2002 14   TIGTA's Results In FY 2001, OA issued a report that discussed the increasing population of partnerships with foreign partners and concluded that IRS should enhance programs to ensure partnerships' compliance with the withholding provisions.9 The report recommended taking interim measures to identify potentially noncompliant partnerships until permanent programming changes could automate the process. In this follow-up report, OA determined that sufficient information existed in the IRS' computer systems to take interim action and begin a process to determine partnerships' compliance with withholding requirements. Also, IRS could better use information on income and foreign partners from partnerships' tax returns and the withholding information documents that partnerships separately file to more effectively identify potential non-compliance. OA recommended that IRS contact a sample of taxpayers to determine whether there are compliance issues with the withholding provisions, and use our methodology as an interim measure until an automated identification process is developed. IRS management's response was not received prior to the issuance of the audit report. facing an economic hardship situation. As a result, Congress included a provision in RRA 98 that added I.R.C.  6343(e) (1999) requiring the IRS to release a wage levy as soon as practicable upon agreement with the taxpayer that the tax is not collectible. In addition, I.R.C.  6343(a) requires IRS to release all levies when it determines that the levy is creating an economic hardship due to the financial condition of the taxpayer. OA determined that IRS is not always releasing levies as required. OA identified cases in which IRS received levy payments after the case was closed as a Currently Not Collectible (CNC) (hardship) case. In addition, OA identified cases that should not have been a closed CNC (hardship) because IRS either did not determine that an economic hardship existed or appeared to disregard the taxpayer's ability to make payments. Finally, OA identified numerous cases that had non-levy payments erroneously recorded as levy payments on IRS' management information system. OA recommended that the IRS improve controls to ensure IRS personnel recognize levies at the time a case is closed CNC (hardship) and release levies as required. IRS should strengthen procedures to ensure cases are closed as CNC (hardship) only when appropriate. Also, the IRS should clarify guidelines to ensure payments received by IRS personnel are accurately recorded on IRS' computer system. IRS management agreed with the recommendations and is taking corrective actions.  The Internal Revenue Service's Levy Process Can Be Improved to Ensure Compliance With the Internal Revenue Code (Reference No. 2002-10-078) Congress believed that taxpayers should not have collection activity taken against them once the IRS has determined that any tax owed is uncollectible because a taxpayer is 9  Earned Income Credit Both the President and Congress have expressed concern with the large number of erroneous payments made annually by federal agencies.

TIGTA's FY 2002 Semiannual Report to Congress    March 31, 2002  15   TIGTA's Results payments and potential fraud, particularly vulnerable is the IRS' administration of the Earned Income Credit (EIC) Program.  Audit highlights in this area follow.  Better Controls Are Needed to Ensure Appropriated Funds Are Used to Improve the Application of the Earned Income Credit (Reference No. 2002-40-020) Congress has been concerned with IRS' ability to administer the EIC. In 1997, Congress enacted legislation10 that authorized the IRS to spend $716 million over a five-year period for the improved application of the EIC. The five-year period began in FY 1998. Each year, IRS spends over $100 million appropriated by Congress. The IRS established the EIC Program Office to administer the EIC appropriation and oversee the EIC-related activities of IRS functions involved in efforts to ensure the efficient application of the law; to increase participation of eligible taxpayers; and to reduce fraud, waste, and abuse. Each year, the Program Office develops a plan that outlines how the EIC funds will be used. However, IRS did not have an effective process in place to ensure that the expenditure of the EIC appropriation was used only for EIC issues, programs, and projects. OA's analysis of the total labor expenses for two IRS functions and a judgmental sample of the IRS' equipment purchases for FY 2000 and the first quarter of FY 2001 identified approximately $28 million in questionable expenses. The IRS is scheduled to receive $146 million in EIC funds in FY 2002, the last year of the current five-year appropriation. Without effective controls in place to assure Congress that the funds are being spent appropriately, IRS is at risk that future appropriation funding beyond FY 2002 could be in jeopardy. OA recommended that IRS management establish procedures to ensure that funds appropriated by Congress for the improved application of the EIC are used for that purpose. 10  Earned Income Credit Was Paid to Taxpayers Who Did Not Provide Required Documentation During Audits (Reference No. 2002-40-004) EIC is a refundable tax credit created in 1975 to offset the impact of Social Security taxes on low-income families and encourage them to seek employment rather than welfare. In CY 2000, a total of 19,226,015 taxpayers received the EIC. While the IRS does not question most EIC claims, in FY 2000 it completed 325,654 audits and recommended over $411 million in additional taxes where EIC claims were in question. Audits of EIC claims represented 74 percent of the total audits completed by IRS' Remote Examination function during the fiscal year. OA identified that taxpayers did not receive consistent treatment when IRS audited their EIC claims. Specifically, some taxpayers were allowed the EIC without having to provide required documentation during the audit to justify their EIC claim. This occurrence was the result of inadequate managerial case reviews designed to ensure consistency and accuracy of audits. OA recommended that IRS management should develop expectations that case reviews will be completed and establish a process to ensure these reviews are done timely. IRS management agreed with the recommendation and took appropriate corrective action.  The Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Pub. L. No. 105-33, 111 Stat. 251. 16 TIGTA's FY FY 2002 Semiannual Report Congress  March 31,31, 2002 TIGTA's 2002 Semiannual Report to to Congress  March 2002 16   TIGTA's Results While IRS management took some corrective action, OA believes the corrective action only strengthened controls for the functions' requests and authorizations to expend EIC appropriation funds. The corrective action does not include provisions for conducting periodic reviews of actual functional EIC expenditures to ensure they are EIC related and, therefore, should be paid from EIC appropriation funds. OA believes these reviews are critical to ensuring EIC funds are used for EIC purposes. IRS management disagreed with OA's reported outcome that $28 million of EIC appropriation funds were used for questionable labor and equipment purchases. However, they did agree with OA's statements that not all the expenses OA reviewed were directly related to the EIC. Therefore, until IRS has sufficient information to determine how much of these items are directly related to EIC, OA believes its outcome measure is still valid.  There was inconsistency in the IRS' methodology applications between studies. Emphasis on EIC taxpayers with business income during the TY 1999 EIC compliance study increased the time spent on the audits, but did not produce any apparent benefits. Poor planning caused taxpayers to be needlessly audited as part of the TY 1998 EIC compliance study.      IRS management disagreed with OA's recommendations that there were significant weaknesses in its methodology for measuring EIC compliance and questioned the relevance of the audit recommendations. IRS management stated that improvements have been made to the EIC program due to the results of its current measurement methodology and compliance efforts. In OA's opinion, IRS' response did not adequately support the disagreement with OA's assessment of the EIC compliance measurement methodology. OA recognizes that several initiatives have been made over the past few years to improve the administration of the EIC program. However, the majority of the improvements listed in the IRS response were not the result of its current efforts at measuring EIC compliance. At the time of OA's review, IRS had issued only one report as a result of its last three EIC compliance studies. That report, Compliance Estimates for Earned Income Tax Credit Claimed on 1997 Returns, was issued more than two years after most of the audits in the study were completed. Since OA's review was completed, a second report, Compliance Estimates for Earned Income Tax Credit Claimed on 1999 Rates, was issued in February 2002.  There Are Significant Weaknesses in the Internal Revenue Service's Efforts to Measure Earned Income Credit Compliance (Reference No. 2002-40-021) IRS originally planned to measure EIC compliance levels annually. The audit results were to provide a baseline for comparing measurements from subsequent years. The basis for the compliance levels would come from annual audits of tax returns claiming the EIC. While IRS made some improvements in its methodology to measure EIC compliance from Tax Year (TY) 1997 to TY 1999, significant weaknesses still exist. Specifically:  Some audits in the TYs 1997 and 1999 EIC compliance studies lacked the necessary information to support the IRS' results.  TIGTA's FY 2002 Semiannual Report to Congress    March 31, 2002  17   TIGTA's Results  Government Performance and Results Act Congress passed the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA)11 to increase agency accountability and improve the quality and delivery of government services. GPRA holds federal agencies accountable for program results by emphasizing goal setting, customer satisfaction, and results measurement. TIGTA performed the following reviews as part of its strategy to assess IRS' compliance with GPRA.  judgment with respect to tax enforcement results. It also forbids establishing goals for individual employees based on records of tax enforcement results. As such, CI's business results measures are not outcome oriented and do not accurately show the results of CI's activities. CI also did not have a measure for its refund fraud program, a major management challenge for IRS. CI measured its outreach efforts (activities to educate the public about CI and the consequences of violating the tax laws) by the staff years spent on those efforts. It's case quality review measure includes only discontinued and non-prosecution cases with no grand jury involvement (about 27 percent of the total CI workload), and excludes the cases with the most impact on taxpayers. The CI customer satisfaction survey was sent only to U.S. Attorneys and did not include the Department of Justice Tax Division Attorneys. OA was not allowed access to the Criminal Investigation Management Information System (CIMIS),13 the source of most of CI's performance measures. While not able to validate the CIMIS data, OA determined that system audit trails were not complete and were not effectively used, creating a potential security risk. OA recommended that measures be developed, such as the number of individuals indicted, convicted, and sentenced; CI's effect on voluntary compliance and the tax gap; the results of major programs like refund fraud; and the results of a quality review process that includes all cases. Also, CI should consider a survey to assess CI's outreach efforts; ensure that audit trail requirements are met and documented; and fully disclose CIMIS data limitations. IRS management disagreed with five of the nine recommendations in the report. IRS 13  GPRA: Criminal Investigation Can Improve Its Performance Measures to Better Account for Its Results (Reference No: 2002-10-009) The IRS' Criminal Investigation (CI) has a budget of $395 million and a staff of approximately 3,700 special agents and support personnel. CI's mission is to serve the American public by investigating potential criminal violations of the Internal Revenue Code and related financial crimes in a manner intended to foster confidence in the tax system and compliance with the tax law. OA identified that CI's performance measures do not address its mission and that only the number of cases initiated was included in IRS' GPRA measures. CI developed outcome-neutral measures12 to report as its business results because of its concern about 26 CFR Part 801. This regulation prohibits using quantity measures to impose or suggest production goals for any organizational unit whose employees exercise 11  Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA), Pub.

Conduct the required managerial reviews of the work performed by quality reviewers and perform the on-line, joint-monitoring aspect of these reviews remotely so that it can be done in an independent setting. Develop an automated call recording system to measure the accuracy of tax law assistance that ensures that all tax law calls are included in the population, the selection of calls is truly random, and the sampling plan is implemented as designed.    The Internal Revenue Service Could Improve Its Process to More Reliably Measure the Accuracy of Its Toll-Free Tax Law Assistance (Reference No. 2002-40-051) Design and implementation weaknesses in the current sampling strategy used to measure the accuracy of IRS toll-free tax law assistance had the potential to bias the accuracy of the results. The 73.78 percent accuracy rate that IRS reported for the 2001 Filing Season may not be accurate. A different rate may influence management decisions concerning assignment and training of customer service personnel, which could affect IRS budget decisions. OA noted that managerial reviews were not conducted as required at critical periods during the 2001 Filing Season, and they were not conducted in an independent setting. OA recommended that IRS management:  Design the sampling plan to include all tax law calls in the population and randomly select from all hours of all call site operations. Ensure the sampling plan is implemented as designed, the latitude of reviewers to select and disconnect calls (in terms of both application and call site) is limited, and the required number of calls is reviewed at critical times during the filing season.  IRS management agreed with the audit recommendations and has initiated corrective actions where possible. IRS management could not develop corrective actions for managerial reviews of quality reviewers due to telephone system limitations. IRS management strengthened controls to ensure that each Centralized Quality Review Site (CQRS) manager meets minimum monitoring standards. In addition, while IRS management agreed that an automated call recording system is the best way to achieve random call selection, they pointed out that the IRS is not technologically able to do so at this time. The IRS is aggressively pursuing automated call recording. Lastly, the telephone equipment used by the CQRS staff cannot track disconnected calls.

No instances were found where the IRS did not meet established intermediate target dates contained in the remediation plan. OA did identify where intermediate target dates were extended with reasonable explanations. Also, the IRS received required Office of Management and Budget concurrence for remedial actions with intermediate target dates that extend longer than three years; incorporated all GAO financial statement audit recommendations pertinent to the FFMIA guidelines into its remediation plan; and, has taken actions to reconcile inconsistencies between GAO and IRS reported status of remedial actions. The IRS has also taken positive steps to implement corrective actions addressing prior OA recommendations.  FFMIA also requires that remediation plans be developed for any entity that is unable to report substantial compliance with these requirements. OA's evaluation of IRS' remediation plans follows.  Management Advisory Report: The Internal Revenue Service's Federal Financial Management Improvement Act Remediation Plan Complies With Reporting Requirements (Reference No. 2002-10-069) OA conducted a review of IRS' FFMIA remediation plan to identify any instances and reasons for missed intermediate target dates, and to evaluate whether the IRS is meeting its responsibilities in fulfilling the intent of the FFMIA. This review was performed to meet OA's requirement under the FFMIA that each IG shall report to Congress instances and reasons when an agency has not met the intermediate target dates established in the remediation plan.  20 TIGTA's FY 2002 Semiannual Report to Congress  March 31,31, 2002 TIGTA's FY 2002 Semiannual Report to Congress  March 2002 20   TIGTA Strategic Goal: Detecting and Deterring Fraud in IRS Programs and Operations TIGTA is responsible for conducting investigations and audits to help prevent, detect, and deter fraud and abuse in IRS programs and operations. This includes investigating allegations of misconduct by IRS employees; protecting IRS against external attempts to corrupt or threaten its employees; and performing reviews of activities related to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement of IRS and related entities, such as the IRS Oversight Board and IRS Chief Counsel.

The employee subsequently resigned from IRS.  Former IRS Employee Indicted for Converting Property A grand jury indicted a former IRS employee on seven counts of converting taxpayers' property. According to the indictment, the former employee embezzled $32,583 by electronic transfer of funds from taxpayers' original tax returns to accounts belonging to the employee.  Internal Fraud OI conducts investigations that protect taxpayers from IRS employees who commit criminal violations and administrative misconduct. These inquiries may involve allegations of unauthorized access to and disclosure of confidential taxpayer information, bribery, financial fraud, false statements and abuse of taxpayer rights.  IRS Employee Arrested by TIGTA Special Agents for Solicitation of $200,000 Bribe In December 2001, an attorney representing a corporation reported that during a routine IRS examination, an IRS employee solicited a cash bribe of $200,000 from the company's attorney to reduce the company's tax liability. The attorney subsequently agreed to cooperate with TIGTA in its investigation. In January 2002, with assistance from TIGTA's TSS, an electronically recorded meeting took place between the attorney and the employee. After receiving the $200,000 bribe, the IRS employee provided the attorney with a fraudulent Revenue Agent Report. TIGTA special agents arrested the IRS employee before the employee left the meeting.  Investigative highlights in this area follow.  A Twenty-Two Year IRS Veteran Charged with Unauthorized Access (UNAX) to Taxpayer Accounts As a result of a UNAX violation, an IRS employee pled guilty to one count of computer fraud and was sentenced to two years probation, fined $5,000 and ordered to perform 100 hours of community service.

It is comprised of three components with distinct and complementary missions. A collaborative effort of special agents, forensic data analysts, and computer programmers assigned to SED Cincinnati Operations execute proactive programs to detect internal fraud in IRS operations and unauthorized access to IRS computer systems. Computer matching is used nationwide in proactive initiatives. These initiatives are included in Computer Matching Act16 agreements approved by Treasury's Data Integrity Board and published in the Federal Register. During this period, there were six ongoing initiatives, and 19 criminal referrals to field special agents for further investigation. Since October 2001, CIS special agents have conducted forensic examinations in 56 TIGTA investigations, reviewing 141 devices containing 872 gigabytes of storage space.  System Intrusion Network Response Attack Team (SINART) is another SED unit in which assigned agents and computer programmers investigate attempts to interfere with the security, integrity, and reliability of IRS computers by external sources. Since October 2001, SINART special agents and computer specialists have conducted nine computer security reviews and 17 criminal investigations. Additionally, SINART special agents and computer specialists have:  Participated with the IRS Computer Security Incident Response Team in a penetration test designed to evaluate the security controls in place within the www.irs.gov environment. The tests were conducted to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data over the networks, and to gauge the new IRS website's ability to withstand Internet-based attacks. The penetration test team used common foot printing and attacks utilized by hackers, including remote procedure calls, telnet, and other exploitations. The penetration test results were reported to the IRS Office of Cyber Security.  Established proactive initiatives to evaluate the IRS network for specific vulnerabilities, including an initiative designed to identify unauthorized wireless network access technology on IRS and TIGTA networks. Wireless scans of several IRS facilities have been completed. Another initiative was launched to identify unauthorized connections to IRS computers through unregistered modems. A total of 33 modems were identified. Each modem was investigated to determine the extent of vulnerability. The results of SINART proactive initiatives are provided to the IRS Office of Cyber Security.   Computer Investigative Specialist Program (CIS) is a unit of SED that provides support and advice concerning the search and seizure of computers and computer-related media; the processing of seized electronic evidence; and assistance with Internet-related crimes and investigations. Agents assigned to the Computer Investigative Support Program provide forensic processing of seized computers and other electronic media in support of TIGTA investigations.  16  Pub. L.

Examination of the employee's computer hard drive revealed 30,664 graphics files. Most of the graphics were pornographic or sexually explicit in nature and numerous images were classified as child pornography. The employee pled guilty to knowingly possessing visual depictions of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct. In October 2001, the employee signed a pretrial diversion agreement and prosecution was deferred 18 months.  participation in a mental health treatment program. The former employee was ordered to pay restitution of $11,648.  IRS Employee Pled Guilty to Embezzling Tax Payments In May 2001, an IRS employee was discovered to have received a $2,800 cash tax payment from a taxpayer and then gambled and lost that money at a local casino. During a subsequent interview by TIGTA special agents, the employee admitted to collecting cash from taxpayers and using the money to gamble. IRS records revealed that during the six-month period prior to the $2,800 embezzlement, the IRS employee delayed processing an additional $9,040 in cash payments. After pleading guilty to one count of embezzlement in January 2002, the employee was sentenced to three years probation, and ordered to pay $2,800 in restitution to IRS. Administrative action is currently pending.  Former IRS Employee Pled Guilty to Misuse of IRS Computer System and Improper Relationships with Taxpayers In November 2001, a former IRS revenue officer was charged with allegedly accepting gifts from different taxpayers, including approximately $1,000 in cash, a television set, free health club privileges, free auto repairs, and free garage door repairs, for a payment plan of taxes and abatement of penalties owed by the taxpayers totalling $158,741. The former employee also was charged with allegedly accessing an IRS computer without authorization and thereby obtaining information from the IRS and with allegedly failing to deposit money of the United States under his control.

These taxpayers received the Disabled Access Credit (a business incentive credit intended to help eligible small businesses comply with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act)17 even though their tax returns indicated no business reasons for taking the credits. Although the number of taxpayers involved was limited, the issue was significant for two reasons:  Many of the taxpayers involved were elderly Americans who were possible victims of promoters recommending unwise investments in pay telephones and automated teller machines and promising bogus tax credits. Based on the media coverage the issue had received,18 OA believed the problem was most likely increasing.  computer analysis of TY 2000 tax returns. From TY 1999 to TY 2000, the number of tax returns for which the Disabled Access Credit was inappropriately allowed increased 28 percent. The amount of credit allowed on these returns totaled over $1.25 million. OA also determined that 64 taxpayers inappropriately received the credit for both TYs 1999 and 2000. As of January 2002, IRS was on schedule to add information to its Small Business/Self Employed Community Website to alert taxpayers about investments in pay telephones and automated teller machines fraudulently promoted as qualifying for the Disabled Access Credit. IRS management also agreed to work on another enhancement to the IRS' website that would provide links from other sections of IRS' website to the text in the Small Business/Self-Employed section. As no formal recommendations were made in this report, an IRS management response was not required.    One of the recommendations in a prior report was for IRS to analyze the results of a computer analysis completed by OA for TY 1999 returns, perform a similar analysis of TY 2000 returns, and develop a compliance approach to address this issue. To facilitate IRS' corrective action, OA agreed to perform a 16  Computer Programming Can be Used to More Effectively Stop Refunds on Illegal Claims for Reparations Credits (Reference No. 2002-30-071) Since the early 1990s, thousands of taxpayers have filed specious tax claims with the IRS for reparations credits payable to descendants of slaves. The Internal Revenue Code does not provide for, or allow, such a credit. As a result, the IRS tries to identify tax returns containing these claims, deny the claims, and stop any resulting refunds before they are issued to taxpayers. IRS employees manually identify the vast majority of these claims before any data is input to the IRS' computer systems. For example, during CY 2001, IRS employees manually identified close to 80,000 such claims.

Early in CY 2001, IRS found that this was occurring more often. Many taxpayers claiming reparations credits had received refunds, some of which exceeded $80,000 for married taxpayers claiming reparations credits for each spouse. As a result, management from IRS' Frivolous Return Program asked OA to help improve IRS' controls by developing a computer program to identify tax returns being processed that contained claims for reparations credits. Overall, the controls designed by IRS to identify and stop claims for reparations credits from refunding, once the claims were entered into IRS computers, could be significantly improved by using an OA-developed computer program. OA estimated that by using this program, IRS employees could identify 91 percent more of the returns that made it through the initial manual screening than they could using the existing processes, and stop an additional $90.7 million in refunds from claims for reparations credits over a five-year period. Further, OA identified current and former IRS employees who claimed reparations credits on their own tax returns. Pertinent information regarding these individuals was referred to OI. OA recommended that IRS management permanently implement and maintain the computer program developed by OA and ensure that employees assigned to the Frivolous Return Program are given access to and training regarding a computer command code. This command code is under development for the CI function. It will allow those employees to stop refunds from being issued during accelerated returns processing cycles.19 IRS management agreed with the recommendations and initiated appropriate corrective actions.  Significant Efforts Have Been Made to Combat Abusive Trusts, But Additional Improvements Are Needed to Ensure Fairness and Compliance Objectives Are Achieved (Reference No: 2002-30-050) The IRS anticipates that almost 3.7 million U.S. Income Tax Returns for Estates and Trusts (Form 1041) will be filed for CY 2001. Trust returns are now the third most frequently filed income tax return, behind individual and corporate returns. An abusive trust arrangement generally involves a promoter who claims that owners are allowed to both retain full benefit of business or personal assets, and reduce or eliminate taxes. Since 1997, IRS has made significant efforts to combat abusive trusts. Abusive trust issues are being addressed through a nationally coordinated strategy that includes the IRS CI function, the Small Business/Self-Employed Division's Compliance function, the Office of Chief Counsel, and the Department of Justice. The IRS has emphasized the identification of abusive trust promotions and the use of civil and criminal enforcement actions. Further, IRS has increased its examinations of Forms 1041 from 567 in FY 1997 to over 4,400 returns in FY 2000. These additional 19  The IRS must process individual refund returns within 45 days of the return due date to avoid paying interest. To minimize interest payments, the IRS accelerates its processing routines during the weeks before the 45-day deadline to ensure returns are timely processed. The IRS saved almost $9 million in interest by accelerating processing in certain weeks of its 2001 Filing Season.  TIGTA's FY 2002 Semiannual Report to Congress    March 31, 2002  25   TIGTA's Results examinations yielded a substantial increase in proposed tax assessments, averaging $104,000 per return. Table 2 shows that IRS tax assessments involving abusive business trusts and related returns increased from $8 million in FY 1997 to over $467 million in FY 2000. However, additional improvements are needed in the program to ensure that IRS achieves its goal of combating abusive trusts. OA's review of abusive trust-related returns examined and closed during the first quarter of FY 2001 showed that IRS may not be consistently asserting the accuracy-related penalty. The IRS assessed the accuracy-related or fraud penalty in only 26 percent of a sample of these cases. If the IRS assessed the accuracy-related penalty based on the additional tax assessments of $467 million, penalty assessments could range from an estimated $69.1 to $138.2 million over a two-year period. There is a risk that not penalizing taxpayers involved with abusive trusts could result in further noncompliance, because these taxpayers may simply move to other abusive arrangements. One of the methods that the IRS' National Trust Initiative uses to accomplish its primary goal of combating abusive trusts is pre-filing and outreach activities. However, IRS does not have performance measures to determine if its pre-filing and outreach activities are increasing taxpayer compliance. Finally, IRS does not have a system to capture results of Form 1041 examinations that would identify emerging abusive trust issues. OA recommended that IRS management develop new penalty tables to monitor the application of the accuracy-related penalty and develop a system to capture Form 1041 examination data. IRS management agreed to the recommendations and is proposing a number of actions to address the problems identified in the report.

This program was designed to accelerate the deposit of tax payments by having taxpayers send their payments to commercial banks rather than to the IRS. With this acceleration came significant risks, as evidenced in FY 2001 when control weaknesses contributed to the loss of taxpayer payments and taxpayer information at a lockbox bank in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Approximately 71,000 taxpayer remittances valued in excess of $1.2 billion were lost or destroyed. The Los Angeles lockbox bank processes tax payments for the Fresno Submission Processing Center. The bank received payments for U.S. Individual Income Tax Returns (Form 1040 series), employment tax returns (Form 940 series), and other miscellaneous tax payments. The Los Angeles lockbox bank handled approximately 10 percent of the more than 84 million payments, totaling $311 billion, processed for the entire lockbox network in FY 2000. OA reported that the Los Angeles lockbox bank was in compliance with established Lockbox Processing Guidelines concerning physical and data security for CY 2001. However, additional controls are needed in the Guidelines to reduce the risks associated with processing large volumes of taxpayer remittances that could lead to financial losses and loss of taxpayer confidence.  OA recommended that the Lockbox Processing Guidelines be strengthened or clarified in the following areas: adding controls for mail delivered by courier from the post office to the lockbox bank; establishing inventory controls earlier over tax payments received; enhancing video surveillance systems; testing disaster recovery plans; providing for biological safeguards; requiring couriers, bank associates, and temporary employees to undergo background clearance checks prior to handling IRS material; and further specifying guard service and courier service requirements. IRS management agreed with most of the findings and recommendations in the report, and plans numerous corrective actions.  Pricing Discrepancies on the Long Term Maintenance Computing Center Contract (TIR-NO-96-D-0021) (Reference No. 2002-10-008) OI received an allegation that a contractor had mischarged IRS for monthly software maintenance fees. From this allegation, OA reviewed the subcontractor's records and determined that IRS was mischarged on nine Contract Line Items (CLIN) on the Long Term Maintenance Computing Center contract. The subcontractor records indicated that these services were provided to the contractor at a significantly lower cost than the IRS was billed. The contractor was charging IRS yearly costs on a monthly basis. This resulted in IRS unnecessarily paying the contractor $433,000 over the life of the contract. Additionally, IRS paid for a higher-priced software upgrade than that provided by the contractor. The IRS ordered a specific CLIN upgrade, costing approximately $199,500. However, the contractor  TIGTA's FY 2002 Semiannual Report to Congress    March 31, 2002  27   TIGTA's Results replaced the item with another, lower-priced product. The cost to the contractor for this upgrade was $46,908. Therefore, the estimated cost to the government should have been approximately $52,500, allowing the contractor a modest increase for general and administrative expenses and profit. OA found no indication that the contractor notified IRS of the product differences. As a result, IRS unnecessarily spent approximately $147,000 for this software upgrade. The mischarges on the software maintenance and the upgrade have been discussed with an Assistant United States Attorney (AUSA), who considered the prosecutable merits of the case. After consulting with the contractor's legal counsel, the AUSA declined civil and criminal prosecution. OA recommended IRS take the necessary administrative actions to recover the $580,000 associated with the pricing discrepancies. IRS management responded that avenues to recoup the costs are limited. The contract is completed and the contractor holds no other contract with the IRS. Moreover, the contractor has filed for Chapter 11 in the United States Bankruptcy Court. As an alternative, IRS issued a letter to the contractor requesting an equitable adjustment in the amount of $580,000. However, given the contractor's bankruptcy status, recouping any costs from the contractor is unlikely.  Individual Jailed for Sabotaging IRS Computers In October 2001, a person was sentenced to 15-months incarceration and three years probation for intentionally causing damage to a protected computer. The individual, an employee of an IRS contractor, was also ordered to pay restitution to IRS in the amount of $108,804. By inserting active destructive computer codes on three separate IRS computer servers, this person manipulated the code so that, once executed, it would destroy all data on the three servers. After these activities were discovered, the contracting firm and IRS shut down the servers in order to remove the destructive code and reestablish the security and integrity of the system.  Health Insurance Employee Defrauds Government through Bogus Refund Scam A former health insurance company employee was charged with one count of making false claims against the U.S. In October 2001, this individual, using the names, addresses, and Social Security numbers of unsuspecting policyholders from various states across the country, created false tax returns in a scheme to defraud IRS of $278,000 in refunds, of which the individual succeeded in obtaining almost $40,000. Bank security contacted TIGTA to report a suspicious transaction when numerous tax refunds were electronically deposited into the same account but the names on the refunds did not match the bank account holder's name. TIGTA identified numerous bank accounts associated with this scheme and advised bank security to freeze the accounts to prevent the individual from receiving the money. No evidence was found linking this individual or the friend to any IRS employee.  28 TIGTA's FY 2002 Semiannual Report to Congress  March 31, 31, 2002 TIGTA's FY 2002 Semiannual Report to Congress  March 2002 28   TIGTA's Results  Attorney Sentenced for Submitting Bogus Release of Levy Form In January 2002, an attorney pled guilty to corrupt interference with tax administration. According to the indictment, IRS had issued a Notice of Levy to an employer, instructing the employer to pay a certain portion of an individual's salary each week to IRS in order to collect funds owed to IRS. The indictment alleged that the attorney submitted a bogus release of levy form to the employer, causing the employer to erroneously release IRS' levy on the wages. In connection with this guilty plea, a federal judge sentenced the attorney to five years probation. The attorney must serve the first six months in home confinement and was ordered to meet with the IRS to determine the prior tax liability.  cash payment. The attorney was arrested at the conclusion of this meeting and subsequently pled guilty to federal bribery charges. Results of this investigation confirmed that the attorney acted alone without the knowledge of his business partners.  Individual Pled Guilty in Scheme to Defraud Elderly Woman TIGTA received information from an IRS employee who reported suspicions that a senior citizen was the victim of a fraudulent scheme. An acquaintance reportedly made the senior citizen believe that IRS was holding over one million dollars in refunds, which would be lost unless IRS tax payments were made. From September 1997 to May 2000, the senior citizen gave the acquaintance over $40,000 via wire transfers to make payments to IRS for this purpose. The indictment alleged that the individual did not represent the IRS and instead converted all of these payments to the acquaintance's own use. The senior citizen, who sold her home and several rental properties to make these fictitious tax payments, was living penniless in a homeless shelter when interviewed by TIGTA. As a result of interviews with witnesses, analyses of financial documents, and electronic monitoring, the acquaintance was indicted, arrested, and subsequently pled guilty in November 2001 to money laundering and was to be sentenced in April 2002. The victim is currently receiving Social Security benefits and is now living in a convalescence care facility.  Business Owner Convicted of Bribery A business owner pled guilty to federal charges of making bribe overtures totaling $20,000 to an IRS employee. Following a routine meeting to discuss a federal tax liability with business partners, this individual contacted and offered an IRS employee $10,000 to reduce the company's liability by half its original debt. The IRS employee reported the bribe overture to TIGTA. In a subsequent meeting with the business owner, the cooperating IRS employee agreed to the offer and later accepted the $10,000 cash. With assistance from special agents from OI's TSS, electronic evidence was gathered through the use of audio and video recording devices. Following the first payoff, the attorney offered the cooperating IRS employee a second bribe of an additional $10,000 if the employee would reduce the liability of another partner in the same fashion. A second, covertly monitored meeting was arranged where the attorney provided another $10,000  Individual Indicted on Six Counts of Fraud In March 2002 an individual was indicted on one count of making false, fictitious or fraudulent claims; one count of influencing or inuring an officer or juror; one count of  TIGTA's FY 2002 Semiannual Report to Congress    March 31, 2002  29   TIGTA's Results attempting to interfere with the administration of Internal Revenue laws; and three counts of bankruptcy fraud. The indictment alleges that the individual presented a check in the amount of $12,990 to the IRS on a closed bank account; that he filed Chapter 7 involuntary petitions in U.S. Bankruptcy Court identifying an IRS employee and a judge as debtors (the petitions contained false claims against them relating to their role in a trial); and that the individual devised a scheme to defraud two individuals of certain alleged equity in their property by filing false and fraudulent petitions. The indictment also alleges that the individual filed the four involuntary bankruptcy petitions without lawful payment of the filing fees.  Two Charged with Bank Fraud, Mail Fraud and Conspiracy In March 2002, the United States Attorney's office charged two individuals with mail fraud, bank fraud, and conspiracy. The information alleges the individuals paid bribes to an IRS taxpayer service representative to access confidential IRS records relating to delinquent taxpayers. The individuals then offered to represent the delinquent taxpayers before the IRS and solicited monies from them on the false representation that the monies would be paid over to the IRS as payments on an Offer in Compromise. The individuals allegedly converted over $600,000 for their own use from funds given to them by the delinquent taxpayers.  Man Arrested for Sending Threatening Letters In February 2002, special agents arrested a man who allegedly sent a series of threatening communications to an IRS employee in January and February 2002. The man was arrested pursuant to a criminal complaint that alleged one count of forcible interference with tax administration.  30 TIGTA's FY FY 2002 Semiannual Report to CongressMarch 31, 2002 TIGTA's 2002 Semiannual Report to Congress   March 31, 2002 30   TIGTA Organization TIGTA's FY2002 Semi-Annual Report to Congress  March 31, 2002 CongressOrganization 2002 TIGTA's FY 2002 Semiannual Report to TIGTA  March 31, 31 31   TIGTA's Organization  Organization of the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration TIGTA provides independent oversight of IRS activities, the IRS Oversight Board, and the IRS Office of Chief Counsel. TIGTA is organizationally placed within Treasury, but is independent of the Department and all other Treasury offices. TIGTA's focus is devoted to all aspects of work related to tax administration. TIGTA's primary organizational components are the Office of Audit and the Office of Investigations. TIGTA's Offices of Chief Counsel, Information Technology, and Management Services support both components' efforts. TIGTA's audit and investigative activities are designed to:  Promote economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in administering the nation's tax system. Detect and deter fraud and abuse in IRS programs and operations. Protect IRS against external attempts to corrupt or threaten its employees.  Authorities TIGTA has all the authorities granted under the Inspector General Act of 1978.21 TIGTA also has access to tax information in the performance of its responsibilities and has the obligation to report potential criminal violations directly to the Department of Justice. The Inspector General and the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service have established policies and procedures delineating responsibilities to investigate potential criminal offenses under the internal revenue laws. In addition, RRA 98 amended the Inspector General Act of 1978 to give TIGTA special agents statutory authority to carry firearms and execute the provisions of the I.R.C.  7608(b)(2). These provisions include law enforcement authority to execute and serve search warrants, serve subpoenas, and make arrests.  21  Pub. L. No. 95-452 Stat. 1101, as amended, at 5 U.S.C., App 3.

Ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Prevent, detect, and deter fraud, waste, and abuse.  The Audit program is comprised of reviews mandated by statute or regulation, as well as reviews identified through the annual planning process. The Annual Audit Plan describes audit responsibilities, audit focus and audit direction for the fiscal year. The planning process begins with independent risk assessments, which are designed to prioritize areas based on the greatest risks to the IRS. Major management issues, as well as specific areas of concern to Congress, the IRS Commissioner and the IRS Oversight Board, are considered as part of this planning process. OA is organized around IRS' core business activities (Small Business and Corporate Programs; Wage and Investment Income; Information Systems; and Headquarters Operations and Exempt Organization Programs). Emphasis is also placed on the statutory audit coverage mandated by RRA 98, as well as on other statutory authorities and standards involving computer systems and financial management.  34 TIGTA's FY FY 2002 Semiannual Report Congress  March 31,31, 2002 TIGTA's 2002 Semiannual Report to to Congress  March 2002 34   TIGTA's Organization  Office of Investigations OI investigates activities related to fraud, waste, abuse and mismanagement concerning activities of the IRS and related entities. OI is organized around 12 field divisions, which are geographically dispersed around the country, with direct reporting responsibilities to TIGTA headquarters. Additionally, OI includes five headquarters divisions that perform special support functions and provide technical and investigative assistance to the field. These divisions include:  Operations  provides OI with TIGTA's guidance concerning all investigative matters. Some examples of Operations' responsibilities include: responding to Congressional inquiries; liaison with other federal law enforcement agencies and preparation of recurring statistical reports for internal use and external use. Complaints Management  reviews and refers all complaints made to the TIGTA hotline and maintains OI's records. Strategic Enforcement  executes a proactive program to detect fraud in IRS operations, unauthorized accesses (UNAX) to IRS computer systems by internal users, and attempts to interfere with the security of IRS computers by external sources. SED's staff includes the combined expertise of auditors, special agents, and computer programmers. Technical and Forensic Support  provides technical support to the field through the Technical Services Section (TSS) and the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL). TSS provides technical and investigative assistance, equipment, training and other specialized services to enhance TIGTA's investigative activities. The FSL processes documentary, physical and chemical evidence, fingerprint and handwriting examination, and photography and chemical analysis. Special Inquiries and Inspection  conducts TIGTA's most complex, high profile investigations involving IRS senior management officials, the IRS oversight board, and IRS international employees. This Division includes three other specialized programs: procurement fraud, domestic terrorism and inspection.

These issues are of interest to IRS and Treasury executives, Congress, and the taxpaying public, and are expressed in quantifiable terms to provide further insights to the value and potential impact of OA's products and services. Including this information also advances adherence to the intent and spirit of GPRA.  Definitions of Additional Measures   Taxpayer Rights and Entitlements at Risk: The protection of due process (rights) that is granted to taxpayers by law, regulation, or IRS policies and procedures. These rights most commonly arise in the performance of filing tax returns, paying delinquent taxes, and examining the accuracy of tax liabilities. The acceptance of claims for and issuance of refunds (entitlements) are also included in this category, relating to instances when taxpayers have a legitimate assertion of overpayments of tax. Reduction of Burden on Taxpayers: Decreases by individuals or businesses in the need for, frequency of, or time spent on contacts, record keeping, preparation, or costs to comply with tax laws, regulations, and IRS policies and procedures. Increased Revenue or Revenue Protection: Assessment or collection of additional taxes (increased revenue), or proper denial of claims for refund, including recommendations that prevent erroneous refunds or efforts to defraud the tax system (revenue protection). Taxpayer Privacy and Security: Protection of taxpayer financial and account information (privacy). Processes and programs that provide protection of tax administration, account information, and organizational assets (security). Protection of Resources: Safeguarding human and capital assets, used by or in the custody of the organization, from inadvertent or malicious injury, theft, destruction, loss, misuse, overpayment, or degradation. This measure will often be expressed as a value of the entity or program affected by the issue(s) described in the audit report. Reliability of Management Information: Ensuring the accuracy, validity, relevance, and integrity of data, including the sources of data and the applications and processing thereof, used by the organization to plan, monitor, and report on its financial and operational activities. This measure will often be expressed as an absolute value (i.e., without regard to whether a number is positive or negative) of overstatements or understatements of amounts recorded on the organization's documents or systems.            40  TIGTA's FY 2002 Semiannual Report to Congress    March 31, 2002   Reports With Additional Quantifiable Impact on Tax Administration The number of taxpayer accounts, hours, and dollar values shown in this chart were derived from analyses of historical data, and are thus considered potential barometers of the impact of audit recommendations.

As of March 31, 2002, TIGTA issued one report where information or assistance requested by OA was refused. Reference No. 2002-10-009, GPRA: Criminal Investigation Can Improve Its Performance Measures to Better Account for Its Results OA was unable to issue an opinion about the quality of the data used to report the CI business results due to a scope impairment. CI denied OA access to the CIMIS database by stating that it contained information related to cases under grand jury investigation, access to which is restricted by the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (18 U.S.C. Appendix). The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 6(e), require that only those individuals approved by a government attorney may have access to grand jury material, and then only in furtherance of the criminal aspects of the case.    Disputed Audit Recommendations The Inspector General Act of 1978 requires IGs to provide information on significant management decisions in response to audit recommendations with which the IG disagrees. As of March 31, 2002, TIGTA did not issue a report where a significant recommendation was disputed.    Revised Management Decisions The Inspector General Act of 1978 requires IGs to provide a description and explanation of the reasons for any significant revised management decisions made during the reporting period. As of March 31, 2002, no significant management decisions were revised.    Audit Reports Issued in the Prior Reporting Period With No Management Response The Inspector General Act of 1978 requires IGs to provide a summary of each audit report issued before the beginning of the current reporting period for which no management response has been received by the end of the current reporting period. As of March 31, 2002, they were no prior reports where management's response was not received.    Review of Legislation and Regulations The Inspector General Act of 1978 requires IGs to review existing and proposed legislation and regulations and to make recommendations concerning the impact of such legislation or regulations. TIGTA's Office of Chief Counsel reviewed 135 proposed legislation and regulations during the six-month reporting period.

The following table reflects the status of the FY 2002 RRA 98 statutory reviews. Eleven statutory audit reports that dealt with the adequacy and security of IRS technology were issued during this reporting period.1 Reference to Statutory Coverage Enforcement Statistics  Explanation of the Provision An evaluation of IRS' compliance with restrictions under Section 1204 of RRA 98 on the use of enforcement statistics to evaluate IRS employees. An evaluation of IRS' compliance with restrictions under I.R.C.  7521 on directly contacting taxpayers who have indicated that they prefer their representatives be contacted. An evaluation of IRS' compliance with required procedures under I.R.C.  6320 (Supp. IV 1998) upon the filing of a notice of lien. An evaluation of IRS' compliance with required procedures under I.R.C  6330 (Supp. IV 1998) regarding levies.  Comments/TIGTA Audit Status Audit fieldwork in process.

All information technology program reviews are considered statutory based on the RRA 98 requirement to report annually on the adequacy and security of IRS technology.  68  TIGTA's FY 2002 Semiannual Report to Congress    March 31, 2002   Reference to Statutory Coverage Collection Due Process  Explanation of the Provision An evaluation of IRS' compliance with required procedures under I.R.C.  6320 and 6330 (Supp. IV 1998) regarding the taxpayers' rights to appeal lien or levy actions.  Comments/TIGTA Audit Status Reference Number 2002-10-068, March 2002. In 85 of the 87 cases reviewed (98 percent), the IRS generally complied with the requirements of the law and ensured taxpayers' appeal rights were protected. However, in 2 of the 87 cases, the IRS did not always follow all the requirements of the law. In these instances, Appeals Officers either did not adequately balance the efficiency of the proposed collection action against the taxpayer's legitimate concerns that the action be no more intrusive than necessary or did not obtain adequate verification from the IRS that all regulations had been met. OA does not believe that in either of these cases the noncompliance resulted in a legal violation of the taxpayer's Collection Due Process rights since no collection actions were ever initiated. Additionally, in 82 of the 87 cases, Appeals appropriately communicated the decision to taxpayers. These results indicate an improvement in communicating Appeals' decisions to taxpayers when compared to the prior year's audit. Ensuring all determination letters completely outline all the provisions of the law considered in the decision and by ensuring all established guidelines are followed could make further improvements. The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), 26 CFR 301.6330-1T(e)(Q-E7), and Appeals procedures state that the letters must address all issues raised by the taxpayer and whether the IRS followed all the applicable rules and administrative procedures and balanced tax collection with the taxpayers' legitimate concerns. The IRS guidelines also require the letters to provide information concerning which court the taxpayer must file his/her request for judicial review, as well as information about any agreements reached during the hearing and the actions to be taken by the IRS or the taxpayer.  I.R.C. 7803(d)(1)(A)(iii) and (iv)  Seizures  I.R.C.  7803(d)(1)(A)(iv)  An evaluation of IRS' compliance with required procedures under Subchapter D of Chapter 64 for seizure of property for collection of taxes. An evaluation of IRS' compliance with restrictions under Section 3707 of RRA 98 on designation of taxpayers.  Audit fieldwork in process.

This credit can be claimed even if the adoption has not been           finalized, and, in the 1998 tax year, even if the adoption process is           interrupted and never finalized. The expenses claimed for an adoption           that is stopped are applied to the maximum amount that may be claimed           on a second adoption.           The credit is up to $5,000 for each child, or           up to $6,000 for a domestic waiting child (called a ""special           needs"" child in IRS publications). The $5,000 credit also applies           to international adoptions after finalization. (After 2001, the           adoption credit will apply only to domestic waiting children.) The tax           credit limit is for expenses associated with each adopted child,           rather than an annual limit.           The tax credit is progressively phased out           for high-income families. The phase-out starts for families with           adjusted gross income (AGI) of $75,001 or higher in the year they           adopt, and is phased out entirely once their AGI reaches $115,000.           This tax credit is more valuable than a tax           deduction because allowable expenses are subtracted dollar for dollar           against your tax liability. For example, if you owe $5,000 in federal           taxes and have $3,000 in qualified adoption expenses, your tax bill is           reduced to $2,000. If your tax bill is smaller than the credit, the           unused portion of the credit may be carried forward for up to five           years.           According to IRS Publication 968, qualified           expenses include ""reasonable and necessary"" adoption fees,           attorney fees, and some travel costs, including necessary           transportation, meals, and lodging. Expenses related to surrogate           parents or adopting a spouse's child do not qualify for the credit.           The credit also does not apply to expenses reimbursed by the           government or private programs or for which an income tax deduction or           credit already is allowed. Adoptive parents should carefully review           the IRS guidance, preferably with a tax professional, to clarify what           expenses qualify for the credit according to IRS guidelines.           The credit may be taken for adoption expenses           incurred and paid for on or after January 1, 1997.

GX267-97-15804828	"APPENDIX C Summary of Revenue Sources  Prepared by:  Paul Wilson, Fiscal Analyst Minnesota House of Representatives Mary Jane Hedstrom, Fiscal Analyst Minnesota State Senate January 31, 2002   Table 1. Sales Tax on Food and Alcohol at the Metrodome 2001 Season ($1,000s)  Twins  Vikings  Gophers  Other  Total  Comments Vikings and Gophers numbers have been consistent for last few years, but the Twins numbers were only about half as large in 2000, owing to lower attendance.  Food (6.5%) Alcohol (9%) Total  $481 $286 $767  $169 $257 $426  $45 $32 $77  $119 $27 $146  $814 $602 $1,416  Source: Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission. Notes: (1) The table does not include the tax on food or beverages sold in suites. (2) Estimates are most recent available data for existing facilities. Revenue in future years would depend upon stadium venues, configuration, attendance and prices.  Table 2. 10 Percent Ticket Tax 2001 Season (Total sales and tax in $1,000s) Twins Paid Attendance Average Price (including tax) Average Price (before tax) Total Ticket Sales* (before tax) 1,928,009 $11.15 $9.65 $18,600 Vikings 640,910 $53.67 $46.07 $29,527 Gophers 256,972 $20.92 $17.96 $4,615 Other 525,405 $24.17 $20.75 $10,901 Total 3,351,296 $22.07 $18.99 $63,643 Comments *Complementary tickets are included in sales and are subject to tax. Average ticket prices include the face value of those tickets. (Complementary ticket totals: Twins 145,083 tickets; Vikings 12,002; Gophers 8,343).  Note that a 6.5% state sales tax was collected, in Tax (10%) $1,860 $2,953 $461 $1,080 $6,364 addition to this 10% ticket tax. Source: Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission. Note: Estimates are most recent available data for existing facilities. Revenue in future years would depend upon stadium configuration, attendance and prices.   Table 3. 6.5% Gross Receipts Tax on Clothing and Other Sports Memorabilia Licensed by Professional and College Sports Estimate for 2003 ($1,000s)  Taxable Items Clothing Other Items Clothing and other items  MLB $1,500 $1,000 $2,500  NFL $2,700 $1,900 $4,600  NBA & NHL $3,100 $1,900 $5,000  College $1,700 $1,100 $2,800  Total $9,000 $5,900 $14,900  Comments This cannot be structured as a sales tax because it would conflict with the Streamlined Sales Tax agreement. Estimate is for a 6.5% gross receipts tax (at retail) or a tax equal to 13% of wholesale. Tax rate could be set at any rate desired. Statewide tax base.  Source: Preliminary revenue estimate by Tax Research Division, Department of Revenue, based on national data from the Sporting Goods Manufacturing Association (www.sgma.com). Notes: 1. Table only includes revenue from taxing memorabilia for the four listed professional leagues. If other sports or leagues (such as NASCAR or WWF) were included, revenue would be higher. 2. The estimate for ""collegiate sports memorabilia"" is very preliminary because the breadth of that tax base has not been clearly defined.  Table 4. Existing Income Tax Paid by Players from Visiting Teams Estimate for 2001 ($1,000s)  MLB NFL Total  Between $1,100 and $1,300 Between $ 250 and $ 350 Between $1,350 and $1,650  Future revenue would depend on salary levels in professional sports.  Source: Preliminary revenue estimate by Tax Research Division, Department of Revenue.  Table 5. Lottery Games with a Sports Theme Estimate for 2001 ($1,000s)  Gross income per game Net income per game (after dedication to other funds)  $1,500 $ 612  The per-game revenue would be multiplied by the number of games dedicated to stadium finance each year. It may be possible to capture all $1.5 million per game for stadium finance.  Source: Minnesota State Lottery. Notes: 1. Gross income is after deducting prizes, retailer commissions, and operating expenses. Net income is after deducting dedicated revenue: $480,000 of in-lieu sales tax (dedicated to the Natural Resources Fund and Game and Fish Fund) and another $408,000 dedicated to the Environment and Natural Resources Fund. 2. The State Lottery assumes that these games will replace other games with no increase in total lottery revenue, resulting in net revenue loss to the funds listed above.   Table 6. Tax on Rental Vehicles in the Metro Area (Rentals of less than 30 days)  Estimate for 2003 ($1,000s) Comments: A percentage tax would need to be a gross receipts tax rather than a sales tax, under the Streamlined Sales Tax agreement. Source: Preliminary revenue estimate by Tax Research Division, Department of Revenue.  2% rental tax (metro area only)  $3,400  Table 7. Sales Tax Exemption for Stadium Construction Materials Hypothetical Cost of Stadium Value of Sales Tax Exemption ($1,000s)  Comments Construction materials are assumed equal to 52 percent of actual construction costs, so exemption from state sales tax would cut costs by (6.5%)x(52%)x(construction costs). This is a one-time cost (see note 3).  $300 million $500 million  $10,100 $16,900  If host city has a local sales tax, the state exemption would mean exemption from local tax as well. Source: Preliminary revenue estimate by Tax Research Division, Department of Revenue. Notes: 1. The actual stadium cost is unknown, so two hypothetical costs are shown. 2. ""Construction costs"" here exclude the cost of land, architectural fees and other soft costs. 3. Typically, construction materials exemptions are administered as refunds payable during construction so the state revenue impact occurs over several fiscal years. If desired for budget reasons, legislation could provide for a lump-sum refund of sales tax to be paid in one fiscal year when construction is complete.  OTHER REVENUES Media Access Charge  A rent based on gross receipts is similar to the rent that most shopping malls charge their tenants. The amount of rent could be set at the percentage necessary to raise a set amount of revenue and/or it could be set consistent with rent charged to vendors and other parties that use the stadium to further their business activities. Source: Patricia Lien, Senate Counsel and Research. Fees for use of the broadcast facilities at a stadium, at rates of $10,000 per game for television/cable and $5,000 per game for radio broadcast, would raise an estimated $2.16 million per year from Major League Baseball and $215,000 per year from National Football League broadcasts assuming that these fees are in addition to any existing fees. (If they replace existing fees, then the new revenue yield would be less). Source: Preliminary revenue estimate by Tax Research Division, Department of Revenue. Naming Rights  As this report says, naming rights are a matter for negotiation. Recently in the United States, naming rights for new professional sports stadiums typically have yielded $2 million to $2.5 million per year for terms of ten to thirty years. The range is between $900,000 and $4 million per year. Personal Seat Licensing  Details are needed before an estimate can be prepared for revenues from personal seat licenses. Personal seat license provisions in 1997 legislation (to finance a major league baseball stadium) were estimated to raise $500,000 in one-time revenue. Gaming Revenues  Estimates for sports lottery games are shown on the tables. The revenue potential from new types of legal gaming cannot be estimated without more specific information."

More detailed examination techniques and issue guidance are contained in the specific issue chapters of this guide.                     General Accounting Considerations          Even among sports franchises in the same league, the financial statements for the sports franchise are generally unique.  There are often significant differences in accounting for the acquisition of the sports franchise and in the accounting policies for major items such as player contracts and contingencies.  There are also varying levels of vertical business integration.  The financial statements often reflect significant related party transactions which are common for most sports franchises.           The amortization of player contracts is almost always a material audit issue.  Player contracts are typically structured to include signing bonuses and deferred compensation arrangements.           For most sports franchises, ticket revenues and broadcasting rights constitute the majority of revenue.  Many teams also have favorable lease arrangements in which the team receives revenue from parking, concessions, and stadium naming rights.  Advance sales of upcoming season tickets are typically reflected as deferred revenue on the balance sheet.  Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) require that gate revenues be recorded in the period in which the fans attend the games so that they are matched against period costs.  As with other industries, the GAAP timing of income and expenses for sports franchises often differs from that for tax purposes.                    -  Return to Table of Contents  -                               Return Identification and Entity Background Information          There are usually a limited number of sports franchises located within a specific district.  For purposes of an approved district compliance initiative, sports franchise returns can often best be identified through the examiner's personal knowledge of the sports teams located within their district.           The main problem in identifying returns, however, is identifying the owner's entity name under which the tax return is filed, as opposed to the sports franchise's ""doing business as"" (DBA) name.  This can be a difficult and time consuming task in situations in which the entity operates as a partnership.         One way to identify the ownership entity is through the use of the incorporation library (INCORP) on Lexis-Nexis.  By accessing the XXBIZ file (where XX represents the state abbreviation; for example, FLBIZ for Florida) examiners can usually locate the records for the ownership entity by utilizing the DBA name as the search term.           The BIZ file can provide a wealth of information about the entity, including the entity's registered name; the form of the entity, for example, corporation or partnership; the officers of record; and the federal employer's identification number (EIN).  The INCORP records will also indicate whether or not the entity is still active, or if it has been dissolved (voluntary or involuntary).  Additionally, historical data is provided which, if applicable, would include name changes or whether a merger had occurred.  The BIZ file will often cross reference related entity records.                    -  Return to Table of Contents  -                               Preplan and Issue Identification          The following information is presented to assist in assessing the audit potential of a sports franchise return.  It should only be used as supplemental information during the preplanning stage of an examination. Since it is not all inclusive, in no way should it restrict the examiner from identifying other potential return issues that may be present.                     Intangible Assets          The balance sheet is an integral part of any preplan.  Aside from normal preplan audit considerations, a specific review of the allocation among amortizable and non-amortizable intangible assets is especially important in sports franchise examinations.  A sports franchise's non-amortizable intangible assets may, upon examination, be determined to be significant.  The ratio of non-amortizable intangible assets (TV broadcast rights, goodwill, going concern value, and franchise costs) to amortizable assets (primarily player contracts) will depend on how long the franchise has been in existence and the number of marque players employed by the team.           Form 4562,  Depreciation and Amortization , should be viewed to ascertain if amortization has been  claimed on non-amortizable intangible assets.  An inspection of Form 4562 might also indicate potential problems regarding the amount of the original franchise cost (whether by purchase or by expansion) allocated to player contracts, the useful life assigned to player contracts, and the placed in-service date for these contracts.                     Deferred Revenue and Deposits          In order to identify deferred revenue and amounts that may have been improperly treated as non-taxable deposits, a detailed review of balance sheet current liabilities and long term liabilities is recommended.  The detail attached to the return may identify the make up of any deferred revenue.  For example, the detail may state that long term liabilities include deferred broadcast revenue and deferred sponsorship revenue.           Look at long-term liabilities to determine if any deferred revenue is included.  Sources of income such as ticket revenue for games which may extend beyond more than one season are often inappropriately deferred.           Amounts treated by the taxpayer as non-taxable deposits, which may in fact be taxable advance payments for services, may be included in long term liabilities or other liabilities.  The deposit/advance payment amounts for multiple year season ticket holder agreements (regular season ticket holders, club seats, and skybox or executive suites) can be quite significant.  This is especially the case for new sports franchises resulting from league expansion or team relocations and sports franchises that have or are trying to improve or expand the stadiums in which they play their home games.                     Accrued Expenses          As part of the examination of the balance sheet, large accrued expense items should be considered.  Accrued expenses may include such items as accrued bonuses or compensation to related parties to which IRC section 267 or IRC section 482 may apply.  Additionally, accrued compensation costs will often fall under the purview of IRC section 404 (deductions for deferred compensation) or IRC section 419 (deductions for contributions to welfare benefit funds).  Also, a large accrual of rent for a stadium or an arena should be reviewed to determine whether it qualifies as an IRC section 467 rental agreement, and if so, that the requirements of IRC section 467 are in compliance.                     Other Deductions          As with any examination, excessive repair expenses claimed may indicate capital improvements are being improperly expensed.  The same can be said for excessive professional fees claimed, which may represent fees connected with the acquisition of the sports franchise, a lease agreement, or similar capital asset.           The audited financial statements should reflect any loans to related parties and the terms of the loans.  A review of this information may indicate an IRC section 7872 issue involving related party debt having below market interest rates.                     Schedule M-1          Schedule M-1 should be inspected to determine the sports franchise's differences between taxable income and book income.  As with other taxpayers, these differences warrant consideration.           A taxpayer's tax accounting and book accounting are the same for items not reflected in Schedule M-1.  Accordingly, awareness of the sports franchise accounting areas for which there are usually differences in tax accounting and book accounting (which raise questions by their absence from Schedule M-1) can assist the examiner in identifying areas of audit risk.           An example is the absence of a Schedule M-1 adjustment for amortization.  Generally, a sports franchise's amortization will be less for tax purposes than for book purposes.  This is especially the case for new franchises, whether through expansion or purchase.                     Related Party Transactions          Related party transactions are common for sports franchises.  Concession arrangements, local television contracts, and stadium lease arrangements to related entities are common in the industry.  It is not uncommon for the owners of the sports franchise to have an interest in these and other businesses that have financial dealings with the sports franchise.           The audited financial statements are a good source of information. Generally accepted accounting principles and more specifically Statement of Financial Accounting Standard 57, Related Party Disclosures, require disclosure of related party transactions in the notes to the financial statements.  This includes information on: (1) their affect on the financial statements, (2) the dollar amount of each transaction, and (3) any amounts due to or from related parties along with the terms of the debt arrangement.           Often, the underlying documents will be needed to determine the substance of related party transactions.                    -  Return to Table of Contents  -                               Issue Development          Issue development is the key to any examination.  This means the facts should be fully developed to support the underlying issue, and to the extent possible, the taxpayer should acknowledge agreement with the facts.           Exhibit 2-1 is a sample Form 4564, Information Document Request, that can be tailored to fit the specific needs of the examination. Depending on the issue, the examiner may need to retain a copy of many of the documents and agreements inspected during the examination for the case file workpapers.           Factual development starts with the initial interview.  The interview should be conducted with the party having first-hand knowledge, usually the chief financial officer or comptroller.           It is important to develop initial interview questions which fit the particular facts and circumstances of the sports franchise.  Exhibit 2-2 is a sample interview questionnaire that can be tailored to the sports franchise's unique facts and circumstances.  This sample interview questionnaire contains generic, initial interview questions, as well as questions specific to sports franchise examinations.  The questionnaire is by no means all inclusive.  Rather, it is meant to be used as only a guideline.           As with most examinations, a key to good issue development is a tour of the business.  Regardless of how many stadiums or sports arenas the examiner has visited, each is unique in its own way.  Moreover, visiting a stadium or sports arena as a spectator is quite different from touring the facility as an examiner, where one has the opportunity to ask questions about the lives of assets, financing arrangements, and income producing activities.           It is preferable that the examination take place at the sports franchise's place of business.  A day-to-day observation of the business operations can lead to a more thorough understanding of the facts, clear up potential misunderstandings, and facilitate obtaining information from the taxpayer in a timely manner.  This usually minimizes the time expended on the examination and inconvenience to the taxpayer.           Make specialist referrals as early as possible.  Because a Computer Audit Specialist (CAS) referral is mandatory on all cases with Activity Code 219 and above, sports franchises typically require a CAS referral.           Asset valuation issues are usually identified early in the examination.  If asset valuation assistance is warranted, make the engineering referral early in the examination.                    -  Return to Table of Contents  -                               Required Filing Checks          There are usually related entity returns that should be inspected and perhaps examined.  This often includes the tax returns of the owners of the sports franchise.           The single largest expense of a professional sports franchise team is its salaries and wages.  This is due to ever increasing player costs.  It is, therefore, important for examiners to ensure the proper filing of all employment tax returns.  In addition, the policies for issuing Forms 1099 should be reviewed in conjunction with a determination that all required Forms 1099 were issued and that employees and subcontractors were properly classified.           Among other things, examiners should ensure that any relocation expenses paid to new players, coaches, etc., are included in the employee's W-2.  Additionally, examiners should determine if taxable fringe benefits have been properly handled.  For example, if all employees are provided season tickets at no cost, the value of the tickets given should be included in the employee's W-2, and proper FICA and FUTA paid.  If appropriate, the assistance of an Employment Tax Specialist should be requested.                     Player Personal Service Corporations          A potential issue area is whether the sports franchise's players have formed personal service corporations (PSCs) through which their services are offered to the sports franchise.  A PSC may have a tax impact on the individual player under IRC section 269A and IRC section 482.  In addition, a PSC is likely to have a major employment tax impact on the sports franchise.           In the case of a sports franchise and a player employed through his PSC, there is no issue as to whether the player is an employee or independent contractor.  The issue is whether the player is an employee of the sports franchise or the PSC for employment tax purposes.           An analysis of the evidence generally establishes that a sports franchise controls its players not only as to the result, but also as to the means and methods of accomplishing the result.  Under the player contracts, players may not offer their services to any other sports franchise in the league.  Additionally, the sports franchise normally pays for the players' expenses when the team is on the road.           Generally, a sports franchise will be determined to be the employer of its players.  Accordingly, the sports franchise is usually responsible for FICA and FUTA taxes on the compensation paid for player services even if they are paid to a PSC.   See Leavell v. Commissioner, 104 T.C. 140 (1995).                    -  Return to Table of Contents  -                               Compliance Strategies          If you believe there may be a lack of compliance in your area for one or more of the issues covered in this ATG, you may want to recommend a district compliance initiative.

GX027-15-9688578	"Statement of John R. LoGalbo, Vice President, Public Policy,  PSINet Inc., Ashburn, Virginia   Testimony Before the Subcommittee on Oversight  of the House Committee on Ways and Means   Hearing on Internet Tax Issues   May 16, 2000   Mr. Chairman, Mr. Ranking Member, members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you this afternoon. I am John LoGalbo, Vice President of Public Policy for PSINet. More than 10 years ago - before the Internet became a household word, long before the proliferation of ""dot.com"" companies, certainly before anyone conceived of billions of dollars of commercial activity riding on a stream of electrons - PSINet's chairman and founder, Bill Schrader, had a vision of the future of telecommunications. That vision was founded on the realization that every kind of communication - voice, text, pictures, sound, video - can be ""digitized,"" broken up into electronic pulses, carried anywhere in the world over diverse paths, and reassembled into its original form at the destination. The key was the ability to carry data over a new kind of robust, inexpensive network that crossed all proprietary boundaries - without regard to operating systems, network protocols, or physical communications media. Bill Schrader formed PSINet as the first company to attempt to transform that vision into a  commercial  reality, on a global scale, and he has succeeded beyond anyone's wildest expectations (except perhaps his own).   Today PSINet is an Internet Super Carrier, having built a global e-commerce infrastructure over our own optical fiber, satellite, Web hosting, and switching facilities. We serve more than two million users in 800 metropolitan areas in 27 countries on five continents, offering a full suite of retail and wholesale Internet services through wholly-owned PSINet subsidiaries.   At the heart of all PSINet services is our advanced Internet Protocol (""IP"") network. Connected to over 900 points-of-presence (""POPs"") worldwide, and designed for nearly unlimited growth, the PSINet network is one of the primary backbones that comprise the Internet.   We are building our e-commerce Web hosting centers, designed to support critical Internet applications in secure, managed environments, in key financial and business centers around the world. Our eight hosting centers (in New York City, northern Virginia, Los Angeles, Tokyo, Toronto, Geneva, London, and Amsterdam) are ideal for e-commerce applications. By the end of 2000, our plans call for 24 centers with two million square feet of revenue-producing space to be completed or under development. At present PSINet hosts many of the most highly visible and complex Web sites in the world.   With the acquisition of Transaction Network Services in 1999, PSINet is now at the forefront of the high-growth, high-margin world of electronic commerce. As purchases and transactions migrate to the web, companies need to be able to tap into a network that can process them efficiently and safely. TNS is the leading worldwide provider of e-commerce data communications solutions, handling more than 19 million transactions daily from two million businesses.   Finally, as an Internet Super Carrier, PSINet provides the ideal infrastructure to support other companies offering Internet services. We are, in effect, the Internet Service Providers' ISP, supporting a full spectrum of dial-up and dedicated access services, security solutions, Web hosting, e-mail and fax applications that can be privately labeled and sold to end-users by ISPs, telecommunications carriers, or any group with a large customer or membership base. As part of PSINet's partnership with the NFL's Baltimore Ravens - which includes naming rights for PSINet Stadium at Camden Yards - we created the first affinity ISP in professional sports history.   The report of the Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce, submitted to the Congress in April, makes significant recommendations with respect to ISPs. The Subcommittee has asked that we address those that relate to Internet access, and that would specifically impact ISPs.   The Advisory Commission, by a vote of 11 Yeas to 1 Nay, with 7 Abstentions, proposed to make permanent the current moratorium on any transaction taxes on the sale of Internet access, including taxes that were grandfathered under the Internet Tax Freedom Act. We strongly support this majority proposal of the Advisory Commission and we look forward to a permanent ban on Internet access taxes. At this point, we express our appreciation to the House of Representatives for the vote taken last Wednesday to extend the moratorium on Internet access taxes for a five-year period. In addition, we thank the House for its foresight in rescinding the grandfather clause for the nine states who currently impose taxes on Internet access. The margin of approval in the House - 352 to 75 - is very heartening to those of us in the Internet and telecom sector.   PSINet believes that a permanent ban on Internet access taxes is a substantial, but only preliminary, step toward the type of radical simplification and reform of traditional tax systems that must take place if those systems are to continue to function in the coming decades without suppressing the technological dynamism that powers the American economy.   When we refer to Internet access, generally we think of consumer-oriented, modem-based, ""narrowband"" dial-up access from a home PC, for prices ranging from $9.95 to $29.95 per month, sometimes at a flat rate and sometimes with an additional premium for hours of usage above a certain level.   My goal, however, is to illustrate for the Committee the type of Internet access that PSINet has always focused on - the provision of more complex, dedicated, high-bandwidth access to businesses, often accompanied by additional value-added services. The issues we confront when dealing with the tax systems of states and localities in that context are similar to that of other backbone providers and business-oriented ISPs. It is very difficult to separate taxes on Internet access from the plethora of other taxes to which we are subject, particularly as we utilize our IP-optimized network to take on some of the functions of traditional telecommunications companies.   Let me use as an example one of PSINet's core service offerings to business customers - our ""virtual private network"" (VPN) solutions, known as PSINet IntraNet ® . In the past, businesses seeking to tie together the private data networks of geographically dispersed offices have had to rely on traditional wide-area networking, requiring them to lease expensive, dedicated telephone circuits running between each remote office location. Building on our extensive backbone network, PSINet can offer secure and reliable data connections between remote offices at a fraction of the cost of traditional dedicated networks. Customers need only purchase circuit connections between each office and the nearest PSINet POP (instead of circuits spanning thousands of miles between the offices themselves). We carry the customer's data traffic between remote offices over our own backbone network, but we isolate it from traffic on the public Internet by means of frame relay technology or, for more advanced services, by encryption.   Typically, a customer seeking a VPN solution is also concerned about network security, since the data traffic between headquarters and satellite offices may include highly sensitive confidential and proprietary business information. If the customer's objective is to extend its exchange of data with its business suppliers or customers over a VPN (known as an ""extranet""), the security concerns may be even greater. PSINet offers additional services - beyond the basic ""connectivity"" solution - to address these issues, by means of firewalls, packet filtering, encryption technologies, and other value-added security services. Many of these solutions include hardware, software, on-site and remote service and maintenance components, in addition to connectivity.   Let's examine the tax implications of this fairly straightforward package of services. Since the moratorium was enacted, nine states continue to tax Internet access (Connecticut, Hawaii, Ohio for commercial customers, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, and Wisconsin). The District of Columbia, Iowa, and South Carolina have - wisely, in our view - repealed their Internet access taxes after the moratorium went into effect. Which of the services offered in this VPN package fall under the definition of ""Internet access"" in the Internet Tax Freedom Act? Perhaps because the answer is unclear, several states now impose tax on some or all ""enhanced"" Internet services, including not only network security but also Web hosting, Website design, application service provider (""ASP"") offerings, and others.   The industry is also finding that there can be dramatic state and local tax implications depending on how basic ISP access services are ""bundled"" together with other value-added services. Specifically, a service may be exempt if invoiced to the customer on a stand-alone basis but taxable if bundled with other services. Many business customers are moving away from simple dial-up access to higher-bandwidth connections using dedicated circuits, digital subscriber lines (""DSL""), cable modems, and other means - and ISPs, naturally, are providing those connections as part of a package. Where there is a separate charge for connectivity, most states are likely to tax it (since ""telecommunications"" are expressly excluded from the definition of ""Internet access"" under the Internet Tax Freedom Act). Where connectivity is bundled with Internet access into a single charge, states may attempt to tax the  entire  charge, including the otherwise exempt access fees.   Not only are connectivity charges subject to telecommunications taxes, but installation charges, disconnect fees, and associated charges face varying tax treatment among the states and localities. These traditional telecom categories introduce extraordinary levels of complexity and expense, with over 300 types of taxes and fees potentially applicable, at combined rates that reach and (in some cases) exceed 20%.   The interaction of multiple taxes adds insult to injury. Frequently taxes build on one another, where the base for calculation of one tax may include other taxes applied to that service - thereby assessing a ""tax on tax."" Federal and state excise taxes, for example, could be built into the base for computation of a state sales tax.   Similarly, there are too frequent instances of pyramiding of tax - payment of tax at  both  the wholesale and retail levels - which increase bottom-line service costs to the customer. For instance, while 13 states allow telecommunications companies a sales tax exemption on equipment used to deliver their services, only New York and, to a very limited extent, Virginia do so for Internet Service Providers. ISPs generally cannot avail themselves of resale exemptions with respect to the telecom connectivity services provided as a necessary part of the offer of Internet access. One concrete example is Connecticut, where regulations flatly deny a resale exemption even where a dedicated circuit is resold directly to the customer. As such, an ISP may pay tax on the lease of a circuit from the customer to its POP, then be forced to bill its customer for the tax  again  when it passes through the circuit cost.   Finally, which jurisdictions are entitled to impose their specific array of taxes on which portions of the entire package of services (the VPN and security services, in our example)? By definition, a virtual private network spans several locations, usually with the headquarters or ""hub"" in one state and the satellite or remote offices in others. Tangible products (such as routers) may be shipped to specified locations and taxed there, but the services (such as connectivity, remote monitoring, and network design) may span a variety of jurisdictions - each with its own tax rates, its own definitions and rules for determining the amount of the overall transaction applicable to its jurisdiction, and its own exemption requirements - many of which may be contradictory or inconsistent with those of other jurisdictions.   A recent report noted that a full service telecommunications provider operating nationwide would be required to file 55,748 tax returns a year, with total effective tax rates exceeding 20% in ten states (with Texas topping the list at 28.56%).  (1)      It is difficult to overstate the burden these complexities place on ISPs as the tax collection agents for these overlapping tax systems - not to mention their customers, as they attempt to sort out the taxes included in their bills. As another tax expert observed in a recent authoritative study:     [C]ompared to other advanced industrialized nations, the sales tax in the United States is complicated by the large number of state, county, and local jurisdictions that impose sales and use taxes. Currently, 45 states and the District of Columbia impose sales or use taxes at the state level. … In addition to the states, approximately 7,500 counties, cities, towns, transportation districts, and other special local jurisdictions impose sales or use taxes on transactions occurring within their borders.   …By contrast, in the European Union, there are only 15 countries and generally only 15 different national value-added tax rates. There are no local or county value-added tax rules or rates to be complied with.  (2)     A fair assessment of the value of Internet access taxes should therefore take into consideration the negative effects that saddling U.S. companies with these administrative costs may inflict on their competitiveness in the global economy.   Besides going a short distance to reduce the burdens and costs of collection on ISPs, a permanent moratorium on Internet access taxes would have an immediate positive impact by reducing the costs of Internet access for both consumers and businesses. Reducing access costs is a quick and obvious way to boost American competitiveness and to lower the ""Digital Divide"" that threatens to exclude from the information economy those citizens with fewer resources to spend on computers and Internet connectivity.   Making the moratorium permanent and applying it to Internet access taxes previously excluded by the grandfather clause would not threaten state and local revenues in any significant way. States could radically simplify and decrease the telecom taxes that are now imposed on the channels by which Internet access is delivered to their citizens - telephone lines, wireless transmissions, and cable television and satellite communications - and still maintain substantial revenue from these sources. Income taxes, both corporate and individual, from income generated by the growth of electronic commerce would be unaffected. Sales and use taxes on most in-state purchases would continue to be collected. Revenue losses from abolishing Internet access taxes and decreasing other telecom taxes would therefore be minimal.   There is much more to the Advisory Commission's report, of course, than the recommendation that all Internet access taxes be subject to a permanent moratorium. PSINet supports both the Formal Findings and Recommendations of the Commission and the policy proposals adopted by the majority of the Commissioners.   Significantly, the Commission's report observed that it is early to predict the trends and outcomes of many aspects of e-commerce as it continues its development, and that empirical assessments of these trends are just beginning to be made.   We are grateful to the Chairman and this Subcommittee for their leadership in holding these hearings, and for extending this opportunity to PSINet to present its perspective. We hope you will continue to look to PSINet to work with you on the issues arising from tax policies, electronic commerce, and the Internet.   We look forward to answering any questions you may have.     1.  Committee on State Taxation's Fifty State Study and Report on Telecommunications Taxation, p. 5 (September 7, 1999).  2.

The Q&A provides information to taxpayers who need a taxpayer identification number for a child who has been placed in their home pending final adoption.    Questions and Answers:      What is an ATIN?    Who needs an ATIN?    Why do I need an ATIN?    How do I know if I should apply for an ATIN?    How can I find out if I qualify to claim the dependency exemption or child and dependent care credit for the child I am adopting?    Can I get an ATIN if I am adopting a child from another country?    I applied for an SSN using the documentation given to me by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) but my application was rejected. Now what do I do?    Is the ATIN something new; I have never heard of it before.    What did people do last year if they didn't have an ATIN?    What form do I use to apply for an ATIN?    What do I need to complete the Form W-7A?    What is placement documentation?    Should I send in my original documentation?    How long is the ATIN valid?    Why does the ATIN deactivate after two years?    What can I do if the ATIN expires before the adoption is finalized?    When should I apply for an ATIN?    How long does it take to get an ATIN?    Can I use an ATIN to claim the Earned Income Tax Credit?                            ATIN Questions and Answers       Q.1. What is an ATIN?    A.1. An ATIN is an Adoption Taxpayer Identification Number issued by the Internal Revenue Service as a temporary taxpayer identification number for the child in a domestic adoption where the adopting taxpayers do not have and/or are unable to obtain the child's Social Security Number (SSN). The ATIN is to be used by the adopting taxpayers on their Federal Income Tax return to identify the child while final domestic adoption is pending.    Return to Questions and Answers Index                        ATIN Questions and Answers       Q.2. Who needs an ATIN?    A.2. If you are in the process of adopting a child and are able to claim the child as your dependent or are able to claim a child care credit, you may need an ATIN for your adoptive child.    Return to Questions and Answers Index                        ATIN Questions and Answers       Q.3. Why do I need an ATIN?    A.3. Recent tax law changes require that when you list a person's name on your federal income tax return, you must provide a valid identifying number for that person. During the adoption process, you may not have been able to obtain an existing or a new Social Security Number (SSN) for the child who may already have been placed in your home. If you are eligible to claim the child as your dependent, and you don't have the child's SSN, then you will need to request an ATIN in order to claim the child as a dependent and ( if eligible) to claim the child care credit.    Return to Questions and Answers Index                        ATIN Questions and Answers       Q.4. How do I know if I should apply for an ATIN?    A.4. You should apply for an ATIN only if you are in the process of adopting a child and you meet all of the following qualifications:      The adoption is a domestic adoption.    The child is legally placed in your home for adoption by a authorized adoption agency/agent.    The adoption is not yet final, and you are unable to obtain the child's existing SSN or you are unable to apply for a new SSN for the child pending the finalization of the adoption.    You qualify to claim the child as a dependent.      Return to Questions and Answers Index                        ATIN Questions and Answers       Q.5. I am not sure if I qualify to claim the dependency exemption or child and dependent care credit for the child I am adopting, how can I find out?    A.5. To know whether you qualify to claim the child's exemption or child care credit for the child, see ""Exemptions"" and ""Credit for Child and Dependent Care Expenses"" in the Form 1040 instructions. For further information you may order Publication 501 (Exemptions, Standard Deductions and Filing Information) and Publication 503 (Child and Dependent Care Expenses), by calling 1-800-829-3676 (or 1-800-TAX-FORM). You may also download information on the INTERNET.    If you are still not sure, you may call 1-800-829-1040 or come to any IRS walk-in office for assistance.    Return to Questions and Answers Index                        ATIN Questions and Answers       Q.6. Can I get an ATIN if I am adopting a child from another country?    A.6. No! You should apply through the Social Security Administration (SSA) for a valid SSN. When you are adopting a foreign child, upon the child's entry into the United States you should receive enough documentation from the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to satisfy the Social Security Administration's requirements for a SSN.    Return to Questions and Answers Index                        ATIN Questions and Answers       Q.7. I applied for an SSN using the documentation given to me by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) but my application was rejected. Now what do I do?    A.7. If the SSA rejects your application because the documentation you received from the INS did not satisfy their requirements for an SSN, you may then apply to the IRS for an ITIN, Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, using Form W-7, Application for IRS Individual Taxpayer Identification Number. Order Publication 1915, Understanding Your ITIN, and review the requirements.    Return to Questions and Answers Index                        ATIN Questions and Answers       Q.8. Is the ATIN something new; I have never heard of it before.    A.8. Yes, this is new. In fact, this is the first year it is required. So, if you meet the requirements in  Question 4 , when you file your 1997 tax return you will need an ATIN if you intend to claim the exemption or (when eligible) take the child care credit for the child you are adopting.    Return to Questions and Answers Index                        ATIN Questions and Answers       Q.9. What did people do last year if they didn't have an ATIN?    A.9. Before the 1997 tax year, taxpayers who were adopting children and met the requirements to claim the child could use the phrase ""U.S. Adoption Pending"" in place of the SSN. If taxpayers amended their 1996 or 1995 tax returns claiming the child they were in the process of adopting, they could still use the phrase ""U.S. Adoption Pending"" in place of the SSN. It is only beginning with your 1997 tax return that the ATIN a required.    Return to Questions and Answers Index                        ATIN Questions and Answers       Q.10. I now know that I meet the requirements to apply for an ATIN. What form do I use to apply for an ATIN?    A.10. The Form W-7A, Application for Taxpayer Identification Number for Pending Adoptions, is used by qualifying taxpayers to obtain an ATIN. To get Form W-7A, you may go to any IRS walk-in site or call 1-800-829-3676. You may also download the form  here  in Adobe PDF format.    Return to Questions and Answers Index                        ATIN Questions and Answers       Q.11. What do I need to complete the Form W-7A?    A.11. In general you need to know the child's name, the birth information, and the placement agency. This information is typically found in the placement documentation. In addition, this placement documentation must be attached to and submitted with the W-7A. The Form W-7A has more specific and detailed instructions. You may send the Form W-7A and the necessary documentation to the address listed below or it can be dropped off at an IRS Walk-in site. The Walk-in site will mail the information for you.

Box 447  Bensalem, PA 19020    Return to Questions and Answers Index                        ATIN Questions and Answers       Q.12. What is placement documentation?    A.12. Placement documentation is the signed documentation placing the child in your care for legal adoption. In general, one of the following documents will satisfy this requirement:      A placement agreement entered into between you and a public or private adoption agency.    A document signed by a hospital official authorizing the release of a newborn child to you for legal adoption.    A court order or other court document ordering or approving the placement of a child with you for legal adoption.    An affidavit signed by an attorney, a government official, etc., placing the child with you pursuant to the states' legal adoption laws.     The placement documentation is sometimes referred to as ""Placement Agreement""; ""Surrender Papers""; ""Temporary Placement Paperwork""; ""Placement Order"" etc. This documentation termed differently from state to state must clearly establish that the child was placed in your home for purposes of adoption by an authorized adoption agency (or agent), and must include the following information:    Adoptive Parent(s) full name  Child's full name  Name of the Placement Agency or Agent  The date the child was placed in the adoptive parents home.  The signature of the parent or parents (the adopting taxpayers) and that of an official representative of the authorized placing agency or agent.    Return to Questions and Answers Index                        ATIN Questions and Answers       Q.13. Should I send in my original documentation?    A.13. No, do not send the original documentation. A copy of the original documentation is all that is required to be sent with the W-7A. IRS will not return any submitted documentation.    Return to Questions and Answers Index                        ATIN Questions and Answers       Q.14. How long is the ATIN valid?    A.14. As soon as the adoption becomes final, the adopting parents should obtain an SSN for the child and notify the IRS of the new SSN. When the IRS is notified of a new SSN for the adopted child, it will deactivate the ATIN. If the adopting parents do not notify the IRS within two years, the ATIN will be automatically deactivated.    Return to Questions and Answers Index                        ATIN Questions and Answers       Q.15. Why does the ATIN deactivate after two years?    A.15. The automatic deactivation of the ATIN after a two year period is necessary because the ATIN is an identification number issued for temporary use until a valid SSN can be obtained for the adopted child. It is not a permanent valid identification number. A reminder notice will be sent eighteen months after the taxpayers receives the ATIN, informing the adopting parents, that the ATIN will expire in 6 months.    Return to Questions and Answers Index                        ATIN Questions and Answers       Q.16. What can I do if the ATIN expires before the adoption is finalized?    A.16. If the adoption is not finalized before the ATIN expires, you may apply for an extension. The eighteen month reminder notice will explain what you must do to apply for an extension.    Return to Questions and Answers Index                        ATIN Questions and Answers       Q.17. When should I apply for an ATIN?    A.17. You should apply as soon as the qualifying conditions listed in  question 4  are met, but at least 8 weeks before the due date of your individual federal income tax return, which is normally April 15. For tax year 1997, taxpayers meeting the conditions listed in question 4 should wait until December 15 to file Forms W-7A.    Return to Questions and Answers Index                        ATIN Questions and Answers       Q.18. How long does it take to get an ATIN?    A.18. It will generally take 4 to 8 weeks to get an ATIN once the IRS receives a completed Form W-7A. After 8 weeks if you have not heard from the IRS about your application, you may call the Philadelphia Service Center at (215) 516-4846. This is not a toll-free call.    Return to Questions and Answers Index                        ATIN Questions and Answers       Q.19. Can I use an ATIN to claim the Earned Income Tax Credit?    A.19. No. You can only use an SSN to claim the EITC. However, if you are entitled to the EITC without using the adoptive child as the qualifying child, you can still claim the EITC.    When the adoption is final and the child has an SSN, you may file an amended return for an earlier year if you find that you could have claimed EITC in the earlier year except for the fact that the child did not have an SSN. Use Form 1040X, Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax Return, and Schedule EIC. The Statute of Limitation for filing an amended tax return is normally three years from the due date of the individual income tax return. More detailed information on filing the amended individual tax return is available in the instruction for the 1040X. Those instructions can be obtained by calling the IRS at 1-800-829-3676.

GX256-34-14899041	"October 24, 2003  MEMORANDUM FOR LMSB INDUSTRY DIRECTORS DIRECTORS, FIELD OPERATIONS COMMUNICATIONS, TECHNOLOGY & MEDIA DIRECTOR, FIELD SPECIALISTS DIRECTOR, PREFILING AND TECHNICAL GUIDANCE FROM: Thomas W. Wilson, Jr. /s/Thomas W. Wilson, Jr. Industry Director Communications, Technology & Media Examination Procedures for Sports Franchise Acquisitions  SUBJECT:  In a simultaneously issued field directive titled ""Examination of Sports Franchise Acqui sitions"" examiners are provided with a compliance measure tool to be used in the classification and examination of taxpayers who acquire sports franchises. This tool allows agents to resolve sports franchise acquisitions issues in limited and expedited examinations. This memorandum provides examiners with directions in applying the compliance measure to cases within the classification and in the examination process. A taxpayer's acceptance of the Service's use of the compliance measure still requires examiners to conduct a review of the acquisition to verify that the taxpayer falls within the scope of the measure. Revenue agents assigned sports franchise acquisition cases should complete and forward referrals to the Engineering program during their pre examination analysis. Examiners in conducting their review should utilize the procedures outlined below. VERIFY THE EXISTENCE , BASES AND USEFUL LIVES OF ACQUIRED INTA NGIBLE ASSETS 1. Verifications and Examination Techniques Taxpayers are required to allocate the purchase price among the acquired intangibles. In any case in which a taxpayer claims amortization deductions for an intangible asset, the taxpayer is required to verify the existence, value and useful life of the asset to establish that the asset qualifies for amortization. Therefore, taxpayers are expected to have an appraisal, which is to be requested and reviewed by the examiner. When a taxpayer makes an amended return to claim additional amortization deductions, the taxpayer is expected to provide a new or revised appraisal. Examiners in conducting their review of the appraisal should use the following audit steps and request the following documents:   2 a. Request and reconcile the appraised values and useful lives to the values and lives reported on the return, the taxpayer's financial statements and depreciation schedules. b. Request, review and reconcile player contracts to the lives detailed on the taxpayer's appraisal and depreciation schedules. Due to the volume of contracts, examiners may elect to review and reconcile a sampling of the contracts. c. Request, review and reconcile contracts for the sale of luxury suites, club seats, in-stadium advertising, naming rights, and other acquired assets to the lives detailed on the taxpayer's appraisal and depreciation schedules. Due to the volume of contracts, examiners may elect to review and reconcile a sampling of the contracts. d. Request and review sales documents including the due diligence letter, if any. Reconcile the sales price (includ ing a reconciliation of liabilities assumed) to the value reported in the appraisal. In examining the useful lives of acquired intangible assets, agents generally should expect to see the following:   Player contracts with a composite useful life between four and five years. Other amortizable assets (not including any media rights) with a composite useful life of between nine and 10 years.  With respect to a purchase price allocation for an existing franchise, agents generally should see allocations to:   Player contracts of approximately 55% of the total amount allocable to all intangibles. Other amortizable assets (not including any media rights) including , but not limited to , playing facility naming rights, concession agreements, club seat contracts, and luxury suite contracts of approximately 15% of the total amount allocable to all intangibles. Non-amortizable intangible assets (exclusive of media rights) such as equity interests in related entities, franchise rights, and goodwill and going conce rn value of approximately 10% of the total amount allocable to all intangibles. Media rights of approximately 20% of the total amount allocable to all intangibles, split relatively evenly between the current value of the rights represented by the contracts in place as of the date of acquisition, and the residual (terminal) value of all rights in all future media contracts.       3 2. Expansion Teams A taxpayer who acquires an expansion team will normally have allocations different than those described above. When a taxpayer acquires an expansion team , the taxpayer, unlike a taxpayer who acquires an existing team, generally does not acquire preexisting agreements that provide the taxpayer the contractual rights to income sources such as those generated by the sale of luxury box seating or playing facilities naming rights. Instead, the grant of an expansion team provides the owner with the right to continually enter into and renew such agreements. Agents should therefore expect to see a lower allocation to a mortizable assets relative to such allocation for an existing team that has exercised its rights to enter into and renew amortizable agreements . 3. Media Rights Taxpayers usually determine the acquisition cost allocable to acquired media rights in one of two ways. Taxpayers may use a discounted cash flow analysis to value both current and future media rights. In using this approach, the taxpayer bifurcates the media rights value between the rights represented by the current media contacts and the rights represented by all expected future media contracts. Taxpayers claim amortization deductions for the cost allocated to the value of media rights represented by the current contracts. Amortization claims are not made for the cost allocated to the ongoing rights to revenues from expected future contracts because those rights do not have an ascertainable useful life. In the other approach, the taxpayer does not independently value the media rights and instead considers the value to be in the ""residual"" class of assets. Under this approach, taxpayers do not claim amortization deductions for media rights. A taxpayer's media rights may include national TV rights, local TV rights, national radio rights, local radio rights, foreign TV and radio rights, and satellite broadcast rights. Examiners are not to allow any amortization deductions for any media rights. Taxpayers will be free to pursue any claim for amortization deductions from media rights in Appeals or in the courts. We encourage the use of Fast Track procedures to resolve the issue in the field. 4. Closing Agreements Examination must secure a closing agreement that sets out the resolution of the acquisition issues under the compliance measure. The closing agreement will reflect the li mited nature of the compliance measure. Thus, the closing agreement will reflect that application of the measure in and of itself will not preclude the Service from subsequent examination of the basis of any specific asset as may be necessary in applying any provision of the Code. The language of the closing agreement will vary depending on the treatment of media rights. If at the close of an examination, the issue of the amortization of media rights   4 has not been considered under the Fast Track procedures, the closing agreement prepared in Examination would set out the determination of the taxpayer's amortization deductions for all acquired amortizable intangible assets (not including any media rights) under the compliance measure. The closing agreement must also set out the purchase price allocation to media rights as determined under the compliance measure, and that the taxpayer has not conceded in Examination any amortization claim for media rights represented by current media contracts. Taxpaye rs will be free to pursue any denied deduction for amortization of the purchase price allocable to current media rights (as determined under the compliance measure) in Appeals or in the courts. Alternatively, if the taxpayer chooses to concede in Examination all claims for amortization deductions for all media rights in all years, that concession must be included in the closing agreement. If, during the time the acquisition issues are in the jurisdiction of Examination, the issue of the allowance of amortization deductions for any media rights was resolve in Appeals under the Fast Track procedures, the resolution must be set out in the closing agreement. PRESENT VALUE CALCULATIONS AND BASIS ADJUSTMENTS After verifying the existence, bases and useful live s of the acquired amortizable intangible assets, the next step to be taken by examiners is to determine whether the taxpayer's present value percentage of the amortizable intangible assets comes within the compliance measure. An adjustment must be made to the bases of the taxpayer's acquired amortizable intangible assets if the taxpayer's present value percentage is greater than the compliance measure percentage. In such case, a corresponding adjustment will be made to the bases of the remaining ( non-amortizable ) intangible assets. Calculating the taxpayer's present value percentage and any necessary bases adjustments is a multi -step process that requires the following determinations: (1) the percentage of total intangibles represented by each intangible asset, (2) the present value table factor for each amortizable intangible asset, (3) the present value of the deductions to recover the cost allocable to the amortizable intangible assets individually and as a group, (4) the basis reduction needed in order to come within the compliance measure percentage and the allocation of that basis reduction to each of the amortizable intangible assets, and (5) a reallocation of the basis reduction so as to step up the bases of the remaining ( non-amortizable ) intangible assets. Step One - CALCULATE EACH AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASS ET'S PERCENTAGE OF TOTA L INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GROUP TOTAL: The applicable percentage is determined by dividing the cost allocable to each intangible asset by the total cost allocable to all intangible assets. Add the result for each amortizable asset together to calculate the group total. Step Two - DETERMINE THE PRESENT VALUE FACTOR FOR EACH AMORTIZABLE INTA NGIBLE ASSET (NOT INCLUDING ANY ME DIA RIGHTS ): In applying the compliance measure, agents will use a discount rate of 5.5% per annum. The discount rate will be applied to the stream of amortization deductions claimed (and to be claimed) assuming that the   5 deductions are allowable at the close of each calendar year. The present value factor may be determined via the use of the attached present value table (see Attachment A  Present Value Table). The table has two columns, one showing useful life and the other the corresponding present value factor for that life. The table states a n asset's useful life in quarter- year increments. The present value factor for each amortizable asset is determined by matching the asset's useful life to the useful life on the table (to the nearest quarter- year increment) , and using the corresponding present value factor shown on the table. Step Three - CALCULATE THE PRESENT VALUE PERCENTAGE OF THE RECOVERY OF TH E COST ALLOCABLE TO THE AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS (NOT INCLUDING ANY ME DIA RIGHTS ) INDIVIDUALLY AND AS A GROUP : This is computed by multiplying the percentage calculated in Step One by the factor determined in Step Two for each asset individually. Add the results for each amortizable asset together to calculate the present value recovery percentage for the group as a whole. Step Four - DETERMINE IF AN ADJUSTM ENT TO BASES OF THE AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSE T (NOT INCLUDING ANY ME DIA RIGHTS ) IS REQUIRED. IF REQUIRED, CALCULATE THE GROSS STEP DOWN OF BASES NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE A GROUP PRESENT VALUE PERCENTAGE OF THE RECOVERY OF THE COST ALLOCA BLE TO THE AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT DOES NOT EXCEED THE COMPLIANCE MEASURE PERCENTAGE AND ALLOCATE THAT GROSS STEP-DOWN TO EACH OF THE AMORTIZA BLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS: To determine whether an adjustment to  basis is required, compare the resulting group present value percentage achieved in Step Three to the compliance measure percentage. If the group present value percentage achieved in Step Three is greater than the 60% maximum compliance measure, the bases of the amortizable intangible assets mus t be reduced by an amount that will achieve a group present value percentage that does not exceed the compliance measure percentage. Conversely, if the group present value percentage achieved in Step Three is less than the 60% maximum compliance measure, no adjustment to the bases of the amortizable intangible assets would be warranted . The following calculations are required to determine the basis reduction amounts. 1. The present value difference calculated in Step Four must be converted to its face amount to determine the full adjustment to the purchase price allocations (and bases) of amortizable intangible assets. 2. The face amount calculated in (1 ) above is allocated pro-rata among the amortizable intangible assets. Step Five - REALLOCATE THE GROSS BASES REDUCTION AMOUNT AMONG THE REMAINING INTANGIBLE ASSETS : Once the step-down of the bases of amortizable assets has been completed, a corresponding step -up in the bases of the remaining (non-amortizable) intangible assets, including media rights, must b e made. The allocation of the gross step-up will not require a revaluation of the remaining intangible assets. Generally, as   6 noted above, the remaining intangibles will represent about 30% of the value of all intangibles. Media rights will generally account for about 20% (about 10% to current and 10% to future rights) of the purchase price for all intangibles. Franchise and other non-amortizable franchise rights will generally account for about 10% of the intangibles. These percentages will be used as a base for an allocation process to determine the bases step- up. General Allocation Process: Agents generally will allocate the step- up to three groups of assets: (1) current media rights, (2) future media rights, and (3) franchise and other non-amortizable assets. Within each group, the allocation will be made pro- rata among the distinct assets within the group. The step- up will initially be allocated equally to each of the three groups up to an amount (taking into account any existing purchase price allocation) that does not exceed 10% of the total purchase price of all intangibles. When the existing purchase price allocation to a group is at or exceeds 10%, or when the step- up (together with any existing purchase price allocation) allocated to a group reaches the 10% mark, no additional step- up will be allocated to that group at that time. The allocation will then be made to any remaining group (up to the 10 % mark) until such time as all three groups have reached the 10% mark. When all three groups have reached the 10% mark, the step- up will be allocated in a manner so as to result (to the greatest extent possible) in three groups with the same percentage share of the total purchase price allocable to all intangibles. In accomplishing this step, any remaining unallocated step- up will initially be allocated equally among the groups up to (but not exceeding) the percentage that is the highest percentage of total intangibles allocable to any group. When, if at all, all three groups have reached the highest percentage of total intangibles, any remaining unallocated step- up will be allocated equally among the three groups. In the overall allocation process, the purchase price ultimately allocated to a group may ultimately be less than or greater t han the 10% average generally seen for a group . With one exception, the starting point in performing the allocation will be the purchase price allocation as reported (whether by original or amended return) by the taxpayer. In any initial instance in which franchise exceeds 10% of the total purchase price of all intangibles and future media rights are less than that 10% mark, the excess of franchise over the10% mark will be reallocated to future media rights (even in cases in which the taxpayer does not initially value future media rights) up to , but not exceeding , 10%. Thus, if both future media and franchise exceed 10%, there will be no reallocation between franchise and future media rights. Similarly, if franchise is 10% or less, there will be no reallocation between franchise and future media rights. In no event will there be a reallocation of reported purchase price for franchise or future media rights to current media rights (whether or not valued by the taxpayer) . Agents should not reallocate the reported purchase price among the reported non-amortizable assets except as otherwise noted in this paragraph.   7 EXAMPLES EXAMPLE 1  B, in an asset acquisition, acquired the assets of sports franchise S for $200 million. B allocated $180 million of the purchase to intangible assets. Of the $180 million allocated to intangible assets, B allocated $38 million to non-amortizable assets (including $15 million to future media rights and $23 million to franchise and all other non-amortizable assets and league membership rights), and $142 million to intangible assets for which B claimed amortization deductions. Of the $142 million, B allocated $15 million to current media rights (as represented by the current TV and radio contracts), and $127 million to player contracts and all other amortizable assets as follows: Assets Player Contracts Season Ticket Holder List Concession Agreement Sponsorship Agreements Luxury Suite Contracts National TV Contracts Local TV Contacts Local Radio Contracts Group Total Original Allocation $115,000,000 $ 4,000,000 $ 3,000,000 $ 2,500,000 $ 2,500,000 $ 12,500,000 $ 2,000,000 $ 500,000 $142,000,000 Useful Life 3.29 years 21 years 5.5 years 2.5 years 2 years 4 years 3 years 3 years  Step One  CALCULATE THE PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL INTANGIBLE ASSETS ALLOCATED TO EACH AMORTIZABLE INTANGIB LE ASSET (NOT INCLUDING ANY ME DIA RIGHTS ) AND THE GROUP TOTAL.

The following computations are required to allocate the $ 4,708,233 step down computed in Step 3: 1. CALCULATE THE PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO BE REALLOCATED.   10 The $4,708,233 is 2 .616% of total intangible assets ($4,708,233/$180,000,000). 2.

CATEGORIZE THE REMAINING ASSETS INTO THRE E GROUPS : (1) CURRENT MEDIA RIGHTS , (2) FUTURE MEDIA RIGHTS , AND (3) FRANCHISE AND OTHER NON-AMORTIZABLE ASSETS . The groups' respective percentage of total intangible assets is as follows : Current Media = 8.33% Future Media = 8.33% Franchise, etc. = 12.78 % a. Because franchise exceeds 10%, and future media rights is less than 10%, allocate the excess of franchise over 10% to future media rights up to, but not exceeding 10%. Thus, 1.67% of franchise value will be allocated to future media rights to bring that value up to 10%. As a result of this re -allocation, the starting place for the bases step up is 11.11% (12.7 8% - 1.67%) for franchise, etc., and 10% (8.33% + 1.67%) for future media rights. b. Because both franchise and future media are at or above the 10% mark, the step- up will first be allocated exc lusively to current media rights to bring that group up to 10%. Current media rights will be increased initially (as a percentage of total intangibles) by 1.67%, the amount necessary to bring that group up to the 10% mark. As a result of this re allocati on: Current Media = 10.00% (8.33% + 1.67%) Future Media = 10.00% Franchise, etc. = 11.11% c. Following these initial reallocations, the three groups are at or above 10%. At this stage, the remaining step- up of .95% (2.616-1.67%) will be allocated in a ma nner so as to achieve to the greatest extent possible   11 three equal groups of the highest percentage of purchase price allocable to total intangibles. The highest percentage allocable to total intangible s is 11.11%, the amount allocable to franchise, etc. Since current and future media rights are below 11.11%, the remaining .95% step- up will be allocated equally to each of those two groups so as to bring each group up to 11.11%. An equal allocation will exhaust the remaining step- up and result in .475% of step- up to both current and future media. The final step up allocation to the three groups of assets as a percentage of total intangible assets both individually and as a group is as follows: Current Media Rights: Future Media Rights: Franchise, etc.: Group Total 10.475% (8.33% + 1.67% + .475%). 10.475% (8.33% + 1.67% +.475%). 11.11%. (12.78% - 1.67%) 32.0 6%  4. DETERMINE THE GROSS STEP-UP (IF ANY ) FOR EACH GROUP AND DISTRIBUTE PRO RATA THAT STEP-UP TO EACH DISTINCT INTANGIBLE ASSET WITHIN EACH GROUP . The gross step- up a mount for a group i s the portion of the $57,708,233 (the amount to be allocated to remaining intangible assets (i.e., current and future media rights and franchise, etc. , as a group) from Step 4 , above ) to be allocated to the group , less the amount originally allocated to the group. The portion of the $57,708,233 to be allocated to a group is the product of the $57,708,233 and the ratio of the percentage of total intangible assets for the group to the percentage of total intangible assets for the remaining intangible assets. a. Current Media Rights Gross Step- up Amount is $ 3,855,076 . This amount is calculated by subtracting from the portion of the $57,708,076 to be allocated to current media rights the original allocation to current media rights . The portion of the $57,708,233 to be allocated to current media rights is $18,855,076, the product of (10.475%/32.06%) 2 * $57,708,233. The original allocation to current media rights was $15,000,000. Thus, the gross step- up amount of $3,855,076 is $18,855,076 minus $15,000,000.  2  The ratio of the percent age of total intangible assets for current media rights to the percent age o f total intangible assets for the remaining intangible assets.   12 Original Allocation $12,500,000 $ 2,000,000 $ 500,000  Assets  Step-up Computation $12,500,000 + ($3,855,076 * ($12,500,000/$15,000,000)) $2,000,000 + ($3,855,076 * ($2,000,000/$15,000,000)) $500,000 + ($3,855,076  ($3,212,563 + $514,010))  Step- Up  Revised Allocation  National TV Current Local TV Current Local Radio Current Group Total  $3,212,563 $15,712,563 $ 514,010 $ 2,514,010 $ 128,503 $ 628,503  $15,000,000  $18,855,076  b.  Future Media Rights Gross Step- up Amount is $ 3,855,076. This amount is calculated by subtracti ng from the portion of the $57,708,076 to be allocated to future media rights the original allocation to future media rights . The portion of the $57,708,233 to be allocated to future media rights is $18,855,076, the product of (10.475%/32.06%) 3 * $57,708,233. The original allocation to future media rights was $15,000,000. Thus, the gross step- up amount of $3,855,076 is $18,855,076 minus $15,000,000. The $ 3,855,0 76 is made up of a $3,001,919 reallocation from franchise, etc. (as determined below) plus $853,157 of additional step-up ( the difference between the $ 3,855,076 gross step- up amount and the $3,001,919 reallocation form franchise, etc.).

This amount reflects the reallocation from franchise, etc. to future media rights.

Introduction The Internal Revenue Bulletin is the authoritative instrument of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue for announcing official rulings and procedures of the Internal Revenue Service and for publishing Treasury Decisions, Executive Orders, Tax Conventions, legislation, court decisions, and other items of general interest. It is published weekly and may be obtained from the Superintendent of Documents on a subscription basis. Bulletin contents are consolidated semiannually into Cumulative Bulletins, which are sold on a single-copy basis. It is the policy of the Service to publish in the Bulletin all substantive rulings necessary to promote a uniform application of the tax laws, including all rulings that supersede, revoke, modify, or amend any of those previously published in the Bulletin. All published rulings apply retroactively unless otherwise indicated. Procedures relating solely to matters of internal management are not published; however, statements of internal practices and procedures that affect the rights and duties of taxpayers are published. Revenue rulings represent the conclusions of the Service on the application of the law to the pivotal facts stated in the revenue ruling. In those based on positions taken in rulings to taxpayers or technical advice to Service field offices, identifying details and information of a confidential nature are deleted to prevent unwarranted invasions of privacy and to comply with statutory requirements. Rulings and procedures reported in the Bulletin do not have the force and effect of Treasury Department Regulations, but they may be used as precedents. Unpublished rulings will not be relied on, used, or cited as precedents by Service personnel in the disposition of other cases. In applying published rulings and procedures, the effect of subsequent legislation, regulations, court decisions, rulings, and procedures must be considered, and Service personnel and others concerned are cautioned against reaching the same conclusions in other cases unless the facts and circumstances are substantially the same. The Bulletin is divided into four parts as follows: Part I.--1986 Code. This part includes rulings and decisions based on provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Part II.--Treaties and Tax Legislation. This part is divided into two subparts as follows: Subpart A, Tax Conventions, and Subpart B, Legislation and Related Committee Reports. Part III.--Administrative, Procedural, and Miscellaneous. To the extent practicable, per tinent cross references to these subjects are contained in the other Parts and Subparts. Also included in this part are Bank Secrecy Act Administrative Rulings. Bank Secrecy Act Administrative Rulings are issued by the Department of the Treasury's Office of the Assistant Secretary (Enforcement). Part IV.--Items of General Interest. This part includes notices of proposed rulemakings, disbarment and suspension lists, and announcements. The first Bulletin for each month includes a cumulative index for the matters published during the preceding months. These monthly indexes are cumulated on a semiannual basis, and are published in the first Bulletin of the succeeding semiannual period, respectively.  The contents of this publication are not copyrighted and may be reprinted freely. A citation of the Internal Revenue Bulletin as the source would be appropriate.

T.D. 8933 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 26 CFR Parts 1 and 602 Qualified Transportation Fringe Benefits AGENCY: Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury. ACTION: Final regulation. SUMMARY: This document contains final regulations relating to qualified transportation fringe benefits. These final regulations provide rules to ensure that transportation benefits provided to employees are excludable from gross income. These final regulations reflect changes to the law made by the Energy Policy Act of 1992, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, and the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century. These final regulations affect employers that offer qualified transportation fringes and employees who receive these benefits. DATES: Effective Date: These regulations are effective January 11, 2001. Applicability Date: For dates of applicability, see 1.1329(b), Q/A25. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John Richards, (202) 622-6040 (not a toll-free number). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Paperwork Reduction Act The collection of information contained in these final regulations has been reviewed and approved by the Office of Management and Budget in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of  1995 (44 U.S.C. 3507) under control number 15451676. Responses to this collection of information are mandatory to obtain the benefit described under section 132(f). An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a valid control number assigned by the Office of Management and Budget. The estimated average annual recordkeeping burden per recordkeeper is 26.5 hours. The estimated annual reporting burden per respondent is .8 hours. Comments concerning the accuracy of this burden estimate and suggestions for reducing this burden should be sent to the Internal Revenue Service, Attn: IRS Reports Clearance Officer, W:CAR: MP:FP:S:O, Washington, DC 20224, and to the Office of Management and Budget, Attn: Desk Officer for the Department of the Treasury, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503. Books or records relating to a collection of information must be retained as long as their contents might become material in the administration of any internal revenue law. Generally, tax returns and tax return information are confidential, as required by 26 U.S.C. 6103. Background This document contains amendments to 26 CFR part 1 (Income Tax Regulations). On January 27, 2000, a proposed regulation (REG11357299, 20007 I.R.B. 624) relating to qualified transportation fringes was published in the Federal Register (65 FR 4388). A public hearing was held on June 1, 2000. Written or electronic comments responding to the notice of proposed rulemaking were received. After consideration of all the comments, the proposed regulations are adopted as amended by this Treasury decision. The revisions are discussed below. Explanation of Provisions and Summary of Comments In general, comments received on the proposed regulations were favorable and, accordingly, the final regulations retain the general structure of the proposed reg-  ulations, including the question and answer format and a variety of examples illustrating the substance of the final regulations. However, commentators made a number of specific recommendations for modifications and clarifications of the regulations. In response to these comments, the final regulations incorporate the modifications and clarifications described below. A. Whether Vouchers are Readily Available Section 132(f)(3) provides that qualified transportation fringes include cash reimbursement for transit passes ""only if a voucher or similar item which may be exchanged only for a transit pass is not readily available for direct distribution by the employer to the employee."" Thus, if vouchers are readily available, the employer must use vouchers and cash reimbursement of a mass transit expense would not be a qualified transportation fringe. Most of the comments received addressed the issue of whether vouchers are ""readily available."" Commentators representing employers generally favored rules permitting cash reimbursement. Commentators representing transit operators and voucher providers generally favored rules not permitting cash reimbursement. The following discusses three issues raised by commentators: first, whether the proposed regulations' 1 percent safe harbor should be retained; second, whether internal administrative costs should be considered in applying the 1 percent test; and third, whether other nonfinancial restrictions should be considered in determining whether vouchers are readily available. 1. The 1 percent safe harbor Under Notice 943, 19941 C.B. 327, and the proposed regulations, a voucher is readily available if an employer can obtain it on terms no less favorable than those available to an individual employee and without incurring a significant administrative cost. Under the proposed regulations, administrative costs relate only to fees paid to fare media providers, and the determination of whether obtaining a  March 12, 2001  794  200111 I.R.B.   voucher would result in a significant administrative cost is made with respect to each transit system voucher. The proposed regulations provide a rule under which administrative costs are treated as significant if the average monthly administrative costs incurred by the employer for a voucher (disregarding delivery charges imposed by the fare media provider to the extent not in excess of $15 per order) are more than 1 percent of the average monthly value of the vouchers for a system. Commentators, in particular those representing fare media providers and transit operators, suggested that the fare media provider fee percentage causing vouchers to not be readily available should be raised because many fare media providers charge fees in excess of the 1 percent limit and, thus, under this test, transit vouchers would not be considered readily available in some large metropolitan areas. These commentators assert that the 1 percent test is therefore contrary to the intent of the statute. Commentators suggested that the 1 percent test, particularly if combined with inadequate cash reimbursement substantiation requirements, may result in taxpayer abuse, with the result that the benefit might not be used for the purpose for which it is intended, which is to increase the use of mass transit. In addition, commentators testified at the public hearing that the mandatory use of vouchers (with no ability to use cash reimbursement if vouchers are readily available) would increase the use of vouchers and promote the development of advanced technologies that minimize the burden on employers while ensuring that the benefit is used for mass transit. These new technologies might allow an employer to make payment directly to the transit operator, who in turn credits fare to the employee's magnetic media fare card, thus eliminating the need for employers to incur the expense of distributing vouchers. Other commentators, in particular groups representing employers, generally favored the 1 percent test, but suggested that internal costs be considered in applying the test (discussed below). These commentators took the position that an increase in the percentage might affect the market charge for such services. There was also a concern that a strict voucher-  use requirement would result in fewer employers adopting transit pass programs, thus frustrating the purpose of section 132(f) to increase the use of mass transit. The final regulations retain the 1 percent test. The 1 percent test, applicable for years beginning after December 31, 2003, is appropriate in light of the rule (discussed below) that only voucher provider fees are considered in determining availability. It is intended that the delayed application of this rule would provide sufficient time for those affected by this rule to modify their systems and procedures appropriately. The 1 percent threshold, coupled with the exclusion of internal administrative costs from the readily available determination, represents a balanced approach that will promote the growth of voucher programs in most transportation areas. In addition, raising the percentage threshold could curtail the growth in transit benefit programs, which would be contrary to the goal of increasing the use of mass transit. Finally, in cases where cash reimbursement is allowed, adequate substantiation requirements will ensure that transit pass benefits will actually go toward mass transportation usage. In this regard, the proposed regulations provide that employers must implement reasonable procedures to ensure that an amount equal to the reimbursement was incurred for transit passes. For example, the final regulations clarify that in circumstances when employee certification is a reasonable reimbursement procedure, it must occur after the expense is incurred. The final regulations also clarify the application of the 1 percent rule if multiple vouchers for a transit system are available for distribution by an employer to employees, and if multiple transit system vouchers are required in an area to meet the transit needs of an employer 's employees. The final regulations provide that if multiple transit system vouchers are available for direct distribution to employees, the employer must consider the lowest cost voucher for purposes of determining whether the voucher provider fees cause vouchers to not be readily available. However, if multiple vouchers are required in an area to meet the transit needs of the individual employees in that area, the employer has the option of averaging the costs applied to vouchers from  each system for purposes of determining whether the voucher provider fees cause vouchers to not be readily available. 2. Internal administrative costs Several commentators representing employers recommended that, in addition to fare media provider fees, internal administrative costs, especially security and distribution costs, should be considered in determining whether vouchers are readily available. These commentators noted that administrative costs are increased when an employer must maintain both a voucher system and a reimbursement system to provide qualified transportation fringes. For example, the employer may maintain a cash reimbursement system for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and qualified parking, and also maintain a voucher system for transit passes. In addition, several commentators suggested that the increased costs and administrative burden for employers that maintain offices in multiple cities should also be considered in determining whether vouchers are readily available. The final regulations retain the test considering only fees paid to voucher providers in determining availability based on a plain reading of the terms of the statute. The language ""readily available for direct distribution by the employer to the employee"" under section 132(f)(3) in its plain, ordinary sense means that vouchers are easily obtainable for direct distribution to the employer 's employees. The determination of availability bears no relationship with costs that may be incurred after vouchers have been obtained. The service fees charged by voucher providers and delivery costs can reasonably be viewed as affecting whether vouchers are easily obtainable; an employer 's internal costs of subsequently administering a voucher program would not. Thus, based upon the plain language of section 132(f), internal administrative costs do not affect whether vouchers are readily available. Moreover, the test considering only voucher provider fees is a comparatively simple bright line test. A test that depends on the employer 's internal administrative costs would necessarily be complex, requiring complex rules that would be difficult for employers to apply.  200111 I.R.B.  795  March 12, 2001   3. Other nonfinancial restrictions Commentators representing employers suggested that nonfinancial factors should be considered in determining whether vouchers are readily available. They suggested that factors such as whether there are reasonable advance purchase and minimum purchase requirements, and whether vouchers can be purchased in appropriate denominations, should be considered in determining availability. The final regulations adopt this suggestion because nonfinancial restrictions would reasonably affect whether vouchers are available for distribution by an employer to an employee. The final regulations provide guidance on the types of nonfinancial restrictions that cause vouchers to not be readily available. The final regulations provide that certain nonfinancial restrictions, such as a voucher provider not making vouchers available for purchase at reasonable intervals or failing to provide the vouchers within a reasonable period after receiving payment for the voucher, cause vouchers to not be readily available. In addition, if a voucher provider does not provide vouchers in reasonably appropriate quantities, or in reasonably appropriate denominations, vouchers may not be readily available. When and as the standards in these final regulations go into effect, they will supercede the current law standards in Notice 943. B. Advance Transit Passes Commentators suggested that the administrability of transit pass programs would be improved if vouchers were permitted to be distributed in advance for more than one month. The final regulations adopt this suggestion. In October of this year, the IRS issued Announcement 200078 (200043 I.R.B. 428) to notify taxpayers that, when finalized, the regulations will clarify that transit passes may be distributed in advance for more than one month (such as for a calendar quarter) by taking into account the monthly limits for all months for which the transit passes are distributed. The announcement further provides, however, that if an employee receives advance transit passes, and the employee's  employment terminates before the beginning of the last month of the period for which the transit passes were provided, the employer must include in the employee's wages, for income and for employment tax purposes (FICA, FUTA, and income tax withholding), the value of the passes provided for those month(s) beginning after the employee's employment terminates to the extent the employer does not recover those transit passes or the value of those passes. The announcement provides that pending the issuance of these final regulations, employers may rely on the announcement. The final regulations differ from the announcement in one respect. In any case in which transit passes are provided in advance for a period of no more than three months (such as for a calendar quarter), but the recipient ceases to be an employee before the beginning of the last month in that period, the final regulations provide that the value of a transit pass provided in advance for a month is excluded from wages for employment tax (FICA, FUTA, and income tax withholding) purposes (but not for income tax purposes) unless at the time the transit passes were distributed there was an established termination date that was before the beginning of the last month of that period and the employee does in fact terminate employment before the beginning of the last month of that period. C. Qualified Parking The final regulations address whether reimbursement paid to an employee for parking at a work location away from the employee's permanent work location is excludable from wages for income and employment tax purposes under section 132(f). Section 132(f)(5)(C) defines qualified parking, in part, as ""parking provided to an employee on or near the business premises of the employer . . . ."" The final regulations provide that qualified parking includes parking on or near a work location at which the employee performs services for the employer. However, qualified parking does not include reimbursement for parking that is otherwise excludable from gross income as a reimbursement treated as paid under an accountable plan under 1.622 of the Income Tax Regulations, or parking pro-  vided in kind to an employee that is excludable from the employee's gross income as a working condition fringe under section 132(a)(3). Thus, if the exclusion at 1.622 or section 132(a)(3) is available (even if not reimbursed by the employer), then section 132(f) does not apply. Whether a reimbursement for local transportation expenses, including parking at a work location away from the employee's permanent work location, is excludable from the employee's gross income under 1.622, or whether parking provided in kind to an employee is excludable from the employee's gross income under section 132(a)(3), is determined based upon whether the parking expenses would be deductible if paid or incurred by the employee under section 162(a) as an expense incurred in the employee's trade or business of being an employee for the employer. 1.622(d); 1.1325(a)(2). Revenue Ruling 997 (19991 C.B. 361) addresses under what circumstances daily transportation expenses, including parking, incurred by a taxpayer in going between the taxpayer 's residence and a work location are deductible by the taxpayer under section 162(a). The final regulations provide the minimum requirements to ensure that transportation benefits are qualified transportation fringes under section 132(f). An employer may have a transit benefit program that is more restrictive than a program meeting the minimum requirements under the regulations. In addition, these regulations do not affect the application of authorities outside the Internal Revenue Code which may restrict a transportation benefit program. Federal Government agencies, for example, may be required by other federal law to implement restrictions beyond those required under these regulations. D. Applicability Date The regulations are generally applicable for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2001. However, in order to provide a transition period for those affected by the 1 percent rule (described under ""The 1 percent safe harbor"" in this preamble), that rule is applicable for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2003.  March 12, 2001  796  200111 I.R.B.   Effect on Other Documents The following document is obsolete as of January 11, 2001: Announcement 200078 (200043 I.R.B. 428). The following document is modified as of the date these regulations become applicable (see Q/A25): Notice 943 (19941 C.B. 327). Special Analyses It has been determined that this Treasury Decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) does not apply to these regulations. A final regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared for the collection of information in this Treasury decision under 5 U.S.C. 604. A summary of the analysis is set forth in this preamble under the heading ""Summary of Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis."" Summary of Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis This analysis is required under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6). The collection of information under this rule is based upon the requirements under section 132(f). We estimate that approximately 265,000 employers that provide qualified transportation fringes to their employees will be affected by the recordkeeping requirements of this rule. None of the comments received in response to the notice of proposed rulemaking specifically addressed the initial regulatory flexibility analysis. Section 132(f)(3) provides that qualified transportation fringes may be provided in the form of cash reimbursement. The legislative history indicates that an employer providing cash reimbursement to the employer 's employees for qualified transportation fringes must establish a bona fide reimbursement arrangement. As a condition to providing cash reimbursement for qualified transportation fringes, this rule provides that employers must receive substantiation from employees. The objective of this rule is to ensure that reimbursements are made for qualified transportation fringes.  Whether an arrangement constitutes a bona fide reimbursement arrangement varies depending on the facts and circumstances, including the method or methods of payment utilized within a mass transit system. An employee certification in either written or electronic form may be sufficient depending upon the facts and circumstances. For example, if receipts are not provided in the ordinary course of business, such as with respect to metered parking or used transit passes that cannot be returned to the user, an employee certification that expenses have been incurred constitutes a reasonable reimbursement procedure. A certification that expenses will be incurred in the future, by itself, is not a reasonable reimbursement procedure. There are no particular professional skills required to maintain these records. In addition, section 132(f)(4) provides that an employee may choose between cash compensation and qualified transportation fringes. This rule provides that an employer may allow an employee the choice to receive either a fixed amount of cash compensation at a specified future date or a fixed amount of qualified transportation fringes to be provided for a specified future period (such as qualified parking to be used during a future calendar month). This rule provides that employers must keep records with respect to employee compensation reduction elections. An employee's election must be in writing or some other permanent and verifiable form, and include the date of the election, the amount of compensation to be reduced, and the period for which the qualified transportation fringes will be provided. The objective of this rule is to ensure against recharacterization of taxable compensation after it has been paid to the employee. There are no particular professional skills required to maintain these records. A less burdensome alternative for small organizations would be to exempt those entities from the recordkeeping requirements under this rule. However, it would be inconsistent with the statutory provisions and legislative history to exempt those entities from the recordkeeping requirements imposed under this rule. This rule provides several options which avoid more burdensome recordkeeping requirements for small entities.  This rule provides that (1) there are no substantiation requirements if the employer distributes transit passes in kind; (2) a compensation reduction election may be made electronically; (3) an election to reduce compensation may be automatically renewed; (4) an employer may provide for deemed compensation reduction elections under its qualified transportation fringe benefit plan; and (5) a requirement that a voucher be distributed in-kind by the employer is satisfied if the voucher is distributed by the employer or by another person on behalf of the employer (for example, if a transit operator credits amounts to the employee's fare card as a result of payments made to the operator by the employer). Drafting Information The principal author of these regulations is John Richards, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel (Exempt Organizations/Employment Tax/Government Entities). However, other personnel from the IRS and Treasury Department participated in their development. ***** Adoption of Amendments to the Regulations Accordingly, 26 CFR parts 1 and 602 are amended as follows: PART I--INCOME TAXES Paragraph 1.

What is the effective date of this section? (b) Questions and answers.  Q-1. What is a qualified transportation fringe? A-1. (a) The following benefits are qualified transportation fringe benefits: (1) Transportation in a commuter highway vehicle. (2) Transit passes. (3) Qualified parking. (b) An employer may simultaneously provide an employee with any one or more of these three benefits. Q-2. What is transportation in a commuter highway vehicle? A-2. Transportation in a commuter highway vehicle is transportation provided by an employer to an employee in connection with travel between the employee's residence and place of employment. A commuter highway vehicle is a highway vehicle with a seating capacity of at least 6 adults (excluding the driver) and with respect to which at least 80 percent of the vehicle's mileage for a year is reasonably expected to be-- (a) For transporting employees in connection with travel between their residences and their place of employment; and (b) On trips during which the number of employees transported for commuting is at least one-half of the adult seating capacity of the vehicle (excluding the driver). Q-3. What are transit passes? A-3. A transit pass is any pass, token, farecard, voucher, or similar item (including an item exchangeable for fare media) that entitles a person to transportation-- (a) On mass transit facilities (whether or not publicly owned); or (b) Provided by any person in the business of transporting persons for compensation or hire in a highway vehicle with a seating capacity of at least 6 adults (excluding the driver). Q-4. What is qualified parking? A-4. (a) Qualified parking is parking provided to an employee by an employer-- (1) On or near the employer 's business premises; or (2) At a location from which the employee commutes to work (including commuting by carpool, commuter highway vehicle, mass transit facilities, or transportation provided by any person in the business of transporting persons for compensation or hire).  March 12, 2001  798  200111 I.R.B.   (b) For purposes of section 132(f), parking on or near the employer 's business premises includes parking on or near a work location at which the employee provides services for the employer. However, qualified parking does not include-- (1) The value of parking provided to an employee that is excludable from gross income under section 132(a)(3) (as a working condition fringe), or (2) Reimbursement paid to an employee for parking costs that is excludable from gross income as an amount treated as paid under an accountable plan. See 1.622. (c) However, parking on or near property used by the employee for residential purposes is not qualified parking. (d) Parking is provided by an employer if-- (1) The parking is on property that the employer owns or leases; (2) The employer pays for the parking; or (3) The employer reimburses the employee for parking expenses (see Q/A16 of this section for rules relating to cash reimbursements). Q-5. May qualified transportation fringes be provided to individuals who are not employees? A-5. An employer may provide qualified transportation fringes only to individuals who are currently employees of the employer at the time the qualified transportation fringe is provided. The term employee for purposes of qualified transportation fringes is defined in 1.1321(b)(2)(i). This term includes only common law employees and other statutory employees, such as officers of corporations. See Q/A-24 of this section for rules regarding partners, 2-percent shareholders, and independent contractors. Q-6. Must a qualified transportation fringe benefit plan be in writing? A-6. No. Section 132(f) does not require that a qualified transportation fringe benefit plan be in writing. Q-7. Is there a limit on the value of qualified transportation fringes that may be excluded from an employee's gross income? A-7. (a) Transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and transit passes. Before January 1, 2002, up to $65 per  month is excludable from the gross income of an employee for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and transit passes provided by an employer. On January 1, 2002, this amount is increased to $100 per month. (b) Parking. Up to $175 per month is excludable from the gross income of an employee for qualified parking. (c) Combination. An employer may provide qualified parking benefits in addition to transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and transit passes. (d) Cost-of-living adjustments. The amounts in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Q/A-7 are adjusted annually, beginning with 2000, to reflect cost-of-living. The adjusted figures are announced by the Service before the beginning of the year. Q-8. What amount is includible in an employee's wages for income and employment tax purposes if the value of the qualified transportation fringe exceeds the applicable statutory monthly limit? A-8. (a) Generally, an employee must include in gross income the amount by which the fair market value of the benefit exceeds the sum of the amount, if any, paid by the employee and any amount excluded from gross income under section 132(a)(5). Thus, assuming no other statutory exclusion applies, if an employer provides an employee with a qualified transportation fringe that exceeds the applicable statutory monthly limit and the employee does not make any payment, the value of the benefits provided in excess of the applicable statutory monthly limit is included in the employee's wages for income and employment tax purposes. See 1.6121(b)(1). (b) The following examples illustrate the principles of this Q/A-8: Example 1. (i) For each month in a year in which the statutory monthly transit pass limit is $100 (i.e., a year after 2001), Employer M provides a transit pass valued at $110 to Employee D, who does not pay any amount to Employer M for the transit pass. (ii) In this Example 1, because the value of the monthly transit pass exceeds the statutory monthly limit by $10, $120 ($110 - $100, times 12 months) must be included in D's wages for income and employment tax purposes for the year with respect to the transit passes. Example 2. (i) For each month in a year in which the statutory monthly qualified parking limit is $175, Employer M provides qualified parking valued at $195 to Employee E, who does not pay any amount to M for the parking. (ii) In this Example 2, because the fair market value of the qualified parking exceeds the statutory  monthly limit by $20, $240 ($195 - $175, times 12 months) must be included in Employee E's wages for income and employment tax purposes for the year with respect to the qualified parking. Example 3. (i) For each month in a year in which the statutory monthly qualified parking limit is $175, Employer P provides qualified parking with a fair market value of $220 per month to its employees, but charges each employee $45 per month. (ii) In this Example 3, because the sum of the amount paid by an employee ($45) plus the amount excludable for qualified parking ($175) is not less than the fair market value of the monthly benefit, no amount is includible in the employee's wages for income and employment tax purposes with respect to the qualified parking.  Q-9. Are excludable qualified transportation fringes calculated on a monthly basis? A-9. (a) In general. Yes. The value of transportation in a commuter highway vehicle, transit passes, and qualified parking is calculated on a monthly basis to determine whether the value of the benefit has exceeded the applicable statutory monthly limit on qualified transportation fringes. Except in the case of a transit pass provided to an employee, the applicable statutory monthly limit applies to qualified transportation fringes used by the employee in a month. Monthly exclusion amounts are not combined to provide a qualified transportation fringe for any month exceeding the statutory limit. A month is a calendar month or a substantially equivalent period applied consistently. (b) Transit passes. In the case of transit passes provided to an employee, the applicable statutory monthly limit applies to the transit passes provided by the employer to the employee in a month for that month or for any previous month in the calendar year. In addition, transit passes distributed in advance for more than one month, but not for more than twelve months, are qualified transportation fringes if the requirements in paragraph (c) of this Q/A-9 are met (relating to the income tax and employment tax treatment of advance transit passes). The applicable statutory monthly limit under section 132(f)(2) on the combined amount of transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and transit passes may be calculated by taking into account the monthly limits for all months for which the transit passes are distributed. In the case of a pass that is valid for more than one month, such as an annual pass, the value of the  200111 I.R.B.  799  March 12, 2001   pass may be divided by the number of months for which it is valid for purposes of determining whether the value of the pass exceeds the statutory monthly limit. (c) Rule if employee's employment terminates-- (1) income tax treatment. The value of transit passes provided in advance to an employee with respect to a month in which the individual is not an employee is included in the employee's wages for income tax purposes. (2) Reporting and employment tax treatment. Transit passes distributed in advance to an employee are excludable from wages for employment tax purposes under sections 3121, 3306, and 3401 (FICA, FUTA, and income tax withholding) if the employer distributes transit passes to the employee in advance for not more than three months and, at the time the transit passes are distributed, there is not an established date that the employee's employment will terminate (for example, if the employee has given notice of retirement) which will occur before the beginning of the last month of the period for which the transit passes are provided. If the employer distributes transit passes to an employee in advance for not more than three months and at the time the transit passes are distributed there is an established date that the employee's employment will terminate, and the employee's employment does terminate before the beginning of the last month of the period for which the transit passes are provided, the value of transit passes provided for months beginning after the date of termination during which the employee is not employed by the employer is included in the employee's wages for employment tax purposes. If transit passes are distributed in advance for more than three months, the value of transit passes provided for the months during which the employee is not employed by the employer is includible in the employee's wages for employment tax purposes regardless of whether at the time the transit passes were distributed there was an established date of termination of the employee's employment. (d) Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of this Q/A-9: Example 1. (i) Employee E incurs $150 for qualified parking used during the month of June of a year in which the statutory monthly parking limit is $175, for which E is reimbursed $150 by Employer R. Employee E incurs $180 in expenses for qualified parking used during the month of July of that year, for which E is reimbursed $180 by Employer R.  (ii) In this Example 1, because monthly exclusion amounts may not be combined to provide a benefit in any month greater than the applicable statutory limit, the amount by which the amount reimbursed for July exceeds the applicable statutory monthly limit ($180 minus $175 equals $5) is includible in Employee E's wages for income and employment tax purposes. Example 2. (i) Employee F receives transit passes from Employer G with a value of $195 in March of a year (for which the statutory monthly transit pass limit is $65) for January, February, and March of that year. F was hired during January and has not received any transit passes from G. (ii) In this Example 2, the value of the transit passes (three months times $65 equals $195) is excludable from F's wages for income and employment tax purposes. Example 3. (i) Employer S has a qualified transportation fringe benefit plan under which its employees receive transit passes near the beginning of each calendar quarter for that calendar quarter. All employees of Employer S receive transit passes from Employer S with a value of $195 on March 31 for the second calendar quarter covering the months April, May, and June (of a year in which the statutory monthly transit pass limit is $65). (ii) In this Example 3, because the value of the transit passes may be calculated by taking into account the monthly limits for all months for which the transit passes are distributed, the value of the transit passes (three months times $65 equals $195) is excludable from the employees' wages for income and employment tax purposes. Example 4. (i) Same facts as in Example 3, except that Employee T, an employee of Employer S, terminates employment with S on May 31. There was not an established date of termination for Employee T at the time the transit passes were distributed. (ii) In this Example 4, because at the time the transit passes were distributed there was not an established date of termination for Employee T, the value of the transit passes provided for June ($65) is excludable from T's wages for employment tax purposes. However, the value of the transit passes distributed to Employee T for June ($65) is not excludable from T's wages for income tax purposes. (iii) If Employee T's May 31 termination date was established at the time the transit passes were provided, the value of the transit passes provided for June ($65) is included in T's wages for both income and employment tax purposes. Example 5. (i) Employer F has a qualified transportation fringe benefit plan under which its employees receive transit passes semi-annually in advance of the months for which the transit passes are provided. All employees of Employer F, including Employee X, receive transit passes from F with a value of $390 on June 30 for the 6 months of July through December (of a year in which the statutory monthly transit pass limit is $65). Employee X's employment terminates and his last day of work is August 1. Employer F's other employees remain employed throughout the remainder of the year. (ii) In this Example 5, the value of the transit passes provided to Employee X for the months September, October, November, and December ($65 times 4 months equals $260) of the year is included  in X's wages for income and employment tax purposes. The value of the transit passes provided to Employer F's other employees is excludable from the employees' wages for income and employment tax purposes. Example 6. (i) Each month during a year in which the statutory monthly transit pass limit is $65, Employer R distributes transit passes with a face amount of $70 to each of its employees. Transit passes with a face amount of $70 can be purchased from the transit system by any individual for $65. (ii) In this Example 6, because the value of the transit passes distributed by Employer R does not exceed the applicable statutory monthly limit ($65), no portion of the value of the transit passes is included as wages for income and employment tax purposes.  Q-10. May an employee receive qualified transportation fringes from more than one employer? A-10. (a) General rule. Yes. The statutory monthly limits described in Q/A-7 of this section apply to benefits provided by an employer to its employees. For this purpose, all employees treated as employed by a single employer under section 414(b), (c), (m), or (o) are treated as employed by a single employer. See section 414(t) and 1.1321(c). Thus, qualified transportation fringes paid by entities under common control under section 414(b), (c), (m), or (o) are combined for purposes of applying the applicable statutory monthly limit. In addition, an individual who is treated as a leased employee of the employer under section 414(n) is treated as an employee of that employer for purposes of section 132. See section 414(n)(3)(C). (b) Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of this Q/A-10: Example 1. (i) During a year in which the statutory monthly qualified parking limit is $175, Employee E works for Employers M and N, who are unrelated and not treated as a single employer under section 414(b), (c), (m), or (o). Each month, M and N each provide qualified parking benefits to E with a value of $100. (ii) In this Example 1, because M and N are unrelated employers, and the value of the monthly parking benefit provided by each is not more than the applicable statutory monthly limit, the parking benefits provided by each employer are excludable as qualified transportation fringes assuming that the other requirements of this section are satisfied. Example 2. (i) Same facts as in Example 1, except that Employers M and N are treated as a single employer under section 414(b). (ii) In this Example 2, because M and N are treated as a single employer, the value of the monthly parking benefit provided by M and N must be combined for purposes of determining whether the applicable statutory monthly limit has been exceeded. Thus, the amount by which the value of the park-  March 12, 2001  800  200111 I.R.B.   ing benefit exceeds the monthly limit ($200 minus the monthly limit amount of $175 equals $25) for each month in the year is includible in E's wages for income and employment tax purposes.  Q-11. May qualified transportation fringes be provided to employees pursuant to a compensation reduction agreement? A-11. Yes. An employer may offer employees a choice between cash compensation and any qualified transportation fringe. An employee who is offered this choice and who elects qualified transportation fringes is not required to include the cash compensation in income if-- (a) The election is pursuant to an arrangement described in Q/A-12 of this section; (b) The amount of the reduction in cash compensation does not exceed the limitation in Q/A-13 of this section; (c) The arrangement satisfies the timing and reimbursement rules in Q/A-14 and 16 of this section; and (d) The related fringe benefit arrangement otherwise satisfies the requirements set forth elsewhere in this section. Q-12. What is a compensation reduction election for purposes of section 132(f)? A-12. (a) Election requirements generally. A compensation reduction arrangement is an arrangement under which the employer provides the employee with the right to elect whether the employee will receive either a fixed amount of cash compensation at a specified future date or a fixed amount of qualified transportation fringes to be provided for a specified future period (such as qualified parking to be used during a future calendar month). The employee's election must be in writing or another form, such as electronic, that includes, in a permanent and verifiable form, the information required to be in the election. The election must contain the date of the election, the amount of the compensation to be reduced, and the period for which the benefit will be provided. The election must relate to a fixed dollar amount or fixed percentage of compensation reduction. An election to reduce compensation for a period by a set amount for such period may be automatically renewed for subsequent periods. (b) Automatic election permitted. An employer may provide under its qualified transportation fringe benefit plan that a compensation reduction election will be  deemed to have been made if the employee does not elect to receive cash compensation in lieu of the qualified transportation fringe, provided that the employee receives adequate notice that a compensation reduction will be made and is given adequate opportunity to choose to receive the cash compensation instead of the qualified transportation fringe. Q13. Is there a limit to the amount of the compensation reduction? A13. Yes. Each month, the amount of the compensation reduction may not exceed the combined applicable statutory monthly limits for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle, transit passes, and qualified parking. For example, for a year in which the statutory monthly limit is $65 for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and transit passes, and $175 for qualified parking, an employee could elect to reduce compensation for any month by no more than $240 ($65 plus $175) with respect to qualified transportation fringes. If an employee were to elect to reduce compensation by $250 for a month, the excess $10 ($250 minus $240) would be includible in the employee's wages for income and employment tax purposes. Q14. When must the employee have made a compensation reduction election and under what circumstances may the amount be paid in cash to the employee? A14. (a) The compensation reduction election must satisfy the requirements set forth under paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this Q/A-14. (b) Timing of election. The compensation reduction election must be made before the employee is able currently to receive the cash or other taxable amount at the employee's discretion. The determination of whether the employee is able currently to receive the cash does not depend on whether it has been constructively received for purposes of section 451. The election must specify that the period (such as a calendar month) for which the qualified transportation fringe will be provided must not begin before the election is made. Thus, a compensation reduction election must relate to qualified transportation fringes to be provided after the election. For this purpose, the date a qualified transportation fringe is provided is-- (1) The date the employee receives a voucher or similar item; or  (2) In any other case, the date the employee uses the qualified transportation fringe. (c) Revocability of elections. The employee may not revoke a compensation reduction election after the employee is able currently to receive the cash or other taxable amount at the employee's discretion. In addition, the election may not be revoked after the beginning of the period for which the qualified transportation fringe will be provided. (d) Compensation reduction amounts not refundable. Unless an election is revoked in a manner consistent with paragraph (c) of this Q/A-14, an employee may not subsequently receive the compensation (in cash or any form other than by payment of a qualified transportation fringe under the employer 's plan). Thus, an employer 's qualified transportation fringe benefit plan may not provide that an employee who ceases to participate in the employer 's qualified transportation fringe benefit plan (such as in the case of termination of employment) is entitled to receive a refund of the amount by which the employee's compensation reductions exceed the actual qualified transportation fringes provided to the employee by the employer. (e) Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of this Q/A-14: Example 1. (i) Employer P maintains a qualified transportation fringe benefit arrangement during a year in which the statutory monthly limit is $100 for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and transit passes (2002 or later) and $180 for qualified parking. Employees of P are paid cash compensation twice per month, with the payroll dates being the first and the fifteenth day of the month. Under P's arrangement, an employee is permitted to elect at any time before the first day of a month to reduce his or her compensation payable during that month in an amount up to the applicable statutory monthly limit ($100 if the employee elects coverage for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle or a mass transit pass, or $180 if the employee chooses qualified parking) in return for the right to receive qualified transportation fringes up to the amount of the election. If such an election is made, P will provide a mass transit pass for that month with a value not exceeding the compensation reduction amount elected by the employee or will reimburse the cost of other qualified transportation fringes used by the employee on or after the first day of that month up to the compensation reduction amount elected by the employee. Any compensation reduction amount elected by the employee for the month that is not used for qualified transportation fringes is not refunded to the employee at any future date. (ii) In this Example 1, the arrangement satisfies the requirements of this Q/A-14 because the election  200111 I.R.B.  801  March 12, 2001   is made before the employee is able currently to receive the cash and the election specifies the future period for which the qualified transportation fringes will be provided. The arrangement would also satisfy the requirements of this Q/A-14 and Q/A-13 of this section if employees are allowed to elect to reduce compensation up to $280 per month ($100 plus $180). (iii) The arrangement would also satisfy the requirements of this Q/A-14 (and Q/A-13 of this section) if employees are allowed to make an election at any time before the first or the fifteenth day of the month to reduce their compensation payable on that payroll date by an amount not in excess of one-half of the applicable statutory monthly limit (depending on the type of qualified transportation fringe elected by the employee) and P provides a mass transit pass on or after the applicable payroll date for the compensation reduction amount elected by the employee for the payroll date or reimburses the cost of other qualified transportation fringes used by the employee on or after the payroll date up to the compensation reduction amount elected by the employee for that payroll date. Example 2. (i) Employee Q elects to reduce his compensation payable on March 1 of a year (for which the statutory monthly mass transit limit is $65) by $195 in exchange for a mass transit voucher to be provided in March. The election is made on the preceding February 27. Employee Q was hired in January of the year. On March 10 of the year, the employer of Employee Q delivers to Employee Q a mass transit voucher worth $195 for the months of January, February, and March. (ii) In this Example 2, $65 is included in Employee Q's wages for income and employment tax purposes because the compensation reduction election fails to satisfy the requirement in this Q/A14 and Q/A-12 of this section that the period for which the qualified transportation fringe will be provided not begin before the election is made to the extent the election relates to $65 worth of transit passes for January of the year. The $65 for February is not taxable because the election was for a future period that includes at least one day in February. (iii) However, no amount would be included in Employee Q's wages as a result of the election if $195 worth of mass transit passes were instead provided to Q for the months of February, March, and April (because the compensation reduction would relate solely to fringes to be provided for a period not beginning before the date of the election and the amount provided does not exceed the aggregate limit for the period, i.e., the sum of $65 for each of February, March, and April). See Q/A-9 of this section for rules governing transit passes distributed in advance for more than one month. Example 3. (i) Employee R elects to reduce his compensation payable on March 1 of a year (for which the statutory monthly parking limit is $175) by $185 in exchange for reimbursement by Employer T of parking expenses incurred by Employee R for parking on or near Employer T's business premises during the period beginning after the date of the election through March. The election is made on the preceding February 27. Employee R incurs $10 in parking expenses on February 28 of the year, and $175 in parking expenses during the month  of March. On April 5 of the year, Employer T reimburses Employee R $185 for the parking expenses incurred on February 28, and during March, of the year. (ii) In this Example 3, no amount would be includible in Employee R's wages for income and employment tax purposes because the compensation reduction related solely to parking on or near Employer R's business premises used during a period not beginning before the date of the election and the amount reimbursed for parking used in any one month does not exceed the statutory monthly limitation.  Q15. May an employee whose qualified transportation fringe costs are less than the employee's compensation reduction carry over this excess amount to subsequent periods? A15. (a) Yes. An employee may carry over unused compensation reduction amounts to subsequent periods under the plan of the employee's employer. (b) The following example illustrates the principles of this Q/A-15: Example. (i) By an election made before November 1 of a year for which the statutory monthly mass transit limit is $65, Employee E elects to reduce compensation in the amount of $65 for the month of November. E incurs $50 in employeeoperated commuter highway vehicle expenses during November for which E is reimbursed $50 by Employer R, E's employer. By an election made before December, E elects to reduce compensation by $65 for the month of December. E incurs $65 in employee-operated commuter highway vehicle expenses during December for which E is reimbursed $65 by R. Before the following January, E elects to reduce compensation by $50 for the month of January. E incurs $65 in employee-operated commuter highway vehicle expenses during January for which E is reimbursed $65 by R because R allows E to carry over to the next year the $15 amount by which the compensation reductions for November and December exceeded the employee-operated commuter highway vehicle expenses incurred during those months. (ii) In this Example, because Employee E is reimbursed in an amount not exceeding the applicable statutory monthly limit, and the reimbursement does not exceed the amount of employee-operated commuter highway vehicle expenses incurred during the month of January, the amount reimbursed ($65) is excludable from E's wages for income and employment tax purposes.  Q16. How does section 132(f) apply to expense reimbursements? A-16. (a) In general. The term qualified transportation fringe includes cash reimbursement by an employer to an employee for expenses incurred or paid by an employee for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle or qualified parking. The term qualified transportation fringe also includes cash reimburse-  ment for transit passes made under a bona fide reimbursement arrangement, but, in accordance with section 132(f)(3), only if permitted under paragraph (b) of this Q/A-16. The reimbursement must be made under a bona fide reimbursement arrangement which meets the rules of paragraph (c) of this Q/A-16. A payment made before the date an expense has been incurred or paid is not a reimbursement. In addition, a bona fide reimbursement arrangement does not include an arrangement that is dependent solely upon an employee certifying in advance that the employee will incur expenses at some future date. (b) Special rule for transit passes-- (1) In general. The term qualified transportation fringe includes cash reimbursement for transit passes made under a bona fide reimbursement arrangement, but, in accordance with section 132(f)(3), only if no voucher or similar item that may be exchanged only for a transit pass is readily available for direct distribution by the employer to employees. If a voucher is readily available, the requirement that a voucher be distributed in-kind by the employer is satisfied if the voucher is distributed by the employer or by another person on behalf of the employer (for example, if a transit operator credits amounts to the employee's fare card as a result of payments made to the operator by the employer). (2) Voucher or similar item. For purposes of the special rule in paragraph (b) of this Q/A-16, a transit system voucher is an instrument that may be purchased by employers from a voucher provider that is accepted by one or more mass transit operators (e.g., train, subway, and bus) in an area as fare media or in exchange for fare media. Thus, for example, a transit pass that may be purchased by employers directly from a voucher provider is a transit system voucher. (3) Voucher provider. The term voucher provider means any person in the trade or business of selling transit system vouchers to employers, or any transit system or transit operator that sells vouchers to employers for the purpose of direct distribution to employees. Thus, a transit operator might or might not be a voucher provider. A voucher provider is not, for example, a third-party employee benefits  March 12, 2001  802  200111 I.R.B.   administrator that administers a transit pass benefit program for an employer using vouchers that the employer could obtain directly. (4) Readily available. For purposes of this paragraph (b), a voucher or similar item is readily available for direct distribution by the employer to employees if and only if an employer can obtain it from a voucher provider that (i) does not impose fare media charges that cause vouchers to not be readily available as described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section; and (ii) does not impose other restrictions that cause vouchers to not be readily available as described in paragraph (b)(6) of this section. (5) Fare media charges. For purposes of paragraph (b)(4) of this section, fare media charges relate only to fees paid by the employer to voucher providers for vouchers. The determination of whether obtaining a voucher would result in fare media charges that cause vouchers to not be readily available as described in this paragraph (b) is made with respect to each transit system voucher. If more than one transit system voucher is available for direct distribution to employees, the employer must consider the fees imposed for the lowest cost monthly voucher for purposes of determining whether the fees imposed by the voucher provider satisfy this paragraph. However, if transit system vouchers for multiple transit systems are required in an area to meet the transit needs of the individual employees in that area, the employer has the option of averaging the costs applied to each transit system voucher for purposes of determining whether the fare media charges for transit system vouchers satisfy this paragraph. Fare media charges are described in this paragraph (b)(5), and therefore cause vouchers to not be readily available, if and only if the average annual fare media charges that the employer reasonably expects to incur for transit system vouchers purchased from the voucher provider (disregarding reasonable and customary delivery charges imposed by the voucher provider, e.g., not in excess of $15) are more than 1 percent of the average annual value of the vouchers for a transit system. (6) Other restrictions. For purposes of paragraph (b)(4) of this section, restrictions that cause vouchers to not be readily  available are restrictions imposed by the voucher provider other than fare media charges that effectively prevent the employer from obtaining vouchers appropriate for distribution to employees. Examples of such restrictions include-- (i) Advance purchase requirements. Advance purchase requirements cause vouchers to not be readily available only if the voucher provider does not offer vouchers at regular intervals or fails to provide the voucher within a reasonable period after receiving payment for the voucher. For example, a requirement that vouchers may be purchased only once per year may effectively prevent an employer from obtaining vouchers for distribution to employees. An advance purchase requirement that vouchers be purchased not more frequently than monthly does not effectively prevent the employer from obtaining vouchers for distribution to employees. (ii) Purchase quantity requirements. Purchase quantity requirements cause vouchers to not be readily available if the voucher provider does not offer vouchers in quantities that are reasonably appropriate to the number of the employer 's employees who use mass transportation (for example, the voucher provider requires a $1,000 minimum purchase and the employer seeks to purchase only $200 of vouchers). (iii) Limitations on denominations of vouchers that are available. If the voucher provider does not offer vouchers in denominations appropriate for distribution to the employer 's employees, vouchers are not readily available. For example, vouchers provided in $5 increments up to the monthly limit are appropriate for distribution to employees, while vouchers available only in a denomination equal to the monthly limit are not appropriate for distribution to employees if the amount of the benefit provided to the employer 's employees each month is normally less than the monthly limit. (7) Example. The following example illustrates the principles of this paragraph (b): Example. (i) Company C in City X sells mass transit vouchers to employers in the metropolitan area of X in various denominations appropriate for distribution to employees. Employers can purchase vouchers monthly in reasonably appropriate quantities. Several different bus, rail, van pool, and ferry operators service X, and a number of the operators accept  the vouchers either as fare media or in exchange for fare media. To cover its operating expenses, C imposes on each voucher a 50 cents charge, plus a reasonable and customary $15 charge for delivery of each order of vouchers. Employer M disburses vouchers purchased from C to its employees who use operators that accept the vouchers and M reasonably expects that $55 is the average value of the voucher it will purchase from C for the next calendar year. (ii) In this Example, vouchers for X are readily available for direct distribution by the employer to employees because the expected cost of the vouchers disbursed to M's employees for the next calendar year is not more than 1 percent of the value of the vouchers (50 cents divided by $55 equals 0.91 percent), the delivery charges are disregarded because they are reasonable and customary, and there are no other restrictions that cause the vouchers to not be readily available. Thus, any reimbursement of mass transportation costs in X would not be a qualified transportation fringe.  (c) Substantiation requirements. Employers that make cash reimbursements must establish a bona fide reimbursement arrangement to establish that their employees have, in fact, incurred expenses for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle, transit passes, or qualified parking. For purposes of section 132(f), whether cash reimbursements are made under a bona fide reimbursement arrangement may vary depending on the facts and circumstances, including the method or methods of payment utilized within the mass transit system. The employer must implement reasonable procedures to ensure that an amount equal to the reimbursement was incurred for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle, transit passes, or qualified parking. The expense must be substantiated within a reasonable period of time. An expense substantiated to the payor within 180 days after it has been paid will be treated as having been substantiated within a reasonable period of time. An employee certification at the time of reimbursement in either written or electronic form may be a reasonable reimbursement procedure depending on the facts and circumstances. Examples of reasonable reimbursement procedures are set forth in paragraph (d) of this Q/A-16. (d) Illustrations of reasonable reimbursement procedures. The following are examples of reasonable reimbursement procedures for purposes of paragraph (c) of this Q/A-16. In each case, the reimbursement is made at or within a reasonable period after the end of the events described in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(3) of this section.  200111 I.R.B.  803  March 12, 2001   (1) An employee presents to the employer a parking expense receipt for parking on or near the employer 's business premises, the employee certifies that the parking was used by the employee, and the employer has no reason to doubt the employee's certification. (2) An employee either submits a used time-sensitive transit pass (such as a monthly pass) to the employer and certifies that he or she purchased it or presents an unused or used transit pass to the employer and certifies that he or she purchased it and the employee certifies that he or she has not previously been reimbursed for the transit pass. In both cases, the employer has no reason to doubt the employee's certification. (3) If a receipt is not provided in the ordinary course of business (e.g., if the employee uses metered parking or if used transit passes cannot be returned to the user), the employee certifies to the employer the type and the amount of expenses incurred, and the employer has no reason to doubt the employee's certification. Q-17. May an employer provide nontaxable cash reimbursement under section 132(f) for periods longer than one month? A-17. (a) General rule. Yes. Qualified transportation fringes include reimbursement to employees for costs incurred for transportation in more than one month, provided the reimbursement for each month in the period is calculated separately and does not exceed the applicable statutory monthly limit for any month in the period. See Q/A-8 and 9 of this section if the limit for a month is exceeded. (b) Example. The following example illustrates the principles of this Q/A-17: Example. (i) Employee R pays $100 per month for qualified parking used during the period from April 1 through June 30 of a year in which the statutory monthly qualified parking limit is $175. After receiving adequate substantiation from Employee R, R's employer reimburses R $300 in cash on June 30 of that year. (ii) In this Example, because the value of the reimbursed expenses for each month did not exceed the applicable statutory monthly limit, the $300 reimbursement is excludable from R's wages for income and employment tax purposes as a qualified transportation fringe.  Q-18. What are the substantiation requirements if an employer distributes transit passes? A-18. There are no substantiation requirements if the employer distributes  transit passes. Thus, an employer may distribute a transit pass for each month with a value not more than the statutory monthly limit without requiring any certification from the employee regarding the use of the transit pass. Q-19. May an employer choose to impose substantiation requirements in addition to those described in this regulation? A-19. Yes. Q-20. How is the value of parking determined? A-20. Section 1.6121(b)(2) applies for purposes of determining the value of parking. Q-21. How do the qualified transportation fringe rules apply to van pools? A-21. (a) Van pools generally. Employer and employee-operated van pools, as well as private or public transitoperated van pools, may qualify as qualified transportation fringes. The value of van pool benefits which are qualified transportation fringes may be excluded up to the applicable statutory monthly limit for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and transit passes, less the value of any transit passes provided by the employer for the month. (b) Employer-operated van pools. The value of van pool transportation provided by or for an employer to its employees is excludable as a qualified transportation fringe, provided the van qualifies as a commuter highway vehicle as defined in section 132(f)(5)(B) and Q/A-2 of this section. A van pool is operated by or for the employer if the employer purchases or leases vans to enable employees to commute together or the employer contracts with and pays a third party to provide the vans and some or all of the costs of operating the vans, including maintenance, liability insurance and other operating expenses. (c) Employee-operated van pools. Cash reimbursement by an employer to employees for expenses incurred for transportation in a van pool operated by employees independent of their employer are excludable as qualified transportation fringes, provided that the van qualifies as a commuter highway vehicle as defined in section 132(f)(5)(B) and Q/A-2 of this section. See Q/A-16 of this section for the rules governing cash reimbursements. (d) Private or public transit-operated van pool transit passes. The qualified  transportation fringe exclusion for transit passes is available for travel in van pools owned and operated either by public transit authorities or by any person in the business of transporting persons for compensation or hire. In accordance with paragraph (b) of Q/A-3 of this section, the van must seat at least 6 adults (excluding the driver). See Q/A-16(b) and (c) of this section for a special rule for cash reimbursement for transit passes and the substantiation requirements for cash reimbursement. (e) Value of van pool transportation benefits. Section 1.6121(b)(2) provides that the fair market value of a fringe benefit is based on all the facts and circumstances. Alternatively, transportation in an employer-provided commuter highway vehicle may be valued under the automobile lease valuation rule in 1.6121(d), the vehicle cents-per-mile rule in 1.6121(e), or the commuting valuation rule in 1.6121(f). If one of these special valuation rules is used, the employer must use the same valuation rule to value the use of the commuter highway vehicle by each employee who share the use. See 1.6121(c)(2)(i)(B). (f) Qualified parking prime member. If an employee obtains a qualified parking space as a result of membership in a car or van pool, the applicable statutory monthly limit for qualified parking applies to the individual to whom the parking space is assigned. This individual is the prime member. In determining the tax consequences to the prime member, the statutory monthly limit amounts of each car pool member may not be combined. If the employer provides access to the space and the space is not assigned to a particular individual, then the employer must designate one of its employees as the prime member who will bear the tax consequences. The employer may not designate more than one prime member for a car or van pool during a month. The employer of the prime member is responsible for including the value of the qualified parking in excess of the statutory monthly limit in the prime member 's wages for income and employment tax purposes. Q-22. What are the reporting and employment tax requirements for qualified transportation fringes? A-22. (a) Employment tax treatment generally. Qualified transportation  March 12, 2001  804  200111 I.R.B.   fringes not exceeding the applicable statutory monthly limit described in Q/A-7 of this section are not wages for purposes of the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA), the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), and federal income tax withholding. Any amount by which an employee elects to reduce compensation as provided in Q/A-11 of this section is not subject to the FICA, the FUTA, and federal income tax withholding. Qualified transportation fringes exceeding the applicable statutory monthly limit described in Q/A-7 of this section are wages for purposes of the FICA, the FUTA, and federal income tax withholding and are reported on the employee's Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement. (b) Employment tax treatment of cash reimbursement exceeding monthly limits. Cash reimbursement to employees (for example, cash reimbursement for qualified parking) in excess of the applicable statutory monthly limit under section 132(f) is treated as paid for employment tax purposes when actually or constructively paid. See 31.3121(a)2(a), 31.33014, 31.3402(a)1(b) of this chapter. Employers must report and deposit the amounts withheld in addition to reporting and depositing other employment taxes. See Q/A-16 of this section for rules governing cash reimbursements. (c) Noncash fringe benefits exceeding monthly limits. If the value of noncash qualified transportation fringes exceeds the applicable statutory monthly limit, the employer may elect, for purposes of the FICA, the FUTA, and federal income tax withholding, to treat the noncash taxable fringe benefits as paid on a pay period, quarterly, semi-annual, annual, or other basis, provided that the benefits are treated as paid no less frequently than annually. Q23. How does section 132(f) interact with other fringe benefit rules? A-23. For purposes of section 132, the terms working condition fringe and de minimis fringe do not include any qualified transportation fringe under section 132(f). If, however, an employer provides local transportation other than transit passes (without any direct or indirect  compensation reduction election), the value of the benefit may be excludable, either totally or partially, under fringe benefit rules other than the qualified transportation fringe rules under section 132(f). See 1.1326(d)(2)(i) (occasional local transportation fare), 1.1326(d)(2)(iii) (transportation provided under unusual circumstances), and 1.6121(k) (valuation of local transportation provided to qualified employees). See also Q/A-4(b) of this section. Q-24. May qualified transportation fringes be provided to individuals who are partners, 2-percent shareholders of S-corporations, or independent contractors? A-24. (a) General rule. Section 132(f)(5)(E) states that self-employed individuals who are employees within the meaning of section 401(c)(1) are not employees for purposes of section 132(f). Therefore, individuals who are partners, sole proprietors, or other independent contractors are not employees for purposes of section 132(f). In addition, under section 1372(a), 2-percent shareholders of S corporations are treated as partners for fringe benefit purposes. Thus, an individual who is both a 2-percent shareholder of an S corporation and a common law employee of that S corporation is not considered an employee for purposes of section 132(f). However, while section 132(f) does not apply to individuals who are partners, 2-percent shareholders of S corporations, or independent contractors, other exclusions for working condition and de minimis fringes may be available as described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this Q/A-24. See 1.1321(b)(2) and 1.1321(b)(4). (b) Transit passes. The working condition and de minimis fringe exclusions under section 132(a)(3) and (4) are available for transit passes provided to individuals who are partners, 2-percent shareholders, and independent contractors. For example, tokens or farecards provided by a partnership to an individual who is a partner that enable the partner to commute on a public transit system (not including privately-operated van pools) are excludable from the partner 's gross income if the value of the tokens and farecards in any  month does not exceed the dollar amount specified in 1.1326(d)(1). However, if the value of a pass provided in a month exceeds the dollar amount specified in 1.1326(d)(1), the full value of the benefit provided (not merely the amount in excess of the dollar amount specified in 1.1326(d)(1)) is includible in gross income. (c) Parking. The working condition fringe rules under section 132(d) do not apply to commuter parking. See 1.1325(a)(1). However, the de minimis fringe rules under section 132(e) are available for parking provided to individuals who are partners, 2-percent shareholders, or independent contractors that qualifies under the de minimis rules. See 1.1326(a) and (b). (d) Example. The following example illustrates the principles of this Q/A-24: Example. (i) Individual G is a partner in partnership P. Individual G commutes to and from G's office every day and parks free of charge in P's lot. (ii) In this Example, the value of the parking is not excluded under section 132(f), but may be excluded under section 132(e) if the parking is a de minimis fringe under 1.1326.  Q25. What is the effective date of this section? A-25. (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this Q/A-25, this section is applicable for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2001. (b) The last sentence of paragraph (b)(5) of Q/A-16 of this section (relating to whether transit system vouchers for transit passes are readily available) is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2003.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On January 24, 2000, the IRS and Treasury issued final regulations under section 367(b) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). At the same time, the IRS and Treasury also modified temporary regulation 7.367(b)12(a). The final regulations and modified temporary regulation were effective as of February 23, 2000. As modified, 7.367(b)12(a) addresses distributions with respect to, or a disposition of, stock that was subject to certain provisions of the temporary section 367(b) regulations that were in effect before February 23, 2000. This document finalizes the rule stated in 7.367(b) 12(a) in order to insure its continued application. See section 7805(e)(2) (stating a ""sunset rule"" applicable to temporary regulations). Special Analyses It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) does not apply to these regulations, and because the notice of proposed rulemaking preceding the regulations was issued prior to March 29, 1996, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) does not apply. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Code, the notice of proposed rulemaking preceding these regulations was submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small  Business Administration for comment on the impact of the proposed regulations on small business. Drafting Information The principal author of these regulations is Mark Harris of the Office of Associate Chief Counsel (International). However, other personnel from the IRS and Treasury Department participated in their development. ***** Adoption of Amendments to the Regulations Accordingly, 26 CFR parts 1 and 7 are amended as follows: PART 1--INCOME TAXES Paragraph 1. The authority citation for part 1 is amended by adding an entry in numerical order to read in part as follows: Authority: 26 U.S.C. 7805 * * * Section 1.367(b)12 also issued under 26 U.S.C. 367(a) and (b). * * * Par. 2.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On March 9, 1998, the IRS issued Announcement 9818 (19981 C.B. 676) requesting comments relating to the tax issues for U.S. taxpayers operating, investing, or otherwise conducting business in a currency that is converting to the euro.

See Rev. Rul. 200112, page 811.  200111 I.R.B.  807  March 12, 2001   After consideration of the comments, and in order to provide immediate guidance, the Treasury and the IRS published in the Federal Register temporary regulations (63 FR 40366) and a notice of proposed rulemaking by cross-reference to the temporary regulations (63 F.R. 40383 [T.D. 8776, 19982 C.B. 200]) on July 29, 1998. No public hearing was held in conjunction with the notice of proposed rulemaking because no taxpayers requested to speak at the hearing. In the notice of proposed rulemaking, the Treasury and The IRS requested comments with respect to certain additional issues. Two comments were received in connection with the request for comments and are discussed in greater detail below. Explanation of Provisions and Discussion of Comments The temporary regulations provide rules relating to U.S. taxpayers operating, investing, or otherwise conducting business in the currencies of countries that replace their national currencies (legacy currencies) with a single, multinational currency called the euro. Thus, a legacy currency would include former currencies of the eleven countries that adopted the euro in 1999 as well as the currency of a country after it adopts the euro at some later date. The temporary regulations generally provide guidance relating to the circumstances under which the euro conversion creates a realization event with respect to instruments and contracts denominated in a legacy currency, and the circumstances under which the euro conversion constitutes a change in functional currency for a qualified business unit (QBU or QBUs, as the case may be) whose functional currency is a legacy currency, and certain consequences thereof. The temporary regulations published in the Federal Register on July 29, 1998, are finalized substantially as proposed. See the preamble to the temporary regulations for an explanation of the provisions of those regulations. As noted above, two comments were received in connection with the publication of the temporary regulations and the notice of proposed rulemaking. One comment addressed the effect of the euro conversion to a corporation that has significant numbers of legacy currency transactions but has a non-legacy curren-  cy as its functional currency. For example, a corporation may have a non-legacy currency as its functional currency because its economic environment reflected more significant activities denominated in such currency (e.g., the U.S. dollar or the Swiss franc) relative to any single legacy currency. However, given the aggregation of the individual legacy currencies into the euro, the currency of the corporation's economic environment in which a significant part of its activities are conducted is the euro. The commenter suggested that, in such circumstances, the corporation should be allowed to change its functional currency to the euro automatically. In response to the comment, the regulation provides a new rule in which a QBU that uses a non-legacy currency as its functional currency may change its functional currency to the euro provided that the euro is a currency of the economic environment in which a significant part of the QBU's activities are conducted, the QBU maintains its books and records in the euro after conversion, and the QBU is not required to use the dollar as its functional currency. The change is deemed to be made with the consent of the Commissioner if the change is made within the period set forth in 1.9858(b)(2). A QBU changing its functional currency under this new rule is required to make the change in method of accounting adjustments under 1.9855. Treasury and the IRS believe that the rules of 1.9855 appropriately apply to this circumstance because the change in functional currency is not an involuntary change of the same nature as a QBU whose functional currency is a legacy currency. The second comment suggested that the temporary regulations do not provide clear guidance in the case where, prior to conversion, the functional currency of a taxpayer and one of its QBU branches is the same legacy currency, and either the taxpayer or its QBU branch converts to the euro as its functional currency in a taxable year prior to the conversion of the other. The comment noted that the temporary regulations presume that the taxpayer and its branch have a different functional currency, but do not address instances where they have the same functional currency. The comment recom-  mended that the regulations provide rules that require calculation of section 987 gain or loss during the period in which the taxpayer and its branch have different functional currencies. The recommendation is not adopted because section 987 currency gain or loss should not arise when a taxpayer and its branch use the same legacy currency as their functional currencies even if each adopts the euro as its functional currency in different years. Finally, the notice of proposed rulemaking requested comments regarding the treatment of section 988 transactions that are held by euro functional currency QBUs and that are denominated in a currency that is replaced by the euro in the future. While no comments were received, Treasury and the IRS believe that rules relating to this issue should be clarified. Accordingly, 1.9858(d) provides that the principles of 1.9858(c)(3) apply in this context. Under this rule, legacy currency transactions generally continue to be treated as section 988 transactions and the principles of section 988 apply. Further, the principles provided in 1.9858(c)(3)(iii) and (iv) continue to apply to currency and accounts payable and receivable, respectively. Special Analysis It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedures Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) does not apply to these regulations, and because the final rule does not impose a collection of information on small entities, the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act do not apply. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, these regulations were submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on their impact on small business. DRAFTING INFORMATION: The principal authors of these final regulations are John W. Rogers III of the Office of the Associate Chief Counsel (International) and Thomas Preston of the Office of Associate Chief Counsel (Financial Institutions and Products). Other personnel from the IRS and Treasury  March 12, 2001  808  200111 I.R.B.   Department also participated in their development. * * ** * Adoption of Amendments to the Regulations Accordingly, 26 CFR part 1 is amended as follows: PART 1--INCOME TAXES Paragraph 1.

Section 1.9858 is added to read as follows: 1.9858 Special rules applicable to the European Monetary Union (conversion to euro). (a) Definitions--(1) Legacy currency. A legacy currency is the former currency of a Member State of the European Community which is substituted for the euro in accordance with the Treaty establishing the European Community signed February 7, 1992. The term legacy currency shall also include the European Currency Unit. (2) Conversion rate. The conversion rate is the rate at which the euro is substituted for a legacy currency. (b) Operative rules--(1) Initial adoption. A QBU (as defined in 1.989(a)1(b)) whose first taxable year begins after the euro has been substituted for a legacy currency may not adopt a legacy currency as its functional currency. (2) QBU with a legacy currency as its functional currency--(i) Required change. A QBU with a legacy currency as its functional currency is required to change its functional currency to the euro beginning the first day of the first taxable year  (A) That begins on or after the day that the euro is substituted for that legacy currency (in accordance with the Treaty on European Union); and (B) In which the QBU begins to maintain its books and records (as described in 1.989(a)1(d)) in the euro. (ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, a QBU with a legacy currency as its functional currency is required to change its functional currency to the euro no later than the last taxable year beginning on or before the first day such legacy currency is no longer valid legal tender. (3) QBU with a non-legacy currency as its functional currency -- (i) In general. A QBU with a non-legacy currency as its functional currency may change its functional currency to the euro pursuant to this 1.9858 if (A) Under the rules set forth in 1.9851(c), the euro is the currency of the economic environment in which a significant part of the QBU's activities are conducted; (B) After conversion, the QBU maintains its books and records (as described in 1.989(a)1(d)) in the euro; and (C) The QBU is not required to use the dollar as its functional currency under 1.9851(b). (ii) Time period for change. A QBU with a non-legacy currency as its functional currency may change its functional currency to the euro under this section only if it does so within the period set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section as if the functional currency of the QBU was a legacy currency. (4) Consent of Commissioner. A change made pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section shall be deemed to be made with the consent of the Commissioner for purposes of 1.9854. A QBU changing its functional currency to the euro pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section must make adjustments as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. A QBU changing its functional currency to the euro pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) must make adjustments as provided in 1.9855. (5) Statement to file upon change. With respect to a QBU that changes its functional currency to the euro under paragraph (b) of this section, an affected taxpayer shall attach to its return for the taxable year of change a statement that  includes the following: ""TAXPAYER CERTIFIES THAT A QBU OF THE TAXPAYER HAS CHANGED ITS FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY TO THE EURO PURSUANT TO TREAS. REG. 1.9858."" For purposes of this paragraph (b)(5), an affected taxpayer shall be in the case where the QBU is: a QBU of an individual U.S. resident (as a result of the activities of such individual), the individual; a QBU branch of a U.S. corporation, the corporation; a controlled foreign corporation (as described in section 957)(or QBU branch thereof), each United States shareholder (as described in section 951(b)); a partnership, each partner separately; a noncontrolled section 902 corporation (as described in section 904(d)(2)(E)) (or branch thereof), each domestic shareholder as described in 1.9021(a)(1); or a trust or estate, the fiduciary of such trust or estate. (c) Adjustments required when a QBU changes its functional currency from a legacy currency to the euro pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section--(1) In general. A QBU that changes its functional currency from a legacy currency to the euro pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section must make the adjustments described in paragraphs (c)(2) through (5) of this section. Section 1.9855 shall not apply. (2) Determining the euro basis of property and the euro amount of liabilities and other relevant items. The euro basis in property and the euro amount of liabilities and other relevant items shall equal the product of the legacy functional currency adjusted basis or amount of liabilities multiplied by the applicable conversion rate. (3) Taking into account exchange gain or loss on legacy currency section 988 transactions--(i) In general. Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(3)(iii) and (iv) of this section, a legacy currency denominated section 988 transaction (determined after applying section 988(d)) outstanding on the last day of the taxable year immediately prior to the year of change shall continue to be treated as a section 988 transaction after the change and the principles of section 988 shall apply. (ii) Examples. The application of this paragraph (c)(3) may be illustrated by the following examples:  200111 I.R.B.  809  March 12, 2001   Example 1. X, a calendar year QBU on the cash method of accounting, uses the deutschmark as its functional currency. X is not described in section 1281(b). On July 1, 1998, X converts 10,000 deutschmarks (DM) into Dutch guilders(fl) at the spot rate of fl1 = DM1 and loans the 10,000 guilders to Y (an unrelated party) for one year at a rate of 10% with principal and interest to be paid on June 30, 1999. On January 1, 1999, X changes its functional currency to the euro pursuant to this section. Assume that the euro/deutschmark conversion rate is set by the European Council at C 1= DM2. Assume further that the euro/guilder conversion rate is set at C 1 = fl2.25. Accordingly, under the terms of the note, on June 30, 1999, X will receive C 4444.44 (fl10,000/2.25) of principal and C 444.44 (fl1,000/2.25) of interest. Pursuant to this paragraph (c)(3), X will realize an exchange loss on the principal computed under the principles of 1.9882(b)(5). For this purpose, the exchange rate used under 1.9882(b)(5)(i) shall be the guilder/euro conversion rate. The amount under 1.9882(b)(5)(ii) is determined by translating the fl10,000 at the guilder/deutschmark spot rate on July 1, 1998, and translating that deutschmark amount into euros at the deutschmark/euro conversion rate. Thus, X will compute an exchange loss for 1999 of C 555.56 determined as follows: [ C 4444.44 (fl10,000/2.25) - C5000 ((fl10,000/1)/2) = - C555.56]. Pursuant to this paragraph (c)(3), the character and source of the loss are determined pursuant to section 988 and regulations thereunder. Because X uses the cash method of accounting for the interest on this debt instrument, X does not realize exchange gain or loss on the receipt of that interest. Example 2. (i) X, a calendar year QBU on the accrual method of accounting, uses the deutschmark as its functional currency. On February 1, 1998, X converts 12,000 deutschmarks into Dutch guilders at the spot rate of fl1 = DM1 and loans the 12,000 guilders to Y (an unrelated party) for one year at a rate of 10% with principal and interest to be paid on January 31, 1999. In addition, assume the average rate (deutschmark/guilder) for the period from February 1, 1998, through December 31, 1998 is fl1.07 = DM1. Pursuant to 1.9882(b)(2)(ii)(C), X will accrue eleven months of interest on the note and recognize interest income of DM1028.04 (fl1100/1.07) in the 1998 taxable year. (ii) On January 1, 1999, the euro will replace the deutschmark as the national currency of Germany pursuant to the Treaty on European Union signed February 7, 1992. Assume that on January 1, 1999, X changes its functional currency to the euro pursuant to this section. Assume that the euro/deutschmark conversion rate is set by the European Council at C1 = DM2. Assume further that the euro/guilder conversion rate is set at C1 = fl2.25. In 1999, X will accrue one month of interest equal to C 44.44 (fl100/2.25). On January 31, 1999, pursuant to the note, X will receive interest denominated in euros of C 533.33 (fl1200/2.25). Pursuant to this paragraph (c)(3), X will realize an exchange loss in the 1999 taxable year with respect to accrued interest computed under the principles of 1.9882(b)(3). For this purpose, the exchange rate used under 1.9882(b)(3)(i) is the guilder/euro conversion rate and the exchange rate used under 1.9882(b)(3)(ii) is the deutschmark/euro conversion rate. Thus, with respect to the interest accrued  in 1998, X will realize exchange loss of C 25.13 under 1.9882(b)(3) as follows: [C 488.89 (fl1100/2.25)- C 514.02 (DM1028.04/2) = - C 25.13]. With respect to the one month of interest accrued in 1999, X will realize no exchange gain or loss since the exchange rate when the interest accrued and the spot rate on the payment date are the same. (iii) X will realize exchange loss of C 666.67 on repayment of the loan principal computed in the same manner as in Example 1 [ C 5333.33 (fl12,000/2.25) - C 6000 fl12,000/1)/2)]. The losses with respect to accrued interest and principal are characterized and sourced under the rules of section 988.  (iii) Special rule for legacy nonfunctional currency. The QBU shall realize or otherwise take into account for all purposes of the Internal Revenue Code the amount of any unrealized exchange gain or loss attributable to nonfunctional currency (as described in section 988(c)(1) (C)(ii)) that is denominated in a legacy currency as if the currency were disposed of on the last day of the taxable year immediately prior to the year of change. The character and source of the gain or loss are determined under section 988. (iv) Legacy currency denominated accounts receivable and payable--(A) In general. A QBU may elect to realize or otherwise take into account for all purposes of the Internal Revenue Code the amount of any unrealized exchange gain or loss attributable to a legacy currency denominated item described in section 988(c)(1)(B)(ii) as if the item were terminated on the last day of the taxable year ending prior to the year of change. (B) Time and manner of election. With respect to a QBU that makes an election described in paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(A) of this section, an affected taxpayer (as described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section) shall attach a statement to its tax return for the taxable year ending immediately prior to the year of change which includes the following: ""TAXPAYER CERTIFIES THAT A QBU OF THE TAXPAYER HAS ELECTED TO REALIZE CURRENCY GAIN OR LOSS ON LEGACY CURRENCY DENOMINATED ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND PAYABLE UPON CHANGE OF FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY TO THE EURO."" A QBU making the election must do so for all legacy currency denominated items described in section 988(c)(1)(B)(ii). (4) Adjustments when a branch changes its functional currency to the euro--(i)  Branch changing from a legacy currency to the euro in a taxable year during which taxpayer 's functional currency is other than the euro. If a branch changes its functional currency from a legacy currency to the euro for a taxable year during which the taxpayer's functional currency is other than the euro, the branch's euro equity pool shall equal the product of the legacy currency amount of the equity pool multiplied by the applicable conversion rate. No adjustment to the basis pool is required. (ii) Branch changing from a legacy currency to the euro in a taxable year during which taxpayer's functional currency is the euro. If a branch changes its functional currency from a legacy currency to the euro for a taxable year during which the taxpayer's functional currency is the euro, the taxpayer shall realize gain or loss attributable to the branch's equity pool under the principles of section 987, computed as if the branch terminated on the last day prior to the year of change. Adjustments under this paragraph (c)(4)(ii) shall be taken into account by the taxpayer ratably over four taxable years beginning with the taxable year of change. (5) Adjustments to a branch's accounts when a taxpayer changes to the euro--(i) Taxpayer changing from a legacy currency to the euro in a taxable year during which a branch's functional currency is other than the euro. If a taxpayer changes its functional currency to the euro for a taxable year during which the functional currency of a branch of the taxpayer is other than the euro, the basis pool shall equal the product of the legacy currency amount of the basis pool multiplied by the applicable conversion rate. No adjustment to the equity pool is required. (ii) Taxpayer changing from a legacy currency to the euro in a taxable year during which a branch's functional currency is the euro. If a taxpayer changes its functional currency from a legacy currency to the euro for a taxable year during which the functional currency of a branch of the taxpayer is the euro, the taxpayer shall take into account gain or loss as determined under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section. (6) Additional adjustments that are necessary when a corporation changes its functional currency to the euro. The amount of a corporation's euro currency earnings and profits and the amount of its  March 12, 2001  810  200111 I.R.B.   euro paid-in capital shall equal the product of the legacy currency amounts of these items multiplied by the applicable conversion rate. The foreign income taxes and accumulated profits or deficits in accumulated profits of a foreign corporation that were maintained in foreign currency for purposes of section 902 and that are attributable to taxable years of the foreign corporation beginning before January 1, 1987, also shall be translated into the euro at the conversion rate. (d) Treatment of legacy currency section 988 transactions with respect to a QBU that has the euro as its functional currency--(1) In general. This 1.9858(d) applies to a QBU that has the euro as its functional currency and that holds a section 988 transaction denominated in, or determined by reference to, a currency that is substituted by the euro. For example, this paragraph (d) will apply to a German QBU with the euro as its functional currency if the QBU is holding Country X currency or other section 988 transactions denominated in such currency on the day in the year 2005 when the euro is substituted for the Country X currency. (2) Principles of paragraph (c)(3) of this section shall apply. With respect to a QBU described in paragraph (d) of this section, the principles of paragraph (c)(3) of this section shall apply. For example, if a German QBU with the euro as its functional currency is holding a Country X currency denominated debt instrument on the day in the year 2005 when the euro is substituted for the Country X currency, the instrument shall continue to be treated as a section 988 transaction pursuant to the principles of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section. However, if such QBU holds Country X currency, the QBU shall take into account any unrealized exchange gain or loss pursuant to the principles of paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section as if the currency was disposed of on the day prior to the day the euro is substituted for the Country X currency. Similarly, if the QBU makes an election under the principles of paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section,  the QBU shall take into account for all purposes of the Internal Revenue Code the amount of any unrealized exchange gain or loss attributable to a legacy currency denominated item described in section 988(c)(1)(B)(ii) as if the item were terminated on the day prior to the day the euro is substituted for the Country X currency. (e) Effective date. This section applies to tax years ending after July 29, 1998. 1.9858T [Removed] Par.5. Section 1.9858T is removed. Par.6. Section 1.10015 is added to read as follows: 1.10015 European Monetary Union (conversion to the euro). (a) Conversion of currencies. For purposes of 1.10011(a), the conversion to the euro of legacy currencies (as defined in 1.9858(a)(1)) is not the exchange of property for other property differing materially in kind or extent. (b) Effect of currency conversion on other rights and obligations. For purposes of 1.10011(a), if, solely as the result of the conversion of legacy currencies to the euro, rights or obligations denominated in a legacy currency become rights or obligations denominated in the euro, that event is not the exchange of property for other property differing materially in kind or extent. Thus, for example, when a debt instrument that requires payments of amounts denominated in a legacy currency becomes a debt instrument requiring payments of euros, that alteration is not a modification within the meaning of 1.10013(c). (c) Effective date. This section applies to tax years ending after July 29, 1998. 1.10015T [Removed] Par. 7. Section 1.10015T is removed. Robert E. Wenzel, Deputy Commissioner of Internal Revenue.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background This document contains amendments to the Regulations on Procedure and Administration (26 CFR part 301) under section 7502 relating to timely mailing treated as timely filing and paying. A notice of proposed rulemaking (REG11543398, 19991 C.B. 651) was published in the Federal Register (64 F.R. 2606) on January 15, 1999. Temporary regulations (T.D. 8807, 19991 C.B. 630) relating to electronic postmarks for electronically filed income tax returns were published in the Federal Register for the same day (64 F.R. 2568). No public hearing was requested or held. No comments were received from the public in response to the notice of proposed rulemaking. The proposed regulations under section 7502 are adopted as revised by this Treasury decision and the corresponding temporary regulations are removed. The revisions are discussed below. Explanation of Revisions In the notice of proposed rulemaking, the IRS and the Treasury Department requested comments regarding whether section 7502 should apply to claims for credit or refund made on late filed original income tax returns. No comments were received on this issue. However, the IRS and the Treasury Department have determined that, in certain situations, a claim for credit or refund made on a late filed original income tax return should be treated under section 7502 as timely filed on the postmark date for purposes of section 6511(b)(2)(A). This is consistent with the  Section 7502.--Timely Mailing Treated as Timely Filing and Paying 26 CFR 301.75021: Timely mailing of documents and payments treated as timely filing and paying.  T.D. 8932 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Internal Revenue Service 26 CFR Part 301 Timely Mailing Treated as Timely Filing/Electronic Postmark AGENCY: Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury. ACTION: Final regulations; and removal of temporary regulations. SUMMARY: This document contains regulations relating to timely mailing treated as timely filing and paying under section 7502 of the Internal Revenue Code. The regulations generally reflect changes to the law made since 1960. In addition, the regulations provide that the date of an electronic postmark will be the filing date under certain circumstances. The regulations affect taxpayers who file documents or make payments or deposits. DATES: Effective Date: These regulations are effective January 11, 2001. Applicability Date: For dates of applicability, see 301.75021(g) and 301.75022(e).  opinion of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Weisbart v. United States Department of Treasury and Internal Revenue Service, 222 F.3d 93 (2d Cir. 2000), rev'g 991 USTC (CCH)  50,549 (E.D.N.Y. 1999), AOD-CC-200009 (Nov. 13, 2000). The IRS and the Treasury Department have further determined that claims for credit or refund made on late filed original tax returns other than income tax returns should also be treated under section 7502 as timely filed on the postmark date for purposes of section 6511(b)(2)(A). This would include returns such as Form 720, Quarterly Federal Excise Tax Return, and Form 706, U.S. Estate Tax Return. Moreover, the IRS and the Treasury Department have determined that the late filed original tax return, as well as the claim for credit or refund, should also be treated as filed on the postmark date. These changes, which are reflected in 301.75021(f), will assist taxpayers in filing timely claims for credit or refund, and will be applied retroactively to certain previously disallowed claims for credit or refund. These changes are effective for any claim for credit or refund on a late filed tax return described in 301.75021(f)(1) except for those claims for credit or refund which (without regard to paragraph (f) of this section) were barred by the operation of section 6532(a) or any other law or rule of law (including res judicata) as of January 11, 2001. See 301.75021(g)(2), which provides the effective date rules for 301.75021(f). Consistent with the effective date rules for 301.75021(f), the IRS will attempt to identify as many claims as possible that were filed on untimely original individual income tax returns and that were previously disallowed based on the Government's position in Weisbart. In  200111 I.R.B.  813  March 12, 2001   these cases, the IRS intends to issue a refund, or credit the overpayment against a liability as provided in section 6402, without the need for the taxpayer to contact the IRS. Such automatic reconsideration of the claim will generally occur if the claim was filed on an individual income tax return for 1995 or a subsequent calendar year. Claims filed on other types of original returns will not receive automatic reconsideration under this program, e.g., individual returns for years prior to 1995. Because the IRS will be undertaking the automatic reconsideration program described above and intends to complete the program by June 30, 2001, taxpayers who have filed income tax refund claims for tax year 1995 and later years that qualify under 301.75021(f) need not contact the IRS regarding their claims unless the two-year period for filing a refund suit under section 6532(a) for their denied claim will expire prior to June 30, 2001. In such cases, taxpayers are advised to file a request for reconsideration with the appropriate IRS Service Center. Such a request should include a notation on the top of the first page that it is a ""Weisbart Claim."" Such taxpayers are also advised to file a refund suit to protect their legal rights with respect to the claim. The IRS will respond to the requests for reconsideration after the IRS has finished identifying eligible claims under the automatic reconsideration program and paying those refunds. Taxpayers whose two-year period for filing a refund suit under section 6532(a) does not expire until after June 30, 2001, and who have not received a refund by that date, are advised to file a request for reconsideration with the appropriate IRS Service Center at that time. Special Analyses It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) does not apply to these regulations, and because these regulations do not impose a collection of information on small entities, the Regulatory Flexibility  Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) does not apply. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, the notice of proposed rulemaking preceding these regulations was submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business. Drafting Information The principal author of these regulations is Charles A. Hall of the Office of Associate Chief Counsel, Procedure and Administration (Administrative Provisions and Judicial Practice Division). However, other personnel from the IRS and Treasury Department participated in their development. ***** Adoption of Amendments to the Regulations Accordingly, 26 CFR part 301 is amended as follows: PART 301--PROCEDURE AND ADMINISTRATION Paragraph 1. The authority citation for part 301 is amended by adding entries in numerical order to read as follows: Authority: 26 U.S.C. 7805 * * * Section 301.75021 also issued under 26 U.S.C. 7502. Section 301.75022 also issued under 26 U.S.C. 7502. * * * Par. 2. Section 301.75021 is revised to read as follows: 301.75021 Timely mailing of documents and payments treated as timely filing and paying. (a) General rule. Section 7502 provides that, if the requirements of that section are met, a document or payment is deemed to be filed or paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the envelope or other appropriate wrapper (envelope) in which the document or payment was mailed. Thus, if the envelope that contains the document or payment has a timely postmark, the document or payment is considered timely filed or paid even if it is received after the last date, or the last day of the period, prescribed for filing the document or making the payment. Section 7502 does not apply in determining whether a failure to file a return or pay a tax has continued for an additional month or fraction thereof for purposes of  computing the penalties and additions to tax imposed by section 6651. Except as provided in section 7502(e) and 301.75022, relating to the timely mailing of deposits, and paragraph (d) of this section, relating to electronically filed documents, section 7502 is applicable only to those documents or payments as defined in paragraph (b) of this section and only if the document or payment is mailed in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section and is delivered in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section. (b) Definitions--(1) Document defined. (i) The term document, as used in this section, means any return, claim, statement, or other document required to be filed within a prescribed period or on or before a prescribed date under authority of any provision of the internal revenue laws, except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section. (ii) The term does not include returns, claims, statements, or other documents that are required under any provision of the internal revenue laws or the regulations thereunder to be delivered by any method other than mailing. (iii) The term does not include any document filed in any court other than the Tax Court, but the term does include any document filed with the Tax Court, including a petition and a notice of appeal of a decision of the Tax Court. (iv) The term does not include any document that is mailed to an authorized financial institution under section 6302. However, see 301.75022 for special rules relating to the timeliness of deposits and documents required to be filed with deposits. (2) Claims for refund. In the case of certain taxes, a return may constitute a claim for credit or refund. In such a case, section 7502 is applicable to the claim for credit or refund if the conditions of such section are met, irrespective of whether the claim is also a return. For rules regarding claims for refund on late filed tax returns, see paragraph (f) of this section. (3) Payment defined. (i) The term payment, as used in this section, means any payment required to be made within a prescribed period or on or before a prescribed date under the authority of any provision of the internal revenue laws, except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii), (iii), (iv), or (v) of this section.  March 12, 2001  814  200111 I.R.B.   (ii) The term does not include any payment that is required under any provision of the internal revenue laws or the regulations thereunder to be delivered by any method other than mailing. See, for example, section 6302(h) and the regulations thereunder regarding electronic funds transfer. (iii) The term does not include any payment, whether it is made in the form of currency or other medium of payment, unless it is actually received and accounted for. For example, if a check is used as the form of payment, this section does not apply unless the check is honored upon presentation. (iv) The term does not include any payment to any court other than the Tax Court. (v) The term does not include any deposit that is required to be made with an authorized financial institution under section 6302. However, see 301.75022 for rules relating to the timeliness of deposits. (4) Last date or last day prescribed. As used in this section, the term the last date, or the last day of the period, prescribed for filing the document or making the payment includes any extension of time granted for that action. When the last date, or the last day of the period, prescribed for filing the document or making the payment falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, section 7503 applies. Therefore, in applying the rules of this paragraph (b)(4), the next succeeding day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday is treated as the last date, or the last day of the period, prescribed for filing the document or making the payment. Also, when the last date, or the last day of the period, prescribed for filing the document or making the payment falls within a period disregarded under section 7508 or section 7508A, the next succeeding day after the expiration of the section 7508 period or section 7508A period that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday is treated as the last date, or the last day of the period, prescribed for filing the document or making the payment. (c) Mailing requirements--(1) In general. Section 7502 does not apply unless the document or payment is mailed in accordance with the following requirements: (i) Envelope and address. The document or payment must be contained in an  envelope, properly addressed to the agency, officer, or office with which the document is required to be filed or to which the payment is required to be made. (ii) Timely deposited in U.S. mail. The document or payment must be deposited within the prescribed time in the mail in the United States with sufficient postage prepaid. For this purpose, a document or payment is deposited in the mail in the United States when it is deposited with the domestic mail service of the U.S. Postal Service. The domestic mail service of the U.S. Postal Service, as defined by the Domestic Mail Manual as incorporated by reference in the postal regulations, includes mail transmitted within, among, and between the United States of America, its territories and possessions, and Army post offices (APO), fleet post offices (FPO), and the United Nations, NY. (See Domestic Mail Manual, section G011.2.1, as incorporated by reference in 39 CFR 111.1.) Section 7502 does not apply to any document or payment that is deposited with the mail service of any other country. (iii) Postmark--(A) U.S. Postal Service postmark. If the postmark on the envelope is made by the U.S. Postal Service, the postmark must bear a date on or before the last date, or the last day of the period, prescribed for filing the document or making the payment. If the postmark does not bear a date on or before the last date, or the last day of the period, prescribed for filing the document or making the payment, the document or payment is considered not to be timely filed or paid, regardless of when the document or payment is deposited in the mail. Accordingly, the sender who relies upon the applicability of section 7502 assumes the risk that the postmark will bear a date on or before the last date, or the last day of the period, prescribed for filing the document or making the payment. See, however, paragraph (c)(2) of this section with respect to the use of registered mail or certified mail to avoid this risk. If the postmark on the envelope is made by the U.S. Postal Service but is not legible, the person who is required to file the document or make the payment has the burden of proving the date that the postmark was made. Furthermore, if the envelope that contains a document or payment has a timely postmark made by the U.S. Postal  Service, but it is received after the time when a document or payment postmarked and mailed at that time would ordinarily be received, the sender may be required to prove that it was timely mailed. (B) Postmark made by other than U.S. Postal Service--(1) In general. If the postmark on the envelope is made other than by the U.S. Postal Service-- (i) The postmark so made must bear a legible date on or before the last date, or the last day of the period, prescribed for filing the document or making the payment; and (ii) The document or payment must be received by the agency, officer, or office with which it is required to be filed not later than the time when a document or payment contained in an envelope that is properly addressed, mailed, and sent by the same class of mail would ordinarily be received if it were postmarked at the same point of origin by the U.S. Postal Service on the last date, or the last day of the period, prescribed for filing the document or making the payment. (2) Document or payment received late. If a document or payment described in paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(B)(1) is received after the time when a document or payment so mailed and so postmarked by the U.S. Postal Service would ordinarily be received, the document or payment is treated as having been received at the time when a document or payment so mailed and so postmarked would ordinarily be received if the person who is required to file the document or make the payment establishes-- (i) That it was actually deposited in the U.S. mail before the last collection of mail from the place of deposit that was postmarked (except for the metered mail) by the U.S. Postal Service on or before the last date, or the last day of the period, prescribed for filing the document or making the payment; (ii) That the delay in receiving the document or payment was due to a delay in the transmission of the U.S. mail; and (iii) The cause of the delay. (3) U.S. and non-U.S. postmarks. If the envelope has a postmark made by the U.S. Postal Service in addition to a postmark not so made, the postmark that was not made by the U.S. Postal Service is disregarded, and whether the envelope was mailed in accordance with this paragraph  200111 I.R.B.  815  March 12, 2001   (c)(1)(iii)(B) will be determined solely by applying the rule of paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(A) of this section. (2) Registered or certified mail. If the document or payment is sent by U.S. registered mail, the date of registration of the document or payment is treated as the postmark date. If the document or payment is sent by U.S. certified mail and the sender 's receipt is postmarked by the postal employee to whom the document or payment is presented, the date of the U.S. postmark on the receipt is treated as the postmark date of the document or payment. Accordingly, the risk that the document or payment will not be postmarked on the day that it is deposited in the mail may be eliminated by the use of registered or certified mail. (d) Electronically filed documents--(1) In general. A document filed electronically with an electronic return transmitter (as defined in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section and authorized pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section) in the manner and time prescribed by the Commissioner is deemed to be filed on the date of the electronic postmark (as defined in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section) given by the authorized electronic return transmitter. Thus, if the electronic postmark is timely, the document is considered filed timely although it is received by the agency, officer, or office after the last date, or the last day of the period, prescribed for filing such document. (2) Authorized electronic return transmitters. The Commissioner may enter into an agreement with an electronic return transmitter or prescribe in forms, instructions, or other appropriate guidance the procedures under which the electronic return transmitter is authorized to provide taxpayers with an electronic postmark to acknowledge the date and time that the electronic return transmitter received the electronically filed document. (3) Definitions--(i) Electronic return transmitter. For purposes of this paragraph (d), the term electronic return transmitter has the same meaning as contained in section 3.01(4) of Rev. Proc. 200031 (200031 I.R.B. 146 (July 31, 2000))(see 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter) or in procedures prescribed by the Commissioner. (ii) Electronic postmark. For purposes of this paragraph (d), the term electronic  postmark means a record of the date and time (in a particular time zone) that an authorized electronic return transmitter receives the transmission of a taxpayer 's electronically filed document on its host system. However, if the taxpayer and the electronic return transmitter are located in different time zones, it is the taxpayer 's time zone that controls the timeliness of the electronically filed document. (e) Delivery--(1) Except as provided in section 7502(f) and paragraph (d) of this section, section 7502 is not applicable unless the document or payment is delivered by U.S. mail to the agency, officer, or office with which the document is required to be filed or to which payment is required to be made. However, in the case of a document (but not a payment) sent by registered or certified mail, proof that the document was properly registered or that a postmarked certified mail sender 's receipt was properly issued and that the envelope was properly addressed to the agency, officer, or office constitutes prima facie evidence that the document was delivered to the agency, officer, or office. (2) Section 7502 is applicable to the determination of whether a claim for credit or refund is timely filed for purposes of section 6511(a), assuming all the requirements of section 7502 are satisfied. Section 7502 is also applicable when a claim for credit or refund is delivered after the last day of the period specified in section 6511(b)(2)(A) or in any other corresponding provision of law relating to the limit on the amount of credit or refund that is allowable. (3) Example. The rules of paragraph (e)(2) of this section are illustrated by the following example: Example. (i) Taxpayer A, an individual, mailed his 1998 Form 1040, ""U.S. Individual Income Tax Return,"" on May 10, 1999, but no tax was paid at that time because the tax liability disclosed by the return had been completely satisfied by the income tax that had been withheld on A's wages. On April 15, 2002, A mails in accordance with the requirements of this section, a Form 1040X, ""U.S. Amended Individual Income Tax Return,"" claiming a refund of a portion of the tax that had been paid through withholding during 1998. The date of the postmark on the envelope containing the claim for refund is April 15, 2002. The claim is received by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on April 18, 2002. (ii) Under section 6511(a), A's claim for refund is timely if filed within three years from May 10, 1999, the date on which A's 1998 return was filed. However, as a result of the limitations of section  6511(b)(2)(A), if his claim is not filed within three years after April 15, 1999, the date on which he is deemed under section 6513 to have paid his 1998 tax, he is not entitled to any refund. Thus, because A's claim for refund is postmarked and mailed in accordance with the requirements of this section and is delivered after the last day of the period specified in section 6511(b)(2)(A), section 7502 is applicable and the claim is deemed to have been filed on April 15, 2002.  (f) Claim for credit or refund on late filed tax return--(1) In general. Generally, an original income tax return may constitute a claim for credit or refund of income tax. See 301.64023(a)(5). Other original tax returns can also be considered claims for credit or refund if the liability disclosed on the return is less than the amount of tax that has been paid. If section 7502 would not apply to a return (but for the operation of paragraph (f)(2) of this section) that is also considered a claim for credit or refund because the envelope that contains the return does not have a postmark dated on or before the due date of the return, section 7502 will apply separately to the claim for credit or refund if-- (i) The date of the postmark on the envelope is within the period that is three years (plus the period of any extension of time to file) from the day the tax is paid or considered paid (see section 6513), and the claim for credit or refund is delivered after this three-year period; and (ii) The conditions of section 7502 are otherwise met. (2) Filing date of late filed return. If the conditions of paragraph (f)(1) of this section are met, the late filed return will be deemed filed on the postmark date. (3) Example. The rules of this paragraph (f) are illustrated by the following example: Example. (i) Taxpayer A, an individual, mailed his 2001 Form 1040, ""U.S. Individual Income Tax Return,"" on April 15, 2005, claiming a refund of amounts paid through withholding during 2001. The date of the postmark on the envelope containing the return and claim for refund is April 15, 2005. The return and claim for refund are received by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on April 18, 2005. Amounts withheld in 2001 exceeded A's tax liability for 2001 and are treated as paid on April 15, 2002, pursuant to section 6513. (ii) Even though the date of the postmark on the envelope is after the due date of the return, the claim for refund and the late filed return are treated as filed on the postmark date for purposes of this paragraph (f). Accordingly, the return will be treated as filed on April 15, 2005. In addition, the claim for refund will be treated as timely filed on April 15, 2005. Further, the entire amount of the refund attributable to with-  March 12, 2001  816  200111 I.R.B.   holding is allowable as a refund under section 6511(b)(2)(A).  (g) Effective date--(1) In general. Except as provided in paragraphs (g)(2) and (3) of this section, the rules of this section apply to any payment or document mailed and delivered in accordance with the requirements of this section in an envelope bearing a postmark dated after January 11, 2001. (2) Claim for credit or refund on late filed tax return. Paragraph (f) of this section applies to any claim for credit or refund on a late filed tax return described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section except for those claims for credit or refund which (without regard to paragraph (f) of this section) were barred by the operation of section 6532(a) or any other law or rule of law (including res judicata) as of January 11, 2001. (3) Electronically filed documents. This section applies to any electronically filed return, claim, statement, or other document transmitted to an electronic return transmitter that is authorized to provide an electronic postmark pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section after January 11, 2001. 301.75021T [Removed] Par. 3. Section 301.75021T is removed. Par. 4. Section 301.75022 is added to read as follows: 301.75022 Timely mailing of deposits. (a) General rule--(1) Two day rule. Section 7502(e) provides that, if the requirements of that section are met, a deposit is deemed to be received on the date the deposit was mailed even though it is received after the date prescribed for making the deposit. The requirements of the section are met if the person required to make the deposit establishes that the date of mailing was on or before the second day preceding the date prescribed for making the deposit. If the date of mailing was not established to be on or before the second day preceding the date prescribed  for making the deposit, the deposit will not be considered timely received unless it is actually received on or before the date prescribed for making the deposit. Section 7502(e) only applies to a deposit mailed to the financial institution authorized to receive that deposit. Thus, section 7502(e) does not apply to any remittance mailed to an internal revenue service center. (2) Deposits of $20,000 or more. Paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not apply with respect to any deposit of $20,000 or more by any person required to deposit any tax more than once a month. Any such deposit must be made by the due date for such deposit, regardless of the method of delivery. (b) Deposit defined. The term deposit, as used in this section, means any deposit of tax required to be made on or before a prescribed date at an authorized financial institution pursuant to regulations prescribed under section 6302. (c) Mailing requirements--(1) In general. Section 7502(e) does not apply unless the deposit is mailed in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. (2) Requirements. The date of mailing must fall on or before the second day preceding the prescribed date for making a deposit (including any extension of time granted for making the deposit). For example, if a deposit is due on or before January 15, the date of mailing must fall on or before January 13. The deposit must be contained in an envelope or other appropriate wrapper approved for use in the mails by the U.S. Postal Service, properly addressed to the financial institution authorized to receive the deposit. The deposit must be deposited with sufficient postage prepaid in the mail in the United States within the meaning of 301.75021 on or before the second day preceding the prescribed date for making a deposit. (3) Registered and certified mail. The provisions of 301.75021(c)(2) apply to a deposit sent by U.S. registered mail or U.S. certified mail as if the deposit were a  payment, except that the date of registration or the date of the postmark on the sender 's receipt is considered the date of mailing of such deposit. (d) Delivery. Section 7502(e) does not apply unless a deposit is actually delivered by U.S. mail to the authorized financial institution with which the deposit is required to be made and is accepted by that financial institution. For rules relating to the acceptance of deposits by authorized financial institutions see 31 CFR 203.18. The fact that a deposit is sent by U.S. registered or U.S. certified mail does not constitute prima facie evidence that the deposit was delivered to the financial institution authorized to receive the deposit. Section 7502(e) does not apply unless the deposit is delivered after the date prescribed for making the deposit. (e) Effective date. This section applies to all deposits required to be made after January 11, 2001. Robert E. Wenzel, Deputy Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Approved December 21, 2000.

Low-Income Housing Tax Credit--2001 Calendar Year Resident Population Estimates Notice 2001-21 This notice informs (1) state and housing credit agencies that allocate income housing tax credits under  the Internal Revenue Code and (2) local low42 of states  and other issuers of tax-exempt private activity bonds under  141, of the proper population figures to be used for calculating the 2001 calendar year population-based component of the state housing credit ceiling (Credit Ceiling) under  42(h)(3)(C)(ii) and the 2001 calendar year volume cap (Volume Cap) under  146. The population figures both for the population-based component of the Credit Ceiling and for the Volume Cap are determined by reference to  146(j). That section provides generally that determinations of population for any calendar year are made on the basis of the most recent census estimate of the resident population of a state (or issuing authority) released by the Bureau of the Census before the beginning of such calendar year.  The proper population figures for calculating the Credit Ceiling and the Volume Cap for the 2001 calendar year are the resident population of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, released by the Bureau of the Census on December 28, 2000, in Press Release CB00-CN.65. The proper population figures for calculating the Credit Ceiling and the Volume Cap for the 2001 calendar year for the insular areas (American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and U.S. Virgin Islands) are the estimates of the resident population for July 1, 1999, released by the Bureau of the Census on December 29, 1999, in Press Release CB99-254.

An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless the collection of information displays a valid control number assigned by the Office of Management and Budget. Background This document contains proposed regulations relating to the Income Tax Regulations (CFR part 1) under sections 863(a), (b), (d), and (e) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). Congress enacted section 863(d) and section 863(e) as part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (Public Law 99514, 100 Stat. 2085) (the 1986 Act). Section 863(d) governs the source of income derived from certain space and ocean activities. Section 863(e) governs the source of income derived from international communications activity.  March 12, 2001  820  200111 I.R.B.   Explanation of Provisions These proposed regulations provide two sets of rules, one in 1.8638 for determining the source of income from space and ocean activities, the other in 1.8639 for determining the source of income from communications activity. Section 1.8639 provides rules for both international communications income (ICI) and other communications income. The IRS and Treasury believe it is appropriate to provide source rules for both ICI and other communications income in a single regulation. The IRS and Treasury are fully aware of the rapid technological evolution in the space and communications industries since Congress enacted sections 863(d) and (e) in 1986, and have attempted to take into account these changes as well as changes in the space and communications industries and business practices and business models. The IRS and Treasury recognize that these regulations address important issues for many different industries and have worked closely with the industries in drafting these rules. The IRS and Treasury are interested in receiving comments from these industries on how to accommodate issues arising from the use of new technologies, consistent with the language and purpose of the statutory provisions. A. Space and Ocean Activity Under Section 863(d) 1. Scope of 1.8638 of the proposed regulations Section 1.8638 of the proposed regulations provides rules for sourcing income derived from space and ocean activity, notwithstanding other sections. Proposed regulations 1.8638(a) provides that a taxpayer derives income from a space or ocean activity only if the taxpayer conducts such activity directly. This is consistent with the approach that IRS and Treasury adopted in the 1.8633 regulations sourcing income from inventory sales. 2. Source of gross income from space or ocean activity a. General Section 863(d)(1) states that, except as provided in regulations, any income  derived from space or ocean activity by a U.S. person will be U.S. source income, and if derived by a foreign person, foreign source income. Proposed regulations 1.8638(b)(1) provides that a U.S. person's space or ocean income is U.S. source. Proposed regulations 1.8638 (b)(1) also states the general rule that income derived by a foreign person from a space or ocean activity is foreign source income. However, the proposed regulations contain several exceptions to that general rule. Proposed regulations 1.8638(b)(2) provides that if a foreign corporation is 50 percent or more owned by vote or value (directly, indirectly, or constructively) by U.S. persons and is not a controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of section 957 (CFC), all income derived by the corporation from space or ocean activity is U.S. source income. This rule reflects IRS and Treasury's concern that U.S. persons may use a foreign corporation (for example, by incorporating a 50/50 joint venture with a foreign person, thereby avoiding CFC status) to obtain results that are inconsistent with the purposes of this section. The IRS and Treasury believe Congress granted Treasury broad regulatory authority in section 863(d) to prevent taxpayers from circumventing the purposes of this section. Proposed regulations 1.8638(b)(3) provides that if a foreign person is engaged in a U.S. trade or business, the foreign person's income derived from a space or ocean activity is presumed to be U.S. source income. The rule reflects IRS and Treasury's concern that a foreign person could engage in significant economic activities in the United States and avoid U.S. taxation of space or ocean income derived from such activities. For example, a foreign satellite company established in a no-tax jurisdiction could engage in substantial activity in the United States through launch facilities, yet pay no U.S. or foreign tax on income arising from leasing the satellites it launches. The IRS and Treasury believe Congress intended that a foreign person engaged in substantial U.S. business in the United States be subject to U.S. tax on related space or ocean activity. The IRS and Treasury recognize that the presumption may be over-inclusive in  certain cases. Therefore, the proposed regulations provide that if the foreign person can allocate gross space or ocean income between income from sources within the United States, space, or international water, and outside the United States and space and international water, to the satisfaction of the Commissioner, based on the facts and circumstances, which may include functions performed, resources employed, risks assumed, or other contributions to value, income from outside the United States and space and international water will be treated as foreign source income. When a foreign person is entitled to the benefits of a tax treaty with the United States, such person may elect to be taxed under the rules of that treaty, so that, for example, the United States would tax only income attributable to a permanent establishment of that foreign person, regardless of the amount of income considered effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. b. Source Rules for Sales of Certain Property Taxpayers must apply the rules of section 863(d) and these proposed regulations to determine the source of income from sales of property purchased or produced by the taxpayer, either when production occurs in whole or in part in space or in international water, or when the sale occurs in space or in international water. The rules of sections 861, 862, 863(a) and (b), and 865, and the regulations thereunder apply only to the extent provided in proposed regulations 1.8638(b)(4). Proposed regulations 1.8638(b)(4)(i) provides that income derived from the sale of purchased property in space or international water is sourced under paragraph (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section. Proposed regulations 1.8638(d)(2)(iii) provides that a sale occurs in space or international water if either property is located in space or international water at the time the rights, title, and interests pass to the purchaser, or the property sold is for use in space or international water. This rule for determining if a sale takes place in space or in international water modifies for space and ocean activity the rule in 1.8617(c) for otherwise determining where a sale takes place. The IRS and Treasury believe this rule for determining the place of sale in the case of space or  200111 I.R.B.  821  March 12, 2001   ocean activity is consistent with the legislative history of section 863(d), indicating Congress intended that space and ocean activity be broadly defined. See S. Rept. No. 313, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 357 (1986) (Senate Report). It is also consistent with the language of the Senate Report stating that the committee did not intend to override the title passage rule for sales of property on the high seas. Consistent with this language, proposed regulations 1.8638(d)(1)(ii) excludes from the definition of ocean activity the sale of inventory on international water, and the source of income from such sales continues to be determined under 1.8617(c). Proposed regulations 1.8638(b) (4)(ii) provides rules for income derived from the sale of property produced by the taxpayer. To determine the source of income derived from the sale of property produced by the taxpayer, proposed regulations 1.8638(b)(4)(ii)(A) provides that the taxpayer must divide gross income from such sale equally between production activity and sales activity. Thus, one-half of the taxpayer 's gross income is attributed to production activity, and the other one-half of such gross income is attributed to sales activity. Proposed regulations 1.8638(b)(4) (ii)(A) provides that income attributable to sales activity is sourced applying the rules applicable to the sale of purchased property. If the taxpayer sells such property in space or international water, the source of income attributable to sales activity is determined under paragraph (b)(1), (2), or (3). If the taxpayer sells such property outside space and outside international water, the source of income attributable to sales activity is determined under 1.8633(c)(2). Proposed regulations 1.8638(b)(4)(ii)(B) provides that income attributable to production activity, when production occurs only in space or in international water, is sourced under paragraphs (b)(1), (2), or (3). When production occurs only outside space and international water, income attributable to production activity is sourced under 1.8633(c)(1). When production activity occurs both in space or in international water and outside space and international water, proposed regulations 1.8638(b) (4)(ii)(C) splits the income attributed to production activity between production  activities occurring in space or in international water, and production activities occurring outside space and international water. Gross income must be allocated to the satisfaction of the Commissioner, based on all relevant facts and circumstances, which may include functions performed, resources employed, risks assumed, and any other contributions to the value of the property. The source of gross income attributable to production activities in space or in international water is sourced under paragraphs (b)(1), (2), or (3). The source of gross income attributable to production activities outside space and international water is determined under 1.8633(c)(1). c. Special Rule for Determining the Source of Income from Services Proposed regulations 1.8638(b)(5) provides that income derived from the performance of services in space or in international water is sourced under paragraph (b)(1), (2), or (3). Proposed regulations 1.8638(d)(2)(ii)(A) provides that a performance of a service is a space or ocean activity when a part of the service, even if de minimis, is performed in space or in international water. The IRS and Treasury believe that Congress intended a broad range of activities be treated as space or ocean activities. The IRS and Treasury recognize that this rule may be over-inclusive in certain cases. Therefore, proposed regulations 1.8638 (b)(5) provides that the taxpayer can allocate gross income derived from the performance of the service between activities that occur in space or international water and activities that occur outside space and international water, to the satisfaction of the Commissioner, based on facts and circumstances, which may include functions performed, resources employed, risks assumed, or other contributions to value. Gross income allocated to activities occurring outside space and international water will be sourced under sections 861, 862, 863, and 865 of the Code. d. Special Rule for Determining the Source of Communications Income A communications activity, as defined in proposed regulations 1.8639(d), also can be a space or ocean activity. Pursuant to the authority granted in section  863(d)(1), proposed regulations 1.8638 (b)(6) provides that income from communications activity that is also a space or ocean activity is sourced under proposed regulations 1.8639(b). 3. Taxable income When a taxpayer allocates gross income under paragraph (b)(3) (allocation for certain foreign persons), paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(C) (allocation between production occurring in space or international water and production occurring outside), or paragraph (b)(5) (allocation between services occurring in space or international water and those occurring outside) of this section, the taxpayer must allocate or apportion expenses, losses, and other deductions under 1.8618 through 1.86114T of the regulations to the class of gross income, which must include the total income so allocated in each case. A taxpayer must then apply the rules of 1.8618 through 1.86114T to properly allocate or apportion amounts of expenses, losses, and other deductions allocated or apportioned to such class of gross income between gross income from sources within the United States and without the United States. When a taxpayer must allocate gross income to the satisfaction of the Commissioner based on the facts and circumstances, IRS and Treasury believe that such allocations would be based generally on section 482 principles. However, IRS and Treasury solicit comments on this approach, including specific comments and examples on alternative methods that could be used to make these allocations. 4. Definition of space and ocean activity a. General Rules Section 863(d)(2) provides that space or ocean activity means any activity conducted in space, and any activity conducted in or under water not within the jurisdiction of the United States or a foreign country. Proposed regulations 1.8638(d)(1)(i) defines space as any area not within the jurisdiction (as recognized by the United States) of a foreign country, possession of the United States, or the United States, and not in international water. Proposed regulations 1.8638(d)(1)(i) provides that space activity is any activity  March 12, 2001  822  200111 I.R.B.   conducted in space, with certain exceptions. Space activity includes performance and provision of services in space, leasing of equipment or other property, including spacecraft (e.g., satellites) or transponders, located in space, licensing of technology or other intangibles for use in space, and the production, processing, or creation of property in space. Space activity includes the sale of property in space. Space activity also includes underwriting income from the insurance of risks on activities that produce income derived from space activity. The inclusion of such underwriting income is consistent with language in the Senate Report. See Senate Report at 357. Proposed regulations 1.8638(d)(1) (ii) provides that ocean activity is any activity conducted in international water, with certain exceptions. Ocean activity includes performance and provision of services in international water, leasing of equipment or other property located in international water, licensing of technology or other intangibles for use in international water, and the production, processing, or creation of property in international water. Ocean activity includes the sale of property in international water, and the sale of inventory under international water, but does not include the selling of inventory if the sale takes place on international water. Thus, if property sold on international water is inventory property, income attributable to sales activity is sourced under 1.8617(c). Ocean activity also includes underwriting income from the insurance of risks on activities that produce income derived from ocean activity. The inclusion of such underwriting income is consistent with language in the Senate Report. See Senate Report at 357. Ocean activity also includes any activity performed in Antarctica. Ocean activity further includes the leasing of a vessel if such vessel does not transport cargo or persons for hire between ports-of-call. Thus, for example, income earned by a lessor of a vessel that is to engage only in research activities in international water is ocean income. Ocean activity also includes the leasing of drilling rigs, extraction of minerals, and performance and provision of services related thereto, to the extent the mines, oil and gas wells, or other natural deposits are not within the  jurisdiction of the United States, U.S. possessions, or any foreign country (as defined in section 638). Based on legislative history, the IRS and Treasury believe space and ocean activity should be broadly defined based on legislative history. The legislative history clearly indicates that Congress intended to characterize certain land based activity as space or ocean activity. See Senate Report at 357. Consistent with that determination, the proposed regulations provide that when activities occur both in space or in international water and outside space and international water, and constitute parts of a single transaction described in 1.8638(d)(1), the transaction will be characterized as space or ocean activity. Thus, for example, income from the lease of equipment located in space will be sourced in its entirety under section 863(d), even though certain functions associated with the transaction may be performed outside space and international water. The rules of this section for defining space or ocean activity by combining activities occurring both in space or in international water and outside space and international water simply reflect existing principles for characterizing a transaction, and are fully consistent with rules for characterizing income for purposes of other source rules. Taxpayers enjoy flexibility in structuring their transactions that will be characterized under existing principles. To ensure the statutory purpose is not circumvented, the Commissioner may treat parts of a transaction as separate transactions, or combine separate transactions as a single transaction. Certain activities occurring in space or international water are not considered either space or ocean activity. Proposed regulations 1.8638(d)(3)(i) provides that space or ocean activity does not include any activity giving rise to transportation income as defined in section 863(c). Proposed regulations 1.8638 (d)(3)(ii) provides that space or ocean activity also does not include any activity with respect to mines, oil and gas wells, or other natural deposits to the extent the mines or wells are located within the jurisdiction (as recognized by the United States) of any country, including the United States and its possessions (as defined in section 638). Proposed regulations 1.8638(d)(3)(iii) provides that  space or ocean activity does not include any activity giving rise to international communications income as defined in proposed regulations 1.8639(d)(3)(ii). These exceptions are consistent with section 863(d)(2)(B) of the Code. b. Special Rules in Determining Space or Ocean Activity Proposed regulations 1.8638(d) (2)(ii)(A) provides that services are performed in space or in international water if functions are performed, resources employed, risks assumed, or other contributions to the value of the transaction occur in space or international water, whether such contributions are performed by personnel, or equipment, or otherwise. The IRS and Treasury believe that all contributions to a transaction's value, whether contributed by personnel, equipment, or otherwise, should be considered in determining whether services are performed in space or international water. Proposed regulations 1.8638(d) (2)(ii)(A) provides that the performance of a service is treated as a space or ocean activity if a part of the service is performed in space or international water. The IRS and Treasury recognize that this rule may be over-inclusive in certain cases. Therefore, proposed regulations 1.8638(d)(2)(ii)(B) provides that the performance of a service will not be a space or ocean activity if the only activity of the taxpayer in space or in international water is to facilitate the taxpayer 's own communications, as part of provision or delivery of a service by the taxpayer, and that service would not otherwise be in whole or in part a space or ocean activity. Several examples in the regulations illustrate this facilitation exception. The IRS and Treasury recognize that taxpayers may use communications services in conducting a business, and the fact that such communications may be routed through space or international water instead of by way of land should not produce differences in the source of the taxpayer 's income derived from such service. 5. Treatment of partnerships Proposed regulations 1.8638(e) provides that for U.S. partnerships, section  200111 I.R.B.  823  March 12, 2001   863(d) and the regulations thereunder will be applied at the partnership level. The IRS and Treasury believe this rule is consistent with section 7701(a)(30)(B), which defines a U.S. person as a domestic partnership. For foreign partnerships, section 863(d) and the regulations thereunder will be applied at the partner level. The proposed regulations provide a different rule for foreign partnerships because IRS and Treasury are concerned that U.S. persons may use a foreign partnership to circumvent the purposes of this section. For example, two U.S. persons by the simple expediency of forming a foreign partnership can change significantly the U.S. tax consequences under section 863(d). 6. Reporting and documentation requirements When a taxpayer allocates gross income to the satisfaction of the Commissioner under 1.8638(b)(3) (income of certain foreign persons), 1.8638(b)(4)(ii)(C) (certain production activity), or under 1.8638(b)(5) (services) of the proposed regulations, the taxpayer must do so by making the allocation on a timely filed original return (including extensions). An amended return does not qualify, and section 9100 relief will not be available. In all cases, a taxpayer must maintain contemporaneous documentation regarding the allocation of gross income, and allocation of expenses, losses, and other deductions, the methodology used, and the circumstances justifying use of that methodology. The taxpayer must produce such documentation within 30 days upon request. B. Communications Activity Under Sections 863(a), (d), and (e) 1. Scope Section 1.8639 of the proposed regulations provides rules for sourcing income derived from communications activity, notwithstanding any other section. Pursuant to proposed regulations 1.863 8, these source rules apply to communications activity that is also space or ocean activity.  2. Source of gross income derived from communications activity a. International Communications Income Section 863(e)(1)(A) states that any international communications income of a U.S. person will be sourced 50 percent to the United States and 50 percent to foreign sources. Proposed regulations 1.8639(b)(2)(i) provides that international communications income of a U.S. person will be sourced 50 percent to the United States and 50 percent to foreign sources. Section 863(e)(1)(B)(i) provides that any international communications income of a foreign person will be foreign source income except as provided in regulations or in section 863(e)(1)(B)(ii). Proposed regulations 1.8639(b)(2)(ii)(A) states the general rule that international communications income of a foreign person is foreign source income. However, the proposed regulations contain several exceptions to the general rule. Proposed regulations 1.8639(b)(2) (ii)(B) states that if a foreign corporation is 50 percent or more owned by vote or value (directly, indirectly, or constructively) by U.S. persons, or is a controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of section 957, all international communications income is U.S. source income. This rule reflects IRS and Treasury's concern that U.S. persons may use a foreign corporation to obtain benefits that are inconsistent with the purposes of this section. Section 863(e)(1)(B)(ii) provides that if a foreign person has a U.S. fixed place of business, international communications income attributable to the fixed place of business is U.S. source income. Consistent with section 863(e)(1)(B)(ii), proposed regulations 1.8639(b)(2) (ii)(C) states that if a foreign person, other than a foreign person described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A), maintains an office or other fixed place of business in the United States, any international communications income attributable to the office or other fixed place of business is U.S. source income. The principles of section 864(c)(5) will apply to determine whether  a foreign person has an office or fixed place of business in the United States. This rule does not apply if the foreign person is engaged in a U.S. trade or business. Proposed regulations 1.8639(b) (2)(ii)(D) provides that if a foreign person is engaged in a U.S. trade or business, the foreign person's international communications income is presumed to be U.S. source income. The rule reflects IRS and Treasury's concern that a foreign person could avoid a U.S. fixed place of business under section 863(e)(1)(B)(ii), yet engage in significant communications activity in the United States. The IRS and Treasury believe Congress intended that a foreign person engaged in substantial U.S. business in the United States be subject to U.S. tax on that communications activity. The IRS and Treasury recognize that this rule may be over-inclusive in certain cases. Therefore, the proposed regulations provide that if the foreign person can allocate income to international communications activity outside the United States and space and international water, to the satisfaction of the Commissioner, based on the facts and circumstances, which may include functions performed, resources employed, risks assumed, or other contributions to value, then the income allocated to such communications activity outside the United States and space and international water will be foreign source income. When a foreign person is entitled to the benefits of a tax treaty with the United States, such person may elect to be taxed under the rules of that treaty, so that, for example, the United States would tax only income attributable to a permanent establishment of that foreign person, regardless of the amount of income considered effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. b. Other Communications Income The proposed regulations also provide rules, for both U.S. and foreign persons, for determining the source of income from communications activity that does not qualify as international communications activity. The IRS and Treasury believe rules that address income from  March 12, 2001  824  200111 I.R.B.   other communications activities are necessary based on the legislative history. See Senate Report at 357. Proposed regulations 1.8639(b)(3) states that the source of income derived by either a U.S. or foreign person from U.S. communications activity is U.S. source income. Proposed regulations 1.8639(b)(4) states that the source of income derived by either a U.S. or foreign person from foreign communications activity is foreign source income. Proposed regulations 1.8639(b)(5) states that the source of income derived from space/ocean communications activity is determined under section 863(d) and the regulations thereunder. 3. Taxable income When a taxpayer allocates gross income under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D) (certain foreign persons), or (d)(1)(ii) (determining a communications activity), the taxpayer must allocate or apportion expenses, losses, and other deductions as prescribed in 1.8618 through 1.86114T of the regulations to the class of gross income, which must include the total income so allocated in each case. A taxpayer must then apply the rules of 1.8618 through 1.86114T of the regulations to properly allocate or apportion amounts of expenses, losses, and other deductions allocated or apportioned to such gross income between gross income from sources within the United States and without the United States. For amounts of expenses, losses, and other deductions allocated or apportioned to gross income derived from international communications activity, when the source of income is determined under the 50/50 method of paragraph (b)(2)(i), taxpayers must apportion expenses and other deductions between U.S. and foreign sources pro rata based on the relative amounts of U.S. and foreign source gross income. Research and experimental expenditures qualifying under 1.86117 are allocated under that section. When a taxpayer must allocate gross income to the satisfaction of the Commissioner based on the facts and circumstances, IRS and Treasury believe that such allocations would be based generally on section 482 principles. However, IRS and Treasury solicit com-  ments on this approach, including specific comments and examples on alternative methods that could be used to make these allocations. 4. Definition of communications activity and income derived from communications activity a. Communications Activity Proposed regulations 1.8639(d)(1) defines a communications activity as an activity consisting solely in the delivery by transmission of communications or data (communications). The definition of a communications activity is limited to the function of transmitting a particular communication from point A to point B. The delivery of communications by means other than transmission, for example, delivery of a letter is not a communications activity. The IRS and Treasury believe that this narrow definition of communications activity is consistent with the legislative history of section 863(e). See Senate Report at 357. The provision of capacity to transmit communications or data is considered to be a communications activity. For example, the provision of satellite transponder capacity can qualify as a communications activity. The provision of content or any other additional service will not be treated as a communications activity unless de minimis. For example, changes in the form of a voice communication when switching from analog technology to digital data for Internet telephony would be disregarded in determining whether there has been a transmission of communications within the meaning of proposed regulations 1.8639(d). However, payment for information from a data base sent electronically, or for income attributable to an entertainment event transmitted electronically, would not be income derived from a communications activity. When the provision of content or any other services is de minimis, such content or services are ignored, and the transaction will be treated solely as the transmission of communications within the meaning of proposed regulations 1.8639 (d)(1). The determination of whether the provision of content or other services is de minimis should be based on all the facts and circumstances. The IRS and Treasury  believe the exclusion of content and other services is consistent with the legislative history of section 863(e). No evidence exists in the Congressional testimony or in the legislative history that content provided by transmission was to be considered a communications activity. Proposed regulations 1.8639(d)(1) (ii) requires that a transaction encompassing non-de minimis communications activities and non-de minimis non-communications activities must be broken into parts and each part treated as a separate transaction. Proposed regulations 1.8639(d)(1)(ii) states that gross income derived from the activities must be allocated to each separate transaction, to the satisfaction of the Commissioner, based on all relevant facts and circumstances, which may include functions performed, resources employed, risks assumed, and any other contributions to the value of the respective transactions. For example, a payment by an advertiser to a TV broadcast station may be in part a payment for transmission of the advertisement, but could also be a payment for other property or services, for example the transmitter 's ability to reach a particular market or audience. Such activities, if not de minimis, must be treated as non-communications activities under 1.8639(d)(1)(ii) of the proposed regulations. To ensure the statutory purposes are not circumvented, the Commissioner may treat parts of a transaction as separate transactions, or construe separate transactions as a single transaction. b. Income Derived from Communications Activity Income derived from communications activity is defined in proposed regulations 1.8639(d)(2) as income derived from the transmission of communications, including income derived from the provision of capacity to transmit communications. There is no requirement that the income recipient perform the transmission function. This rule reflects IRS and Treasury's understanding that those providing communications services often use capacity owned or operated by others. However, income is derived from communications activity only if the taxpayer is paid to transmit, and bears the risk of transmitting, the communications.  200111 I.R.B.  825  March 12, 2001   c. Character of Communications Activity Proposed regulations 1.8639(d)(3) provides rules for characterizing income derived from a communications activity for purposes of sourcing the income derived from such activity. The character of income derived from communications activity is determined by establishing the two points between which the taxpayer is paid to transmit, and bears the risk of transmitting, the communication. Under the paid-to-do rule, the path the communication takes between the two points is not relevant in determining the character of the transmission. If a taxpayer is paid to take a communication from one point to another point, income derived from the transmission is characterized based on the transmission between those two points, even though the taxpayer contracts out part of the transmission to another. This rule reflects IRS and Treasury's recognition that those providing communications often use the network owned or operated by others. Several examples in the proposed regulations illustrate the paid-to-do rule. Proposed regulations 1.8639(d)(3) (ii) defines income derived from international communications activity as the transmission from a point in the United States and a point in a foreign country (or a possession of the United States). Proposed regulations 1.8639(d)(3)(iii) defines income derived from U.S. communications activity as the transmission between two points in the United States or a point in the United States and a point in space or international water. Proposed regulations 1.8639(d)(3) (iv) defines income derived from foreign communications activity as the transmission between two points either in a foreign country or in foreign countries or a point in a foreign country and a point in space or international water. Proposed regulations 1.8639(d)(3)(v) defines income derived from space/ocean communications activity as the transmission between a point in space or international water and another point in space or international water. The IRS and Treasury believe these rules are consistent with the legislative history. See Senate Report at 357. When the taxpayer cannot establish the two points between which the taxpayer is paid to transmit, the source of income de-  rived from such activity, for either a U.S. or foreign person, is U.S. source income. Thus, for example, when a provider of communications services provides both local and international long distance along with cable services in one-price bundles for a set amount each month, tracing each transmission may not be possible or practical. In such cases, the source of income derived from communications activity is U.S. source income. The IRS and Treasury understand that many in the communications industry may not consider it practical or possible to prove the end points of the communications the taxpayer transmits. The IRS and Treasury solicit comments as to proposals for those situations when taxpayers cannot establish the points between which the taxpayer is paid to transmit the communications. 5. Treatment of partnerships Proposed regulations 1.8639(e) provides, in general, that for U.S. partnerships, section 863(e) and the regulations thereunder will be applied at the partnership level. The IRS and Treasury believe this rule is consistent with section 7701(a)(30)(B), which defines a U.S. person as a domestic partnership. For foreign partnerships, and in the case of a U.S. partnership in which 50 percent or more of the partnership interests are owned by foreign persons, section 863(e) and the regulations thereunder will be applied at the partner level. The proposed regulations provide a different rule for foreign partnerships and for U.S. partnerships with substantial foreign ownership because the IRS and Treasury are concerned that U.S. persons may use such partnerships to circumvent the purposes of this section. 6. Reporting rules and documentation requirements When a taxpayer allocates gross income to the satisfaction of the Commissioner under proposed regulations 1.8639(b)(2)(ii)(D) (certain foreign persons) or (d)(1)(ii) (determining a communications activity), it does so by making the allocation on a timely filed original return (including extensions). An amended return does not qualify, and section 9100 relief will not be available. In all cases, a taxpayer must maintain con-  temporaneous documentation regarding the allocation of gross income, and allocation of expenses, losses and other deductions, the methodology used, and the circumstances justifying use of that methodology. The taxpayer must produce such documentation within 30 days upon request. C. Amendment to the 1.8633 Regulations These proposed regulations amend the regulations under 1.8633 for determining the source of income in certain inventory sales. The regulations provide that in determining the source of income from sales of property when the property is either (i) produced in whole or in part in space or in international water, or (ii) sold in space or in international water , the rules of 1.8638 of the proposed regulations apply. The rules of sections 863(a) and (b), and the regulations under those sections, do not apply to determine the source of income in such cases, except to the extent provided in 1.8638 of the proposed regulations. The proposed regulations in 1.8638(b)(4)(ii)(A) provide, however, that the source of income from sales of inventory on international water continues to be sourced under 1.863 3(c)(2). The regulations in 1.863 3(a)(1) and 3(c)(1)(i)(A) are amended to reflect these provisions. The proposed regulations also amend 1.8633(c)(2) to provide that the place of sale will be presumed to be the United States, for purposes of that section, when property is produced in the United States and the property is sold to a U.S. resident for use, consumption, or disposition in space. See 1.8646(b)(3) for determining whether property is used in space and whether the sale is to a U.S. resident. These rules reflect the views of Treasury and the IRS that sales of satellites or transponders by a U.S. resident in space should produce U.S. source income. These rules also reflect the view that sales of such property by a U.S. resident to a U.S. purchaser should produce U.S. source income. Treasury and the IRS believe that these provisions are consistent with Congress' intent in enacting section 863(d) to tax U.S. persons on a residency basis on income that is not likely to be subject to foreign tax  March 12, 2001  826  200111 I.R.B.   by a foreign country. It is also consistent with the tax policy of the foreign tax credit that income not likely to be subject to foreign tax should not be treated as foreign source income, which would inappropriately allow taxpayers with excess foreign tax credits to shelter this income from U.S. tax. Proposed Effective Dates These regulations are proposed to apply for taxable years beginning on or after the date that is 30 days after the date of publication of final regulations in the Federal Register. Special Analyses It has been determined that this notice of proposed rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It is hereby certified that these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This certification is based on the fact that the rules of this section principally impact large multinationals who pay foreign taxes on substantial foreign operations and therefore the rules will impact very few small entities. Moreover, in those few instances where the rules of this section impact small entities, the economic impact on such entities is not likely to be significant. Accordingly, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, this notice of proposed rulemaking will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business. Comments and Public Hearing Before these proposed regulations are adopted as final regulations, consideration will be given to any comments that are submitted timely (in the manner described under the ADDRESSES caption) to the IRS. The IRS and Treasury specifically request comments on the clarity of the proposed regulations and how they may be made easier to understand. All comments will be available for public inspection and copying. A public hearing has been scheduled for March 28, 2001, at 10 a.m., in the  auditorium, seventh floor, Internal Revenue Building, 1111 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC. Due to building security procedures, visitors must enter at the 10th Street entrance, located between Constitution and Pennsylvania Avenues, NW. In addition, all visitors must present photo identification to enter the building. Because of access restrictions, visitors will not be admitted beyond the immediate entrance area more than 15 minutes before the hearing starts. For information about having your name placed on the building access list to attend the hearing, see the ""FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT"" section of this preamble. The rules of 26 CFR 601.601(a)(3) apply to the hearing. Persons who wish to present oral comments at the hearing must submit comments and an outline of topics to be discussed and the time to be devoted to each topic (in the manner described under the ADDRESSES caption of this preamble) by March 7, 2001. A period of 10 minutes will be allotted to each person for making comments. An agenda showing the scheduling of the speakers will be prepared after the deadline for receiving outlines has passed. Copies of the agenda will be available free of charge at the hearing. Drafting Information The principal author of these regulations is Anne Shelburne, Office of Associate Chief Counsel (International). However, other personnel from the IRS and Treasury Department participated in their development. ***** Proposed Amendments to the Regulations Accordingly, 26 CFR part 1 is proposed to be amended as follows: PART 1--INCOME TAXES Paragraph 1. The authority citation for part 1 is amended by adding entries in numerical order to read as follows: Authority: 26 U.S.C. 7805 * * * Section 1.8638 also issued under 26 U.S.C. 863(a), (b) and (d). Section 1.8639 also issued under 26 U.S.C. 863(a), (d) and (e). * * * Par. 2 Section 1.8633 is amended by:  1. Adding a sentence after the first sentence in paragraph (a)(1). 2. Adding a sentence at the end of paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A). 3. Adding three sentences, one after the current first sentence of paragraph (c)(2), and the other two sentences after the current second sentence of paragraph (c)(2). The additions read as follows: 1.8633 Allocation and apportionment of income from certain sales of inventory. (a) * * * (1) * * *To determine the source of income from sales of property produced by the taxpayer, when the property is either produced in whole or in part in space or on or under water not within the jurisdiction (as recognized by the United States) of a foreign country, possession of the United States, or the United States (in international water), or is sold in space or in international water, the rules of 1.8638 apply, and the rules of this section do not apply, except to the extent provided in 1.8638. * * * ***** (c) * * * (1) * * *(i) * * *(A) * * * For rules regarding the source of income when production takes place, in whole or in part, in space or in international water, the rules of 1.8638 apply, and the rules of this section do not apply except to the extent provided in 1.8638. ***** (c)(2) * * * Notwithstanding any other provision, for rules regarding the source of income when a sale takes place in space or in international water, the rules of 1.8638 apply, and the rules of this section do not apply except to the extent provided in 1.8638. * * * The place of sale will be presumed to be the United States under this rule when property is produced in the United States and the property is sold to a U.S. resident, who uses the property in space or in international water. In such cases, the property will be treated as sold for use, consumption, or disposition in the United States. ***** Par. 3 Section 1.8638 and 1.8639 are added to read as follows: 1.8638 Source of income from space and ocean activity under section 863(d). (a) In general. Income of a U.S. or a foreign person derived from space or  200111 I.R.B.  827  March 12, 2001   ocean activity (space or ocean income) is sourced under the rules of this section, notwithstanding any other provision, including sections 861, 862, 863, and 865. A taxpayer will not be considered to derive income from space or ocean activity, as defined in paragraph (d) of this section, if such activity is performed by another person, subject to the rules for the treatment of consolidated groups in section 1.150213. (b) Source of gross income from space or ocean activity--(1) In general. Income derived by a U.S. person from space or ocean activity is income from sources within the United States, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b). Income derived by a person other than a United States person from space or ocean activity is income from sources without the United States, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b). (2) Income derived by certain foreign corporations. If a U.S. person or U.S. persons own 50 percent or more of the vote or value of the stock of a foreign corporation (directly, indirectly or constructively) that is not a controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of section 957, all income derived by that foreign corporation from space or ocean activity is U.S. source income. (3) Income derived by foreign persons engaged in a U.S. trade or business. If a foreign person, other than a controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of section 957 or a foreign person described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, is engaged in a U.S. trade or business, all income derived by that person from space or ocean activity is presumed to be U.S. source income. However, if the foreign person can allocate income between sources within the United States, or space, or international water, and sources outside the United States and space and international water, to the satisfaction of the Commissioner, based on the facts and circumstances, which may include functions performed, resources employed, risks assumed, or other contributions to value, then space or ocean income allocated to sources outside the United States and space and international water shall be treated as from sources outside the United States. (4) Source rules for income from certain sales of property--(i) Sales of pur-  chased property. When a taxpayer sells property in space or in international water, the source of gross income shall be determined under paragraph (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section as applicable. However, if inventory, within the meaning of section 1221(1), is sold on international water, the source of income shall be determined under 1.8633(c)(2). (ii) Sales of property produced by the taxpayer--(A) General. If the taxpayer both produces property and also sells such property, the taxpayer must divide gross income from such sales between production activity and sales activity under the 50/50 method as described in this paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A). Under the 50/50 method, one-half of the taxpayer 's gross income will be considered income attributable to production activity, and the source of that income will be determined under paragraphs (b)(4)(ii)(B) or (C) of this section. The remaining one-half of such gross income will be considered income attributable to sales activity and the source of that income will be determined under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section. However, if the taxpayer sells such property outside space and outside international water, the source of gross income attributable to sales activity will be determined under 1.8633(c)(2). (B) Production only in space or in international water, or only outside space and international water. When production occurs only in space or in international water, income attributable to production activity is sourced under paragraph (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section as space or ocean income. When production occurs only outside space and international water, income attributable to production activity is sourced under 1.8633(c)(1). (C) Production both in space or in international water and outside space and international water. When property is produced in space or in international water and outside space and international water, gross income must be allocated to production occurring in space or in international water and production occurring outside space and international water, to the satisfaction of the Commissioner, based on all the facts and circumstances, which may include functions performed, resources employed, risks assumed, and any other contributions to value. The  source of gross income allocated to space or international water is determined under paragraph (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section. The source of gross income allocated outside space and international water is determined under 1.8633(c)(1). (5) Special rule for determining the source of gross income from services. If a transaction characterized as the performance of services constitutes a space or ocean activity by reason of the performance of part of the service in space or in international water, as determined under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, the source of all gross income derived from such transaction of which such performance is a part is determined under paragraph (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section. However, if the taxpayer can allocate gross income between performance occurring outside space and international water, and performance occurring in space or international water, to the satisfaction of the Commissioner, based on the facts and circumstances, including functions performed, resources employed, risks assumed, or other contributions to value, then the source of income allocated to performance occurring outside space and international water shall be determined under sections 861, 862, 863, and 865. (6) Special rule for determining source of income from communications activity (other than income from international communications activity). Space and ocean activity, as defined in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section, includes activity occurring in space or in international water that is characterized as a communications activity as defined in 1.8639(d). The source of gross income from space or ocean activity that is also a communications activity as defined in 1.8639(d) is determined under the rules of 1.8639(b), rather than under paragraph (b) of this section. (c) Taxable income. When a taxpayer allocates gross income under paragraph (b)(3), (b)(4)(ii)(C), or(b)(5) of this section, to the satisfaction of the Commissioner, based on all the facts and circumstances, the taxpayer must allocate or apportion expenses, losses, and other deductions as prescribed in 1.8618 through 1.86114T to the class of gross income, which must include the total income so allocated in each case. A tax-  March 12, 2001  828  200111 I.R.B.   payer must then apply the rules of 1.8618 through 1.86114T to properly allocate or apportion amounts of expenses, losses, and other deductions allocated or apportioned to such gross income between gross income from sources within the United States and without the United States. (d) Space and Ocean activity--(1) Definition--(i) Space activity. In general, space activity is any activity conducted in space. Space activity includes performance and provision of services in space, as defined in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, leasing of equipment located in space, including spacecraft (e.g., satellites) or transponders located in space, licensing of technology or other intangibles for use in space, and the production, processing, or creation of property in space, as defined in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section. Space activity includes activity occurring in space that is characterized as communications activity (other than international communications activity) under 1.8639(d). Space activity also includes underwriting income from the insurance of risks on activities that produce space income. Space activity includes the sale in space of property, as defined in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section. For purposes of this section, space means any area not within the jurisdiction (as recognized by the United States) of a foreign country, possession of the United States, or the United States, and not in international water. For purposes of determining space activity, the Commissioner may separate parts of a single transaction into separate transactions or combine separate transactions as parts of a single transaction. Paragraph (d)(3) of this section lists exceptions to the general rule. (ii) Ocean activity. In general, ocean activity is any activity conducted on or under water not within the jurisdiction (as recognized by the United States) of a foreign country, possession of the United States, or the United States (collectively, in international water). Ocean activity includes performance and provision of services in international water, as defined in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, leasing of equipment located in international water, including underwater cables, licensing of technology or other intangibles for use in international water, and the  production, processing, or creation of property in international water, as defined in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section. Ocean activity includes sales of property in international water, as defined in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section, but ocean activity does not include the selling of inventory as defined in section 1221(1) on international water. Ocean activity includes activity occurring in international water that is characterized as communications activity (other than international communications activity) under 1.8639(d). Ocean activity also includes underwriting income from the insurance of risks on activities that produce ocean income. Ocean activity also includes any activity performed in Antarctica. Ocean activity further includes the leasing of a vessel if such vessel does not transport cargo or persons for hire between portsof-call. Thus, for example, the leasing of a vessel that is to engage only in research activities in international water is an ocean activity. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, ocean activity also includes the leasing of drilling rigs, extraction of minerals, and performance and provision of services related thereto. For purposes of determining ocean activity, the Commissioner may separate parts of a single transaction into separate transactions or combine separate transactions as parts of a single transaction. Paragraph (d)(3) of this section lists exceptions to the general rule. (2) Determining a space or ocean activity--(i) Production of property in space or in international water. For purposes of this section, production activity means an activity that creates, fabricates, manufactures, extracts, processes, cures, or ages property within the meaning of sections 864(a) and 1.8641. (ii) Special rule for performance of services--(A) General. If a transaction is characterized as the performance of a service, then such service will be treated as a space or ocean activity when a part of the service, even if de minimis, is performed in space or in international water. Services are performed in space or in international water if functions are performed, resources employed, risks assumed, or other contributions to value occur in space or in international water, regardless of whether performed by personnel, or equipment, or otherwise.  (B) Exception to the general rulefacilitating the taxpayer 's own communications. If a taxpayer 's only activity in space or in international water is to facilitate the taxpayer 's own communications as part of the provision or delivery of a service provided by the taxpayer, and that service would not otherwise be in whole or in part a space or ocean activity, such service will not be treated as either space or ocean activity because of such facilitation. (iii) Sale in space or in international water. In applying 1.861-7(c) to determine where a sale takes place, property will be sold in space or in international water if the property is located in space or in international water when rights, title and interest pass to the buyer (or when bare legal title is retained, at the time and place of passage of beneficial ownership and risk of loss), or if property is sold for use in space or in international water. (3) Exceptions to space or ocean activity. Space or ocean activity does not include the following types of activities-- (i) Any activity giving rise to transportation income as defined in section 863(c); or (ii) Any activity with respect to mines, oil and gas wells, or other natural deposits to the extent the mines or wells are located within the jurisdiction (as recognized by the United States) of any country, including the United States and its possessions; or (iii) Any activity giving rise to international communications income as defined in 1.8639(d)(3)(ii). (e) Treatment of partnerships. In the case of a U.S. partnership, this section will be applied at the partnership level. In the case of a foreign partnership, this section will be applied at the partner level. (f) Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this section: Example 1. Space activity-activity occurring on land and in space. (i) Facts. S owns satellites, and leases one of its satellites to A. S, as lessor, will not operate the satellite. Part of S's performance as lessor in this transaction occurs on land. (ii) Analysis. The combination of S's activities is characterized as the lease of equipment. Since the equipment is located in space, the transaction is defined as space activity under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section. Income derived from the lease will be sourced in its entirety under paragraph (b) of this section. Example 2. Space activity. (i) Facts. X is an Internet service provider, offering a service to per-  200111 I.R.B.  829  March 12, 2001   sonal computer users accessing the Internet. This service permits a customer, C, to make a call, initiated by a modem, routed to a control center, for connection to the World Wide Web. X transmits the requested information over its satellite capacity leased from S to C's personal computer. X charges its customers a flat monthly fee. Assume neither X nor S derive international communications income within the meaning of 1.8639(d)(3)(ii). (ii) Analysis. In this case, X performs a service, and X's activity in space is not simply facilitation within the meaning of paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, because X's activity is not simply the facilitation of X's own communications and because X's activity is not just part of another service provided by X. Thus, X's activity constitutes space activity in its entirety under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, and the source of X's income is determined under paragraph (b) of this section. To the extent X derives income from communications activity, within the meaning of 1.8639(d), the source of X's income is determined under 1.8639(b), as provided in paragraph (b)(6) of this section. S derives communications income within the meaning of 1.8639(d), and therefore the source of S's income is determined under 1.8639(b), as provided in paragraph (b)(6) of this section. Example 3. Services as space activity-facilitation of communications. (i) Facts. R owns a retail outlet in the United States. R employs S to provide a security system for R's premises. S operates its security system by transmitting images from R's premises to a satellite, and from there to a group of S employees located in Country B, who then monitor the premises by viewing the transmitted images. O provides S with transponder capacity on O's satellite, which S uses to transmit those images. (ii) Analysis. S derives income for providing monitoring services. Because, in this case, S uses O's satellite transponder to transmit images to facilitate S's own communications in space as part of its provision of a security service, S's activity in space is limited to facilitating communications as described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) of this section. Thus, S is not engaged in a space activity, and none of S's income is space income. Assuming O's provision of capacity is viewed as the provision of a service, O's activity in space is not simply the facilitation of communications as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, because O is not just facilitating its own communications. Thus, O's activity is characterized as space activity in its entirety under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section (unless O's activity in space qualifies as international communications activity). To the extent O derives income from communications activity, within the meaning of 1.8639(d), the source of O's income is determined under 1.8639(b), as provided in paragraph (b)(6) of this section. On these facts, R does not derive any income from space activity. Example 4. Space activity. (i) Facts. L, a U.S. company, offers programming and also certain services to customers located both in the United States and in foreign countries. Assume L's provision of programming and services in this case was viewed as the provision of a service, with no part of that service occurring in space. L uses satellite capacity acquired from S to deliver the service directly to customers' television sets, so that the delivery of the service occurs in space. Assume the delivery in this  case is not considered de minimis. L also acquires programming from H, and L pays H a royalty for use of copyrighted material in the United States and in foreign countries. Customer, C, pays L for delivery of the service to C's residence in the United States. Assume S's provision of capacity in this case was viewed as the provision of a service, and also that S does not derive international communications income within the meaning of 1.8639(d)(3)(ii). (ii) Analysis. On these facts, S's activity in space is not just the facilitation of its own communications within the meaning of paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, because S is facilitating the communications of others. To the extent S derives income from a space activity that is also a communications activity under 1.8639(d), the source of S's income is determined under 1.8639(b), as provided in paragraph (b)(6) of this section. On these facts, L is treated as providing a service and is paid to deliver that service to its customers, and each transaction, i.e., the provision of the service and the delivery of the service, constitutes a separate transaction. L's income derived from provision of the service is not income derived from space activity. L's income derived from delivery of the service is space activity. L's delivery of the service is not just the facilitation of L's own communications within the meaning of paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, because it is not just a part of the provision of a service, but instead the entire service. Since L derives communications income within the meaning of 1.8639(d), the source of L's income is determined under 1.8639(b), as provided in paragraph (b)(6) of this section. If on other facts, L provides a service and delivers that service, and L treats the provision of the service and the delivery of the service as one separate transaction, then L performs services in space under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, because the delivery of the service occurs in space. However, L's activity in space would be limited to facilitating its own communications within the meaning of paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, because it is part of another service that would not otherwise be a space activity. As a result, L's provision of the service would not be a space activity under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section. Example 5. Space activity--treatment of land activity. (i) Facts. S, a U.S. person, offers remote imaging products and services to its customers. In year 1, S uses its satellite's remote sensors to gather data on certain geographical terrain. In year 3, C, a construction development company, contracts with S to obtain a satellite image of an area for site development work. S pulls data from its archives and transfers to C the images gathered in year 1, in a transaction that is characterized as a sale of the data. Title to the data passes to C in the United States. Before transferring the images to C, S uses computer software to enhance the images so that the images can be used. (ii) Analysis. The collection of data and creation of images in space is characterized as the creation of property in space. S's income is derived from production of property in part in space, and is, therefore, derived in part from space activity. The source of S's income from production and sale of property is, therefore, determined under paragraph (b)(4) of this section. Since production activity occurs both in space and on land, the source of S's production income is determined under paragraphs (b)(4)(ii)(A)  and (C) of this section. The source of S's income attributable to sales activity is determined under paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this section and 1.8633(c)(2) as U.S. source income. Example 6. Use of intangible property in space. (i) Facts. X acquires a license to use a particular satellite slot or orbit, which X sublicenses to C. C pays X a royalty. (ii) Analysis. Since the royalty is paid for the right to use intangible property in space, the source of X's royalty is determined under paragraph (b) of this section. Example 7. Performance of services. (i) Facts. E, a U.S. company, operates satellites with sensing equipment that can determine how much heat and light particular plants emit and reflect. Based on the data, E will provide F, a U.S. farmer, a report analyzing the data, which F will use in growing crops. E analyzes the data from U.S. offices. (ii) Analysis. Assume E's combined activities are characterized as the performance of services. Because part of the service is performed in space, all income E derives from the transaction will be treated as derived from space activity under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section. The source of such income will be determined under paragraph (b)(5) of this section. If, however, E can allocate gross income, to the satisfaction of the Commissioner, as prescribed in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, then the source of gross income attributable to services performed outside space may be determined as provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this section. Example 8. Separate transactions. (i) Facts. The same facts as Example 7, except that E provides the raw data to F in a transaction characterized as a sale of a copyrighted article, and in addition also provides an analysis in the form of a report to F, a U.S. farmer who uses the information in growing crops. The price F pays E for the raw data is separately stated. (ii) Analysis. To the extent the provision of raw data and the analysis of the data are each treated as separate transactions, the source of income from the production and sale of data is determined under paragraph (b)(4) of this section. The provision of services would be analyzed in the same manner as in Example 7. Example 9. Sale of property under international water. (i) Facts. T owns transatlantic cable lying under the ocean, which it purchased. T sells the cable to B. (ii) Analysis. Because the property is sold under international water as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section, the transaction is ocean activity under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, and the source of income is determined under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, by reference to paragraph (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section. Example 10. Sales of property in space. (i) Facts. S manufactures a satellite in the United States and sells it to a U.S. customer, with the rights, title, and interest passing to the customer when the satellite is located in space. (ii) Analysis. The source of income derived from the sale of the satellite in space is determined under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, with the source of income attributable to production activity determined under paragraphs (b)(4)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section, and the source of income attributable to sales activity determined under paragraphs  March 12, 2001  830  200111 I.R.B.   (b)(4)(ii)(A) and (b)(4)(i) of this section, by reference to paragraph (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section. Example 11. Sale of property located in space. (i) Facts. S has a right to operate from a particular position in space. S sells the right to operate from that satellite slot or orbit to P. (ii) Analysis. Because the sale takes place in space, as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section, gain on the sale of the satellite slot or orbit is income derived from space activity under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, and income from the sale is sourced under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, by reference to paragraph (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section. Example 12. Source of income of a foreign person. (i) Facts. FP, a foreign company, not a controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of section 957, derives income from the operation of satellites. FP operates a ground station in the United States and in foreign country, FC. (ii) Analysis. In this case, FP is engaged in a U.S. trade or business of operating the ground station. Thus, under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, all FP's income derived from space activity is presumed to be U.S. source income. However, if FP can allocate space income to contributions occurring outside the United States, space, and international water, as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, for example, to the ground station located in FC, then such space income so allocated will be from sources outside the United States. Example 13. Source of income of a foreign person. (i) Facts. FP, a foreign company, not a controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of Section 957, operates remote sensing satellites, collecting data and images in space for its customers. FP uses an independent agent, A, in the United States who provides marketing, order taking, and other customer service functions. (ii) Analysis. In this case, FP is engaged in a U.S. trade or business on the basis of A's activities on its behalf in the United States. Therefore, under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, all of FP's income derived from space activity is presumed to be space income. However, if FP can allocate income to contributions occurring outside the United States, space, and international water, as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, then such income so allocated will be from sources outside the United States.  garding the allocation of gross income and allocation or apportionment of expenses, losses and other deductions, the methodology used, and the circumstances justifying use of that methodology. The taxpayer must produce such documentation within 30 days upon request. (h) Effective date. This section applies to taxable years beginning on or after the date that is 30 days after the date of publication of final regulations in the Federal Register. 1.8639 Source of income derived from communications activity under sections 863(a), (d), and (e). (a) In general. Income of a U.S. or foreign person derived from communications activity is sourced under the rules of this section, notwithstanding any other provision including sections 861, 862, 863, and 865. (b) Source of gross income derived from communications activity --(1) In general. The source of gross income derived from each type of communications activity, as defined in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, is determined under this paragraph (b). If a communications activity would qualify as space or ocean activity under section 863(d) and the regulations thereunder, the source of income derived from such communications activity is determined under this section, and not under section 863(d) and the regulations thereunder. See 1.8638(b)(6). (2) Source of international communications income--(i) Income derived by a U.S. person. Under the 50/50 method of this paragraph (b)(2)(i), income derived by a U.S. person from international communications activity is one-half from sources within the United States and onehalf from sources without the United States. (ii) Income derived by for eign persons(A) General rule. Income derived by a person other than a U.S. person from international communications activity is, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b), wholly from sources without the United States. (B) Income derived by certain foreign corporations. If a foreign corporation, in-  (g) Reporting and documentation requirements. When a taxpayer allocates gross income, to the satisfaction of the Commissioner, under paragraph (b)(3), (b)(4)(ii)(C) , or (b)(5) of this section, it does so by making the allocation on a timely filed original return (including extensions). An amended return does not qualify for this purpose, nor shall the provisions of 301.91001 of this chapter and any guidance promulgated thereunder apply. In all cases, a taxpayer must maintain contemporaneous documentation in existence when such return is filed re-  cluding a controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of section 957, is 50 percent or more owned by vote or value (directly, indirectly, or constructively) by U.S. persons, all income derived by that corporation from international communications activity is from sources within the United States. (C) Income derived by foreign persons with a U.S. fixed place of business. If a foreign person (other than a foreign person described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section) maintains an office or other fixed place of business in the United States, the foreign person's international communications income, as determined to the satisfaction of the Commissioner, attributable to the office or other fixed place of business is from sources within the United States. The principles of section 864(c)(5) apply in determining whether a foreign person has an office or fixed place of business in the United States. See 1.8646 and 7. This paragraph does not apply if the foreign person is engaged in a U.S. trade or business. (D) Income derived by foreign persons engaged in a U.S. trade or business. If a foreign person (other than a foreign person described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section) is engaged in a U.S. trade or business, all of the foreign person's international communications income is presumed to be from sources within the United States. However, if the foreign person can allocate income between sources within the United States, or space, or international water and sources outside the United States and space and international water, to the satisfaction of the Commissioner, based on the facts and circumstances, which may include functions performed, resources employed, risks assumed, or other contributions to value, then the income allocated to sources outside the United States and space and international water shall be treated as from sources without the United States. (3) Source of U.S. communications income. The source of income derived by a U.S. or a foreign person from U.S. communications activity is from sources within the United States. (4) Source of foreign communications income. The source of income derived by  200111 I.R.B.  831  March 12, 2001   a U.S. or a foreign person from foreign communications activity is from sources without the United States. (5) Source of space/ocean communications income. The source of income derived by a U.S. or a foreign person from space/ocean communications activity is determined under section 863(d) and the regulations thereunder, without regard to 1.8638(b)(6). (6) Source of communications income when taxpayer cannot establish the two points between which the taxpayer is paid to transmit the communication. The income derived by a U.S. person or foreign person from communications activity, when the taxpayer cannot establish the two points between which the taxpayer is paid to transmit the communication as required in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, is from sources within the United States. (c) Taxable income. When a taxpayer allocates gross income under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D) or (d)(1)(ii) of this section, to the satisfaction of the Commissioner, based on all the facts and circumstances, the taxpayer must allocate or apportion expenses, losses, and other deductions as prescribed in 1.8618 through 1.86114T to the class of gross income, which must include the total income so allocated in each case. A taxpayer must then apply the rules of 1.8618 through 1.86114T to properly allocate or apportion amounts of expenses, losses, and other deductions allocated or apportioned to such gross income between gross income from sources within the United States and without the United States. For amounts of expenses, losses, and other deductions allocated or apportioned to gross income derived from international communications activity, when the source of income is determined under the 50/50 method of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, taxpayers must apportion expenses, losses, and other deductions between sources within and sources without pro rata based on the relative amounts of gross income from sources within the United States and without the United States. Research and experimental expenditures qualifying under 1.86117 are allocated under that section, and are not allocated and apportioned pro rata under the method of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.  (d) Communications activity and income derived from communications activity(1) Communications activity-- (i) General rule. For purposes of this part, communications activity consists solely of the delivery by transmission of communications or data (communications). Delivery of communications other than by transmission, for example, by delivery of physical packages and letters, is not communications activity within the meaning of this section. Communications activity also includes the provision of capacity to transmit communications. Provision of content or any other additional service provided along with, or in connection with, a non-de minimis communications activity must be treated as a separate non-communications activity unless de minimis. (ii) Separate transaction. To the extent a taxpayer 's transaction consists in part of non-de minimis communications activity and in part of non-de minimis non-communications activity, such parts of the transaction must be treated as separate transactions. Gross income must be allocated to each such transaction involving the communications activity and the noncommunications activity to the satisfaction of the Commissioner, based on all relevant facts and circumstances, which may include functions performed, resources employed, risks assumed, and any other contributions to the value of the respective transactions. For purposes of determining whether income is derived from communications activity, the Commissioner may treat communications activity and non-communications activity, treated as a single transaction, as separate transactions, or combine separate communications activity and non-communications activity transactions into a single transaction. (2) Income derived from communications activity. Income derived from communications activity (communications income) is income derived from the delivery by transmission of communications, including income derived from the provision of capacity to transmit communications. Income may be considered derived from a communications activity even if the taxpayer itself does not perform the transmission function, but in all cases, the taxpayer derives communications income only if the taxpayer is paid to transmit,  and bears the risk of transmitting, the communications. (3) Determining the type of communications activity--(i) In general. Whether income is derived from international communications activity, U.S. communications activity, foreign communications activity, or space/ocean communications activity is determined by identifying the two points between which the taxpayer is paid to transmit the communication. The taxpayer must establish to the satisfaction of the Commissioner the two points between which the taxpayer is paid to transmit, and bears the risk of transmitting, the communication. Whether the taxpayer contracts out part or all of the transmission function is not relevant. (ii) Income derived from international communications activity. Income derived by a taxpayer from international communications activity (international communications income) is income derived from communications activity, as defined in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, when the taxpayer is paid to transmit between a point in the United States and a point in a foreign country (or a possession of the United States). (iii) Income derived from U.S. communications activity. Income derived by a taxpayer from U.S. communications activity (U.S. communications income) is income derived from communications activity, as defined in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, when the taxpayer is paid to transmit-- (A) Between two points in the United States; or (B) Between the United States and a point in space or in international water. (iv) Income derived from foreign communications activity. Income derived by a taxpayer from foreign communications activity (foreign communications income) is income derived from communications activity, as defined in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, when the taxpayer is paid to transmit-- (A) Between two points in a foreign country or countries (or possession or possessions of the United States); or (B) Between a foreign country (or a possession of the United States) and a point in space or in international water. (v) Income derived from space/ocean communications activity. Income derived by a taxpayer from space/ocean commu-  March 12, 2001  832  200111 I.R.B.   nications activity (space/ocean communications income) is income derived from a communications activity, as defined in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, when the taxpayer is paid to transmit between a point in space or in international water and another point in space or in international water. (e) Treatment of partnerships--(1) General. In the case of a U.S. partnership, this section will be applied at the partnership level. In the case of a foreign partnership, this section will be applied at the partner level. (2) Exception. In the case of a U.S. partnership in which 50 percent or more of the partnership interests are owned by foreign persons, this section will be applied at the partner level. (f) Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this section: Example 1. Income derived from communications activity. (i) Facts. D provides its customers in various foreign countries with access to its data base. A customer, C, places a toll call to D's telephone number, and can then access D's data base to obtain certain information, such as C's customers' health care coverage. (ii) Analysis. D is not paid to transmit communications and does not derive income solely from transmission of communications within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this section. D instead derives income from provision of content or provision of services to its customers. Example 2. Income derived from U.S. communications activity. (i) Facts. Local telephone company (TC) receives access fees from an international carrier for picking up calls from a local telephone customer and delivering the call to a U.S. point of presence (POP) of the international carrier. The international carrier picks up the call from its U.S. POP and delivers the call to a foreign country. (ii) Analysis. TC is not paid to carry the transmission between the United States and a foreign country. It is paid to transmit communications between two points in the United States. TC derives income from U.S. communications activity as defined in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section, which is sourced under paragraph (b)(3) of this section as U.S. source income. Example 3. Income derived from international communications activity. (i) Facts. TC, a U.S. company, owns an underwater fiber optic cable. Pursuant to three year contracts, TC makes capacity to transmit communications via the cable available to its customers. Such customers then solicit telephone customers and arrange for transmitting their calls. The cable runs in part through U.S. waters, through international waters, and in part through foreign country waters. (ii) Analysis. TC derives income from communications activity under paragraph (d)(2) of this section. The income is derived from international communications activity as provided in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, since TC is paid to make available capacity to transmit between the United  States and a foreign country, and vice versa. Since TC is a U.S. person, TC's international communications income is sourced under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section as one-half from sources within the United States and one-half from sources without the United States. Example 4. Character of communications activity: the paid-to-do rule. (i) Facts. TC is paid to transmit communications from Toronto, Canada, to Paris, France. TC transmits the communication to New York. TC pays another communications company, IC, to transmit the communications from New York to Paris. (ii) Analysis. Under the paid-to-do rule of paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, TC derives income from foreign communications activity under paragraph (d)(3)(iv) of this section, since it is paid to transmit communications between two foreign points, Toronto and Paris. Under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, the character of TC's activity is determined without regard to the fact that TC pays IC to transmit the communication for some portion of the delivery path. IC has international communications income under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, because it is paid to transmit the communication between a point in the United States and a point in a foreign country. Example 5. Income derived from international communications activity. (i) Facts. S, a U.S. satellite operator, owns satellites and the uplink facilities in Country X, a foreign country. B, a resident of Country X, pays S to deliver its programming from Country X to its downlink facility in the United States, owned by C, a customer of B. (ii) Analysis. S derives communications income under paragraph (d) of this section. S's income is characterized as international communications income under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, because S is paid to transmit the communication between the beginning point in a foreign country to an end point in the United States. The source of S's international communications income is determined under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section as one-half from sources within the United States and one-half from sources without the United States. Example 6. Character of income derived from communications activity: the paid-to-do rule. (i) Facts. TC is paid to take a call from North Carolina to Iowa, two points in the United States, but routes the call through Canada. (ii) Analysis. Under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, the character of the income derived from communications activity is determined by the two points between which the taxpayer is paid to transmit, and bears the risk of transmitting, the communications, without regard to the path of the transmission between those two points. Thus, under paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section, TC derives income from U.S. communications activity because it is paid to transmit between two U.S. points. Example 7. Source of income derived from communications activity. (i) Facts. A, a U.S. company, is an Internet access provider. A charges C a lump sum, paid monthly, for Internet access. A transmits a call made by C in France to a recipient in England, over the public Internet. A does not maintain records as to the beginning and end points of the transmission. (ii) Analysis. Although A derives income from communications activity as defined in paragraph  (d)(1) of this section, the source of income is determined under paragraph (b)(6) of this section as income from sources within the United States, because A cannot establish the two points between which it is paid to transmit the communications. Example 8. Income derived from communications and non-communications activity. (i) Facts. A, a U.S. company, offers customers local and long distance phone service, video, and Internet services. Customers pay one monthly fee, and in addition 10 cents a minute for all long-distance calls, including international calls. (ii) Analysis. To the extent A derives income from communications activity, A must allocate income to its communications activity as provided in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section. To the extent A can establish that it derives international communications income as defined in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, A would determine the source of such income under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. If A cannot establish the points between which it is paid to transmit communications, as required in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, the source of A's income must be determined under paragraph (b)(6) of this section as from within the United States. Example 9. Income derived from communications activity. (i) Facts. T purchases capacity from TC to transmit telephone calls. T sells prepaid telephone calling cards, giving customers access to TC's lines, for a certain number of minutes. (ii) Analysis. T derives income from communications activity, under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, because T makes capacity to transmit available to its customers. In this case, T cannot establish the points between which communications are transmitted. Therefore, the source of its income must be determined under paragraph (b)(6) of this section as U.S. source income. Example 10. Income derived from communications and non-communications activity. (i) Facts. B, a U.S. company, transmits television programs using its satellite transponder, from the United States to downlink facilities in foreign country Y, owned by D, a cable system operator in Country Y. D receives the transmission, unscrambles the signals, and distributes the broadcast to customers in Country Y. (ii) Analysis. B derives income both from communications activity as defined under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, and from non-communications activity. Gross income must be allocated to the communications activity as required in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section. Income derived by B for transmission to D is international communications income within paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, because B is paid to transmit communications from the United States to a foreign country. Example 11. Income derived from communications activity. (i) Facts. TC is paid for Internet access. TC replicates frequently requested sites on its servers, solely to speed up response time. (ii) Analysis. On these facts, the replication service would be treated as de minimis under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, so that TC derives income from communications activity. The type and source of TC's communications income depends on demonstrating the points between which TC is paid by its customer to transmit the communications, under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section.

Part I contains general information on home mortgage interest, including points. It also explains how to report deductible interest on your tax return. Part II explains how your deduction for home mortgage interest may be limited. It contains Table 1, which is a worksheet you may use to figure the limit on your deduction.

The dollar limits for the second and third categories apply to the combined mortgages on your main home and second home.  Part I: Home Mortgage Interest This part contains general information on home mortgage interest, including points, and explains how to report deductible interest on your tax return. Generally, home mortgage interest is any interest you pay on a loan secured by your home (main home or a second home). The loan may be a mortgage to buy your home, a second mortgage, a line of credit, or a home equity loan. To deduct home mortgage interest, you must file Form 1040 and itemize deductions on Schedule A. Report your deductible home mortgage interest on lines 1012 of Schedule A. Legally liable. To deduct interest on a debt, you must be legally liable for that debt. You cannot deduct payments you make for someone else if you are not legally liable to make them. Both you and the lender must intend that the loan be repaid. In addition, there must be a true debtor-creditor relationship between you and the lender. Fully deductible interest. In most cases, you will be able to deduct all of your home mortgage interest. The mortgage must be a secured debt on a qualified home. (See the explanations of ``secured debt'' and ``qualified home''that follow.) Whether all your home mortgage interest is deductible depends on the date you took out the mortgage, the amount of the mortgage, and your use of its proceeds. If all of your mortgages fit into one or more of the following three categories at all times during the year, you can deduct ALL of the interest on those mortgages. If any one mortgage fits into more than one category, add the debt that fits in each category to your other debt in the same category. If one or more of your mortgages does not fit into any of these categories, use Part II of this publication to figure the amount of interest you can deduct. The three categories are: 1) Mortgages you took out on or before October 13, 1987 (called grandfathered debt). 2) Mortgages you took out after October 13, 1987, to buy, build, or improve your home (called home acquisition debt), but only if these mortgages plus any grandfathered debt totaled $1 million or less ($500,000 or less if married filing separately) throughout 1996. 3) Mortgages you took out after October 13, 1987, other than to buy, build, or improve your home (called home equity debt), but Page 2  continues for all later tax years. You may revoke your choice only with the consent of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). You may want to treat a debt as not secured by your home if the interest on that debt is fully deductible whether or not it qualifies as home mortgage interest. This may allow you more of a deduction for interest on other debts that are deductible only as home mortgage interest. Cooperative apartment owner. If you own stock in a cooperative housing corporation, see the Special Rule for Tenant-Stockholders in Cooperative Housing Corporations, later.  Note. You cannot deduct the home mortgage interest in (1) or (3) above if you used the proceeds of the mortgage to purchase securities or certificates that produce tax-free income. See Part II of this publication for more detailed definitions of grandfathered, home acquisition, and home equity debt. You can use Figure A in this publication to check whether your interest is fully deductible.  Qualified Home For you to take a home mortgage interest deduction, your debt must be secured by a qualified home. This means your main home or your second home. A home includes a house, condominium, cooperative, mobile home, boat, or similar property that has sleeping, cooking, and toilet facilities. The interest you pay on a mortgage on a home other than your main or second home may be deductible if the proceeds of the loan were used for business or investment purposes. Otherwise, it is considered personal interest and is not deductible. Main home. You can have only one main home at any one time. Generally, this is the home where you spend most of your time. If you sold this home, you could qualify to postpone paying tax on any gain. For information on the sale of your main home, see Publication 523, Selling Your Home. Second home. If you have a second home that you do not rent to others, you can treat it as a qualified home. It does not matter whether you use the home during the year. However, if you have a second home and rent it out part of the year, you also must use it during the year for it to be a qualified home. You must use this home more than 14 days or more than 10% of the number of days during the year that the home is rented at a fair rental, whichever is longer. If you do not use the home long enough, it is considered rental property and not a second home. If you have more than one second home, you can treat only one as the qualified second home during any year. However, an exception is made to this rule in the following three situations. 1) If you get a new home during the year, you can choose to treat the new home as your second home as of the day you buy it. 2) If your main home no longer qualifies as your main home, you can choose to treat it as your second home as of the day you stop using it as your main home. 3) If your second home is sold during the year or becomes your main home, you can choose a new second home as of the day you sell the old one or begin using it as your main home.  Secured Debt You can deduct your home mortgage interest only if your mortgage is a secured debt. A secured debt is one in which you sign an instrument (such as a mortgage, deed of trust, or land contract) that: 1) Makes your ownership in a qualified home security for payment of the debt, 2) Provides, in case of default, that your home could satisfy the debt, and 3) Is recorded or is otherwise perfected under any state or local law that applies. In other words, your mortgage is a secured debt if you put your home up as collateral to protect the interests of the lender. If you cannot pay the debt, your home can then serve as payment to the lender to satisfy (pay) the debt. In this publication, mortgage will refer to secured debt. Debt not secured by home. A debt is not secured by your home if it is secured solely because of a lien on your general assets or if it is a security interest that attaches to the property without your consent (such as a mechanic's lien or judgment lien). Wraparound mortgage. This is not a secured debt unless it is recorded or otherwise perfected under state law. Example. Beth owns a home subject to a mortgage of $40,000. She sells the home for $100,000 to John, who takes it subject to the $40,000 mortgage. Beth continues to make the payments on the $40,000 note. John pays $10,000 down and gives Beth a $90,000 note secured by a wraparound mortgage on the home. Beth does not record or otherwise perfect the $90,000 mortgage under the state law that applies. Therefore, that mortgage is not a secured debt, and the interest John pays on it is not deductible as home mortgage interest. Choice to treat the debt as not secured by your home. You can choose to treat any debt secured by your qualified home as not secured by the home. This treatment begins with the tax year for which you make the choice and   Divided use of your home. The only part of your home that is considered a qualified home is the part you use for residential living. You must divide both the cost and fair market value of your home between the part that is a qualified home and the part that is not. Dividing the cost may affect the amount of your home acquisition debt, which is limited to the cost of your home plus the cost of any improvements. (See Home Acquisition Debt, in Part II.) Dividing the fair market value may affect your home equity debt limit, also explained in Part II. Renting out part of home. If you rent out part of a qualified home to another person (tenant), you can treat the rented part as being used by you for residential living only if all three of the following conditions apply.  1) The rented part of your home is used by the tenant primarily for residential living. 2) The rented part of your home is not a selfcontained residential unit having separate sleeping, cooking, and toilet facilities. 3) You do not rent (directly or by sublease) to more than two tenants at any time during the tax year. If two persons (and dependents of either) share the same sleeping quarters, they are treated as one tenant.  whether, and how, this affects your deduction for home mortgage interest. Home under construction. You can treat a home under construction as a qualified home for a period of up to 24 months, but only if it becomes your qualified home at the time it is ready for occupancy. The 24month period can start any time on or after the day construction actually begins. Home destroyed. You may be able to continue treating your home as a qualified home even after it is destroyed in a fire, storm, torn a d o , earthquake, or other casualty. This means you can continue to deduct the interest you pay on your home mortgage, subject to the limits described in this publication. Page 3  Office in home. If you have an office in your home that you use in your business, see Publication 587, Business Use of Your Home. It explains how to figure your deduction for the business use of your home. It also explains   To continue treating a destroyed home as a qualified home, you must do one of the following within a reasonable period of time after the home is destroyed: 1) Rebuild the destroyed home and move into it, or 2) Sell the land on which the home was located. This rule applies whether the home is your main home or a second home that you treat as a qualified home. Also, it applies whether or not your home is in a federal disaster area. Time-sharing arrangements. You can treat a home you own under a time-sharing plan as a qualified home if it meets all the requirements. A time-sharing plan is an arrangement between two or more people that limits each person's interest in the home or right to use it to a certain portion of the year. If you rent out your time-share, it qualifies as a second home only if you also use it as a home. See Second home, earlier, for the use requirement. To know whether you meet that requirement, count your days of use and rental of the home only during the time you have a right to use it. Married taxpayers. If you are married and file a joint return, your qualified homes can be owned either jointly or by only one spouse. If you are married filing separately, and you and your spouse own more than one home, you can each take into account only one home as a qualified home. However, if you both consent in writing, then one spouse can take both the main home and a second home into account.  Prepaid interest. If you pay interest in advance for a period that goes beyond the end of the tax year, you must spread this interest over the tax years to which it applies. You can deduct in each year only the interest that qualifies as home mortgage interest for that year. However, there is an exception. See the discussion on Points, later. Mortgage interest credit. You may be able to claim a mortgage interest credit if you were issued a mortgage credit certificate (MCC) by a state or local government. Figure the credit on Form 8396, Mortgage Interest Credit. If you take this credit, you must reduce your mortgage interest deduction by the amount of the credit. See Form 8396 and Publication 530, Tax Information for First-Time Homeowners, for more information on the mortgage interest credit. Ministers' and military housing allowance. If you are a minister or a member of the uniformed services and receive a housing allowance that is not taxable, you can still deduct all of the deductible interest on your home mortgage. Shared appreciation mortgage (SAM). Under a SAM you pay interest at a fixed rate that is lower than the prevailing interest rate. You also agree to pay ``contingent interest '' to the lender. The contingent interest is a percentage of any appreciation in the value of your home and is due when the SAM ends. Generally, a SAM will end when you prepay the SAM, when you sell your home, or on a specified date, whichever is earliest. You can deduct the interest included in your monthly payments at the fixed rate, subject to any limits that apply, each year as you pay it. You can deduct the contingent interest, subject to any limits that apply, in the year you pay it.  of the principal in each payment on the new loan is allocated to the contingent interest. Graduated payment mortgages (GPM). GPMs under section 245 of the National Housing Act provide that monthly payments increase every year for a number of years and then stay the same. During the early years, payments are less than the amount of interest owed on the loan. The interest that is not paid becomes part of the principal. Future interest is figured on the increased unpaid mortgage loan balance. Subject to any limits that apply, you can deduct the interest you actually paid during the year if you are a cash method taxpayer. For example, if the interest owed is $2,551 but your payment for the year is $2,517, you can deduct $2,517. Add $34 ($2,551  $2,517) to the loan principal. Mortgage assistance payments. If you qualify for mortgage assistance payments under section 235 of the National Housing Act, part or all of the interest on your mortgage may be paid for you. You cannot deduct the interest that is paid for you. Do not include these payments in your income. These payments do not reduce other deductions, such as taxes. Divorced or separated individuals. If a divorce or separation agreement requires you or your spouse or former spouse to pay home mortgage interest on a home owned by both of you, see the discussion of Payments for jointly-owned home under Alimony in Publication 504, Divorced or Separated Individuals . Redeemable ground rents. In some states (Maryland, for example), you may buy your home subject to a ground rent. A ground rent is an obligation you assume to pay a fixed amount per year on the property. Under this arrangement, you are leasing (rather than buying) the land on which your home is located. If you make annual or periodic rental payments on a redeemable ground rent, you can deduct them as mortgage interest. A ground rent is a redeemable ground rent if: 1) Your lease, including renewal periods, is for more than 15 years, 2) You can freely assign the lease, 3) You have a present or future right (under state or local law) to end the lease and buy the lessor's entire interest in the land by paying a specific amount, and 4) The lessor's interest in the land is primarily a security interest to protect the rental payments to which he or she is entitled. Payments made to end the lease and to buy the lessor's entire interest in the land are not ground rents. You cannot deduct them. Nonredeemable ground rent. Payments on a nonredeemable ground rent are not interest. You can deduct them as rent if they are a business expense or if they are for rental property held to produce income.  Special Situations This section describes certain items that can be included as home mortgage interest and others that cannot. It also describes certain special situations that may affect your deduction. Late payment charge on mortgage payment. You can deduct as home mortgage interest a late payment charge if it was not for a specific service performed by your mortgage holder. Mortgage prepayment penalty. If you pay off your qualified home mortgage early, you may have to pay a penalty. You can deduct that penalty as home mortgage interest. Sale of home. If you sell your home, you can deduct your allowable home mortgage interest paid up to, but not including, the date of the sale.  Example. John and Peggy Harris sold their home on May 7. Through April 30, they made home mortgage interest payments of $1,220. The settlement sheet for the sale of the home showed $50 interest for the 6day period in May up to, but not including, the date of sale. Their mortgage interest deduction is $1,270 ($1,220 + $50). Page 4  Example. In 1988, you bought your main home for $125,000. You financed the purchase with a 9% 30year $100,000 SAM that provided that you pay the lender 40% of the appreciation as contingent interest. When you bought the house, the prevailing interest rate was 12%. The contingent interest was due when you paid off the loan, when you sold your home, or in 10 years, whichever was earliest. In 1996, you sold your home for $155,000. You paid off the principal on the mortgage plus $12,000 (40% of the $30,000 appreciation ($155,000  $125,000)). In 1996, you can deduct the $12,000 contingent interest as home mortgage interest. The result would be the same if you had not sold your house and had paid off the SAM with funds obtained from a source other than the SAM lender. Refinancing a SAM. You are not considered to have paid the contingent interest if you refinance your loan with the same lender and the face amount of the new loan includes the contingent interest due on the SAM. You can deduct the contingent interest only as you pay off the principal on the new loan. That is, part   Reverse mortgage loans. A reverse mortgage loan is a loan that is based on the value of your home and is secured by a mortgage on your home. The lending institution pays you the loan in installments over a period of months or years. The loan agreement may provide that interest will be added to the outstanding loan balance monthly as it accrues. If you are a cash method taxpayer, you deduct the interest on a reverse mortgage loan when you actually pay it, not when it is added to the outstanding loan balance. Your deduction may be limited because a reverse mortgage loan generally is subject to the limit on Home Equity Debt discussed in Part II. Refunds of interest. If you receive a refund of interest in the same year you paid it, you must reduce your interest expense by the amount refunded to you. If you receive a refund of interest you deducted in an earlier year, you generally must include the refund in income in the year you receive it. However, you need to include it only up to the amount of the deduction that reduced your tax in the earlier year. If you received a refund of interest you overpaid in an earlier year, you generally will receive a Form 1098, Mortgage Interest Statement, showing the refund in box 3. For information about Form 1098, see Mortgage Interest Statement , later. For more information on how to treat refunds of interest deducted in earlier years, see Recoveries in Publication 525, Taxable and Nontaxable Income. Cooperative apartment owner. If you own a cooperative apartment, you must reduce your 1996 mortgage interest deduction by your share of any cash portion of a patronage dividend that is a refund to the cooperative housing corporation of mortgage interest it paid before 1996. If you receive a Form 1098 from the cooperative housing corporation, the form should show only the amount you can deduct.  2) Paying points is an established business practice in the area where the loan was made. 3) The points paid were not more than the points generally charged in that area. 4) You use the cash method of accounting. This means you report income in the year you receive it and deduct expenses in the year you pay them. Most individuals use this method. 5) You use your loan to buy or build your main home. 6) The points were computed as a percentage of the principal amount of the mortgage. 7) The points were not paid in place of amounts that ordinarily are stated separately on the settlement statement, such as appraisal fees, inspection fees, title fees, attorney fees, and property taxes. 8) The amount is clearly shown on the settlement statement ( for example, Form HUD1) as points charged for the mortgage. The points may be shown as paid from either your funds or the seller's. 9) The funds you provided at or before closing, plus any points the seller paid, were at least as much as the points charged. The funds you provided do not have to have been applied to the points. They can include a down payment, an escrow deposit, earnest money, and other funds you paid at or before closing for any purpose. You cannot have borrowed these funds from your lender or mortgage broker. You can also fully deduct in 1996 points paid on a loan to improve your main home, if statements (1) through (4) above are true. Figure B. You can use Figure B as a quick check to see if points are fully deductible in the year paid. Amounts charged for services. Amounts charged by the lender for specific services connected to the loan are not interest. Examples are appraisal fees, notary fees, and preparation costs for the mortgage note or deed of trust. You cannot deduct these amounts as points under either the General rule or the Exception. For information about the tax treatment of these amounts and other settlement fees and closing costs, get Publication 530, Tax Information for First-Time Homeowners . However, an amount shown on your settlement statement as points may be deductible under the Exception to the General rule, even if it is for services in connection with your mortgage (whether VA, FHA, or conventional). The services must not be any of the specific services for which a charge ordinarily is stated separately on the settlement statement, as described in test (7) of the Exception . The other tests under the Exception also must be met. Points paid by the seller. The term ``points'' includes loan placement fees that the seller  pays to the lender to arrange financing for the buyer. The seller cannot deduct these fees as interest. But they are a selling expense that reduces the seller's amount realized. The buyer reduces the basis of the home by the amount of the seller-paid points and treats the points as if he or she had paid them. If all the tests under the Exception are met, the buyer deducts the points in the year paid. If any of those tests is not met, the buyer deducts the points over the life of the loan. If you need information about the basis of your home, get Publication 523, Selling Your Home, or Publication 530. Funds provided are less than points. If you meet all the tests in the Exception except that the funds you provided were less than the points charged to you, you can deduct the points in the year paid up to the amount of funds you provided. In addition, you can deduct any points paid by the seller.  Example 1. When you took out a $100,000 mortgage loan to buy your home in December 1996, you were charged one point ($1,000). You meet all the tests for deducting points in the Exception, except the only funds you provided were a $750 down payment. Of the $1,000 charged for points, you can deduct $750 in 1996. Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that the person who sold you your home also paid one point ($1,000) to help you get your mortgage. In 1996, you can deduct $1,750 ($750 of the amount you were charged plus the $1,000 paid by the seller). You must reduce the basis of your home by the $1,000 paid by the seller. Excess points. If you meet all the tests in the Exception except that the points paid were more than generally paid in your area, your deduction in 1996 is limited to the points generally charged. Any additional amount of points paid is interest paid in advance, and the deduction must be spread over the life of the mortgage. Second home. The Exception does not apply to points you pay on loans secured by your second home. You can deduct these points only over the life of the loan. Mortgage ending early. If you spread your deduction for points over the life of the mortgage, you can deduct any remaining balance in the year the mortgage ends. A mortgage may end early due to a prepayment, refinancing, foreclosure, or similar event.  Points The term ``points'' is used to describe certain charges paid, or treated as paid, by a borrower to obtain a home mortgage. Points may also be called loan origination fees, maximum loan charges, loan discount, or discount points. A borrower is treated as paying any points that a home seller pays for the borrower's mortgage. See Points paid by the seller , later. General rule. You cannot deduct the full amount of points in the year paid. Because they are prepaid interest, you must spread the points over the life (term) of the mortgage. Generally, you can deduct an equal portion in each year of the mortgage. Exception. You can fully deduct in 1996 the amount paid on your loan as points if all the following are true: 1) Your loan is secured by your main home. (Your main home is the one you live in most of the time.)  Example. Dan refinanced his mortgage in 1991 and paid $3,000 in points that he had to spread out over the life of the mortgage. He had deducted $1,000 of these points through 1995. Dan prepaid his mortgage in full in 1996. He can deduct the remaining $2,000 of points in 1996. Refinancing. Generally, points you pay to refinance a mortgage are not deductible in full in  Page 5   Page 6   the year you pay them. This is true even if the new mortgage is secured by your main home. However, if you use part of the refinanced mortgage proceeds to improve your main home and you meet the first four tests listed under the Exception, earlier, you can fully deduct the part of the points related to the improvement in the year paid. You can deduct the rest of the points over the life of the loan. Example 1. In 1990, Bill Fields got a mortgage to buy a home. The interest rate on that mortgage loan was 11%. On June 1, 1996, Bill refinanced that mortgage with a 15year $100,000 mortgage loan that has an interest rate of 8%. The mortgage is secured by his home. To get the new loan, he had to pay three points ($3,000). Two points ($2,000) were for prepaid interest, and one point ($1,000) was for the lender's services. Bill paid the points out of his private funds, rather than out of the proceeds of the new loan. The payment of points is an established practice in the area, and the points charged are not more than the amount generally charged there. Bill made six payments on the loan in 1996 and is a cash basis taxpayer. Bill used the funds from the new mortgage to repay his existing mortgage. Although the new mortgage loan was for Bill's continued ownership of his main home, it was not for the purchase or improvement of that home. For that reason, Bill does not meet all the tests in the Exception, and he cannot deduct all of the points in 1996. He can deduct two points ($2,000) ratably over the life of the loan. He deducts $67 (($2,000  180 months)  6 payments) of the points on his 1996 Form 1040 (on line 12, Schedule A). The other point ($1,000) was a fee for services and not deductible. Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that Bill used $25,000 of the loan proceeds to improve his home and $75,000 to repay his existing mortgage. Bill deducts 25% ($25,000  $100,000) of the $2,000 prepaid interest in 1996. His deduction is $500 ($2,000  25%). Additionally, in 1996, Bill deducts the ratable part of the remaining $1,500 ($2,000  $500) prepaid interest that must be spread over the life of the loan. This is $50 (($1,500  180 months)  6 payments). The total amount deductible in 1996, on line 12, Schedule A, is $550 ($500 + $50). Limits on deduction. You cannot fully deduct points paid on a mortgage that exceeds the limits discussed in Part II. See the Table 1 Instructions for line 10 in Part II. Form 1098. The mortgage interest statement you receive should show not only the total interest paid during the year, but also your deductible points. See Mortgage Interest Statement, next.  Form 1098, Mortgage Interest Statement, or a similar statement. You will receive the statement if you pay interest to a person (including a financial institution or cooperative housing corporation) in the course of that person's trade or business. A governmental unit is a person for purposes of furnishing the statement. You should receive the statement by January 31, 1997. The mortgage interest information will also be sent to the IRS. The statement will show the total interest you paid during the year. If you purchased a main home during 1996, it also will show the deductible points paid during the year, including seller-paid points. However, it should not show any interest that was paid for you by a government agency. As a general rule, Form 1098 will not include points that you cannot fully deduct in the year paid. However, certain points not included on Form 1098 may be deductible, either in the year paid or over the life of the loan. See the earlier discussion of Points to determine whether you can deduct points not shown on Form 1098. Prepaid interest on Form 1098. If you prepaid interest in 1996 that accrued in full by January 15, 1997, this prepaid interest may be included in box 1 of Form 1098. However, even though the prepaid amount may be included in box 1, you cannot deduct the prepaid amount in 1996. (See Prepaid interest, earlier.) You will have to figure the interest that accrued for 1997 and subtract it from the amount in box 1. You will include the interest for 1997 with other interest you pay for 1997. Refunded interest. If you received a refund of interest you overpaid in an earlier year, you generally will receive a Form 1098 showing the refund in box 3. See Refunds of interest , earlier.  Mortgage proceeds used for business or investment. If your home mortgage interest deduction is limited under the rules explained in Part II, but all or part of the mortgage proceeds were used for business or investment activities, see Table 2 near the end of this publication. It shows where to deduct the part of your excess interest that is allocable to those activities. The instructions in Part II for line 13 of Table 1 explain how to allocate the excess interest among the activities for which the mortgage proceeds were used. More than one borrower. If you and at least one other person (other than your spouse if you file a joint return) were liable for, and paid, interest on a mortgage that was for your home and the other person received a Form 1098 showing the interest that was paid during the year, attach a statement to your return explaining this. Show how much of the interest each of you paid, and give the name and address of the person who received the form. Deduct your share of the interest on line 11, Schedule A, and write ``See attached'' next to line 11. Similarly, if you are the payer of record on a mortgage on which there are other borrowers entitled to a deduction for the interest shown on the Form 1098 you received, deduct only your share of the interest on line 10, Schedule A. You should tell each of the other borrowers what their share is.  Special Rule for TenantStockholders in Cooperative Housing Corporations A qualified home includes stock in a cooperative housing corporation owned by a tenantstockholder. This applies only if the tenantstockholder is entitled to live in the house or apartment because of owning stock in the cooperative. Cooperative housing corporation. This is a corporation that meets all of the following conditions: 1) The corporation has only one class of stock outstanding. 2) Each of the stockholders, only because of owning the stock, can live in a house, apartment, or house trailer owned or leased by the corporation. 3) No stockholder can receive any distribution out of capital, except on a partial or complete liquidation of the corporation. 4) The tenant-stockholders must pay at least 80% of the corporation's gross income for the tax year. For this purpose, gross income means all income received during the entire tax year, including any received before the corporation changed to cooperative ownership.  How To Report Deduct the interest and points reported to you on Form 1098 on line 10, Schedule A (Form 1040). If you paid more deductible interest to the financial institution than the amount shown on Form 1098, show the larger deductible amount on line 10. Attach a statement explaining the difference and write ``See attached '' next to line 10. Deduct home mortgage interest that was not reported to you on Form 1098 on line 11 of Schedule A (Form 1040). If you paid home mortgage interest to the person from whom you bought your home, show that person's name, address, and social security number (SSN) or employer identification number (EIN) on the dotted lines next to line 11. The seller must give you this number and you must give the seller your SSN. Failure to meet any of these requirements may result in a $50 penalty for each failure. If you can take a deduction for points that were not reported to you on Form 1098, deduct those points on line 12 of Schedule A (Form 1040).  Mortgage Interest Statement If you paid $600 or more of mortgage interest (including certain points) during the year on any one mortgage, you generally will receive a  Stock used to secure debt. In some cases, you cannot use your cooperative housing stock to secure a debt because of either: Page 7   1) Restrictions under local or state law, or 2) Restrictions in the cooperative agreement (other than restrictions in which the main purpose is to permit the tenantstockholder to treat unsecured debt as secured debt). However, you can treat a debt as secured by the stock to the extent that the proceeds are used to buy the stock under the allocation of interest rules. See Chapter 8 of Publication 535 for details on these rules. Figuring deductible home mortgage interest. Generally, if you are a tenant-stockholder, you can deduct payments you make for your share of the interest paid or incurred by the cooperative. The interest must be on a debt to buy, build, change, improve, or maintain the cooperative's housing, or on a debt to buy the land. Figure your share of this interest by multiplying the total by the following fraction. Your shares of stock in the cooperative The total shares of stock in the cooperative  The amount of the cooperative's home equity debt is $1.5 million ($1.4 million + $100,000). Jeanne's share is $15,000 ($1.5 million  (20/2,000)). Jeanne is treated as having paid $2,000 of interest during 1996 on the cooperative's debt ($200,000  (20/2,000)). Jeanne also took out a home acquisition debt to buy her shares in the cooperative. Her average balance for 1996 was $40,000. Jeanne's home acquisition debt ($5,000 + $40,000 = $45,000) totaled less than $1 million (the dollar limit that applies to these mortgages) and her home equity debt ($15,000) is less than $100,000 (the dollar limit that applies to these mortgages). Therefore, all of her home mortgage interest is deductible.  acquisition debt only up to the amount of the balance of the old mortgage principal just before the refinancing. Any additional debt is not home acquisition debt, but may qualify as home equity debt (discussed later). Mortgage that qualifies later. A mortgage that does not qualify as home acquisition debt because it does not meet all the requirements may qualify at a later time. For example, a debt that you use to buy your home may not qualify as home acquisition debt because it is not secured by the home. However, if the debt is later secured by the home, it may qualify as home acquisition debt after that time. Similarly, a debt that you use to buy property may not qualify because the property is not a qualified home. However, if the property later becomes a qualified home, the debt may qualify after that time. Mortgage treated as used to buy, build, or improve home. A mortgage secured by a qualified home may be treated as home acquisition debt, even if you do not actually use the proceeds to buy, build, or substantially improve the home, in the following situations. 1) You buy your home within 90 days before or after the date you take out the mortgage. The home acquisition debt is limited to the home's cost, plus the cost of any substantial improvements within the limit described below in (2) or (3). 2) You build or improve your home and take out the mortgage before the work is completed. The home acquisition debt is limited to the amount of the expenses incurred within 24 months before the date of the mortgage. 3) You build or improve your home and take out the mortgage within 90 days after the work is completed. The home acquisition debt is limited to the amount of the expenses incurred within the period beginning 24 months before the work is completed and ending on the date of the mortgage.  Part II: Limits on Home Mortgage Interest Deduction This part of the publication discusses the limits on deductible home mortgage interest. These limits apply to your home mortgage interest expense if you have a home mortgage that does not fit into any of the three categories listed at the beginning of Part I , under Fully deductible interest. Your home mortgage interest deduction is limited to the interest on the part of your home mortgage debt that is not more than your qualified loan limit. This is the part of your home mortgage debt that is grandfathered debt or that is not more than the limits for home acquisition debt and home equity debt. You may use Table 1, later, to figure your qualified loan limit and your deductible home mortgage interest.  Limits on deduction. To figure how the limits discussed in Part II apply to you, treat your share of the cooperative's debt as debt incurred by you. The cooperative should determine your share of its grandfathered debt, its home acquisition debt, and its home equity debt. Your share of each of these types of debt is equal to the average balance of each debt multiplied by the fraction just given. In determining the cooperative's home acquisition debt, a debt taken out to buy, build, or improve any nonresidential part of the property does not qualify. Also, in determining the fair market value of the residential property, the fair market value of any nonresidential part does not qualify. After your share of the average balance of each type of debt is determined, include it with the average balance of that type of debt secured by your stock. Form 1098. The cooperative should give you a Form 1098 showing your share of the interest. Use the rules in this publication to determine your deductible mortgage interest. Example. Jeanne owns 20 shares in a cooperative, in which the total shares are 2,000. The cooperative took out a debt on January 1, 1996, with a principal balance of $2 million. The cooperative made no principal payments in 1996, but it did pay $200,000 interest on the debt. By the end of 1996, the cooperative used the debt proceeds in the following manner. 1) $500,000 to install a swimming pool for the use of all the residents. 2) $1.4 million to make improvements to commercial space rented to tenants. 3) $100,000 for maintenance costs. The amount of the cooperative's home acquisition debt is $500,000. Jeanne's share is $5,000 ($500,000  (20/2,000)). Page 8  Home Acquisition Debt Home acquisition debt is a mortgage you took out after October 13, 1987, to buy, build, or substantially improve a qualified home (your main or second home). It also must be secured by that home. If the amount of your mortgage is more than the cost of the home plus the cost of any substantial improvements, only the debt that is not more than the cost of the home plus improvements qualifies as home acquisition debt. The additional debt may qualify as home equity debt (discussed later). Home acquisition debt limit. The total home acquisition debt you can have at any time on your main home and second home cannot be more than $1 million ($500,000 if married filing separately). However, this limit is reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of your grandfathered debt (discussed later). Debt over this limit may qualify as home equity debt (also discussed later). Refinanced home cured debt you use tion debt is treated However, the new acquisition debt. Any seto refinance home acquisias home acquisition debt. debt will qualify as home  Example 1. You bought your main home on June 3 for $175,000. You paid for the home with cash you got from the sale of your old home. On July 15, you took out a mortgage of $150,000 secured by your main home. You used the $150,000 to invest in stocks. You can treat the mortgage as taken out to buy your home because you bought the home within 90 days before you took out the mortgage. The entire mortgage qualifies as home acquisition debt because it was not more than the home's cost. Example 2. On January 31, John began building a home on the lot that he owned. He used $45,000 of his personal funds to build the home. The home was completed on October 31. John took out a mortgage of $36,000, on November 21, that was secured by the home. The mortgage can be treated as used to build the home because it was taken out within 90 days after the home was completed.   The entire mortgage qualifies as home acquisition debt because it was not more than the expenses incurred within the period beginning 24 months before the home was completed. Figure C illustrates this.  Home Equity Debt If you took out a loan for reasons other than to buy, build, or substantially improve your home, it may qualify as home equity debt. In addition, debt you incurred to buy, build, or substantially improve your home, to the extent it is more than the home acquisition debt limit, may qualify as home equity debt. Home equity debt is a mortgage you took out after October 13, 1987. It is a debt, other than grandfathered debt, discussed later, or home acquisition debt, that is secured by your qualified home.  deductible home mortgage interest. However, the amount of your grandfathered debt reduces the $1 million limit for home acquisition debt and the limit based on your home's fair market value for home equity debt. Refinanced grandfathered debt. If you refinanced grandfathered debt after October 13, 1987, for an amount that was not more than the mortgage principal left on the debt, then you still treat it as grandfathered debt. To the extent the new debt is more than that mortgage principal, it is treated as home acquisition or home equity debt, and the mortgage is a mixed-use mortgage (discussed later under Average Mortgage Balance in the Table 1 Instructions). The debt must be secured by the qualified home. You treat grandfathered debt that was refinanced after October 13, 1987, as grandfathered debt only for the term left on the debt that was refinanced. After that, you treat it as home acquisition debt or home equity debt, depending on how you used the proceeds. Exception. If the debt before refinancing was like a balloon note (the principal on the debt was not amortized over the term of the debt), then you treat the refinanced debt as grandfathered debt for the term of the first refinancing. This term cannot be more than 30 years.  Example. You bought your home for cash 10 years ago. You did not have a mortgage on your home until last year, when you took out a $20,000 loan, secured by your home, to pay for your daughter's college tuition and your father's medical bills. This loan is home equity debt. Home equity debt limit. There is a limit on the amount of debt that can be treated as home equity debt. The total debt on your main home and second home is limited to the smaller of: 1) $100,000 ($50,000 if married filing separately), or 2) The total of each home's fair market value (FMV) reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of its home acquisition debt and grandfathered debt. Determine the FMV and the outstanding home acquisition and grandfathered debt for each home on the date that the last debt was secured by the home. Interest on amounts over the home equity debt limit generally is treated as personal interest and is not deductible. But if the proceeds of the loan were used for investment or business purposes, the interest may be deductible. See the instructions for line 13 of Table 1, later, for an explanation of how to allocate the excess interest. Part of home not a qualified home. To figure the limit on your home equity debt, you must divide the FMV of your home between the part that is a qualified home and any part that is not a qualified home. See Divided use of your home under Qualified Home in Part I. Fair market value. This is the price at which the home would change hands between you and a buyer, neither having to sell or buy, and both having reasonable knowledge of all necessary facts. Sales of similar homes in your area, on about the same date your last debt was secured by the home, may be helpful in figuring the FMV.  Date of the mortgage. The date you take out your mortgage is the day you receive the loan proceeds, generally the closing date. You can treat the day you apply in writing for your mortgage as the date you take it out. However, this applies only if you receive the loan proceeds within 30 days after your application is approved. If an application you make within the 90day period is rejected, a reasonable additional time will be allowed to make a new application. Cost of home or improvements. To determine your cost, include amounts paid to acquire any interest in a qualified home or to substantially improve the home. The cost of building or substantially improving a qualified home includes the costs to acquire real property and building materials, fees for architects and design plans, and required building permits. Substantial improvement. An improvement is substantial if it: 1) Adds to the value of your home, 2) Prolongs your home's useful life, or 3) Adapts your home to new uses. Repairs that maintain your home in good condition, such as repainting your home, are not substantial improvements. However, if you paint your home as part of a renovation that substantially improves your qualified home, you can include the painting costs in the cost of the improvements. Acquiring an interest in a home because of a divorce. Cost includes amounts spent to acquire the interest of a spouse or former spouse in a home, because of a divorce or legal separation. Part of home not a qualified home. To figure your home acquisition debt, you must divide the cost of your home and improvements between the part of your home that is a qualified home and any part that is not a qualified home. See Divided use of your home under Qualified Home in Part I.  Example. Chester took out a $200,000 first mortgage on his home in 1985. The mortgage was a five-year balloon note and the entire balance on the note was due in 1990. Chester refinanced the debt in 1990 with a new 20-year mortgage. The refinanced debt is treated as grandfathered debt for its entire term (20 years). Line-of-credit mortgage. If you had a lineof-credit mortgage on October 13, 1987, and borrowed additional amounts against it after that date, then the additional amounts are either home acquisition debt or home equity debt depending on how you used the proceeds. The balance on the mortgage before you borrowed the additional amounts is grandfathered debt. The newly borrowed amounts are not grandfathered debt because the funds were borrowed after October 13, 1987. See Mixed-use mortgages under Average Mortgage Balance in the Table 1 Instructions, next.  Table 1 Instructions If ALL of your mortgages secured by your main home or second home are grandfathered debt or, for the entire year, are within the limits discussed earlier under Home Acquisition Debt and Home Equity Debt , you can deduct ALL of the interest. You do not need Table 1. Otherwise, you may use Table 1 to determine your qualified loan limit and deductible home mortgage interest. Fill out only one Table 1, for both your main and second home, regardless of how many mortgages you have.  Grandfathered Debt If you took out a mortgage on your home before October 14, 1987, or you refinanced such a mortgage, it may qualify as grandfathered debt. To qualify, it must have been secured by your qualified home on October 13, 1987, and at all times after that date. How you used the proceeds does not matter. Grandfathered debt is not limited. All of the interest you paid on grandfathered debt is fully  Page 9   Table 1. Worksheet to Figure Your Qualified Loan Limit and Deductible Home Mortgage Interest (Keep for your records.)

You need these amounts to complete lines 1, 2, and 9 of the worksheet. You can use the highest mortgage balances during the year to complete the worksheet, but you may benefit most by using the average balances. The following are methods you can use to figure your average mortgage balances. However, if a mortgage has more than one category of debt, see Mixed-use mortgages later in this section. Average of first and last balance method. You can use this method if all the following apply. 1) You did not borrow any new amounts on the mortgage during the year. (This does not include borrowing the original mortgage amount.) Page 10  Interest paid divided by interest rate method. You can use this method if at all times in 1996 the mortgage was secured by your qualified home and the interest was paid at least monthly. Complete the following worksheet to figure your average balance.  1. Enter the interest paid in 1996. Do not include points. However, do include other prepaid interest that was due in 1996. Do not include prepaid interest for other years until the year due. .... 2. Enter the annual interest rate on the mortgage. If the interest rate varied in 1996, use the lowest rate for the year 3.

However, do include other prepaid interest that was due in 1996. Do not include prepaid interest for other years until the year due. .... 2. Enter the annual interest rate on the mortgage. If the interest rate varied in 1996, use the lowest rate for the year 3. Divide the amount on line 1 by the amount on line 2. Enter the result ....  Complete line 9 of Table 1 by including the average balance of the entire mixed-use mortgage, figured under one of the methods described earlier in this section. $2,500  Line 7 The amount on line 7 cannot be more than the smaller of: 1) $100,000 ($50,000 if married filing separately), or 2) The total of each home's fair market value (FMV) reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of its home acquisition debt and grandfathered debt. Determine the FMV and the outstanding home acquisition and grandfathered debt for each home on the date that the last debt was secured by the home. See Home equity debt limit, earlier, under Home Equity Debt for more information about fair market value.  .09 $27,778  Statements provided by your lender. If you receive monthly statements showing the closing balance or the average balance for the month, you can use either to figure your average balance. You can treat the balance as zero for any month the mortgage was not secured by your qualified home. For each mortgage, figure your average balance by adding your monthly closing or average balances and dividing that total by the number of months the home secured by that mortgage was a qualified home during the year. If your lender can give you your average balance for 1996, you can use that amount.  Example. Ms. Brown had a home equity loan secured by her main home all year. She received monthly statements showing her average balance for each month. She may figure her average balance for the year by adding her monthly average balances and dividing the total by 12. Mixed-use mortgages. A mixed-use mortgage is a loan that consists of more than one of the three categories of debt (grandfathered debt, home acquisition debt, and home equity debt). For example, a mortgage you took out in 1996 is a mixed-use mortgage if you used its proceeds partly to refinance a mortgage that you took out in 1989 to buy your home (home acquisition debt) and partly to pay your son's college tuition (home equity debt). Complete lines 1 and 2 of Table 1 by including the separate average balances of any grandfathered debt and home acquisition debt in your mixed-use mortgage. Do not use the methods described earlier in this section to figure the average balance of either category. Instead, for each category, use the following method: 1) Figure the balance of that category of debt for each month. This is the amount of the loan proceeds allocated to that category, reduced by your principal payments on the mortgage previously applied to that category. Principal payments on a mixeduse mortgage are applied in full to each category of debt, until its balance is zero, in the following order: a) First, any home equity debt, b) Next, any grandfathered debt, and c) Finally, any home acquisition debt. 2) Add together the monthly balances figured in (1). 3) Divide the result in (2) by 12.  Example 1. In 1986, Sharon took out a $1,400,000 mortgage to buy her main home (grandfathered debt). In March 1996, when the home had a fair market value of $1,700,000 and she owed $1,100,000 on the mortgage, Sharon took out a second mortgage for $200,000. She used $180,000 of the proceeds to make substantial improvements to her home (home acquisition debt) and the remaining $20,000 to buy a car (home equity debt). Under the loan agreement, Sharon must make principal payments of $1,000 each month. During 1996, her principal payments on the second mortgage totaled $10,000. To complete line 2 of Table 1, Sharon must figure a separate average balance for the part of her second mortgage that is home acquisition debt. The January and February balances were zero. The March through December balances were all $180,000, because none of her principal payments are applied to the home acquisition debt. (They are all applied to the home equity debt, reducing it to $10,000 ($20,000  $10,000).) The monthly balances of the home acquisition debt total $1,800,000 ($180,000  10). Therefore, the average balance of the home acquisition debt for 1996 was $150,000 ($1,800,000  12). Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1. In 1997, Sharon's January through October principal payments on her second mortgage are applied to the home equity debt, reducing it to zero. The balance of the home acquisition debt remains $180,000 for each of those months. Because her November and December principal payments are applied to the home acquisition debt, the November balance is $179,000 ($180,000  $1,000) and the December balance is $178,000 ($180,000  $2,000). The monthly balances total $2,157,000 (($180,000  10) + $179,000 + $178,000). Therefore, the average balance of the home acquisition debt for 1997 is $179,750 ($2,157,000  12).  Line 9 Figure the average balance for 1996 of each outstanding home mortgage. Add the average balances together and enter the total on line 9. See Average Mortgage Balance, earlier. Note: When figuring the average balance of a mixeduse mortgage, for line 9 determine the average balance of the entire mortgage.  Line 10 If you make payments to a financial institution, or to a person whose business is making loans, you should get Form 1098, Mortgage Interest Statement, or a similar statement from the lender. This form will show the amount of interest to enter on line 10 of the worksheet. Also include on this line any other interest payments made on debts secured by a qualified home for which you did not receive a Form 1098. Do not include points on this line. Claiming your deductible points. Figure your deductible points as follows. 1) Figure your deductible points for 1996 using the rules explained under Points in Part I. 2) Multiply the amount in item (1) by the decimal amount on line 11 of the worksheet. Enter the result on Schedule A (Form 1040), line 10 or 12, whichever applies. This amount is fully deductible. 3) Subtract the amount in item (2) from the amount in item (1). This amount is not deductible as home mortgage interest. However, if you used any of the loan proceeds for business or investment activities, see the instructions for line 13 of the worksheet, next.  Line 1 Figure the average balance for 1996 of each mortgage you had on all qualified homes on October 13, 1987 (grandfathered debt). Add the results together and enter the total on line 1. Include the average balance for 1996 for any grandfathered debt part of a mixed-use mortgage.  Line 2 Figure the average balance for 1996 of each mortgage you took out on all qualified homes after October 13, 1987, to buy, build, or substantially improve the home (home acquisition debt). Add the results together and enter the total on line 2. Include the average balance for 1996 for any home acquisition debt part of a mixed-use mortgage.  Line 13 You cannot deduct the amount of interest on line 13 of the worksheet as home mortgage interest. If you did not use any of the proceeds of any mortgage included on line 9 of the worksheet for business or investment activities, then all the interest on line 13 is personal interest. Personal interest is not deductible. If you did use all or part of any mortgage proceeds for business or investment activities, Page 11   the part of the interest on line 13 that is allocable to those activities may be deducted as business or investment expense, subject to any limits that apply. Table 2 in this publication shows where to deduct that interest. See Allocation of Interest in Chapter 8 of Publication 535, Business Expenses, for an explanation of how to determine the use of loan proceeds. The following two rules describe how to allocate the interest on line 13 to a business or investment activity. 1) If you used all of the proceeds of the mortgages on line 9 for one activity, then all the interest on line 13 is allocated to that activity. In this case, deduct the interest on the form or schedule to which it applies. 2) If you used the proceeds of the mortgages on line 9 for more than one activity, then you can allocate the interest on line 13 among the activities in any manner you select (up to the total amount of interest otherwise allocable to each activity).

Mortgage A had an average balance of $90,000 for 1996, and mortgage B had an average balance of $110,000. Don determines that the proceeds of mortgage A are allocable to personal expenses for all of 1996. The proceeds of mortgage B are allocable to his business for all of 1996.

It includes discussions on points and on how to report deductible interest on your tax return. Generally, home mortgage interest is any interest you pay on a loan secured by your home (main home or a second home). The loan may be a mortgage to buy your home, a second mortgage, a line of credit, or a home equity loan. You can deduct home mortgage interest only if you meet all the following conditions.  Secured Debt You can deduct your home mortgage interest only if your mortgage is a secured debt. A secured debt is one in which you sign an instrument (such as a mortgage, deed of trust, or land contract) that: 1) Makes your ownership in a qualified home security for payment of the debt, 2) Provides, in case of default, that your home could satisfy the debt, and 3) Is recorded or is otherwise perfected under any state or local law that applies. In other words, your mortgage is a secured debt if you put your home up as collateral to protect the interests of the lender. If you cannot pay the debt, your home can then serve as payment to the lender to satisfy (pay) the debt. In this publication, mortgage will refer to secured debt. Debt not secured by home. A debt is not secured by your home if it is secured solely because of a lien on your general assets or if it is a security interest that attaches to the property without your consent (such as a mechanic's lien or judgment lien). Wraparound mortgage. This is not a secured debt unless it is recorded or otherwise perfected under state law.  The interest you pay on a mortgage on a home other than your main or second home may be deductible if the proceeds of the loan were used for business or investment purposes. Otherwise, it is considered personal interest and is not deductible. Main home. You can have only one main home at any one time. Generally, this is the home where you spend most of your time.  If you sold this home, you may qualify  TIP to exclude all or part of any gain. For information on the sale of your main home, see Publication 523, Selling Your Home. Second home. You can have only one second home at any time. Second home not rented out. If you have a second home that you do not hold out for rent to others, you can treat it as a qualified home. It does not matter whether you use the home during the year. Second home rented out. If you have a second home and rent it out part of the year, you also must use it during the year for it to be a qualified home. You must use this home more than 14 days or more than 10% of the number of days during the year that the home is rented at a fair rental, whichever is longer. If you do not use the home long enough, it is considered rental property and not a second home. More than one second home. If you have more than one second home, you can treat only one as the qualified second home during any year. However, an exception is made to this rule in the following three situations. 1) If you get a new home during the year, you can choose to treat the new home as your second home as of the day you buy it. 2) If your main home no longer qualifies as your main home, you can choose to treat it as your second home as of the day you stop using it as your main home. 3) If your second home is sold during the year or becomes your main home, you can choose a new second home as of the day you sell the old one or begin using it as your main home. Divided use of your home. The only part of your home that is considered a qualified home is the part you use for residential living. If you use part of your home for other than residential living, such as a home office, you must allocate the use of your home. You must then divide both the cost and fair market value of your home between the part that is a qualified home and the part that is not. Dividing the cost may affect the amount of your home acquisition debt, which is limited to the cost of your home plus the cost of any improvements. (See Home Acquisition Debt in Part II.) Dividing the fair market value may affect your home equity debt limit, also explained in Part II. Renting out part of home. If you rent out part of a qualified home to another person (tenant), you can treat the rented part as being used by you for residential living only if all three of the following conditions apply. 1) The rented part of your home is used by the tenant primarily for residential living.   You must file Form 1040 and itemize deductions on Schedule A (Form 1040).   You must be legally liable for the loan. You cannot deduct payments you make for someone else if you are not legally liable to make them. Both you and the lender must intend that the loan be repaid. In addition, there must be a true debtor-creditor relationship between you and the lender.   The mortgage must be a secured debt on a qualified home. ""Secured debt"" and ""qualified home"" are explained later. Fully deductible interest. In most cases, you will be able to deduct all of your home mortgage interest. Whether it is all deductible depends on the date you took out the mortgage, the amount of the mortgage, and your use of its proceeds. If all of your mortgages fit into one or more of the following three categories at all times during the year, you can deduct all of the interest on those mortgages. (If any one mortgage fits into more than one category, add the debt that fits in each category to your other debt in the same category.) If one or more of your mortgages does not fit into any of these categories, use Part II of this publication to figure the amount of interest you can deduct. The three categories are: 1) Mortgages you took out on or before October 13, 1987 (called grandfathered debt). 2) Mortgages you took out after October 13, 1987, to buy, build, or improve your home (called home acquisition debt), but only if throughout 1998 these mortgages plus any grandfathered debt totaled $1 million or less ($500,000 or less if married filing separately). 3) Mortgages you took out after October 13, 1987, other than to buy, build, or improve your home (called home equity debt), but only if throughout 1998 these mortgages totaled $100,000 or less ($50,000 or less if married filing separately) and totaled no more than the fair market value of your home reduced by (1) and (2). The dollar limits for the second and third categories apply to the combined mortgages on your main home and second home. See Part II for more detailed definitions of grandfathered, home acquisition, and home equity debt. You can use Figure A to check whether your interest is fully deductible. Page 2  Example. Beth owns a home subject to a mortgage of $40,000. She sells the home for $100,000 to John, who takes it subject to the $40,000 mortgage. Beth continues to make the payments on the $40,000 note. John pays $10,000 down and gives Beth a $90,000 note secured by a wraparound mortgage on the home. Beth does not record or otherwise perfect the $90,000 mortgage under the state law that applies. Therefore, that mortgage is not a secured debt, and the interest John pays on it is not deductible as home mortgage interest. Choice to treat the debt as not secured by your home. You can choose to treat any debt secured by your qualified home as not secured by the home. This treatment begins with the tax year for which you make the choice and continues for all later tax years. You may revoke your choice only with the consent of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). You may want to treat a debt as not secured by your home if the interest on that debt is fully deductible (for example, as a business expense) whether or not it qualifies as home mortgage interest. This may allow you, if the limits in Part II apply to you, more of a deduction for interest on other debts that are deductible only as home mortgage interest. Cooperative apartment owner. If you own stock in a cooperative housing corporation, see the Special Rule for Tenant-Stockholders in Cooperative Housing Corporations, later.  Qualified Home For you to take a home mortgage interest deduction, your debt must be secured by a qualified home. This means your main home or your second home. A home includes a house, condominium, cooperative, mobile home, boat, or similar property that has sleeping, cooking, and toilet facilities.   Figure A. Is My Interest Fully Deductible? (Instructions: Include balances of ALL mortgages secured by your main home and second home. Answer YES only if the answer is true at ALL times during the year.) Start Here: Yes Were your total mortgage balances $100,000 or less1 ($50,000 or less if married filing separately)? Your interest is fully deductible. You do not need to read Part II of this publication.  No  Were all of your home mortgages taken out on or before 10-13-87?  Yes  Go to Part II of this publication to determine your deductible interest.  No  Were all of your home mortgages taken out after 10-13-87 used to buy, build, or improve the main home secured by that main home mortgage or used to buy, build, or improve the second home secured by that second home mortgage, or both? Yes  No  Yes  Were your grandfathered debt plus home acquisition 2 debt balances $1,000,000 or less ($500,000 or less if married filing separately)?  No  Yes  Were the mortgage balances $1,000,000 or less ($500,000 or less if married filing separately)?  No  Were your home equity debt balances $100,000 or 1 less ($50,000 or less if married filing separately)?  No  Yes  1  If all mortgages on your main or second home exceed the home's fair market value, a lower limit may apply. See Home equity debt limit under Home Equity Debt in Part II. Amounts over the $1,000,000 limit ($500,000 if married filing separately) qualify as home equity debt if they are not more than the total home equity debt limit. See Part II of this publication for more information about grandfathered debt, home acquisition debt, and home equity debt.  2  2) The rented part of your home is not a self-contained residential unit having separate sleeping, cooking, and toilet facilities. 3) You do not rent (directly or by sublease) to more than two tenants at any time during the tax year. If two persons (and dependents of either) share the same sleeping quarters, they are treated as one tenant.  The 24-month period can start any time on or after the day construction actually begins. Home destroyed. You may be able to continue treating your home as a qualified home even after it is destroyed in a fire, storm, tornado, earthquake, or other casualty. This means you can continue to deduct the interest you pay on your home mortgage, subject to the limits described in this publication. To continue treating a destroyed home as a qualified home, you must do one of the following within a reasonable period of time after the home is destroyed: 1) Rebuild the destroyed home and move into it, or 2) Sell the land on which the home was located. This rule applies whether the home is your main home or a second home that you treat as a qualified home. Also, it applies whether or not your home is in a federal disaster area.  Office in home. If you have an office in your home that you use in your business, see Publication 587, Business Use of Your Home. It explains how to figure your deduction for the business use of your home, which includes the business part of your home mortgage interest. Home under construction. You can treat a home under construction as a qualified home for a period of up to 24 months, but only if it becomes your qualified home at the time it is ready for occupancy.  Time-sharing arrangements. You can treat a home you own under a time-sharing plan as a qualified home if it meets all the requirements. A time-sharing plan is an arrangement between two or more people that limits each person's interest in the home or right to use it to a certain part of the year. Rental of time share. If you rent out your time-share, it qualifies as a second home only if you also use it as a home. See Second home rented out, earlier, for the use requirement. To know whether you meet that requirement, count your days of use and rental of the home only during the time you have a right to use it. Married taxpayers. If you are married and file a joint return, your qualified homes can be owned either jointly or by only one spouse. Separate returns. If you are married filing separately and you and your spouse own more than one home, you can each take into account only one home as a qualified home. However, if you both consent in writing, then one spouse can take both the main home and a second home into account. Page 3   Special Situations This section describes be included as home others that cannot. It special situations that duction. certain items that can mortgage interest and also describes certain may affect your de-  Late payment charge on mortgage payment. You can deduct as home mortgage interest a late payment charge if it was not for a specific service performed by your mortgage holder. Mortgage prepayment penalty. If you pay off your home mortgage early, you may have to pay a penalty. You can deduct that penalty as home mortgage interest. Sale of home. If you sell your home, you can deduct your home mortgage interest paid up to, but not including, the date of the sale.  was 12%. The contingent interest was due when you paid off the loan, when you sold your home, or in 10 years, whichever was earliest. In 1998, you sold your home for $155,000. You paid off the principal on the mortgage plus $12,000 [40% of the $30,000 appreciation ($155,000 - $125,000)]. In 1998, you can deduct the $12,000 contingent interest as home mortgage interest. The result would be the same if you had not sold your house and had paid off the SAM with funds obtained from a source other than the SAM lender.  3) You have a present or future right (under state or local law) to end the lease and buy the lessor's entire interest in the land by paying a specific amount. 4) The lessor's interest in the land is primarily a security interest to protect the rental payments to which he or she is entitled. Payments made to end the lease and to buy the lessor's entire interest in the land are not ground rents. You cannot deduct them. Nonredeemable ground rent. Payments on a nonredeemable ground rent are not mortgage interest. You can deduct them as rent if they are a business expense or if they are for rental property. Reverse mortgage loans. A reverse mortgage loan is a loan that is based on the value of your home and is secured by a mortgage on your home. The lending institution pays you the loan in installments over a period of months or years. The loan agreement may provide that interest will be added to the outstanding loan balance monthly as it accrues. If you are a cash method taxpayer, you deduct the interest on a reverse mortgage loan when you actually pay it, not when it is added to the outstanding loan balance. Your deduction may be limited because a reverse mortgage loan generally is subject to the limit on Home Equity Debt discussed in Part II. Rental payments. If you live in a house before final settlement on the purchase, any payments you make for that period are rent and not interest. This is true even if the settlement papers call them interest. You cannot deduct these payments as home mortgage interest. Mortgage proceeds invested in tax-exempt securities. You cannot deduct the home mortgage interest on grandfathered debt or home equity debt if you used the proceeds of the mortgage to buy securities or certificates that produce tax-free income. Grandfathered debt and home equity debt are defined in Part II of this publication. Refunds of interest. If you receive a refund of interest in the same year you paid it, you must reduce your interest expense by the amount refunded to you. If you receive a refund of interest you deducted in an earlier year, you generally must include the refund in income in the year you receive it. However, you need to include it only up to the amount of the deduction that reduced your tax in the earlier year. If you received a refund of interest you overpaid in an earlier year, you generally will receive a Form 1098, Mortgage Interest Statement, showing the refund in box 3. For information about Form 1098, see Mortgage Interest Statement, later. For more information on how to treat refunds of interest deducted in earlier years, see Recoveries in Publication 525, Taxable and Nontaxable Income. Cooperative apartment owner. If you own a cooperative apartment, you must reduce your home mortgage interest deduction by your share of any cash portion of a patronage dividend that the cooperative receives. The patronage dividend is a partial refund to the cooperative housing corporation of mortgage interest it paid in a prior year.  Example. John and Peggy Harris sold their home on May 7. Through April 30, they made home mortgage interest payments of $1,220. The settlement sheet for the sale of the home showed $50 interest for the 6-day period in May up to, but not including, the date of sale. Their mortgage interest deduction is $1,270 ($1,220 + $50). Prepaid interest. If you pay interest in advance for a period that goes beyond the end of the tax year, you must spread this interest over the tax years to which it applies. You can deduct in each year only the interest that qualifies as home mortgage interest for that year. However, there is an exception. See the discussion on Points, later. Mortgage interest credit. You may be able to claim a mortgage interest credit if you were issued a mortgage credit certificate (MCC) by a state or local government. Figure the credit on Form 8396, Mortgage Interest Credit. If you take this credit, you must reduce your mortgage interest deduction by the amount of the credit. See Form 8396 and Publication 530 for more information on the mortgage interest credit. Ministers' and military housing allowance. If you are a minister or a member of the uniformed services and receive a housing allowance that is not taxable, you can still deduct your home mortgage interest. Shared appreciation mortgage (SAM). Under a SAM, you pay interest at a fixed rate that is lower than the prevailing interest rate. You also agree to pay ""contingent interest"" to the lender. The contingent interest is a percentage of any appreciation in the value of your home and is due when the SAM ends. Generally, a SAM will end when you prepay the SAM, when you sell your home, or on a specified date, whichever is earliest. You can deduct the interest included in your monthly payments at the fixed rate, subject to any limits that apply, each year as you pay it. You can deduct the contingent interest, subject to any limits that apply, in the year you pay it.  Refinancing a SAM. You are not considered to have paid the contingent interest if you refinance your loan with the same lender and the face amount of the new loan includes the contingent interest due on the SAM. You can deduct the contingent interest only as you pay off the principal on the new loan. That is, part of the principal in each payment on the new loan is for the contingent interest. Graduated payment mortgages (GPMs). GPMs under section 245 of the National Housing Act provide that monthly payments increase every year for a number of years and then stay the same. During the early years, payments are less than the amount of interest owed on the loan. The interest that is not paid becomes part of the principal. Future interest is figured on the increased unpaid mortgage loan balance. Subject to any limits that apply, you can deduct the interest you actually paid during the year if you are a cash method taxpayer. For example, if the interest owed is $2,551 but your payment for the year is $2,517, you can deduct $2,517. Add $34 ($2,551 - $2,517) to the loan principal. Mortgage assistance payments. If you qualify for mortgage assistance payments under section 235 of the National Housing Act, part or all of the interest on your mortgage may be paid for you. You cannot deduct the interest that is paid for you. No other effect on taxes. Do not include these mortgage assistance payments in your income. Also, do not use these payments to reduce other deductions, such as real estate taxes. Divorced or separated individuals. If a divorce or separation agreement requires you or your spouse or former spouse to pay home mortgage interest on a home owned by both of you, special rules apply. See the discussion of Payments for jointly-owned home under Alimony in Publication 504, Divorced or Separated Individuals. Redeemable ground rents. In some states (Maryland, for example), you may buy your home subject to a ground rent. A ground rent is an obligation you assume to pay a fixed amount per year on the property. Under this arrangement, you are leasing (rather than buying) the land on which your home is located. If you make annual or periodic rental payments on a redeemable ground rent, you can deduct them as mortgage interest. A ground rent is a redeemable ground rent if all of the following are true. 1) Your lease, including renewal periods, is for more than 15 years. 2) You can freely assign the lease.  Example. In 1989, you bought your main home for $125,000. You financed the purchase with a 6% 30-year $100,000 SAM that provided that you pay the lender 40% of the appreciation as contingent interest. When you bought the house, the prevailing interest rate Page 4   If you receive a Form 1098 from the cooperative housing corporation, the form should show only the amount you can deduct.  However, if the points relate to refinancing a home mortgage, see Refinancing, later. Amounts charged for services. Amounts charged by the lender for specific services connected to the loan are not interest. Examples of these charges are: 1) Appraisal fees, 2) Notary fees, 3) Preparation costs for the mortgage note or deed of trust, 4) Mortgage insurance premiums, and 5) VA funding fees. You cannot deduct these amounts as points either in the year paid or over the life of the mortgage. For information about the tax treatment of these amounts and other settlement fees and closing costs, get Publication 530. Points paid by the seller. The term ""points"" includes loan placement fees that the seller pays to the lender to arrange financing for the buyer. Treatment by seller. The seller cannot deduct these fees as interest. But they are a selling expense that reduces the amount realized by the seller. See Publication 523 for information on selling your home. Treatment by buyer. The buyer reduces the basis of the home by the amount of the seller-paid points and treats the points as if he or she had paid them. If all the tests under the Exception are met, the buyer deducts the points in the year paid. If any of those tests is not met, the buyer deducts the points over the life of the loan. If you need information about the basis of your home, see Publication 523 or Publication 530. Funds provided are less than points. If you meet all the tests in the Exception except that the funds you provided were less than the points charged to you (test 9), you can deduct the points in the year paid, up to the amount of funds you provided. In addition, you can deduct any points paid by the seller.  Second home. The Exception does not apply to points you pay on loans secured by your second home. You can deduct these points only over the life of the loan. Mortgage ending early. If you spread your deduction for points over the life of the mortgage, you can deduct any remaining balance in the year the mortgage ends. A mortgage may end early due to a prepayment, refinancing, foreclosure, or similar event.  Points The term ""points"" is used to describe certain charges paid, or treated as paid, by a borrower to obtain a home mortgage. Points may also be called loan origination fees, maximum loan charges, loan discount, or discount points. A borrower is treated as paying any points that a home seller pays for the borrower's mortgage. See Points paid by the seller, later. General rule. You cannot deduct the full amount of points in the year paid. Because they are prepaid interest, you generally must deduct them over the life (term) of the mortgage. Exception. You can fully deduct points in the year paid if you meet all the following tests. 1) Your loan is secured by your main home. (Your main home is the one you live in most of the time.) 2) Paying points is an established business practice in the area where the loan was made. 3) The points paid were not more than the points generally charged in that area. 4) You use the cash method of accounting. This means you report income in the year you receive it and deduct expenses in the year you pay them. Most individuals use this method. 5) The points were not paid in place of amounts that ordinarily are stated separately on the settlement statement, such as appraisal fees, inspection fees, title fees, attorney fees, and property taxes. 6) You use your loan to buy or build your main home. 7) The points were computed as a percentage of the principal amount of the mortgage. 8) The amount is clearly shown on the settlement statement (for example, Form HUD-1) as points charged for the mortgage. The points may be shown as paid from either your funds or the seller's. 9) The funds you provided at or before closing, plus any points the seller paid, were at least as much as the points charged. The funds you provided do not have to have been applied to the points. They can include a down payment, an escrow deposit, earnest money, and other funds you paid at or before closing for any purpose. You cannot have borrowed these funds from your lender or mortgage broker.  Example. Dan refinanced his mortgage in 1993 and paid $3,000 in points that he had to spread out over the life of the mortgage. He had deducted $1,000 of these points through 1997. Dan prepaid his mortgage in full in 1998. He can deduct the remaining $2,000 of points in 1998. Refinancing. Generally, points you pay to refinance a mortgage are not deductible in full in the year you pay them. This is true even if the new mortgage is secured by your main home. However, if you use part of the refinanced mortgage proceeds to improve your main home and you meet the first five tests listed under the Exception, earlier, you can fully deduct the part of the points related to the improvement in the year paid. You can deduct the rest of the points over the life of the loan.  Example 1. When you took out a $100,000 mortgage loan to buy your home in December, you were charged one point ($1,000). You meet all the nine tests for deducting points in the year paid, except the only funds you provided were a $750 down payment. Of the $1,000 charged for points, you can deduct $750 in the year paid. You spread the remaining $250 over the life of the mortgage. Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that the person who sold you your home also paid one point ($1,000) to help you get your mortgage. In the year paid, you can deduct $1,750 ($750 of the amount you were charged plus the $1,000 paid by the seller). You must reduce the basis of your home by the $1,000 paid by the seller. Excess points. If you meet all the tests in the Exception except that the points paid were more than generally paid in your area (test 3), you deduct in the year paid only the points that are generally charged. Any additional points are prepaid interest, and you must spread them over the life of the mortgage.  Example 1. In 1991, Bill Fields got a mortgage to buy a home. The interest rate on that mortgage loan was 11%. In 1998, Bill refinanced that mortgage with a 15-year $100,000 mortgage loan that has an interest rate of 7%. The mortgage is secured by his home. To get the new loan, he had to pay three points ($3,000). Two points ($2,000) were for prepaid interest, and one point ($1,000) was charged for services, in place of amounts that ordinarily are stated separately on the settlement statement. Bill paid the points out of his private funds, rather than out of the proceeds of the new loan. The payment of points is an established practice in the area, and the points charged are not more than the amount generally charged there. Bill's first payment on the new loan was due July 1. He made six payments on the loan in 1998 and is a cash basis taxpayer. Bill used the funds from the new mortgage to repay his existing mortgage. Although the new mortgage loan was for Bill's continued ownership of his main home, it was not for the purchase or improvement of that home. For that reason, Bill does not meet all the tests in the Exception, and he cannot deduct all of the points in 1998. He can deduct two points ($2,000) ratably over the life of the loan. He deducts $67 [($2,000  180 months)  6 payments] of the points in 1998. The other point ($1,000) was a fee for services and is not deductible. Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that Bill used $25,000 of the loan proceeds to improve his home and $75,000 to repay his existing mortgage. Bill deducts 25% ($25,000  $100,000) of the $2,000 prepaid interest in 1998. His deduction is $500 ($2,000  25%). Bill also deducts the ratable part of the remaining $1,500 ($2,000 - $500) prepaid interest that must be spread over the life of the loan. This is $50 [($1,500  180 months)  6 payments] in 1998. The total amount Bill deducts in 1998 is $550 ($500 + $50). Page 5  Home improvement loan. You can also fully deduct in the year paid points paid on a loan to improve your main home, if statements (1) through (5) above are true. Figure B. You can use Figure B as a quick guide to see whether your points are fully deductible in the year paid. If you do not qualify under the exception to deduct the full amount of points in the year paid, see Points in chapter 8 of Publication 535 for the rules on when and how much you can deduct.   Figure B. Are My Points Fully Deductible This Year? Start Here: No Is the loan secured by your main home? Yes Is the payment of points an established business practice in your area? Yes Were the points paid more than the amount generally charged in your area? No Do you use the cash method of accounting? Yes Were the points paid in place of amounts that ordinarily are separately stated on the settlement sheet? No Yes Did you take out the loan to improve your main home? No Did you take out the loan to buy or build your main home? Yes Were the points computed as a percentage of the principal amount of the mortgage? Yes Were the funds you provided (other than those you borrowed from your lender or mortgage broker), plus any points the seller paid, at least as much as the points charged?* Yes Is the amount paid clearly shown as points on the settlement statement?

They can include a down payment, an escrow deposit, earnest money, and other funds you paid at or before closing for any purpose.  Page 6   Limits on deduction. You cannot fully deduct points paid on a mortgage that exceeds the limits discussed in Part II. See the Table 1 Instructions for line 10. Form 1098. The mortgage interest statement you receive should show not only the total interest paid during the year, but also your deductible points. See Mortgage Interest Statement, next.  must give the seller your SSN. Failure to meet any of these requirements may result in a $50 penalty for each failure. If you can take a deduction for points that were not reported to you on Form 1098, deduct those points on line 12 of Schedule A (Form 1040). More than one borrower. If you and at least one other person (other than your spouse if you file a joint return) were liable for and paid interest on a mortgage that was for your home, and the other person received a Form 1098 showing the interest that was paid during the year, attach a statement to your return explaining this. Show how much of the interest each of you paid, and give the name and address of the person who received the form. Deduct your share of the interest on line 11 of Schedule A (Form 1040), and write ""See attached"" next to the line. Similarly, if you are the payer of record on a mortgage on which there are other borrowers entitled to a deduction for the interest shown on the Form 1098 you received, deduct only your share of the interest on line 10 of Schedule A (Form 1040). You should tell each of the other borrowers what their share is. Mortgage proceeds used for business or investment. If your home mortgage interest deduction is limited under the rules explained in Part II, but all or part of the mortgage proceeds were used for business or investment activities, see Table 2. It shows where to deduct the part of your excess interest that is for those activities. The Table 1 Instructions for line 13 in Part II explain how to divide the excess interest among the activities for which the mortgage proceeds were used.  1) Restrictions under local or state law, or 2) Restrictions in the cooperative agreement (other than restrictions in which the main purpose is to permit the tenantstockholder to treat unsecured debt as secured debt). However, you can treat a debt as secured by the stock to the extent that the proceeds are used to buy the stock under the allocation of interest rules. See chapter 8 of Publication 535 for details on these rules. Figuring deductible home mortgage interest. Generally, if you are a tenantstockholder, you can deduct payments you make for your share of the interest paid or incurred by the cooperative. The interest must be on a debt to buy, build, change, improve, or maintain the cooperative's housing, or on a debt to buy the land. Figure your share of this interest by multiplying the total by the following fraction. Your shares of stock in the cooperative The total shares of stock in the cooperative  Mortgage Interest Statement If you paid $600 or more of mortgage interest (including certain points) during the year on any one mortgage, you generally will receive a Form 1098, Mortgage Interest Statement, or a similar statement from the mortgage holder. You will receive the statement if you pay interest to a person (including a financial institution or cooperative housing corporation) in the course of that person's trade or business. A governmental unit is a person for purposes of furnishing the statement. You should receive the statement for each year by January 31 of the following year. A copy of this form will also be sent to the IRS. The statement will show the total interest you paid during the year. If you purchased a main home during the year, it also will show the deductible points paid during the year, including seller-paid points. However, it should not show any interest that was paid for you by a government agency. As a general rule, Form 1098 will include only points that you can fully deduct in the year paid. However, certain points not included on Form 1098 also may be deductible, either in the year paid or over the life of the loan. See the earlier discussion of Points to determine whether you can deduct points not shown on Form 1098. Prepaid interest on Form 1098. If you prepaid interest in 1998 that accrued in full by January 15, 1999, this prepaid interest may be included in box 1 of Form 1098. However, you cannot deduct the prepaid amount for January 1999 in 1998. (See Prepaid interest, earlier.) You will have to figure the interest that accrued for 1999 and subtract it from the amount in box 1. You will include the interest for January 1999 with other interest you pay for 1999. Refunded interest. of mortgage interest year, you generally showing the refund interest, earlier. If you received a refund you overpaid in an earlier will receive a Form 1098 in box 3. See Refunds of  Special Rule for Tenant-Stockholders in Cooperative Housing Corporations A qualified home includes stock in a cooperative housing corporation owned by a tenant-stockholder. This applies only if the tenant-stockholder is entitled to live in the house or apartment because of owning stock in the cooperative. Cooperative housing corporation. This is a corporation that meets all of the following conditions. 1) The corporation has only one class of stock outstanding. 2) Each of the stockholders, only because of owning the stock, can live in a house, apartment, or house trailer owned or leased by the corporation. 3) No stockholder can receive any distribution out of capital, except on a partial or complete liquidation of the corporation. 4) The tenant-stockholders must pay at least 80% of the corporation's gross income for the tax year. For this purpose, gross income means all income received during the entire tax year, including any received before the corporation changed to cooperative ownership. Stock used to secure debt. In some cases, you cannot use your cooperative housing stock to secure a debt because of either:  Limits on deduction. To figure how the limits discussed in Part II apply to you, treat your share of the cooperative's debt as debt incurred by you. The cooperative should determine your share of its grandfathered debt, its home acquisition debt, and its home equity debt. (Your share of each of these types of debt is equal to the average balance of each debt multiplied by the fraction just given.) After your share of the average balance of each type of debt is determined, you include it with the average balance of that type of debt secured by your stock. Form 1098. The cooperative should give you a Form 1098 showing your share of the interest. Use the rules in this publication to determine your deductible mortgage interest.  Part II: Limits on Home Mortgage Interest Deduction This part of the publication discusses the limits on deductible home mortgage interest. These limits apply to your home mortgage interest expense if you have a home mortgage that does not fit into any of the three categories listed at the beginning of Part I under Fully deductible interest. Your home mortgage interest deduction is limited to the interest on the part of your home mortgage debt that is not more than your qualified loan limit. This is the part of your home mortgage debt that is grandfathered debt or that is not more than the limits for home acquisition debt and home equity debt. Table 1 can help you figure your qualified loan limit and your deductible home mortgage interest.  How To Report Deduct the home mortgage interest and points reported to you on Form 1098 on line 10, Schedule A (Form 1040). If you paid more deductible interest to the financial institution than the amount shown on Form 1098, show the larger deductible amount on line 10. Attach a statement explaining the difference and write ""See attached"" next to line 10. Deduct home mortgage interest that was not reported to you on Form 1098 on line 11 of Schedule A (Form 1040). If you paid home mortgage interest to the person from whom you bought your home, show that person's name, address, and social security number (SSN) or employer identification number (EIN) on the dotted lines next to line 11. The seller must give you this number and you  Home Acquisition Debt Home acquisition debt is a mortgage you took out after October 13, 1987, to buy, build, or substantially improve a qualified home (your main or second home). It also must be secured by that home. If the amount of your mortgage is more than the cost of the home plus the cost of any Page 7   substantial improvements, only the debt that is not more than the cost of the home plus improvements qualifies as home acquisition debt. The additional debt may qualify as home equity debt (discussed later). Home acquisition debt limit. The total home acquisition debt you can have at any time on your main home and second home cannot be more than $1 million ($500,000 if married filing separately). This limit is reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of your grandfathered debt (discussed later). Debt over this limit may qualify as home equity debt (also discussed later). Refinanced home acquisition debt. Any secured debt you use to refinance home acquisition debt is treated as home acquisition debt. However, the new debt will qualify as home acquisition debt only up to the amount of the balance of the old mortgage principal just before the refinancing. Any additional debt is not home acquisition debt, but may qualify as home equity debt (discussed later). Mortgage that qualifies later. A mortgage that does not qualify as home acquisition debt because it does not meet all the requirements may qualify at a later time. For example, a debt that you use to buy your home may not qualify as home acquisition debt because it is not secured by the home. However, if the debt is later secured by the home, it may qualify as home acquisition debt after that time. Similarly, a debt that you use to buy property may not qualify because the property is not a qualified home. However, if the property later becomes a qualified home, the debt may qualify after that time. Mortgage treated as used to buy, build, or improve home. A mortgage secured by a qualified home may be treated as home acquisition debt, even if you do not actually use the proceeds to buy, build, or substantially improve the home. This applies in the following situations. 1) You buy your home within 90 days before or after the date you take out the mortgage. The home acquisition debt is limited to the home's cost, plus the cost of any substantial improvements within the limit described below in (2) or (3). (See Example 1.) 2) You build or improve your home and take out the mortgage before the work is completed. The home acquisition debt is limited to the amount of the expenses incurred within 24 months before the date of the mortgage. 3) You build or improve your home and take out the mortgage within 90 days after the work is completed. The home acquisition debt is limited to the amount of the expenses incurred within the period beginning 24 months before the work is completed and ending on the date of the mortgage. (See Example 2.)  mortgage. The entire mortgage qualifies as home acquisition debt because it was not more than the home's cost.  Example 2. On January 31, John began building a home on the lot that he owned. He used $45,000 of his personal funds to build the home. The home was completed on October 31. On November 21, John took out a $36,000 mortgage that was secured by the home. The mortgage can be treated as used to build the home because it was taken out within 90 days after the home was completed. The entire mortgage qualifies as home acquisition debt because it was not more than the expenses incurred within the period beginning 24 months before the home was completed. Figure C illustrates this.  ments between the part of your home that is a qualified home and any part that is not a qualified home. See Divided use of your home under Qualified Home in Part I.  Home Equity Debt If you took out a loan for reasons other than to buy, build, or substantially improve your home, it may qualify as home equity debt. In addition, debt you incurred to buy, build, or substantially improve your home, to the extent it is more than the home acquisition debt limit, may qualify as home equity debt. Home equity debt is a mortgage you took out after October 13, 1987, that: 1) Does not qualify as home acquisition debt or as grandfathered debt, and 2) Is secured by your qualified home.  Figure C. John Starts Building Home Home Completed ($45,000 in Personal Funds Used)  $36,000 Mortgage Taken Out  Jan. 31  Oct. 31  Nov. 21  Example. You bought your home for cash 10 years ago. You did not have a mortgage on your home until last year, when you took out a $20,000 loan, secured by your home, to pay for your daughter's college tuition and your father's medical bills. This loan is home equity debt. Home equity debt limit. There is a limit on the amount of debt that can be treated as home equity debt. The total home equity debt on your main home and second home is limited to the smaller of: 1) $100,000 ($50,000 if married filing separately), or  9 Months (Within 24 Months)  22 Days (Within 90 Days)  Date of the mortgage. The date you take out your mortgage is the day you receive the loan proceeds, generally the closing date. You can treat the day you apply in writing for your mortgage as the date you take it out. However, this applies only if you receive the loan proceeds within 30 days after your application is approved. If an application you make within the 90-day period is rejected, a reasonable additional time will be allowed to make a new application. Cost of home or improvements. To determine your cost, include amounts paid to acquire any interest in a qualified home or to substantially improve the home. The cost of building or substantially improving a qualified home includes the costs to acquire real property and building materials, fees for architects and design plans, and required building permits. Substantial improvement. An improvement is substantial if it: 1) Adds to the value of your home, 2) Prolongs your home's useful life, or 3) Adapts your home to new uses. Repairs that maintain your home in good condition, such as repainting your home, are not substantial improvements. However, if you paint your home as part of a renovation that substantially improves your qualified home, you can include the painting costs in the cost of the improvements. Acquiring an interest in a home because of a divorce. Cost includes amounts spent to acquire the interest of a spouse or former spouse in a home, because of a divorce or legal separation. Part of home not a qualified home. To figure your home acquisition debt, you must divide the cost of your home and improve-  2) The total of each home's fair market value (FMV) reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of its home acquisition debt and grandfathered debt. Determine the FMV and the outstanding home acquisition and grandfathered debt for each home on the date that the last debt was secured by the home.  Example. You own one home that you bought in 1990. Its fair market value now is $110,000, and the current balance on your original mortgage (home acquisition debt) is $95,000. Bank M offers you a home mortgage loan of 125% of the fair market value of the home less any outstanding mortgages or other liens. To consolidate some of your other debts, you take out a $42,500 home mortgage loan [(125%  $110,000) - $95,000] with Bank M. Your home equity debt is limited to $15,000. This is the smaller of: 1) $100,000, the maximum limit, or 2) $15,000, the amount that the fair market value of $110,000 exceeds the amount of home acquisition debt of $95,000.  Example 1. You bought your main home on June 3 for $175,000. You paid for the home with cash you got from the sale of your old home. On July 15, you took out a mortgage of $150,000 secured by your main home. You used the $150,000 to invest in stocks. You can treat the mortgage as taken out to buy your home because you bought the home within 90 days before you took out the Page 8  Debt higher than limit. Interest on amounts over the home equity debt limit (such as the interest on $27,500 [$42,500 - $15,000] in the preceding example) generally is treated as personal interest and is not deductible. But if the proceeds of the loan were used for investment or business purposes, the interest may be deductible. See Line 13 under the Table 1 Instructions for an explanation of how to allocate the excess interest. Part of home not a qualified home. To figure the limit on your home equity debt, you must divide the FMV of your home between the part that is a qualified home and any part that is not a qualified home. See Divided use   of your home under Qualified Home in Part I. Fair market value. This is the price at which the home would change hands between you and a buyer, neither having to sell or buy, and both having reasonable knowledge of all necessary facts. Sales of similar homes in your area, on about the same date your last debt was secured by the home, may be helpful in figuring the FMV.  Table 1 Instructions You can deduct during the year your main home the following two  all of the interest you paid on mortgages secured by or second home in either of situations.  your qualified home and the interest was paid at least monthly. Complete the following worksheet to figure your average balance. 1. Enter the interest paid in 1998. Do not include points or any other interest paid in 1998 that is for a year after 1998. However, do include interest that is for 1998 but was paid in an earlier year ... 2. Enter the annual interest rate on the mortgage. If the interest rate varied in 1998, use the lowest rate for the year . 3. Divide the amount on line 1 by the amount on line 2. Enter the result .......  1) All the mortgages are grandfathered debt. 2) The total of the mortgage balances for the entire year is within the limits discussed earlier under Home Acquisition Debt and Home Equity Debt. In either of those cases, you do not need Table 1. Otherwise, you may use Table 1 to determine your qualified loan limit and deductible home mortgage interest.  Grandfathered Debt If you took out a mortgage on your home before October 14, 1987, or you refinanced such a mortgage, it may qualify as grandfathered debt. To qualify, it must have been secured by your qualified home on October 13, 1987, and at all times after that date. How you used the proceeds does not matter. Grandfathered debt is not limited. All of the interest you paid on grandfathered debt is fully deductible home mortgage interest. However, the amount of your grandfathered debt reduces the $1 million limit for home acquisition debt and the limit based on your home's fair market value for home equity debt. Refinanced grandfathered debt. If you refinanced grandfathered debt after October 13, 1987, for an amount that was not more than the mortgage principal left on the debt, then you still treat it as grandfathered debt. To the extent the new debt is more than that mortgage principal, it is treated as home acquisition or home equity debt, and the mortgage is a mixed-use mortgage (discussed later under Average Mortgage Balance in the Table 1 Instructions). The debt must be secured by the qualified home. You treat grandfathered debt that was refinanced after October 13, 1987, as grandfathered debt only for the term left on the debt that was refinanced. After that, you treat it as home acquisition debt or home equity debt, depending on how you used the proceeds. Exception. If the debt before refinancing was like a balloon note (the principal on the debt was not amortized over the term of the debt), then you treat the refinanced debt as grandfathered debt for the term of the first refinancing. This term cannot be more than 30 years.  Fill out only one Table 1 for both your TIP main and second home regardless of how many mortgages you have. Home equity debt only. If all of your mortgages are home equity debt, do not fill in lines 1 through 5. Enter zero on line 6 and complete the rest of the worksheet.  Example. Mr. Blue had a line of credit secured by his main home all year. He paid interest of $2,500 on this loan. The interest rate on the loan was 9% (.09) all year. His average balance using this method is $27,778, figured as follows. 1. Enter the interest paid in 1998. Do not include points or any other interest paid in 1998 that is for a year after 1998. However, do include interest that is for 1998 but was paid in an earlier year ... $2,500 2. Enter the annual interest rate on the mortgage. If the interest rate varied in 1998, use the lowest rate for the year . .09 3. Divide the amount on line 1 by the amount on line 2. Enter the result ....... $27,778  Average Mortgage Balance You have to figure the average balance of each mortgage to determine your qualified loan limit. You need these amounts to complete lines 1, 2, and 9 of the worksheet. You can use the highest mortgage balances during the year to complete the worksheet, but you may benefit most by using the average balances. The following are methods you can use to figure your average mortgage balances. However, if a mortgage has more than one category of debt, see Mixed-use mortgages later in this section. Average of first and last balance method. You can use this method if all the following apply. 1) You did not borrow any new amounts on the mortgage during the year. (This does not include borrowing the original mortgage amount.) 2) You did month's includes home or sale.) not prepay more than one principal during the year. (This prepayment by refinancing your by applying proceeds from its  Statements provided by your lender. If you receive monthly statements showing the closing balance or the average balance for the month, you can use either to figure your average balance for the year. You can treat the balance as zero for any month the mortgage was not secured by your qualified home. For each mortgage, figure your average balance by adding your monthly closing or average balances and dividing that total by the number of months the home secured by that mortgage was a qualified home during the year. If your lender can give you your average balance for the year, you can use that amount.  Example. Chester took out a $200,000 first mortgage on his home in 1985. The mortgage was a five-year balloon note and the entire balance on the note was due in 1990. Chester refinanced the debt in 1990 with a new 20-year mortgage. The refinanced debt is treated as grandfathered debt for its entire term (20 years). Line-of-credit mortgage. If you had a lineof-credit mortgage on October 13, 1987, and borrowed additional amounts against it after that date, then the additional amounts are either home acquisition debt or home equity debt depending on how you used the proceeds. The balance on the mortgage before you borrowed the additional amounts is grandfathered debt. The newly borrowed amounts are not grandfathered debt because the funds were borrowed after October 13, 1987. See Mixed-use mortgages under Average Mortgage Balance in the Table 1 Instructions that follow.  3) You had to make level payments at fixed equal intervals on at least a semi-annual basis. You treat your payments as level even if they were adjusted from time to time because of changes in the interest rate. To figure your average balance, complete the following worksheet. 1. Enter the balance as of the first day of the year that the mortgage was secured by your qualified home during the year (generally January 1) .... 2. Enter the balance as of the last day of the year that the mortgage was secured by your qualified home during the year (generally December 31) 3. Add amounts on lines 1 and 2 .......... 4. Divide the amount on line 3 by 2. Enter the result ..................................  Example. Ms. Brown had a home equity loan secured by her main home all year. She received monthly statements showing her average balance for each month. She may figure her average balance for the year by adding her monthly average balances and dividing the total by 12. Mixed-use mortgages. A mixed-use mortgage is a loan that consists of more than one of the three categories of debt (grandfathered debt, home acquisition debt, and home equity debt). For example, a mortgage you took out during the year is a mixed-use mortgage if you used its proceeds partly to refinance a mortgage that you took out in an earlier year to buy your home (home acquisition debt) and partly to pay your son's college tuition (home equity debt). Complete lines 1 and 2 of Table 1 by including the separate average balances of any grandfathered debt and home acquisition debt in your mixed-use mortgage. Do not use the methods described earlier in this section to figure the average balance of either category. Instead, for each category, use the following method. 1) Figure the balance of that category of debt for each month. This is the amount Page 9  Interest paid divided by interest rate method. You can use this method if at all times in 1998 the mortgage was secured by   Table 1.

Principal payments on a mixed-use mortgage are applied in full to each category of debt, until its balance is zero, in the following order: a) b) c) First, any home equity debt, Next, any grandfathered debt, and Finally, any home acquisition debt.  2) Add together the monthly balances figured in (1). 3) Divide the result in (2) by 12. Complete line 9 of Table 1 by including the average balance of the entire mixed-use mortgage, figured under one of the methods described earlier in this section.  must make principal payments of $1,000 at the end of each month. During 1998, her principal payments on the second mortgage totaled $10,000. To complete line 2 of Table 1, Sharon must figure a separate average balance for the part of her second mortgage that is home acquisition debt. The January and February balances were zero. The March through December balances were all $180,000, because none of her principal payments are applied to the home acquisition debt. (They are all applied to the home equity debt, reducing it to $10,000 [$20,000 - $10,000].) The monthly balances of the home acquisition debt total $1,800,000 ($180,000  10). Therefore, the average balance of the home acquisition debt for 1998 was $150,000 ($1,800,000  12).  Line 1 Figure the average balance for the current year of each mortgage you had on all qualified homes on October 13, 1987 (grandfathered debt). Add the results together and enter the total on line 1. Include the average balance for the current year for any grandfathered debt part of a mixed-use mortgage.  Line 2 Figure the average balance for the current year of each mortgage you took out on all qualified homes after October 13, 1987, to buy, build, or substantially improve the home (home acquisition debt). Add the results together and enter the total on line 2. Include the average balance for the current year for any home acquisition debt part of a mixeduse mortgage.  Example 1. In 1986, Sharon took out a $1,400,000 mortgage to buy her main home (grandfathered debt). On March 2, 1998, when the home had a fair market value of $1,700,000 and she owed $1,100,000 on the mortgage, Sharon took out a second mortgage for $200,000. She used $180,000 of the proceeds to make substantial improvements to her home (home acquisition debt) and the remaining $20,000 to buy a car (home equity debt). Under the loan agreement, Sharon Page 10  Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1. In 1999, Sharon's January through October principal payments on her second mortgage are applied to the home equity debt, reducing it to zero. The balance of the home acquisition debt remains $180,000 for each of those months. Because her November and December principal payments are applied to the home acquisition debt, the November balance is $179,000 ($180,000 - $1,000) and the December balance is $178,000 ($180,000 - $2,000). The monthly balances total $2,157,000 [($180,000  10) + $179,000 + $178,000]. Therefore, the average balance of the home acquisition debt for 1999 is $179,750 ($2,157,000  12).  Line 7 The amount on line 7 cannot be more than the smaller of: 1) $100,000 ($50,000 if married filing separately), or 2) The total of each home's fair market value (FMV) reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of its home acquisition debt and grandfathered debt. Determine the FMV and the outstanding home acquisition and grandfathered debt for each home on the date that the last debt was secured by the home.   See Home equity debt limit under Home Equity Debt, earlier, for more information about fair market value.  Line 9 Figure the average balance for the current year of each outstanding home mortgage. Add the average balances together and enter the total on line 9. See Average Mortgage Balance, earlier. Note: When figuring the average balance of a mixed-use mortgage, for line 9 determine the average balance of the entire mortgage.  explanation of how to determine the use of loan proceeds. The following two rules describe how to allocate the interest on line 13 to a business or investment activity. 1) If you used all of the proceeds of the mortgages on line 9 for one activity, then all the interest on line 13 is allocated to that activity. In this case, deduct the interest on the form or schedule to which it applies. 2) If you used the proceeds of the mortgages on line 9 for more than one activity, then you can allocate the interest on line 13 among the activities in any manner you select (up to the total amount of interest otherwise allocable to each activity, explained next). You figure the ""total amount of interest otherwise allocable to each activity"" by multiplying the amount on line 10 of the worksheet by the following fraction. Amount on line 9 of the worksheet allocated to that activity Total amount on line 9  Don determines that the proceeds of mortgage A are allocable to personal expenses for the entire year. The proceeds of mortgage B are allocable to his business for the entire year. Don paid $14,000 of interest on mortgage A and $16,000 of interest on mortgage B. He figures the amount of home mortgage interest he can deduct by using Table 1. Since both mortgages are home equity debt, Don determines that $15,000 of the interest can be deducted as home mortgage interest. The interest Don can allocate to his business is the smaller of: 1) The amount on line 13 of the worksheet ($15,000), or 2) The total amount of interest allocable to the business ($16,500), figured by multiplying the amount on line 10 (the $30,000 total interest paid) by the following fraction. $110,000 (the average balance of the mortgage allocated to the business) $200,000 (the total average balance of all mortgages-- line 9 of the worksheet)  Line 10 If you make payments to a financial institution, or to a person whose business is making loans, you should get Form 1098 or a similar statement from the lender. This form will show the amount of interest to enter on line 10 of the worksheet. Also include on this line any other interest payments made on debts secured by a qualified home for which you did not receive a Form 1098. Do not include points on this line. Claiming your deductible points. your deductible points as follows. Figure  1) Figure your deductible points for the current year using the rules explained under Points in Part I. 2) Multiply the amount in item (1) by the decimal amount on line 11 of the worksheet. Enter the result on Schedule A (Form 1040), line 10 or 12, whichever applies. This amount is fully deductible. 3) Subtract the amount in item (2) from the amount in item (1). This amount is not deductible as home mortgage interest. However, if you used any of the loan proceeds for business or investment activities, see the instructions for line 13 of the worksheet, next.  Example. Don had two mortgages (A and B) on his main home during the entire year. Mortgage A had an average balance of $90,000, and mortgage B had an average balance of $110,000.  Because $15,000 is the smaller of items (1) and (2), that is the amount of interest Don can allocate to his business. He deducts this amount on his Schedule C (Form 1040).  Table 2.

If you did not use any of the proceeds of any mortgage included on line 9 of the worksheet for business or investment activities, then all the interest on line 13 is personal interest. Personal interest is not deductible. If you did use all or part of any mortgage proceeds for business or investment activities, the part of the interest on line 13 that is allocable to those activities may be deducted as business or investment expense, subject to any limits that apply. Table 2 shows where to deduct that interest.

However, complete independence during the later years may be compromised as longevity is associated with increasing changes in the physical, social, emotional, mental, and financial status of older persons. Aging-related changes may persuade an older person to consider relocating to a more supportive living environment. Section I (Retirement Housing Alternatives) provides brief descriptions of various retirement housing options available in New York State to accommodate older people as their needs change during the later years. Section II (Staying In Your Own Home) provides brief descriptions of a variety of programs and strategies that older people can employ to make ""staying in your home"" a viable option for aging in place. References to contact are included for obtaining additional detailed information.  I. RETIREMENT HOUSING ALTERNATIVES Retirement housing alternatives may be-   developed by public or private organizations, priced at market rates or subsidized by government assistance to be affordable by persons with specified income limits, open to persons of all ages or restricted to adults over a specified age.  Housing alternatives might or might not include a variety of activities, supportive assistance (such as congregate dining, housekeeping, laundry, transportation, 24-hour security, emergency response systems, resident advisor), supervision, personal/health care services, and nursing care. Housing that includes any of these activities, assistance, or services is often referred to as ""supportive housing."" If such features are included, they might be included as part of the monthly charge, or rent and services/assistance might be charged for separately. The extent of service provision does not preclude residents from privately purchasing these services and assistance from community service agencies.  Housing Alternatives for Seniors in New York State  1   There is much overlap among the names, definitions, and construct of various housing alternatives. Following are several housing categories, and their major conventional characteristics, into which most available housing for seniors will fall. If a category/alternative is licensed by New York State, its specific name and definition are stated in law. 1. SENIOR HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS These are multiunit apartment buildings, condominiums, cooperatives, single family home complexes, and mobile home parks that are restricted to persons over a specified age (defined variously as 55, 60, 62, or 65). Typically, these were not originally planned to include activities, supportive assistance, or personal/health care. Many have incrementally added these features as residents have aged and require help to continue aging in place. Monthly charges or rents usually do not include the costs of services. Charges/rents may be priced at market rates or subsidized with government assistance. NATURALLY OCCURRING RETIREMENT COMMUNITIES (NORCs) These are geographic areas or multiunit apartment buildings that are NOT restricted to persons over a specified age, but which have evolved over time to include a significant number (typically, over 50 per cent) of residents who are aged 60 and over. As their numbers of elderly tenants have grown, many NORCs have added activities, supportive assistance, and services to meet residents' needs. Monthly charges or rents typically do not include the costs of these activities/services. Charges/rents may be priced at market rates or subsidized with government assistance. CONGREGATE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS These are multiunit housing buildings (private rooms or full apartments) that are restricted to persons over a specified age and that include supportive assistance. Typically, monthly charges include rent and supportive services. Congregate housing does not require licensure or certification by a public agency as personal care services (help with eating, bathing, dressing, grooming, toileting, transferring) are not provided or included in the monthly charge. Congregate housing residents may contract privately with community home care agencies to receive personal care and home health care services. Monthly charges may be priced at market rates or subsidized with government assistance.  2.  3.  Housing Alternatives for Seniors in New York State  2   4.  SHARED-HOUSING ALTERNATIVES Shared-housing arrangements can be intergenerational (age-integrated) or restricted to older persons. The benefits of home-sharing include: sharing costs and upkeep tasks, mutual support and assistance, companionship, continued aging-in-place, and facilitated caregiving by family members. Local zoning laws may specify the conditions under which shared-housing alternatives may be established. Four shared housing alternatives: a. SHARED LIVING RESIDENCE This is an age-integrated or age-restricted residence that is shared by a small group (3 to 10) of unrelated persons who share the living expenses and tasks of running the household. Residents have private bedrooms, but share the kitchen, dining, and living rooms. A shared living residence may be owned/sponsored by a community organization and rented to residents. Additional supportive and household assistance for residents will vary according to the independence level of the residents. No government licensure or certification is required unless personal care is charged for or provided by the sponsoring organization. Charges/rents may be priced at market rates or subsidized with government assistance. ACCESSORY APARTMENT An accessory apartment is created when a single-family home is modified to include a complete, private apartment for use by an older person (typically, an elderly relative); or, as a source of additional income and the security of having a housemate while maintaining the privacy of a private living unit, an elderly person may convert part of her own home into an accessory apartment for use by another person. ELDER COTTAGE (or ECHO HOUSING) This is a small (apartment-sized), detached home for use by an older person which is temporarily sited on private property that contains the primary residence of a younger family member. An Elder Cottage utilizes the water, electric, and sewer systems of the primary home. It provides security for the older person, privacy for both the older person and the younger family, and facilitates the caregiving efforts of the younger family.  b.  c.  Housing Alternatives for Seniors in New York State  3   d.  MATCH-UP HOME SHARING Under this arrangement, a homeowner or apartment renter with extra room shares his home with another person in exchange for rent and/or services or as a mutually supportive arrangement to share companionship, expenses, assistance, and household tasks. Sharing may be intergenerational or only for older persons. Matchup home sharing may occur informally, but is often a formal program operated by a community agency that assumes responsibility for screening participants, matching for compatibility, assisting in drawing up agreements for living together, and helping with conflict resolution.  5.  ENRICHED HOUSING PROGRAM This service program is licensed by the New York State Department of Health and provides congregate meals, housekeeping, homemaking, transportation, social activities, supervision, and personal care for individuals aged 65 and over. The program operates in multiunit apartment buildings. An entire building may be licensed to provide Enriched Housing services to all residents, or the program may be licensed to provide Enriched Housing services to a specified proportion of residents in a senior or family apartment development. Both the rent and the cost of services/care are included in one monthly charge. Residents can use private resources to pay for monthly charges; those below a specified income level are eligible for subsidization through the federal and state Supplemental Security Income (SSI) Programs. FAMILY TYPE HOMES Family Type Homes, for adults of all ages, are certified by county Departments of Social Services. These are typically a single family home in which the homeowner provides supportive services, meals, supervision, and personal care to four or fewer adults who are unrelated to the homeowner/operator. Rent and care are included in one monthly charge. Charges may be paid with private resources, or those below a specified income level are eligible for subsidization through federal and state SSI Programs. ADULT HOMES Adult Homes, for adults of all ages, are licensed by the State Department of Health to provide room, meals, supportive services, personal care, and supervision to five or more adults. Room and services are included in one monthly charge, which may be paid with private resources or subsidized through federal and state SSI Programs for those below a specified income level. 4  6.  7.  Housing Alternatives for Seniors in New York State   8.  ASSISTED LIVING PROGRAM Adult Home operators and Enriched Housing operators are eligible to be approved by the State Department of Health to provide personal and health-related services (in addition to routine supportive services) to their residents who are assessed as being nursing-home-eligible. Rent and all services may be paid with private resources or, for those below a specified income level, may be subsidized through SSI for residential supportive services and through the Medicaid Program for personal care and health-related services. DEMENTIA CARE FACILITIES These multiunit developments are licensed by the State Department of Health as Enriched Housing Programs or Adult Homes. Their physical layouts, programmatic aims, staffing, and care plans are designed to address the needs of people with Alzheimer's Disease or other dementia conditions. CONTINUING CARE RETIREMENT COMMUNITIES (CCRCs) These multiple-level complexes are restricted to persons over a specified age, and they include independent living units (apartments and/or cottages), social activities, congregate meals, supportive assistance, and personal care all on one campus. Nursing home care is also included, but may be provided on- or off-campus. Residents pay for housing, activities, meals, services, and nursing care with a one-time entry fee and regular monthly charges and may also use long term care insurance. A community's independent living units may be structured as a cooperative, condominium, or rental arrangement. CCRCs are approved for development and are regulated as a single, total entity by New York State government; and residents are guaranteed housing, supportive assistance, and a specified amount of nursing care under a single contract. The single contract may cover the duration of the resident's life (unlimited nursing care) or cover a specified amount (limited) of nursing care.  9.  10.  11.  MULTILEVEL HOUSING AND CARE COMPLEX These multiple-level complexes include independent living units (apartments and/or cottages), social activities, congregate meals, supportive assistance, and nursing care all on one campus. A complex's independent living units may be structured as a cooperative, condominium, conventional rental arrangement, or long term lease arrangement. Residents pay for housing, activities, meals, and services with monthly charges and may also pay an initial entry or purchase fee. 5  Housing Alternatives for Seniors in New York State   The total complex is not regulated as a single entity, but the adult home and nursing home components are licensed and regulated by the New York State Department of Health. Residents' use of the adult home and nursing home is not contractually guaranteed as it is under a CCRC contract, but residents typically are given priority access to the complex's health and nursing care facilities. 12. NURSING HOME Nursing homes provide skilled nursing services and chronic custodial care. They are licensed and regulated by the New York State Department of Health. The State Office for the Aging's Long Term Care Ombudsman Program provides trained community volunteer Ombudsmen who advocate on behalf of elderly residents of nursing homes and adult homes and their families. Ombudsmen receive complaints, investigate, and help resolve problems.  II. STAYING IN YOUR OWN HOME Service providers and advocates can assist older people to find access to several options that will enable them to remain living in their own homes. These options include conversion of a home's equity into a source of additional cash, physical design modifications and repair of an existing home, and use of a variety of in-home supportive assistance and health care. 1. HOME EQUITY CONVERSION PLANS Home equity conversion plans are financing strategies that help make continuing home ownership an affordable option. These plans allow older homeowners to convert their home's equity into cash loans while continuing to live in their homes. Loans are not paid back until the homeowner transfers title to the home, moves out of the home, or dies, or are repaid at a future date agreed upon by the financial lender and the homeowner. This is not to be confused with home equity loans, which work much like a credit card--allowing you to borrow against your home but are repayable immediately in total or in monthly installments. Following are several types of home equity conversion plans:  Housing Alternatives for Seniors in New York State  6   a.  REVERSE MORTGAGE (For a list of HUD-approved reverse mortgage counselors, call AARP's Housing Counseling Clearinghouse at 1-888-466-3487. For a copy of several publications on reverse mortgages, including Home-Made Money: Consumer's Guide to Home Equity Conversion, call AARP's Home Equity Information Center (202) 434-6042. For a list of Fannie Mae approved lenders or for a copy of Money from Home: A Consumer's Guide to Reverse Mortgage Options, call (212) 755-6820.) A reverse mortgage allows older homeowners to borrow against the equity they have built up in their homes as a source of additional cash. Such loans can be used to pay for daily living expenses, taxes, home health care, home repair, or for any other use preferred by the homeowner. The cash payments may be received in one or several lump sums or may be received in fixed monthly payments. The equity amount available to the homeowner depends on several factors such as the value of the home and the homeowner's health, age, and marital status. The accumulated loan amount, interest, and mortgage fees are not repaid until the homeowner transfers title to the home, moves out of the home, or dies, or is repaid at a future date agreed upon by the financial lender and the homeowner. When due, the loan amount is typically paid through the sale of the home. A variety of lenders offer a variety of reverse mortgage products, and many communities have impartial reverse mortgage counselors to help homeowners choose the most appropriate product for their unique circumstances.  b.  PROPERTY TAX DEFERRAL (For information, contact the local Tax Assessor's office) This is an optional program that municipalities may elect to offer to their older homeowners. Using a participating financial lender, a homeowner's property taxes are paid through loans made against the equity in his/her home. The loan amounts, and any accompanying fees and interest charges, accumulate over time and are repaid at a future date, typically through the sale of the home. The local tax assessor will know if such a program is available in your municipality.  Housing Alternatives for Seniors in New York State  7   c.  SALE/LEASEBACK (For information and legal assistance, contact an attorney knowledgeable in real estate law) In this plan, the homeowner sells his/her house (often to one of his/her children) but continues to live in the home through a life lease clause in the buyer's deed. Financing arrangements include a lump sum ""down payment"" to the seller, mortgage payments to the seller, and rental payments to the buyer. Rent charges are less than the mortgage payments, leaving the selling homeowner with additional monthly income. The buyer is responsible for taxes, repairs, insurance, etc., but the buyer also benefits from any increase in the value of the property over time.  2.  STAR (New York School Tax Relief Program) (For information and application forms, contact the local Tax Assessor's office) STAR provides a property tax exemption on owner-occupied residential property to all New York State residents. Senior citizens with incomes over $60,000 and all non-seniors are eligible for the Basic STAR Exemption beginning with the school year 1999-2000, with a full tax exemption of $30,000 phased in over a three-year period. Senior citizens with incomes under $60,000 are eligible for the Enhanced STAR Exemption beginning with the school year 1998-1999, with a full exemption of at least $50,000 phased in over a four-year period.  3.  PROPERTY TAX ABATEMENT (For information and application forms, contact the local Tax Assessor's office) New York State law allows up to a 50 per cent abatement in local real property taxes for older homeowners, with each locality allowed to set its own maximum income eligibility standard.  Housing Alternatives for Seniors in New York State  8   4.  TAX FORM IT-214 (Circuit Breaker Program) (For information and assistance in completing tax forms, contact the County Office for the Aging) Form IT-214 is filed with a person's annual income tax forms. Tax credits or rebates are provided to older homeowners and renters who are paying a disproportionate amount on housing expenses in relation to their household income. An individual may qualify for a rebate even if he pays no income tax.  5.  HOME REPAIR or HOME MODIFICATION PROGRAMS The availability of home repair or modification programs varies among counties and communities. In addition to the programs described below, local repair and modification programs may be available and funded through the federal Community Development Block Grant and HOME programs, which are administered by various local organizations or municipal departments. Also, many localities have community-specific home repair and modification programs funded locally and operated by local governments, school/community programs, or community-based service organizations. a. WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM (For more information, contact the County Office for the Aging) Weather stripping, caulking, insulating, cleaning or minor repairs to heating equipment, and other energy saving home improvements are provided at no charge for low income families. b. RESTORE (For more information, contact the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal at (518) 486-7083) Grants of up to $5,000 per elderly homeowner are provided for repairs to any of the five major systems of the home in emergency situations that pose a threat to the life and safety of the elderly residents.  Housing Alternatives for Seniors in New York State  9   c.  SECTION 504 HOME REPAIR PROGRAM (For more information, contact the County Office for the Aging; or Rural Development Office, (315) 477-6400) Grants to low-income rural senior homeowners or loans to lowincome rural non-senior homeowners are provided for home repairs and energy conservation improvements.  d.  AFFORDABLE HOME OWNERSHIP PROGRAM (For more information, contact the New York State Housing Finance Agency, (212) 688-4000) In addition to providing financial assistance for the construction or purchase of homes, funds are available through this HFA program to municipalities, housing authorities, housing companies, and non-profit organizations to provide grants for the rehabilitation and structural improvement of condominiums, cooperatives, and 1-4 family homes. The program is not targeted solely to the elderly, but is meant to make affordable home ownership available to low income persons, including the elderly.  e.  UTILITY ENERGY ASSISTANCE (For more information, contact your local utility company or County Office for the Aging) Utility company funds, together with customer contributions, provide monies to low income persons to help pay energy bills, weatherization improvements, and repairs to heating equipment. Local programs have different names; for example, Niagara Mohawk's program is entitled ""Care and Share.""  6.  HEAP (HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM) (For more information, contact the County Office for the Aging or County Department of Social Services) HEAP is a federally funded program to provide financial assistance to low income persons 60 years of age or older to help pay heating bills.  Housing Alternatives for Seniors in New York State  10   7.  RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS A variety of federal and state government housing programs provide funds to build or rehabilitate housing that is targeted to very low, low, and moderate income families and seniors. Rents in these buildings are subsidized; that is, lower than the area's market rate rents. Often, tenants are required to pay no more than 30 per cent of their income for rent or rent and utilities, and there may be abatements for utility costs. In some cases, rents are not restricted to 30 per cent of income, but the rental charge structure is regulated by a government agency to remain below market rates. In addition to subsidized housing, the following programs maintain rents below market rates. a. RURAL RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (For more information, contact the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, (518) 486-5067, or USDA Rural Development, (315) 477-6400) New York State provides financial assistance to low income elderly and family residents in Rural Development's Section 515 rural rental housing projects. This assistance enables residents to pay no more than 30 per cent of their incomes on rent. b. SECTION 8 PROGRAM (For more information, contact the local Public Housing Authority) Federal rent vouchers and rent certificates provide financial assistance for very low income elderly and families in rental housing, enabling these residents to pay no more than 30 per cent of their incomes on rent. c. RENT CONTROL and RENT STABILIZATION (For more information, contact the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, (212) 480-6700) Rent control generally applies to buildings constructed before February, 1947, and for tenants who have been living in their apartments continuously since July 1, 1971. Rent control exists for buildings in New York City, as well as in some municipalities in the counties of Albany, Erie, Nassau, Rensselaer, Schenectady and Westchester. Rent Control limits the rent a landlord may charge for apartments and restricts the right of a landlord to evict tenants.  Housing Alternatives for Seniors in New York State  11   Rent Stabilization (in New York City) and the Emergency Tenant Protection Act (in Nassau, Westchester, and Rockland Counties) generally exist for buildings built between February 1, 1947, and January 1, 1974, and for tenants who moved in after June 30, 1971. These programs set maximum allowable rental increases. d. SCRIE (SENIOR CITIZEN RENT INCREASE EXEMPTION) (For more information: in New York City, contact the New York City Department for the Aging, (212) 442-9366; outside of New York City, contact the County Office for the Aging) Tenants aged 62 and over who live in rent controlled or rent stabilized apartments in New York City and in several municipalities in Nassau and Westchester Counties may qualify for an exemption to rental increases if their incomes and the proportion of their incomes spent on rent meet eligibility guidelines.  8.  COMMUNITY-BASED SERVICES New York State offers an extensive range of programs and services that assist frail older persons to continue living in their own homes. Contact the County Office for the Aging for information about programs such as congregate meals, home-delivered meals, legal assistance, health and long term care insurance counseling, caregiver support, respite services, social day care, telephone reassurance, senior service centers, and transportation services. Several community-based programs specific to making the home environment viable for aging-in-place are described below. a. RESIDENT ADVISOR PROGRAM (For more information, contact the New York State Office for the Aging, (518) 486-2728) In many rental housing projects, a staff person is available on a regular basis to all older residents for counseling, information and referral, and facilitated linkage to community-based assistance and services.  Housing Alternatives for Seniors in New York State  12   b.  EISEP (Expanded In-home Services for the Elderly Program) and COMMUNITY SERVICES FOR THE ELDERLY (For more information, contact the County Office for the Aging) These state-supported programs provide supportive services to older persons in their own homes/apartments: case management, homemaking, housekeeping, and other services. These programs are available to older persons whose income levels exceed Medicaid eligibility levels, and charges are assessed on a sliding scale basis.  c.  PERSONAL CARE and HOME HEALTH AIDE SERVICES (For more information, contact the County Public Health Department; or County Department of Social Services; also see phone book listings) Services are available to older persons in their own homes or apartments: housekeeping, personal care, and home health aide services. Services are available to seniors and families on a private pay basis or are eligible for Medicaid reimbursement if income eligibility limits are met.  d.  LONG TERM HOME HEALTH CARE PROGRAM (LTHHC) [Nursing Home Without Walls Program] (For more information, contact the County Office for the Aging, County Dept. of Social Services, or County Health Dept.) As an alternative to institutionalized long term care, this program provides nursing home services and other services to persons in their own homes or apartments. Individuals are eligible for the LTHHC Program if an assessment indicates that they are nursinghome eligible and the services required will cost no more than a specified percentage of what those same services would cost if provided in a nursing home.  e.  ADULT DAY CARE (Social or Medical) (For more information, contact the County Office for the Aging) Both types of day programs provide social and other activities, meals, personal care, and supervision in a protective setting for physically and mentally frail older persons. Medical day care also includes the various rehabilitation therapies and nursing and dental services. Medical day care charges are reimbursable through the Medicaid Program for income-eligible participants. 13  Housing Alternatives for Seniors in New York State   SOME HOUSING RESOURCES !

However, complete         independence during the later years may be compromised as longevity is         associated with increasing changes in the physical, social, emotional, mental,         and financial status of older persons.           Aging-related changes may persuade an         older person to consider relocating to a more supportive living environment.          Section I (Retirement Housing Alternatives)  provides brief descriptions         of various retirement housing options available in New York State to         accommodate older people as their needs change during the later years.                     Section II (Staying In Your Own Home)          provides brief descriptions of a variety of programs and strategies that         older people can employ to make ""staying in your home"" a viable         option for aging in place. References to contact are included for obtaining         additional detailed information.            I. RETIREMENT HOUSING ALTERNATIVES                             Retirement housing alternatives may be --                    developed by public or private         organizations,            priced at market rates or subsidized by         government assistance to be affordable by persons with specified income limits,                    open to persons of all ages or         restricted to adults over a specified age.                   Housing alternatives might or might not         include a variety of activities, supportive assistance (such as congregate         dining, housekeeping, laundry, transportation, 24-hour security, emergency         response systems, resident advisor), supervision, personal/ health care         services, and nursing care. Housing that includes any of these activities,         assistance, or services is often referred to as ""supportive housing.""         If such features are included, they might be included as part of the monthly         charge, or rent and services/ assistance might be charged for separately. The         extent of service provision does not preclude residents from privately         purchasing these services and assistance from community service         agencies.                   4    Page         5   6   top           There is much overlap among the names,         definitions, and construct of various housing alternatives. Following are         several housing categories, and their major conventional characteristics, into         which most available housing for seniors will fall. If a category/ alternative         is licensed by New York State, its specific name and definition are stated in         law.            1. SENIOR HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS                             These are multiunit apartment buildings, condominiums,         cooperatives, single family home complexes, and mobile home parks that are         restricted to persons over a specified age (defined variously as 55, 60, 62, or         65). Typically, these were not originally planned to include activities,         supportive assistance, or personal/ health care. Many have incrementally added         these features as residents have aged and require help to continue aging in         place. Monthly charges or rents usually do not include the costs of services.         Charges/ rents may be priced at market rates or subsidized with government         assistance.            2. NATURALLY OCCURRING RETIREMENT         COMMUNITIES (NORCs)                     These are geographic areas or multiunit apartment buildings         that are NOT restricted to persons over a specified age, but which have evolved         over time to include a significant number (typically, over 50 per cent) of         residents who are aged 60 and over. As their numbers of elderly tenants have         grown, many NORCs have added activities, supportive assistance, and services to         meet residents' needs. Monthly charges or rents typically do not include the         costs of these activities/ services. Charges/ rents may be priced at market         rates or subsidized with government assistance.            3. CONGREGATE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS                             These are multiunit housing buildings (private rooms or         full apartments) that are restricted to persons over a specified age and that         include supportive assistance. Typically, monthly charges include rent and         supportive services. Congregate housing does not require licensure or         certification by a public agency as personal care services (help with eating,         bathing, dressing, grooming, toileting, transferring) are not provided or         included in the monthly charge. Congregate housing residents may contract         privately with community home care agencies to receive personal care and home         health care services. Monthly charges may be priced at market rates or         subsidized with government assistance.                   5    Page         6   7   top           4. SHARED-HOUSING ALTERNATIVES                             Shared-housing arrangements can be intergenerational         (age-integrated) or restricted to older persons. The benefits of home-sharing         include: sharing costs and upkeep tasks, mutual support and assistance,         companionship, continued aging-in-place, and facilitated caregiving by family         members. Local zoning laws may specify the conditions under which         shared-housing alternatives may be established. Four shared housing         alternatives:                       a. SHARED LIVING RESIDENCE             This is an age-integrated or age-restricted residence         that is shared by a small group (3 to 10) of unrelated persons who share the         living expenses and tasks of running the household. Residents have private         bedrooms, but share the kitchen, dining, and living rooms. A shared living         residence may be owned/ sponsored by a community organization and rented to         residents. Additional supportive and household assistance for residents will         vary according to the independence level of the residents. No government         licensure or certification is required unless personal care is charged for or         provided by the sponsoring organization. Charges/ rents may be priced at market         rates or subsidized with government assistance.                               b. ACCESSORY APARTMENT             An accessory apartment is created when a single-family         home is modified to include a complete, private apartment for use by an older         person (typically, an elderly relative); or, as a source of additional income         and the security of having a housemate while maintaining the privacy of a         private living unit, an elderly person may convert part of her own home into an         accessory apartment for use by another person.                               c. ELDER COTTAGE (or ECHO HOUSING)                     This is a small (apartment-sized), detached home for use         by an older person which is temporarily sited on private property that contains         the primary residence of a younger family member. An Elder Cottage utilizes the         water, electric, and sewer systems of the primary home. It provides security         for the older person, privacy for both the older person and the younger family,         and facilitates the caregiving efforts of the younger family.                           6    Page         7   8   top                      d. MATCH-UP HOME SHARING             Under this arrangement, a homeowner or apartment renter         with extra room shares his home with another person in exchange for rent and/         or services or as a mutually supportive arrangement to share companionship,         expenses, assistance, and household tasks. Sharing may be intergenerational or         only for older persons. Match-up home sharing may occur informally, but is         often a formal program operated by a community agency that assumes         responsibility for screening participants, matching for compatibility,         assisting in drawing up agreements for living together, and helping with         conflict resolution.                    5. ENRICHED HOUSING PROGRAM                     This service program is licensed by the New York State         Department of Health and provides congregate meals, housekeeping, homemaking,         transportation, social activities, supervision, and personal care for         individuals aged 65 and over. The program operates in multiunit apartment         buildings. An entire building may be licensed to provide Enriched Housing         services to all residents, or the program may be licensed to provide Enriched         Housing services to a specified proportion of residents in a senior or family         apartment development. Both the rent and the cost of services/ care are         included in one monthly charge. Residents can use private resources to pay for         monthly charges; those below a specified income level are eligible for         subsidization through the federal and state Supplemental Security Income (SSI)         Programs.            6. FAMILY TYPE HOMES                     Family Type Homes, for adults of all ages, are certified by         county Departments of Social Services. These are typically a single family home         in which the homeowner provides supportive services, meals, supervision, and         personal care to four or fewer adults who are unrelated to the homeowner/         operator. Rent and care are included in one monthly charge. Charges may be paid         with private resources, or those below a specified income level are eligible         for subsidization through federal and state SSI Programs.            7. ADULT HOMES                     Adult Homes, for adults of all ages, are licensed by the         State Department of Health to provide room, meals, supportive services,         personal care, and supervision to five or more adults. Room and services are         included in one monthly charge, which may be paid with private resources or         subsidized through federal and state SSI Programs for those below a specified         income level.                    7    Page         8   9   top           8. ASSISTED LIVING PROGRAM                     Adult Home operators and Enriched Housing operators are         eligible to be approved by the State Department of Health to provide personal         and health-related services (in addition to routine supportive services) to         their residents who are assessed as being nursing-home-eligible. Rent and all         services may be paid with private resources or, for those below a specified         income level, may be subsidized through SSI for residential supportive services         and through the Medicaid Program for personal care and health-related services.                    9. DEMENTIA CARE FACILITIES                     These multiunit developments are licensed by the State         Department of Health as Enriched Housing Programs or Adult Homes. Their         physical layouts, programmatic aims, staffing, and care plans are designed to         address the needs of people with Alzheimer's Disease or other dementia         conditions.            10. CONTINUING CARE RETIREMENT         COMMUNITIES (CCRCs)                     These multiple-level complexes are restricted to persons         over a specified age, and they include independent living units (apartments         and/ or cottages), social activities, congregate meals, supportive assistance,         and personal care all on one campus. Nursing home care is also included, but         may be provided on-or off-campus. Residents pay for housing, activities, meals,         services, and nursing care with a one-time entry fee and regular monthly         charges and may also use long term care insurance. A community's independent         living units may be structured as a cooperative, condominium, or rental         arrangement.           CCRCs are approved for development and         are regulated as a single, total entity by New York State government; and         residents are guaranteed housing, supportive assistance, and a specified amount         of nursing care under a single contract. The single contract may cover the         duration of the resident's life (unlimited nursing care) or cover a specified         amount (limited) of nursing care.            11. MULTILEVEL HOUSING AND CARE         COMPLEX                     These multiple-level complexes include independent living         units (apartments and/ or cottages), social activities, congregate meals,         supportive assistance, and nursing care all on one campus. A complex's         independent living units may be structured as a cooperative, condominium,         conventional rental arrangement, or long term lease arrangement. Residents pay         for housing, activities, meals, and services with monthly charges and may also         pay an initial entry or purchase fee.                   8    Page         9   10   top          The total complex is not regulated as a         single entity, but the adult home and nursing home components are licensed and         regulated by the New York State Department of Health. Residents' use of the         adult home and nursing home is not contractually guaranteed as it is under a         CCRC contract, but residents typically are given priority access to the         complex's health and nursing care facilities.            12. NURSING HOME                     Nursing homes provide skilled nursing services and chronic         custodial care. They are licensed and regulated by the New York State         Department of Health. The State Office for the Aging's Long Term Care Ombudsman         Program provides trained community volunteer Ombudsmen who advocate on behalf         of elderly residents of nursing homes and adult homes and their families.         Ombudsmen receive complaints, investigate, and help resolve problems.                     II. STAYING IN YOUR OWN         HOME          Service providers and advocates can assist         older people to find access to several options that will enable them to remain         living in their own homes. These options include conversion of a home's equity         into a source of additional cash, physical design modifications and repair of         an existing home, and use of a variety of in-home supportive assistance and         health care.            1. HOME EQUITY CONVERSION PLANS                             Home equity conversion plans are financing strategies that         help make continuing home ownership an affordable option. These plans allow         older homeowners to convert their home's equity into cash loans while         continuing to live in their homes. Loans are not paid back until the homeowner         transfers title to the home, moves out of the home, or dies, or are repaid at a         future date agreed upon by the financial lender and the homeowner. This is not         to be confused with home equity loans, which work much like a credit         card--allowing you to borrow against your home but are repayable immediately in         total or in monthly installments. Following are several types of home equity         conversion plans:                   9    Page         10   11   top                    a. REVERSE MORTGAGE           (For a list of HUD-approved reverse mortgage counselors,         call AARP's Housing Counseling Clearinghouse at 1-888-466-3487. For a copy of         several publications on reverse mortgages, including Home-Made Money:         Consumer's Guide to Home Equity Conversion, call AARP's Home Equity Information         Center (202) 434-6042. For a list of Fannie Mae approved lenders or for a copy         of Money from Home: A Consumer's Guide to Reverse Mortgage Options, call (212)         755-6820.)             A reverse mortgage allows older         homeowners to borrow against the equity they have built up in their homes as a         source of additional cash. Such loans can be used to pay for daily living         expenses, taxes, home health care, home repair, or for any other use preferred         by the homeowner. The cash payments may be received in one or several lump sums         or may be received in fixed monthly payments. The equity amount available to         the homeowner depends on several factors such as the value of the home and the         homeowner's health, age, and marital status. The accumulated loan amount,         interest, and mortgage fees are not repaid until the homeowner transfers title         to the home, moves out of the home, or dies, or is repaid at a future date         agreed upon by the financial lender and the homeowner. When due, the loan         amount is typically paid through the sale of the home. A variety of lenders         offer a variety of reverse mortgage products, and many communities have         impartial reverse mortgage counselors to help homeowners choose the most         appropriate product for their unique circumstances.                               b. PROPERTY TAX DEFERRAL           (For information, contact the local Tax Assessor's         office)             This is an optional program that         municipalities may elect to offer to their older homeowners. Using a         participating financial lender, a homeowner's property taxes are paid through         loans made against the equity in his/ her home. The loan amounts, and any         accompanying fees and interest charges, accumulate over time and are repaid at         a future date, typically through the sale of the home. The local tax assessor         will know if such a program is available in your municipality.                           10    Page         11   12   top                      c. SALE/ LEASEBACK           (For information and legal assistance, contact an         attorney knowledgeable in real estate law)             In this plan, the homeowner sells his/         her house (often to one of his/ her children) but continues to live in the home         through a life lease clause in the buyer's deed. Financing arrangements include         a lump sum ""down payment"" to the seller, mortgage payments to the         seller, and rental payments to the buyer. Rent charges are less than the         mortgage payments, leaving the selling homeowner with additional monthly         income. The buyer is responsible for taxes, repairs, insurance, etc., but the         buyer also benefits from any increase in the value of the property over time.                            2. STAR (New York School Tax Relief         Program)                     (For information and application forms, contact the local         Tax Assessor's office)           STAR provides a property tax exemption on         owner-occupied residential property to all New York State residents. Senior         citizens with incomes over $60,000 and all non-seniors are eligible for the         Basic STAR Exemption beginning with the school year 1999-2000, with a full tax         exemption of $30,000 phased in over a three-year period. Senior citizens with         incomes under $60,000 are eligible for the Enhanced STAR Exemption beginning         with the school year 1998-1999, with a full exemption of at least $50,000         phased in over a four-year period.            3. PROPERTY TAX ABATEMENT                     (For information and application forms, contact the local         Tax Assessor's office)           New York State law allows up to a 50 per         cent abatement in local real property taxes for older homeowners, with each         locality allowed to set its own maximum income eligibility standard.                   11    Page         12   13   top         4. TAX FORM IT-214 (Circuit Breaker         Program)                     (For information and assistance in completing tax forms,         contact the County Office for the Aging)           Form IT-214 is filed with a person's         annual income tax forms. Tax credits or rebates are provided to older         homeowners and renters who are paying a disproportionate amount on housing         expenses in relation to their household income. An individual may qualify for a         rebate even if he pays no income tax.            5. HOME REPAIR or HOME MODIFICATION         PROGRAMS                     The availability of home repair or modification programs         varies among counties and communities. In addition to the programs described         below, local repair and modification programs may be available and funded         through the federal Community Development Block Grant and HOME programs, which         are administered by various local organizations or municipal departments. Also,         many localities have community-specific home repair and modification programs         funded locally and operated by local governments, school/ community programs,         or community-based service organizations.                       a.

RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS                     A variety of federal and state government housing programs         provide funds to build or rehabilitate housing that is targeted to very low,         low, and moderate income families and seniors. Rents in these buildings are         subsidized; that is, lower than the area's market rate rents. Often, tenants         are required to pay no more than 30 per cent of their income for rent or rent         and utilities, and there may be abatements for utility costs. In some cases,         rents are not restricted to 30 per cent of income, but the rental charge         structure is regulated by a government agency to remain below market rates. In         addition to subsidized housing, the following programs maintain rents below         market rates.                       a. RURAL RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM                   (For more information, contact the New York State         Division of Housing and Community Renewal, (518) 486-5067, or USDA Rural         Development, (315) 477-6400)             New York State provides financial         assistance to low income elderly and family residents in Rural Development's         Section 515 rural rental housing projects. This assistance enables residents to         pay no more than 30 per cent of their incomes on rent.                               b. SECTION 8 PROGRAM           (For more information, contact the local Public Housing         Authority)             Federal rent vouchers and rent         certificates provide financial assistance for very low income elderly and         families in rental housing, enabling these residents to pay no more than 30 per         cent of their incomes on rent.                               c. RENT CONTROL and RENT         STABILIZATION           (For more information, contact the New York State         Division of Housing and Community Renewal, (212) 480-6700)             Rent control generally applies to         buildings constructed before February, 1947, and for tenants who have been         living in their apartments continuously since July 1, 1971. Rent control exists         for buildings in New York City, as well as in some municipalities in the         counties of Albany, Erie, Nassau, Rensselaer, Schenectady and Westchester. Rent         Control limits the rent a landlord may charge for apartments and restricts the         right of a landlord to evict tenants.                            14    Page         15   16   top                    Rent Stabilization (in New York City)         and the Emergency Tenant Protection Act (in Nassau, Westchester, and Rockland         Counties) generally exist for buildings built between February 1, 1947, and         January 1, 1974, and for tenants who moved in after June 30, 1971. These         programs set maximum allowable rental increases.              d. SCRIE (SENIOR CITIZEN RENT         INCREASE EXEMPTION)           (For more information: in New York City, contact the New         York City Department for the Aging, (212) 442-9366; outside of New York City,         contact the County Office for the Aging)             Tenants aged 62 and over who live in         rent controlled or rent stabilized apartments in New York City and in several         municipalities in Nassau and Westchester Counties may qualify for an exemption         to rental increases if their incomes and the proportion of their incomes spent         on rent meet eligibility guidelines.                    8. COMMUNITY-BASED SERVICES                     New York State offers an extensive range of programs and         services that assist frail older persons to continue living in their own homes.         Contact the County Office for the Aging for information about programs such as         congregate meals, home-delivered meals, legal assistance, health and long term         care insurance counseling, caregiver support, respite services, social day         care, telephone reassurance, senior service centers, and transportation         services. Several community-based programs specific to making the home         environment viable for aging-in-place are described below.                       a. RESIDENT ADVISOR PROGRAM           (For more information, contact the New York State Office         for the Aging, (518) 486-2728)             In many rental housing projects, a         staff person is available on a regular basis to all older residents for         counseling, information and referral, and facilitated linkage to         community-based assistance and services.                            15    Page         16   17   top                      b. EISEP (Expanded In-home Services         for the Elderly Program) and COMMUNITY SERVICES FOR THE ELDERLY           (For more information, contact the County Office for the         Aging)             These state-supported programs provide         supportive services to older persons in their own homes/ apartments: case         management, homemaking, housekeeping, and other services. These programs are         available to older persons whose income levels exceed Medicaid eligibility         levels, and charges are assessed on a sliding scale basis.                               c. PERSONAL CARE and HOME HEALTH         AIDE SERVICES           (For more information, contact the County Public Health         Department; or County Department of Social Services; also see phone book         listings)             Services are available to older persons         in their own homes or apartments: housekeeping, personal care, and home health         aide services. Services are available to seniors and families on a private pay         basis or are eligible for Medicaid reimbursement if income eligibility limits         are met.                               d. LONG TERM HOME HEALTH CARE         PROGRAM (LTHHC) [Nursing Home Without Walls Program]           (For more information, contact the County Office for the         Aging, County Dept. of Social Services, or County Health Dept.)             As an alternative to institutionalized         long term care, this program provides nursing home services and other services         to persons in their own homes or apartments. Individuals are eligible for the         LTHHC Program if an assessment indicates that they are nursing-home eligible         and the services required will cost no more than a specified percentage of what         those same services would cost if provided in a nursing home.                               e. ADULT DAY CARE (Social or         Medical)           (For more information, contact the County Office for the         Aging)             Both types of day programs provide         social and other activities, meals, personal care, and supervision in a         protective setting for physically and mentally frail older persons. Medical day         care also includes the various rehabilitation therapies and nursing and dental         services. Medical day care charges are reimbursable through the Medicaid         Program for income-eligible participants.                           16    Page         17   top           SOME HOUSING RESOURCES                             The various          local offices for the         aging  maintain lists of senior housing developments in their county service         areas.

However, complete         independence during the later years may be compromised as longevity is         associated with increasing changes in the physical, social, emotional, mental,         and financial status of older persons.            Aging-related changes may persuade an         older person to consider relocating to a more supportive living environment.          Section I (Retirement Housing Alternatives)  provides brief descriptions         of various retirement housing options available in New York State to         accommodate older people as their needs change during the later years.                       Section II (Staying In Your Own Home)          provides brief descriptions of a variety of programs and strategies that         older people can employ to make ""staying in your home"" a viable option for         aging in place. References to contact are included for obtaining additional         detailed information.             I. RETIREMENT HOUSING ALTERNATIVES             Retirement housing alternatives may be --                      developed by public or private         organizations,             priced at market rates or subsidized by         government assistance to be affordable by persons with specified income limits,                     open to persons of all ages or         restricted to adults over a specified age.                     Housing alternatives might or might not         include a variety of activities, supportive assistance (such as congregate         dining, housekeeping, laundry, transportation, 24-hour security, emergency         response systems, resident advisor), supervision, personal/ health care         services, and nursing care. Housing that includes any of these activities,         assistance, or services is often referred to as ""supportive housing."" If such         features are included, they might be included as part of the monthly charge, or         rent and services/ assistance might be charged for separately. The extent of         service provision does not preclude residents from privately purchasing these         services and assistance from community service agencies.              4    Page         5   6   top            There is much overlap among the names,         definitions, and construct of various housing alternatives. Following are         several housing categories, and their major conventional characteristics, into         which most available housing for seniors will fall. If a category/ alternative         is licensed by New York State, its specific name and definition are stated in         law.             1. SENIOR HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS             These are multiunit apartment buildings, condominiums,         cooperatives, single family home complexes, and mobile home parks that are         restricted to persons over a specified age (defined variously as 55, 60, 62, or         65). Typically, these were not originally planned to include activities,         supportive assistance, or personal/ health care. Many have incrementally added         these features as residents have aged and require help to continue aging in         place. Monthly charges or rents usually do not include the costs of services.         Charges/ rents may be priced at market rates or subsidized with government         assistance.             2. NATURALLY OCCURRING RETIREMENT         COMMUNITIES (NORCs)     These are geographic areas or multiunit         apartment buildings that are NOT restricted to persons over a specified age,         but which have evolved over time to include a significant number (typically,         over 50 per cent) of residents who are aged 60 and over. As their numbers of         elderly tenants have grown, many NORCs have added activities, supportive         assistance, and services to meet residents' needs. Monthly charges or rents         typically do not include the costs of these activities/ services. Charges/         rents may be priced at market rates or subsidized with government assistance.                     3. CONGREGATE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS             These are multiunit housing buildings (private rooms or full         apartments) that are restricted to persons over a specified age and that         include supportive assistance. Typically, monthly charges include rent and         supportive services. Congregate housing does not require licensure or         certification by a public agency as personal care services (help with eating,         bathing, dressing, grooming, toileting, transferring) are not provided or         included in the monthly charge. Congregate housing residents may contract         privately with community home care agencies to receive personal care and home         health care services. Monthly charges may be priced at market rates or         subsidized with government assistance.              5    Page         6   7   top            4. SHARED-HOUSING ALTERNATIVES             Shared-housing arrangements can be intergenerational         (age-integrated) or restricted to older persons. The benefits of home-sharing         include: sharing costs and upkeep tasks, mutual support and assistance,         companionship, continued aging-in-place, and facilitated caregiving by family         members. Local zoning laws may specify the conditions under which         shared-housing alternatives may be established. Four shared housing         alternatives:                        a. SHARED LIVING RESIDENCE             This is an age-integrated or age-restricted residence that is shared by a small         group (3 to 10) of unrelated persons who share the living expenses and tasks of         running the household. Residents have private bedrooms, but share the kitchen,         dining, and living rooms. A shared living residence may be owned/ sponsored by         a community organization and rented to residents. Additional supportive and         household assistance for residents will vary according to the independence         level of the residents. No government licensure or certification is required         unless personal care is charged for or provided by the sponsoring organization.         Charges/ rents may be priced at market rates or subsidized with government         assistance.                          b. ACCESSORY APARTMENT     An         accessory apartment is created when a single-family home is modified to include         a complete, private apartment for use by an older person (typically, an elderly         relative); or, as a source of additional income and the security of having a         housemate while maintaining the privacy of a private living unit, an elderly         person may convert part of her own home into an accessory apartment for use by         another person.                          c. ELDER COTTAGE (or ECHO HOUSING)             This is a small (apartment-sized), detached home for use by an older         person which is temporarily sited on private property that contains the primary         residence of a younger family member. An Elder Cottage utilizes the water,         electric, and sewer systems of the primary home. It provides security for the         older person, privacy for both the older person and the younger family, and         facilitates the caregiving efforts of the younger family.                        6    Page         7   8   top                       d. MATCH-UP HOME SHARING             Under this arrangement, a homeowner or apartment renter with extra room shares         his home with another person in exchange for rent and/ or services or as a         mutually supportive arrangement to share companionship, expenses, assistance,         and household tasks. Sharing may be intergenerational or only for older         persons. Match-up home sharing may occur informally, but is often a formal         program operated by a community agency that assumes responsibility for         screening participants, matching for compatibility, assisting in drawing up         agreements for living together, and helping with conflict resolution.                       5. ENRICHED HOUSING PROGRAM             This service program is licensed by the New York State Department of         Health and provides congregate meals, housekeeping, homemaking, transportation,         social activities, supervision, and personal care for individuals aged 65 and         over. The program operates in multiunit apartment buildings. An entire building         may be licensed to provide Enriched Housing services to all residents, or the         program may be licensed to provide Enriched Housing services to a specified         proportion of residents in a senior or family apartment development. Both the         rent and the cost of services/ care are included in one monthly charge.         Residents can use private resources to pay for monthly charges; those below a         specified income level are eligible for subsidization through the federal and         state Supplemental Security Income (SSI) Programs.             6. FAMILY TYPE HOMES             Family Type Homes, for adults of all ages, are certified by county Departments         of Social Services. These are typically a single family home in which the         homeowner provides supportive services, meals, supervision, and personal care         to four or fewer adults who are unrelated to the homeowner/ operator. Rent and         care are included in one monthly charge. Charges may be paid with private         resources, or those below a specified income level are eligible for         subsidization through federal and state SSI Programs.             7. ADULT HOMES     Adult         Homes, for adults of all ages, are licensed by the State Department of Health         to provide room, meals, supportive services, personal care, and supervision to         five or more adults. Room and services are included in one monthly charge,         which may be paid with private resources or subsidized through federal and         state SSI Programs for those below a specified income level.               7    Page         8   9   top            8. ASSISTED LIVING PROGRAM             Adult Home operators and Enriched Housing operators are eligible to be         approved by the State Department of Health to provide personal and         health-related services (in addition to routine supportive services) to their         residents who are assessed as being nursing-home-eligible. Rent and all         services may be paid with private resources or, for those below a specified         income level, may be subsidized through SSI for residential supportive services         and through the Medicaid Program for personal care and health-related services.                     9. DEMENTIA CARE FACILITIES             These multiunit developments are licensed by the State Department of         Health as Enriched Housing Programs or Adult Homes. Their physical layouts,         programmatic aims, staffing, and care plans are designed to address the needs         of people with Alzheimer's Disease or other dementia conditions.             10. CONTINUING CARE RETIREMENT         COMMUNITIES (CCRCs)     These multiple-level complexes are restricted         to persons over a specified age, and they include independent living units         (apartments and/ or cottages), social activities, congregate meals, supportive         assistance, and personal care all on one campus. Nursing home care is also         included, but may be provided on-or off-campus. Residents pay for housing,         activities, meals, services, and nursing care with a one-time entry fee and         regular monthly charges and may also use long term care insurance. A         community's independent living units may be structured as a cooperative,         condominium, or rental arrangement.            CCRCs are approved for development and         are regulated as a single, total entity by New York State government; and         residents are guaranteed housing, supportive assistance, and a specified amount         of nursing care under a single contract. The single contract may cover the         duration of the resident's life (unlimited nursing care) or cover a specified         amount (limited) of nursing care.             11. MULTILEVEL HOUSING AND CARE         COMPLEX     These multiple-level complexes include independent living         units (apartments and/ or cottages), social activities, congregate meals,         supportive assistance, and nursing care all on one campus. A complex's         independent living units may be structured as a cooperative, condominium,         conventional rental arrangement, or long term lease arrangement. Residents pay         for housing, activities, meals, and services with monthly charges and may also         pay an initial entry or purchase fee.              8    Page         9   10   top           The total complex is not regulated as a         single entity, but the adult home and nursing home components are licensed and         regulated by the New York State Department of Health. Residents' use of the         adult home and nursing home is not contractually guaranteed as it is under a         CCRC contract, but residents typically are given priority access to the         complex's health and nursing care facilities.             12. NURSING HOME     Nursing         homes provide skilled nursing services and chronic custodial care. They are         licensed and regulated by the New York State Department of Health. The State         Office for the Aging's Long Term Care Ombudsman Program provides trained         community volunteer Ombudsmen who advocate on behalf of elderly residents of         nursing homes and adult homes and their families. Ombudsmen receive complaints,         investigate, and help resolve problems.               II. STAYING IN YOUR OWN         HOME           Service providers and advocates can assist         older people to find access to several options that will enable them to remain         living in their own homes. These options include conversion of a home's equity         into a source of additional cash, physical design modifications and repair of         an existing home, and use of a variety of in-home supportive assistance and         health care.             1. HOME EQUITY CONVERSION PLANS             Home equity conversion plans are financing strategies that help         make continuing home ownership an affordable option. These plans allow older         homeowners to convert their home's equity into cash loans while continuing to         live in their homes. Loans are not paid back until the homeowner transfers         title to the home, moves out of the home, or dies, or are repaid at a future         date agreed upon by the financial lender and the homeowner. This is not to be         confused with home equity loans, which work much like a credit card--allowing         you to borrow against your home but are repayable immediately in total or in         monthly installments. Following are several types of home equity conversion         plans:              9    Page         10   11   top                     a. REVERSE MORTGAGE   (For a         list of HUD-approved reverse mortgage counselors, call AARP's Housing         Counseling Clearinghouse at 1-888-466-3487. For a copy of several publications         on reverse mortgages, including Home-Made Money: Consumer's Guide to Home         Equity Conversion, call AARP's Home Equity Information Center (202) 434-6042.         For a list of Fannie Mae approved lenders or for a copy of Money from Home: A         Consumer's Guide to Reverse Mortgage Options, call (212) 755-6820.)                      A reverse mortgage allows older         homeowners to borrow against the equity they have built up in their homes as a         source of additional cash. Such loans can be used to pay for daily living         expenses, taxes, home health care, home repair, or for any other use preferred         by the homeowner. The cash payments may be received in one or several lump sums         or may be received in fixed monthly payments. The equity amount available to         the homeowner depends on several factors such as the value of the home and the         homeowner's health, age, and marital status. The accumulated loan amount,         interest, and mortgage fees are not repaid until the homeowner transfers title         to the home, moves out of the home, or dies, or is repaid at a future date         agreed upon by the financial lender and the homeowner. When due, the loan         amount is typically paid through the sale of the home. A variety of lenders         offer a variety of reverse mortgage products, and many communities have         impartial reverse mortgage counselors to help homeowners choose the most         appropriate product for their unique circumstances.                          b. PROPERTY TAX DEFERRAL           (For information, contact the local Tax Assessor's office)              This is an optional program that         municipalities may elect to offer to their older homeowners. Using a         participating financial lender, a homeowner's property taxes are paid through         loans made against the equity in his/ her home. The loan amounts, and any         accompanying fees and interest charges, accumulate over time and are repaid at         a future date, typically through the sale of the home. The local tax assessor         will know if such a program is available in your municipality.                        10    Page         11   12   top                       c. SALE/ LEASEBACK   (For         information and legal assistance, contact an attorney knowledgeable in real         estate law)              In this plan, the homeowner sells his/         her house (often to one of his/ her children) but continues to live in the home         through a life lease clause in the buyer's deed. Financing arrangements include         a lump sum ""down payment"" to the seller, mortgage payments to the seller, and         rental payments to the buyer. Rent charges are less than the mortgage payments,         leaving the selling homeowner with additional monthly income. The buyer is         responsible for taxes, repairs, insurance, etc., but the buyer also benefits         from any increase in the value of the property over time.                       2. STAR (New York School Tax Relief         Program)     (For information and application forms, contact the         local Tax Assessor's office)            STAR provides a property tax exemption on         owner-occupied residential property to all New York State residents. Senior         citizens with incomes over $60,000 and all non-seniors are eligible for the         Basic STAR Exemption beginning with the school year 1999-2000, with a full tax         exemption of $30,000 phased in over a three-year period. Senior citizens with         incomes under $60,000 are eligible for the Enhanced STAR Exemption beginning         with the school year 1998-1999, with a full exemption of at least $50,000         phased in over a four-year period.             3. PROPERTY TAX ABATEMENT             (For information and application forms, contact the local Tax Assessor's         office)            New York State law allows up to a 50 per         cent abatement in local real property taxes for older homeowners, with each         locality allowed to set its own maximum income eligibility standard.                    11    Page         12   13   top          4. TAX FORM IT-214 (Circuit Breaker         Program)     (For information and assistance in completing tax forms,         contact the County Office for the Aging)            Form IT-214 is filed with a person's         annual income tax forms. Tax credits or rebates are provided to older         homeowners and renters who are paying a disproportionate amount on housing         expenses in relation to their household income. An individual may qualify for a         rebate even if he pays no income tax.             5. HOME REPAIR or HOME MODIFICATION         PROGRAMS     The availability of home repair or modification programs         varies among counties and communities. In addition to the programs described         below, local repair and modification programs may be available and funded         through the federal Community Development Block Grant and HOME programs, which         are administered by various local organizations or municipal departments. Also,         many localities have community-specific home repair and modification programs         funded locally and operated by local governments, school/ community programs,         or community-based service organizations.                        a. WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM           (For more information, contact the County Office for the Aging)              Weather stripping, caulking,         insulating, cleaning or minor repairs to heating equipment, and other energy         saving home improvements are provided at no charge for low income families.                       b.

AFFORDABLE HOME OWNERSHIP PROGRAM           (For more information, contact the New York State Housing Finance         Agency, (212) 688-4000)              In addition to providing financial         assistance for the construction or purchase of homes, funds are available         through this HFA program to municipalities, housing authorities, housing         companies, and non-profit organizations to provide grants for the         rehabilitation and structural improvement of condominiums, cooperatives, and         1-4 family homes. The program is not targeted solely to the elderly, but is         meant to make affordable home ownership available to low income persons,         including the elderly.                          e. UTILITY ENERGY ASSISTANCE           (For more information, contact your local utility company or County         Office for the Aging)              Utility company funds, together with         customer contributions, provide monies to low income persons to help pay energy         bills, weatherization improvements, and repairs to heating equipment. Local         programs have different names; for example, Niagara Mohawk's program is         entitled ""Care and Share.""               6. HEAP (HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE         PROGRAM)     (For more information, contact the County Office for the         Aging or County Department of Social Services)            HEAP is a federally funded program to         provide financial assistance to low income persons 60 years of age or older to         help pay heating bills.               13    Page         14   15   top            7. RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS             A variety of federal and state government housing programs provide funds         to build or rehabilitate housing that is targeted to very low, low, and         moderate income families and seniors. Rents in these buildings are subsidized;         that is, lower than the area's market rate rents. Often, tenants are required         to pay no more than 30 per cent of their income for rent or rent and utilities,         and there may be abatements for utility costs. In some cases, rents are not         restricted to 30 per cent of income, but the rental charge structure is         regulated by a government agency to remain below market rates. In addition to         subsidized housing, the following programs maintain rents below market rates.                                a. RURAL RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM           (For more information, contact the New York State Division of Housing         and Community Renewal, (518) 486-5067, or USDA Rural Development, (315)         477-6400)              New York State provides financial         assistance to low income elderly and family residents in Rural Development's         Section 515 rural rental housing projects. This assistance enables residents to         pay no more than 30 per cent of their incomes on rent.                                  b. SECTION 8 PROGRAM   (For         more information, contact the local Public Housing Authority)              Federal rent vouchers and rent         certificates provide financial assistance for very low income elderly and         families in rental housing, enabling these residents to pay no more than 30 per         cent of their incomes on rent.                          c. RENT CONTROL and RENT         STABILIZATION   (For more information, contact the New York State         Division of Housing and Community Renewal, (212) 480-6700)              Rent control generally applies to         buildings constructed before February, 1947, and for tenants who have been         living in their apartments continuously since July 1, 1971. Rent control exists         for buildings in New York City, as well as in some municipalities in the         counties of Albany, Erie, Nassau, Rensselaer, Schenectady and Westchester. Rent         Control limits the rent a landlord may charge for apartments and restricts the         right of a landlord to evict tenants.                 14    Page         15   16   top                     Rent Stabilization (in New York City)         and the Emergency Tenant Protection Act (in Nassau, Westchester, and Rockland         Counties) generally exist for buildings built between February 1, 1947, and         January 1, 1974, and for tenants who moved in after June 30, 1971. These         programs set maximum allowable rental increases.               d. SCRIE (SENIOR CITIZEN RENT         INCREASE EXEMPTION)   (For more information: in New York City, contact         the New York City Department for the Aging, (212) 442-9366; outside of New York         City, contact the County Office for the Aging)              Tenants aged 62 and over who live in         rent controlled or rent stabilized apartments in New York City and in several         municipalities in Nassau and Westchester Counties may qualify for an exemption         to rental increases if their incomes and the proportion of their incomes spent         on rent meet eligibility guidelines.               8.

As an alternative to institutionalized         long term care, this program provides nursing home services and other services         to persons in their own homes or apartments. Individuals are eligible for the         LTHHC Program if an assessment indicates that they are nursing-home eligible         and the services required will cost no more than a specified percentage of what         those same services would cost if provided in a nursing home.                                  e. ADULT DAY CARE (Social or         Medical)   (For more information, contact the County Office for the         Aging)              Both types of day programs provide         social and other activities, meals, personal care, and supervision in a         protective setting for physically and mentally frail older persons.

A NEWSLETTER BROUGHT TO YOU BY BENEFITSCORP, INC., A GREAT-WEST COMPANY AND ALASKA DRB   Crystal Ball You can' t predic t market performance -- but you can make some educated guesses Everyone knows that you can't predict the ups and downs of the market. There is, however, one tool of economic measurement that acts as a kind of ""crystal ball."" It can help you get a general feel for where our economy may be headed. Our crystal ball is The Index of Leading Economic Indicators. The leading index is really 10 economic ""benchmarks"" rolled into one, including unemployment insurance claims, building permits, interest rates and stock prices. It was designed to measure where the overall U.S. economy is headed during the next three to six months. Although determining the index requires some major calculating power, following it doesn't. Basically, when the leading indicators are rising, that's a positive sign of economic growth. When the indicators slow down or start to fall, that's a signal that growth is slowing. At the end of June of this year, the Index of Leading Economic Indicators rose 0.1%. It was the third straight month that the index had increased. Four of the 10 components of the index rose in June, including stock prices and building permits. However, with high unemployment and weakness in the manufacturing sector, it was still uncertain whether the U.S. was about to enter a period of steady growth. But most analysts were feeling optimistic about the chances for a market turnaround. The important thing to remember is to stay active in managing your financial future. Make an effort to understand what's going on and what affect it may have on your Plan account balance. The fact that you're in the market for the long term should help you weather the many ups and downs you'll experience over the years. You can learn more and find the latest leading indicator figures at: www.tcb-indicators.org. The index also is published monthly in the business section of your local paper and in many leading financial publications, such as The Wall Street Journal.  2   New Tax Cuts Mean Savings for Many Jobs Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act In June, President Bush signed a federal income tax-cut package into law. The tax cuts affect almost everyone who pays federal income taxes. In fact, the Treasury Department estimates that 91 million taxpayers will receive an average 2003 tax cut of $1,126. Here are some highlights of this broad-reaching new tax law.  Child credit increases The tax credit for most parents with children under the age of 17 increased from $600 to $1,000 per child. This summer the IRS sent checks for the increased amount ($400 per child claimed in 2002) to qualifying families.  Marriage penalty relief The new law relieves the ""marriage penalty"" by raising the standard deduction for married couples to $9,500 (twice that of single filers). The standard deduction for married taxpayers filing separately increased to $4,750 (the same as that of single taxpayers). Also for married couples, the 15% tax bracket widened to include a higher income threshold.  Tax rates cut Many of us noticed an increase in our paychecks this summer due to reductions in the tax rate brackets. These reductions affect all taxpayers except those in the 10% and 15% brackets. 2002 Rates 27% 30% 35% 38.6% 2003 Rates 25% 28% 33% 35% Single Filers Over $28,400 Over $68,800 Over $143,500 Over $31 ,950 1 Joint Filers Over $56,800 Over $1 4,650 1 Over $174,700 Over $31 ,950 1  Cuts won' t last All of the changes included in the tax law will expire over the next few years, unless Congress votes to extend them. For example, the expanded 10% bracket, marriage penalty relief and the increased child credit will all expire at the end of 2004. The tax rate reductions will stop after 2010 and return to 2002 brackets.  The new rates were effective in July, but the reductions are retroactive to the beginning of this year. This means that most taxpayers will have had too much federal income tax withheld from their paychecks for the first half of the year. Even though taxpayers in the 10% bracket didn't see a tax rate reduction, they did see an increase in the income threshold. For single filers, the income threshold rises from $6,000 to $7000, , and it increases from $12,000 to $14,000 for joint filers.

What will it mean for your soon-to-be retired life? Maybe that cruise you plan to take each year will have to become less frequent. Buying that RV will have to wait a few years. Perhaps you'll need to continue working a little longer. During times like these, we all need to feel more secure about our retirement income sources. Sure, you'll have Social Security. Maybe you're lucky enough to have a pension. And, of course, you don' t want to give up on your Plan just yet! It may give you some additional confidence to know that your home may be a valuable alternative source of retirement income. As you get closer to retirement, you are probably going to hear more and more about something called a ""reverse"" mortgage. of RM and the lender. The amount you are eligible to borrow generally is based on your age, the equity in your home and the interest rate the lender is charging. Because you retain title to your home with an RM, you also remain responsible for taxes, repairs and maintenance. Depending on the plan you select, your RM becomes due with interest either when you permanently move, sell your home, die or reach the end of the pre-selected loan term. The lender does not take title to your home when you die, but your heirs must pay off the loan. The debt is usually repaid by refinancing the loan into a forward mortgage (if the heirs are eligible) or by using the proceeds from the sale of your home.  Don' t Go it Alone Reverse mortgages aren't for everyone. But for some people it may be worth investigating as an option to help increase your income during retirement.

Please send your questions to:  Reverse Mortgages At a Glance A reverse mortgage (RM) is a type of home equity loan that allows you to convert some of the equity in your home into cash while you retain home ownership. RMs work much like traditional mortgages, only in reverse. Rather than making a payment to your lender each month, the lender pays you. Unlike conventional home equity loans, most RMs do not require any repayment of principal, interest or servicing fees for as long as you live in your home. Funds obtained from an RM may be used for any purpose. To qualify for an RM, you must own your home and be at least 62. The RM funds may be paid to you in a lump sum, in monthly advances, through a line-of-credit, or in a combination of the three, depending on the type  Additional Resources AARP (www.aarp.org/ revmort) HUD (www.hud.gov/buying/ rvrsmort.cfm) Reverse Mortgages For Beginners by Ken Scholen  For account or investment-related issues, contact:  www.state.ak .us/drb KeyTalk: (800) 701-8255 (TDD: 1-800-766-4952)  Great-West/BenefitsCorp Marketing PO Box 1700 Denver, CO 80201 Fax: (303) 737-3693 E-mail: webmaster@ benefitscorp.com For more information about available investment options in your Plan, including fees and expenses, refer to the Investment Option Detail sheets.

The employer does not pay payroll taxes on the benefit, and employees do not pay income or payroll taxes on it. As a result, giving an employee $65 in transit/vanpool benefits is less expensive for an employer than raising the employee's salary by $65, and the employee takes home more. The tax-free limit on transit/vanpool benefits will rise to $100 per month for tax year 2002. transit/vanpool benefits may be provided in a variety of ways: through regional voucher programs, transit passes, or cash reimbursement (in certain circumstances). Providing transit/vanpool benefits is one of the primary benefits under the Commuter Choice Leadership Initiative (CCLI). Employers must offer at least one of three primary benefits to their employees in order to participate in the CCLI (the other two are parking cash out and telecommuting). Under this option, the employer agrees to provide at least $32.50 per month in transit/vanpool benefits for any employee (or the full monthly commuting expense if its less than $32.50 per month).       C  OMMUTER  C  HOICE  LEADERSHIP INITIATIVE  The National Standard of Excellence for Commuter Benefits  This document is one in a series of Commuter Choice Leadership Initiative briefing papers designed to help employers implement commuter benefits.

In some cases, the employer may reimburse employees in cash for transit expenses.2 Although this paper uses the general term ""transit pass,"" a pass could be an unlimited ride pass, tokens, tickets, or farecards.3 Passes are generally issued by a single transit agency only for use on its services. On the other hand, a transit/vanpool voucher can be exchanged by the employee for a transit pass, tokens, or tickets on multiple transit services, or payment of vanpool charges. Vouchers cannot be exchanged for cash; they must be redeemed by designated transit agencies or vanpool operators. Federal $65 per benefits eligible to $100 tax code allows employers to offer up to month ($780 per year) in transit/vanpool tax-free. In 2002, the maximum amount to be treated as tax-exempt will increase per month ($1,200 per year).  is only required to contribute that amount per month ($25/month instead of $32.50). Some employers allow employees to purchase the transit or vanpool benefit using pre-tax dollars (frequently called a pre-tax transit or vanpool benefit). While this option does take advantage of some of the tax benefits of transit and vanpool benefits, it does not provide either the full value of transit or vanpool benefits to the employees or the employers. It is therefore not considered a ""primary benefit"" under the CCLI. Employer-provided transit/vanpool benefits make it less expensive and easier to use transit or vanpools to commute to work, and usually are seen as popular by employees. In recent years, programs encouraging distribution of transit passes by employers have become increasingly popular. Employers tend to view the programs as a lowcost way to provide employees with a very desirable benefit. Since transit/vanpool benefits are tax-free transportation fringes, employers can save money on payroll taxes when they offer these programs. The employer is not limited to providing a transit/ vanpool benefit of $65 per month. However, if, for any month, an employer provides an employee with a qualified transportation fringe benefit that exceeds the statutory tax-free limit, the excess value must be included in the employee's gross income for income and employment tax purposes. A brief history of recent changes in tax legislation that have affected transit benefits is provided in Appendix C.  To qualify the transit or vanpool benefit as a primary benefit under the CCLI, an employer must contribute at least $32.50 per month. If the monthly commuting expense for employees is less than $32.50 per month (e.g. $25/month), the employee  For more information on vanpools, see the separate briefing paper on Vanpool Programs. 2 The employer may provide transit benefits through a cash reimbursement plan only if vouchers are not ""readily available."" See Implementation Issues and Costs section. 3 Although the IRS regulations include ""voucher"" within their definition of ""transit pass,"" because of the operational differences this briefing paper defines them separately. 1  EMPLOYER BENEFITS An employer can benefit in several ways by offering transit/vanpool benefits.  1   CCLI: Transit and Vanpool Benefits  Transit/vanpool benefits can improve employee morale and make an organization a more desirable place to work, which can:     Reduce employee absenteeism Reduce employee turnover Support recruiting and retention goals  students to UWM. Spring 1995 survey results indicate 15% of respondents said the UPASS would have a major impact on their decision to attend UWM in future semesters while 21% indicated the UPASS would have a minor impact. (Meyer and Beimborn, 1996)  Cost Savings Offering transit/vanpool benefits can be a very low cost way to provide employees with an additional benefit. Transit/vanpool benefits provide the employer with lower payroll taxes compared to offering an equivalent salary increase. Offering a pre-tax deduction option can actually save a company money since the company does not pay payroll taxes on the amount of income reserved by the employee. Employees also pay less in income taxes and social security taxes. However, in some cases, voucher providers charge fees, which may reduce the cost savings to employers. Moreover, reducing the number of employees driving to work can result in reduced needs for employee parking. Parking is expensive to build or lease, particularly in urban areas. As a result, transit/vanpool benefits often provide a low-cost way to avoid the large expense associated with securing additional parking. Unlike parking, which is a long-term decision (leases are typically negotiated on an infrequent basis, and the decision to construct new parking has long-term implications) transit/vanpool benefits can be adjusted immediately.  A DOT survey of employers offering TransitChek in the New York and Philadelphia areas found overwhelming positive response by employers and employees: Over 70 percent of the TransitChek users in the first two surveys said they developed more positive opinions of their employers because of TransitChek. Favorable comments from respondents included that the program gave transit a favorable image, increased their usage of transit, was simple and easy to use, and helped to defray transit costs and fare increases. When asked to characterize the relative importance of TransitChek as an employee benefit, 48 percent [of employers] viewed it as ""very important,"" 40 percent said it was ""somewhat important,"" 12 percent chose ""of limited importance,"" and only 1 percent said that it was ""not important at all."" All of the organizations reported TransitChek was very popular among their employees, and the companies themselves viewed it positively, in general.  One state agency, prevented from raising employee salaries by state legislation, appreciated TransitChek as a means to give employees a taxfree benefit equivalent to a greater value in pretax salary dollars (DOT, 1995). Reaction to university programs mirrors these positive reactions, even to improving recruitment and retention. UPASS has the ability to attract and retain students at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM). Participants in focus group discussions mentioned the UPASS could attract potential  TAX C  ONSIDERATIONS  Tax provisions that allow transit/vanpool benefits to be taken as a tax-free fringe benefit offer substantial financial savings for both employers and employees.4  4  Employers should review with their tax advisor the tax implications for themselves and their employees.  2   CCLI: Transit and Vanpool Benefits  Transit/vanpool benefits may be provided tax-free to employees up to $65 per month. Tax benefits accrue to businesses and employees whether the employer pays for the benefits or the employee pays for it through a pre-tax salary deduction, as shown in Figure 1. Figure 1: Tax Savings for Employers and Employees Option Employers give their employees up to $65/month to commute via transit or vanpools  State Income taxes Federal Income taxes Payroll taxes  Employer Tax Benefit Employer saves payroll taxes (7.65%) compared to offering taxable salary.  Employee Tax Benefit Employee receives up to $65/month taxfree. The employee does not pay any taxes on the value of the benefit. Employee saves on income tax and payroll taxes. The amount of income reserved for transit/ vanpooling (up to $65/month) is no longer treated as taxable salary.  Employer Savings  Employee Savings  Figure 2: Sample Tax Savings from offering $780 Commuter Benefit rather than Salary Meanwhile, the employee saves about $325 in taxes compared to receiving taxable income (based on a 28% federal income tax, 6% state income tax, and 7.65% FICA). With taxable salary, over 40 percent of the salary increase is never seen by the employee. In contrast, the employee receives the full $780 per year ($65 per month) in transit/vanpool benefits paid by the employer. Note that some transit voucher providers charge an administrative fee for ordering the vouchers, which would slightly increase the cost to the employer. On the other hand, some transit agencies offer discounts for purchasing transit passes in bulk, which would lower the cost. Some states and localities also offer tax credits, further lowering the cost to the employer. The employee takes home the full $780 benefit, tax-free.5 To net an increase in after-tax income of $780 would require a salary increase of over $1,300. Under Federal tax law, an employee who pays to park at a qualified parking area (like a transit station) and then takes mass transit or a commuter highway vehicle to work can receive a combination of transit/vanpool and qualified parking benefits, up to a combined benefit of $245 Some transit systems add value when fares are purchased in larger increments, resulting in a larger employee benefit. For example, the Washington, DC area Metro system adds 10 percent to farecards purchased in amounts over $20. 5  Employers allow employees to use pre-tax income to pay for transit  Employer saves on payroll taxes (7.65% savings). No payroll taxes are paid on the income that is reserved by the employee.  Employer-Paid Benefits If the employer pays for the transit/vanpool benefit, the value of the benefit is tax-free to the employee, as well as free of employer payroll taxes. As a result, providing transit/vanpool benefits is a low-cost way to provide employees with an additional benefit, and saves considerable money compared to an increase in taxable salary. For example, as shown in Figure 2, by providing a $65 per month ($780 per year) transit/vanpool benefit rather than an increase in salary, the employer saves $59.67 per year in payroll taxes ($780 times 7.65% FICA).  3   CCLI: Transit and Vanpool Benefits  per month ($65 for the transit/vanpool benefit and $180 per month for parking) or a maximum of $2,940 per year. Employee Pre-Tax Salary Deduction If the employer does not pay for the fringe benefit, but deducts the pass and/or parking cost from an employee's pre-tax income:   and an additional $59.67 in payroll taxes. Employees could also save on state income taxes that piggyback on the federal tax definitions of compensations. For example, in a state with a 5 percent income tax, employees could save another $39 in taxes. In total, an employee could be saving over $316 each year. This brings the real transit cost to the employee down from $65 per month to $38.67 per month, a savings of more than 40 percent. As either a salary substitute or additional benefit, transit benefits provide more value for less money than cash. Some states tax transit benefits as regular income for employees. Employers should consult with their tax departments to review the tax treatment of transportation benefits, particularly if they operate in multiple states. Examples of Tax Benefits Detailed examples of how to calculate tax benefits are contained in a separate briefing paper, Commuter Tax Benefits.  The employer sees a reduction in payroll taxes, and The employee does not pay federal income, payroll, and possibly state income taxes on the deducted amount.    Employers do not pay any payroll (FICA) taxes on the amount of income that is reserved by the employee from taxable income. FICA consists of Social Security and Medicare taxes paid on wages. For tax year 2001, employers and employees pay equal amounts: 6.2 percent of wages up to $80,400 per year per employee for Social Security and 1.45 percent of total wages for Medicare (no salary limit). As a result, for every dollar that an employee reserves for a pre-tax transportation fringe benefit, the employer saves about 7.65 cents (for employees making less than $80,400 per year).6 An employee who reserves $65 per month for transit or vanpools will save over $59 per year for the employer in reduced FICA taxes. If an employee reserved the full $180 per month for qualified parking, employer tax savings would be over $165 per year. Employees also receive substantial tax savings. An employee in the 28 percent federal tax bracket who reduces his or her pre-tax income by $65 per month to pay for transit or vanpooling expenses could save $218 per year in federal income taxes For employees earning over $80,400 per year, there would be less savings to the employer because Social Security taxes are not paid on any salary above $80,400 (in 2001; salary limits change annually). Medicare taxes have no salary limit. 6  EMPLOYEE BENEFITS Employee Cost Savings Employees who ride transit or use vanpools save money with these benefits. If the employer pays the full benefit, the employee's transportation expenses are considerably reduced. If the employee pays the benefits, s/he still receives a reduction in transportation costs, since the taxable salary is reduced by the amount of the benefit, thus resulting in a lower tax assessment.  4   CCLI: Transit and Vanpool Benefits  Increased Employee Satisfaction Employees view transit/vanpool benefits extremely favorably. Transit/vanpool benefits can:      Locations with Limited or Expensive Parking and Long Commutes Constrained parking tends to increase the desirability and improve the effectiveness of transit/vanpool benefits since employees may wish to avoid driving under these conditions. Employees with long commutes are often most interested in vanpooling since they can use the time that would have been spent driving more productively, or to rest or talk to co-workers. Such factors as employee work hours matching transit schedules and a supportive employer attitude toward vanpooling can also have important effects on the success of programs. (FHWA, 1993) Employers with Recruitment or Retention Issues In a tight labor market, employers can make themselves more attractive to employees through offering commuter benefits.  Lower employee commute stress Provide additional choices to employees Heighten employee appreciation of employer Help make benefits plans more employeefriendly and environmentally friendly  WHEN TRANSIT/VANPOOL BENEFITS MAKE SENSE Any employer with a commuting workforce can offer transit/vanpool benefits. There are certain conditions, however, that make it easier or more beneficial for an employer to implement such programs. Locations with Access to Transit or High Occupancy Vehicle Lanes Transit passes and vanpool programs can be implemented in all types of locations, including both urban and suburban areas. Transit programs, however, will generally be most effective in locations where transit options are readily available and with frequent service. These conditions are typically the case in central business districts and other dense urban areas, although certain suburban areas may also fit into this group. Vanpooling can work well in more suburban areas not well served by fixed route transit. The availability of high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes and park-and-ride facilities make vanpooling more appealing to employees.  I  MPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND  C  OSTS  Employers must address various administrative issues in implementing a transit/vanpool benefits program. Although all employers must spend some staff time setting up the program, the larger the employer the more complex and potentially challenging the issues. Small and medium employers, especially those with only one worksite, tend to find these benefits fairly straightforward to implement and administer. Because transit/vanpool benefits are a tax deductible business expense, they can often be provided at relatively little cost to an employee and with relatively little administrative burden. As noted above, implementing an employee ""pretax"" payroll deduction program can actually result in total tax bill reductions for a company, but this is not as valuable to employees.  5   CCLI: Transit and Vanpool Benefits  Fewer Administrative Requirements than Cafeteria Plans Transportation fringe benefit programs have considerably fewer administrative requirements than IRS Section 125 cafeteria plans. What sets transportation fringe benefits apart from other pre-tax programs like cafeteria plans and flexible spending accounts is its ease of use and exemption from the usual pre-tax program restrictions. There are no complicated plan filings or forms to fill out, no ""use it or lose it"" rules, no irrevocable elections, and no mandatory enrollment dates. In particular:   voucher providers recommend that employers purchase vouchers for three months at a time, rather than one. Although advance purchase may not be required, the voucher provider or transit agency may give financial incentives for advance purchase, such as lower shipping charges or automatic re-ordering. In addition, voucher providers generally charge a small administrative fee. Ongoing direct administrative costs tend to be small, depending upon the number of participating employees and the number of vouchers or passes distributed. According to David Judd, Vice President of Commuter Check, their internal research shows that for many small companies, administration takes only a few hours per month. (Judd, 2001) Although no written rules are required by tax law, a company will typically want to set up program administrative guidelines. The guidelines will address issues such as: How do employees elect the benefits? How often will voucher distribution take place? How often can employees change their pre-tax elections? Can an employee return the vouchers for taxable cash if they do not use them? Setting up program procedures often entails initial start-up time, but can ultimately save administrative costs by ensuring a clear, consistent set of procedures. Some employers may encounter payroll difficulties combining a partial employer-provided transit/vanpool subsidy with a pre-tax election. For example, at the University of California, Berkeley, staff and faculty are given a choice between reserving pre-tax salary to purchase transit/vanpool passes and participating in the University's subsidy program. Employees cannot combine the benefits. Distribution of Passes or Vouchers An important concern is pass/voucher distribution, in terms of both logistics and security. Transit passes and vouchers generally do not contain identifying characteristics that clearly  Nondiscrimination rules that apply to cafeteria plans do not apply to transportation benefits. An employer can offer transportation benefits to any group of employees without concern about disproportionate use by the highly compensated. Unlike cafeteria plans, salary reduction elections do not need to be made before the beginning of the plan year. The employer may allow elections for transportation benefits to be made before any period during with the employee will receive the benefits. For example, an election period may be for a calendar month, providing greater flexibility for employees. Unlike cafeteria plans, transportation benefits are not subject to Form 5500 annual reporting.      Costs and Corporate Cash Flow The primary cost of employer-based transit benefits programs is the contribution to the employee's transit cost. Although providing transit/vanpool benefits costs a company less than providing additional salary (due to payroll tax savings), cash flow associated with purchasing transit passes or vouchers can be an issue for some companies. For example, some transit agencies and  6   CCLI: Transit and Vanpool Benefits  show they belong to a specific person. As a result, the employer must match the transit vouchers they receive from the transit agency with the elections made by individual employees. The process can be further complicated if the employer payroll operation is centralized but facilities are spread throughout a region or the country. In general, distribution is probably a greater problem for large companies with multiple sites, and not much of a problem for small employers with a single site. Employers have responded in several ways. Some employers have employees pick up passes or vouchers in person from a designated contact person. Other employers send passes or vouchers directly to employees' homes to simplify the process. Some employers use a cash reimbursement system to avoid having to distribute vouchers altogether; however, there are regulations specifying when cash reimbursement can be used, depending on whether vouchers are ""readily available"" (described further below). Some commercial services also offer a service in which they send passes or vouchers directly to employees' homes, saving the employer from distribution; a fee is charged for this service. There is no one best way; each employer must choose a solution that fits. Dealing with Multiple Transit Agencies Dealing with multiple transit systems can be a challenge for employers, whether one has multiple work sites or the region is served by several transit agencies. Within a given region, there may be dozens of individual transit systems, each with different types of transit passes. If an employer needs to distribute different kinds of passes to different employees, this can soon become a major task. There are several options for the employer interested in minimizing personnel staff time in program implementation, while handling different transit systems and vanpools. Although this sec-  tion describes the types of programs available in a general way, please see Appendix A for a list of programs arranged by city or region.   Regional Transit/Vanpool Vouchers: In most large metropolitan areas, regional transit vouchers are available, which are good for services on multiple transit agencies, including vanpools. These regional vouchers tend to come from either a large regional transit agency or a commercial voucher provider.  Vouchers from Transit Agencies: Many large metropolitan areas have simplified the process by creating regional transit vouchers that are good for services on multiple transit agencies, including vanpools. For example, in the Washington, DC metropolitan area, Metrocheks are available through the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). Metrocheks are accepted by over 100 bus, rail, and vanpool services in the DC area. The employee either uses the Metrochek directly on Metrorail or trades the voucher in for a Metro bus pass, another local bus pass, commuter rail tickets, or vanpool pass. Many regional transit services also now have employer coordinators and special program materials for employers to make it easy for employers to start a program. Some transit agencies even provide discounts to employers who order in bulk.  Commercial Voucher Providers: In other metropolitan areas, the regional voucher is available from a commercial voucher provider. A commercial voucher provider serves as a middleman between employer and transit agencies, and a clearinghouse for transit agencies: the voucher provider offers transit passes that can be used on any transit system in the region.  7   CCLI: Transit and Vanpool Benefits  Three of the largest commercial voucher providers are: Commuter Check Services Corp., TransitCenter, and Work/Life Benefits. If using these voucher providers, the employer responsibility becomes limited to only the purchase and distribution of vouchers. The services typically charge an administrative fee. (Garvey, 2000)   Employers cannot consider internal costs (e.g., distribution costs) in claiming that vouchers are not readily available. In addition, the ""one percent"" rule does not take effect until January 1, 2004. In the interim, employers can use the old standard of ""significant administrative costs."" This phrase was not defined in the previous regulations. Equity Issues For employers with multiple worksites, especially in different states, there may be equity issues to consider before implementing transit/vanpool benefits. Because transit fares vary so widely, giving the same dollar amount to employees in different locations (or even to those in the same location who use different means of transit) will result in different levels of coverage for employees' transit needs. A $65 benefit would more than cover a $35 monthly bus pass (although the employee would not receive the additional $30 in cash), but commuter rail expenses could easily exceed $100 per month, in which case the employee would have to make up the difference. The other option is to pay a similar proportion of all employees' commuting expenses, although any benefits over $65 would not be tax-free. There is no one correct approach to the issue, but employers served by a variety of transit agencies must take the issue into account.  Other Transit/Vanpool/Parking Benefit Services: In addition to these options, a commercial venture called WageWorks works with employers to set up a commuter benefit program that allows employers to order transit, vanpool, and parking vouchers on-line. An employer would set up an account with WageWorks. The employees can order passes on-line and get them sent directly to their homes, without the employer having to worry about distributing vouchers. WageWorks charges an administrative fee.  Using Cash Reimbursement Cash reimbursement may be used instead of transit/vanpool vouchers only if the employer can show that vouchers or passes are not ""readily available."" According to IRS regulations, a voucher is considered ""readily available"" unless one of the following two conditions applies:   If fees charged by a transit voucher provider exceed one percent of the average annual value of the vouchers (excluding per order delivery charges of under $15), or If there are non-financial restrictions on vouchers that make voucher use inappropriate for particular companies. These include advance purchase requirements (e.g., one year), minimum purchase requirements (e.g., a company wants to buy $200 worth of vouchers but the minimum requirement is $1,000), or limits on the denominations (e.g., a company wants $40 in vouchers for each employee but they are only available in denominations of $60). 8  GUIDE  TO IMPLEMENTATION    An employer would need to take a number of steps to implement a transit benefit program. The first two steps below would be the same for any employer; however, once an employer has decided whether to use a voucher system or a cash reimbursement system, the steps diverge. Both possibilities are presented below. Appendix B contains a flow chart to assist employers with decision-making about the various choices involved in implementing a transit/vanpool benefits program.   CCLI: Transit and Vanpool Benefits  1) Determine what Form of Transit/Vanpool Voucher is Available for your Location Many cities and regions already have transit voucher programs through which employers can purchase transit vouchers in bulk for their employees. The largest programs are listed in the Associations and Contacts section below, under ""Regional and Local Transit Agencies and Other Contacts."" For regions not listed here, an employer should contact the local transit agency to determine whether they participate in such a program. At this early stage, employers should also determine how many different transit systems their employees use; in a small city, where all bus services are provided by a single agency, a program might function differently than in the San Francisco Bay Area, with over two dozen transit agencies. This may be a particular difficulty for multi-region employers, especially those whose offices are served by smaller agencies. 2) Determine Whether to Use Voucher/Pass System or Cash Reimbursement System According to IRS regulations, a cash reimbursement system can be used only if an existing voucher program does not impose any restrictions that would cause the vouchers to be considered not ""readily available."" A voucher would be considered not ""readily available"" under two circumstances: if the provider imposes a fee of over one percent, or has other restrictions such as advance purchase requirements, minimum purchase requirements, or limits on the voucher denominations that do not meet employer requirements. As noted above, the ""one percent"" rule does not take effect until January 1, 2004. In the interim, employers are advised to consult with a tax advisor to determine if fees would constitute ""significant administrative costs,"" the current standard. If the employer chooses to implement a voucher system, the following steps would apply:  1) Contact Transit Pass or Voucher Provider After determining to participate in a voucher program, the employer could contact a representative from the provider to review program, costs, and logistics. If there are multiple transit agencies, an employer should discuss how this may affect employee's use of the program. Some voucher programs also offer the option of registering online. 2) Determine how Voucher/Pass Program will Operate Vouchers or passes may be used either for employees to purchase with pre-tax dollars, or as an employer-paid benefit. Employers must decide which of these options better meets their needs. If the employer is paying for the benefit, they must also decide whether they will offer the full $65 to all employees, or whether they will pay a certain percentage of costs. (For example, if a monthly bus pass costs only $45, but rail costs $100 per month, an employer must decide how much of each cost to subsidize). 3) Obtain Senior Management Approval Senior management would need to approve this type of addition to existing benefits. Because the most effective programs in reducing solo driving are those that are supported by management, if one of the employer's goals is to reduce the percentage of single-occupant vehicles, on-going management support of the program is critical. 4) Make Appropriate Changes to Payroll System If the program is designed to allow employees to purchase pre-tax vouchers, payroll procedures must be changed to reflect this new benefit. This may mean setting up new deduction codes, redesigning payroll forms, or working with a third-party payroll vendor to implement the change. An employer must also decide if benefits will be available at any time, or if employees will 9   CCLI: Transit and Vanpool Benefits  only be able to enroll during certain election times, and how employees will enroll (via printed forms, electronically, or through some other means). If there will be different denominations of transit vouchers available, this should be reflected in enrollment procedures. At this point, employers should also decide how vouchers or passes will be distributed, on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis; and whether they will be mailed to employees or picked up at a central point at specified times. 5) Enroll in Voucher or Pass Program Employers must enroll with the voucher or pass provider. Providers may have minimum order levels; they may also make recommendations as to how many vouchers or passes should be ordered (usually five percent above anticipated demand). It will generally take several weeks before the employer obtains the vouchers or passes. Employers should ensure that employees receive their vouchers or passes within a reasonable time after beginning to make deductions. In a voucher program, the employer should decide what denominations make sense. For example, if the main transit provider is a bus service, and a monthly pass costs $40, the employer would want to order both $10 and $30 vouchers. A $30 voucher would leave the employee to pay the remaining $10, while two $30 vouchers would mean a waste of $20, since riders cannot redeem the extra voucher amount for cash. Voucher providers may have denominations specific to the city and transit agency. 6) Publicize the Program to Employees Employers should communicate the new benefits to employees. Information about the benefits should also be incorporated into orientation sessions and company benefits literature and internal communications.  7) Enroll Employees Once the benefit is set up and announced with a start date, the employer should be prepared for a large one-time influx of new enrollees. For onsite distribution, employers should make arrangements to have sufficient vouchers or passes on hand at the site, and ensure that personnel understand the distribution procedures. 8) Set up a System for Continuing Distribution Once the initial enrolment period has passed, employers should ensure that the system continues to operate smoothly. This would include continuing publicity of the program, monitoring program usage, ordering new vouchers or passes on a regular basis, and answering employee questions about the program. If the employer chooses to implement a cash reimbursement system, the following steps would apply: 1) Determine how Cash Reimbursement Program will Operate The employer must decide whether the program will operate as an employee-paid or an employerpaid program. An employee-paid reimbursement program operates like a flexible spending account, in which the employees reserves a specific amount of pre-tax money every month, up to $65. The employee then requests reimbursement using these funds for actual transit expenses incurred. An employer-paid program would allow employees to request reimbursement up to $65 per month from the employer. Both types of programs must meet IRS criteria about reimbursement; the employers must implement a ""reasonable procedure"" to ensure that the employee spent the money on qualified transit expenses. Also, reimbursement program must operate on a reimbursement basis; the employer cannot reimburse an employee until an expense has actually been incurred.  10   CCLI: Transit and Vanpool Benefits  2) Obtain Senior Management Approval Senior management would need to approve this type of change in benefits. If the employer wants to reduce the percentage of single-occupant vehicles, on-going management support of the program is critical. Even more important than management support is management participation; if senior level employees ride transit, employees will be more likely to believe that the company has a serious commitment to the program. 3) Make Appropriate Changes to Payroll System If the program is designed to allow employees to reserve pre-tax funds to pay for transit, payroll procedures must be changed to reflect this new benefit. This may mean setting up new deduction codes, redesigning payroll forms, or working with a third-party payroll vendor to implement the change. If the program will be employer-paid, any reimbursement procedures the company already has in place will need to include transit reimbursements; this may require adding expense codes or enrolling employees who do not normally request expense reimbursements. An employer must also decide if benefits will be available at any time, or if employees will only be able to enroll during certain election times, and how employees will enroll (via printed forms, electronically, or through some other means). At this point, employers should also decide how often reimbursement will be distributed: on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis, and how employees will submit claims for reimbursement (on paper or electronically, and whether receipts or copies of transit passes will be required). 4) Publicize the Transit Cash Reimbursement Program to Employees Employers should communicate the new benefits to employees. Information about the benefits  should also be incorporated into orientation sessions and company benefits literature and internal communications. 5) Enroll Employees Once the benefit is set up and announced with a start date, the employer should be prepared for a large but one-time influx of new enrollees, as well as the first batch of requests for reimbursement. 6) Set up a System for Continuing Cash Reimbursements Once the program has been implemented and any bugs worked out, the employer should ensure that the program continues to operate smoothly. This would include continuing publicity of the program, monitoring program usage, and answering employee questions about the program.  EMPLOYER QUESTIONS  AND  A  NSWERS  These questions might commonly be asked by an employer (e.g., a human resources administrator or business manager) considering a commuter benefits program. Question: How difficult - and costly - is it to administer a transit/vanpool benefit program? A study of firms that have implemented transit pass programs generally found negligible implementation costs. The study found that transit programs are in many cases simple to organize and implement and that their ongoing administration poses no extra cost to the firm. Companies interviewed generally felt that the benefits of the program far outweighed the added administrative time necessary to implement the program and distribute vouchers. Some companies hire outside firms to deal with voucher purchase, distribution, and advertisement. Although these companies charge for their services, some companies have  11   CCLI: Transit and Vanpool Benefits  found that these extra costs can be less than actual tax savings for both programs where the employer provide vouchers and where employees pay with pre-tax income. (Litman, 1999) However, implementing programs also involve initial start-up costs in terms of staff time needed, which may fall heavily on the human resources section. In addition, some companies have found that the number of people who will be interested in receiving the benefits is too small to justify the time and effort involved. Question: What are the cost implications of implementing transit/vanpool benefits for my company? The total financial effects of a benefits program will vary depending on the specific conditions of a company, including existing parking arrangements, location, transit availability, and current travel patterns of employees. If the benefit is paid by employees out of their pre-tax earnings, the employer will incur only administrative costs. If the employer pays for the benefit, costs will be substantially higher, based on the amount of the benefit and the number of employees who participate. In addition, the use of commercial transit voucher providers may entail an administration fee. If the employer pays for the benefit, the cost to the employers will be less than if the employers had increased employees' salaries by an equivalent amount. If the employees pay for the benefits out of pre-tax income, the employer saves on payroll taxes. The payroll tax savings should generally offset the administration fees charged by commercial providers. It is important to note that many of the costs may be more than offset by other significant long-term cost savings. Employers interviewed in case studies consistently remarked that the transit benefits are an added fringe benefit that helps to recruit and retain employees: ""It tips the scale in our favor when a recruit is comparing offerings of other companies to ours."" (Wells, 1999) 12  Moreover, by equalizing benefits, companies provide a more equitable compensation package for all their employees. Together, these features may help to reduce recruitment and retention costs for the company. In addition, for employees who personally support environmental goals, such benefits may make the company more attractive than one that simply offers free parking and does not address other commute modes. Together, these features may help to reduce recruitment and retention costs for the company. Question: If I implement a transit/vanpool benefit program, am I required to offer the full value of $65 to my employee? No. An employer may provide benefits of any amount. Question: What if a monthly pass costs $75 per month? Am I limited to providing a $65 benefit per month? No. An employer may provide transit/vanpool benefits of any amount. The tax-free benefit for transit/vanpool benefits, however, is currently limited to $65 per month. As a result, the employee and employer must pay taxes on the value of the benefit that exceeds the $65 statutory limit. For example, if the employer provides the employee with a monthly pass valued at $75 per month, $65 is a tax-free fringe benefit, and the excess - $10 - must be included in the employee's wages for income and employment tax purposes. Similarly, if the employer offers a pre-tax salary deduction option, the employee may be allowed to purchase a pass with a value of more than $65 per month. Then, $65 per month will be deducted from the employee's wages for income and employment tax purposes. The remaining cost will be included in taxable salary but be used by the employer to purchase the pass.   CCLI: Transit and Vanpool Benefits  Question: Do transit passes need to be distributed on a monthly basis? What if I want to provide my employees with annual transit passes? Transit passes may be distributed up to twelve months in advance. In the case of a pass that is valid for more than one month, such as an annual pass, the value of the pass may be divided by the number of months for which it is valid to determine whether the value of the pass exceeds the statutory monthly limit. For example, an employer may provide employees with transit passes near the beginning of each calendar quarter for that calendar quarter. In this case, an employer may provide employees with transit passes with a value of $195 on March 31 for the calendar quarter covering the months April, May, and June. Since $195 is within the statutory limit (three months times $65 equals $195), the total value is excludable from the employees' wages for income and employment tax purposes. Question: How are benefits treated if an employee terminates employment and the transit passes cover multiple months? In general, the value of transit passes provided in advance to an employee for a month in which the individual is not an employee must be included in the employee's wages for income tax purposes. Transit passes distributed in advance to an employee are excludable from wages for employment tax purposes if the employer distributes transit passes to the employee in advance for not more than three months. At the time the passes are distributed, there cannot be an established date that the employee's employment will terminate (for example, if the employee has given notice of retirement) occurring before the beginning of the last month of the period for which the transit passes are provided. Assume the employer distributes transit passes quarterly, and the employee elects to have $195 deducted from salary to cover transit vouchers for 13  April, May, and June. If employment terminates on May 31, and there was not an established date of termination at the time the transit passes were distributed, then the value of the transit passes provided for June ($65) is excludable from the employee's wages for employment tax purposes. However, the value of the transit passes distributed for June ($65) is not excludable from wages for income tax purposes. If the employee's termination date was established at the time the transit passes were provided, then the $65 is included in the employee's wages for both income and employment tax purposes. Question: Under what circumstances can an employer offer benefits in the form of cash payments rather than using transit vouchers or passes? The tax code states that transportation reimbursements must be made through vouchers or passes, rather than cash payments, unless the employer can show that vouchers or passes are not ""readily available."" The January, 2001 IRS regulations define the term ""readily available"" by stating that only fees charged by transit voucher providers, and non-financial restrictions on vouchers, could be considered in making a determination of voucher availability, not internal administrative costs. Passes are to be considered readily available if an employer can obtain a pass on terms no less favorable than those available to an individual employee, as long as the voucher provider does not charge a fee in excess of one percent of the average monthly value of the voucher. However, the ""one percent"" rule does not go into effect until January 1, 2004. In the interim, the previous standard that vouchers were not considered ""readily available"" if there were ""significant administrative costs"" to the employer appears to remain in effect. Previous regulations did not define the term ""significant administrative costs.""   CCLI: Transit and Vanpool Benefits  In making a determination of voucher availability, employers cannot consider internal costs, but can include non-financial restrictions, such as whether there are reasonable advance purchase and minimum purchase requirements and whether vouchers can be purchased in appropriate denominations. (Federal Register, 2001)   ordering. Using a voucher system reduces both the HR and employees' administrative requirements, because they do not have to file for reimbursement or handle reimbursement requests. Once the employee has received the voucher, the employer's tasks are completed. Simpler Relations with Transit Agencies. In areas with multiple transit agencies, employees can generally use vouchers at any provider. Employers do not have to purchase passes from multiple agencies. Customer Friendly. An account representative may provide a human resources employee with valuable experience about expected employee response to vouchers. Easier for Multi-State Employers. Employers with locations in two or more states may choose to use commercial voucher providers because of the time and effort involved in administering the program in different states.  Internal administrative costs that cannot be considered in determining voucher availability include expenses incurred by the employer to distribute the vouches (i.e., if the employer chooses to mail vouchers to employees, the postal fee cannot be considered); any additional security measures that must be taken to safeguard the vouchers, expenses incurred to advertise the provision of transit vouchers, etc. Non-financial restrictions that can be taken into consideration include the following: if a voucher provider does not make vouchers available for purchase at reasonable intervals, or if a voucher provider fails to provide vouchers within a reasonable period after receiving payment for the voucher. Question: Must a qualified transportation fringe benefit plan be in writing? No. The Internal Revenue Code does not require that a transportation fringe benefit be in writing. However, a company may wish to have certain rules and procedures written in order to answer employee questions. Question: What are the benefits and downsides of using a commercial voucher provider? Commercial voucher providers can greatly simplify the process of implementing a transit voucher program.       The main downside is that commercial voucher providers change an administration fee equal to several percent of the total cost of the vouchers supplied. The more employees that enroll, the more expensive the service becomes on an absolute basis. Question: What is a vanpool? A vanpool operates like a mini-transit service, with an organized route, schedule and passenger fare charges. Vanpools are comprised of at least six people, plus a driver, and fares depend on the commute distance, the total number of riders, the type of van, company-provided equipment, and incentives or subsidies. Vanpooling tends to appeal particularly to long distance commuters who can reduce their commute costs and get to work in a stress-free way by sharing the ride with others. Typically, the vanpool driver rides free in exchange for driving, collecting fares, and managing maintenance for the van. Vanpools can be either employer-sponsored, use third party leases, or be owner-operated. More information on vanpools is contained in a separate briefing paper. 14  Fewer Administrative Requirements Compared to Cash Reimbursement. Because vouchers can be ordered in bulk, and are generally valid for many months, an employer can order several times per year, instead of processing many reimbursements every month. Commercial voucher providers can set up automatic reminders about re-   CCLI: Transit and Vanpool Benefits  Question: Does an employer need to operate a vanpool to provide vanpool benefits? No. An employer does not need to own or lease the vans in order to provide a vanpool benefit to employees. Question: What are the best ways to promote a transit/vanpool benefit program? An employer has numerous options to inform employees about the benefits. Some of the more frequent methods include but are not limited to the following:   sit/vanpool passes and what employees are charged for the passes. Georgia offers a $25 tax credit for each employee receiving a transportation fringe benefit, as long as the tax credit does not exceed the amount of money spent on the program. Other states, including Delaware, Connecticut, New Jersey, and Oregon, offer tax credits to eligible companies that implement commuter transportation benefit plans, which could include transit/vanpool benefits. State tax credits may reduce the amount of federal tax savings, due to smaller federal deductions for state taxes. Employers should discuss state tax credit implications with a qualified tax advisor. More detailed information on state tax credits is contained in a separate briefing paper, Commuter Tax Benefits.  Company orientation meetings for new employees; Advertisements in places seen frequently by employees (cafeteria, garage, elevators, etc); Distribution of program brochures; Company newsletters; Voicemail or e-mail broadcast; Special promotional days (example: a ""Pool Day"" to encourage car- and vanpooling) Awards or prize drawings to recognize employees using transit or carpools; Inserts to paychecks; Company web site or intranet.    EMPLOYER C  ASE  S  TUDIES          Both public and private implemented successful Following are examples implemented commuter scales.  sector employers have programs across the U.S. of employers that have pass programs of varying    Seattle, Washington - Minor & James Medical Clinic Minor & James Medical Clinic in Seattle provides all of its employees with an Annual Flex Pass, which is good for unlimited free transit rides in King County, Washington. The Annual Flex Pass provides the approximately 340 employees of the clinic with free transportation to work using public transportation. According to Joann Wray, the Human Resources director and Transportation Director, the Annual Flex Pass is greatly appreciated by employees.      Question: Do any state or local governments offer any incentives for doing this? Yes. Several states offer tax incentives for providing transit/vanpool benefits. Maryland offers a 50 percent tax credit up to $30 per employee per month for costs associated with providing transit/vanpool benefits to employees. Minnesota provides a tax credit equal to 30 percent of the difference between what the employer pays for tran-  15   CCLI: Transit and Vanpool Benefits  The pass normally retails at a cost of $1,746. The program has been in effect since about 1997, and about 80 percent of the employees (275 out of 340) take transit to work each day. No parking is provided at the clinic, except for employees who were grandfathered into the program (about 100) and those that are required to work late night hours. Employees like the pass program because it allows them to commute to work free. Part of the commute program that makes it successful is a guaranteed ride home program that is paid for by the clinic. The guaranteed ride home program offers employees the ability to take transit to work with the security of knowing that they will be able to get home quickly in the event of an emergency or special circumstance. (Wray, 2001) Boston, Massachusetts A Boston-based Internet startup with about 70 employees gives its employees free passes to use in the Boston subway system. Management's primary goal is to keep the benefits free even as the firm grows to an anticipated 100 employees in the months ahead. The company reports that the program has been very well received and is one tool among many to attract high-quality employees. The pass ""really excites people"" because it is something tangible they can use right away. To compete, the company wants to make it as easy as possible for employees to commute and avoid parking expenses, which can add up to an estimated $225 a month in downtown Boston. (Garvey, 2000) Chicago, Illinois - General Growth Properties General Growth Properties, a Chicago-based company that manages shopping malls across the country, allows its employees to take a payroll deduction of up to $65 a month in pre-tax dollars to be used for transit vouchers, rather than providing a direct benefit. About 250 of the company's 500 headquarters employees have enrolled in the program managed by General Growth's payroll/accounting department.  Given that the company's payroll is done in-house, the program managers feel that administration of the program on an ongoing basis takes very little extra effort. Setting a limit on when employees can opt in or out of the program makes the program more manageable. Allowing monthly enrollment or other changes would be difficult from an administrative perspective, so General Growth's program limits changes to once a quarter. Under the company's program, General Growth purchases transit vouchers that cover a broad base of the Regional Transit Authority/Chicago Transit Authority's mass transportation options. The vouchers are in different denominations, made out to General Growth and can be used to pay for transportation on any part of the regional system. Vouchers are distributed to employees once a month through the company's security desk. Those enrolled in the plan must show identification and sign for the vouchers. The company does not offer any form of parking benefit. Portland, Oregon - Intel Corporation Intel Corporation, with major offices in Arizona, Washington, California, and Oregon, has a wide range of transit benefits available to employees. At their Santa Clara facility, employees receive free Ecopasses for the Valley Transportation Authority light rail system, as well as $30 per month in subsidized metro/bus passes. In Portland, Intel Corporation bought annual bus and light-rail passes from Tri-Met, the local transit authority, for $10 apiece instead of the retail price of $505. The company received the discount by purchasing passes for all eligible members of their work force. The corporation purchased 10,400 passes and will provide them free of charge to all employees. Under the State's new commute-reduction law, businesses that provide transit passes for their employees receive a 35 percent State tax deduction.7 See www.epa.gov/oms/transp/comchoic/ccmeasur.htm and www.commuterchoice.com/employers/ Example_Intel_RideShare.pdf 7  16   CCLI: Transit and Vanpool Benefits  According to a 1999 report, 40 percent of Intel's workforce in Arizona and Washington were not driving alone to work, as were 32 percent of California employees. Atlanta, Georgia ---- Georgia Pacific/Southern Company Between 1997 and 1999, Georgia Pacific/Southern Company instituted a series of commuter benefits designed to allow their employees to assist in reducing Atlanta's worsening air pollution. One benefit gives employees $65 per month in subsidies for transit, shuttles, or vanpools. In addition, to encourage rail ridership, the company beefed up its MARTA shuttle operations, shortening headways to 10 minutes or less throughout the day. Use of alternative commute modes increased from 300 employees in 1997 to 1,500 employees in 2000, or from 10 percent to 50 percent of all employees. Ridership on the MARTA shuttle was at 11,000 boardings per month in June 2000, up from 6,000 per month in 1997.8 Milwaukee, Wisconsin - University of Wisconsin The UPASS transit pass program at The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM) is an innovative transit program developed by the University and the Milwaukee County Transit System (MCTS) in which all UWM students receive an unlimited transit pass as part of their tuition. The pass can be used anytime, anywhere, for any trip purpose throughout Milwaukee County without any additional fare required. Program findings indicate that UPASS has been effective in reducing vehicle trips, increasing transit ridership, and reducing the impact of the automobile on the environment. The UPASS program has influenced modal shifts. Students who drive to UWM declined from a rate of 54% prior to UPASS to a rate between 38% to 41% after the  implementation of UPASS. Students choosing to ride MCTS increased from 12% prior to UPASS to a rate of 25% to 26% since the implementation of UPASS. The UPASS program has also increased transit ridership for trips to work, to shopping, and to other locations. Transit mode split for work trips by survey respondents showed nearly a doubling over pre-UPASS semesters from a rate of 8% to approximately 15%. Surveys indicate a 17% to 18% increase in transit ridership for these trip purposes compared to pre-UPASS ridership. MCTS on-board ridership counts indicate express service to UWM showed a 75% to 136% increase compared to ridership counts conducted prior to the UPASS program. The UPASS program reduced vehicle trips to the university, which resulted in a reduction in emissions, fuel consumption, and student dollar savings. The UPASS program resulted in 221,055 fewer vehicle trips made to UWM during the 1994-95 academic school year. Bethesda, Maryland - Calvert Group The Calvert Group, a socially-responsible investment fund located in suburban Washington, DC, offers a commuter benefits program to cover every potential mode, including walking and bicycling. Although Calvert subsidizes employees who drive at a rate of $75/month, persons who ride transit are reimbursed the full value of the transit costs, regardless of provider. Employee turnover dropped from 25 to 12 percent after implementation of the program, and Calvert management sees the plan as integral to its recruitment and morale. The company has gained national attention for the quality of its employee programs in national publications such as Business Week and Working Mothers Magazine.9  8  Example from: www.commuterchoice.com  9  Example from: www.commuterchoice.com/employers/success  17   CCLI: Transit and Vanpool Benefits  Los Angeles, California - Transamerica Life Companies Transamerica Life Companies, an insurance company with approximately 1,000 employees, is located just south of downtown Los Angeles. Los Angeles area companies with over 250 employees are mandated by the South Coast Air Quality Management District to institute trip reduction programs. Transamerica Life's commuter program, which developed over a period of 13 years, includes a vanpool program (leased vans; maintenance, insurance, and administration provided), free parking for vanpools and parking discount for carpools, and a 50 percent transit subsidy (up to $65/month). Employees can purchase transit passes on-site; the Transportation Coordinator sends down a list of participants to the store, and the employee pays the balance of the amount. The company supports these financial elements with a guaranteed ride home program, emergency use of company cars, work hours flexibility, and bike racks and shower/locker facilities. As a result of these measures, approximately 500 employees participate in the transit pass program, and an additional 175 use carpools or vanpools. (FHWA, 1993; Corona, 2001) Minneapolis, Minnesota - American Express In 1998, American Express, a major financial services company, became the first Twin Cities employer to take advantage of the Metropass program offered by regional bus service provider Metro Transit. The program allows employers with over 100 employees to obtain reduced-cost monthly bus passes to their employees. For the first year, American Express paid Metro Transit $1.8 million, based on an estimate of the number of employees who would ride the bus. Employees could then purchase monthly bus passes for $25 pre-tax, a significant savings over the usual price of $76. Employees received photo bus passes to reduce the risk of fraud. Of the company's 6,000 employees in Minneapolis, approximately 70 percent use the program. (Pietsch, 2001; U.S. EPA Commuter Choice Case Studies) 18  SERVICES THAT S IMPLEMENTATION  UPPORT  Local Governments and Transit Agencies Services to help employers implement commuter benefit programs are provided by many regional and local government entities. Transit agencies, metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs), city and county transportation agencies, transportation management associations (TMAs), and transportation management organizations (TMOs) throughout the U.S. provide assistance to employers in starting and maintaining transportation demand management programs like transit passes and vanpools. They often provide information to employers about options to reduce driving to work, implementation issues, and local programs that support employer initiatives. Transit agencies often allow employers to purchase deeply discounted transit passes for their employees in an effort to boost ridership and meet environmental goals. Employers who take advantage of these programs should be aware that transit pass costs may rise after a year or two and plan accordingly. One potential solution to this problem might be for a company to carry the cost of transit passes for the initial years, and then share costs with employees later on. Supporting Services - Guaranteed Rides Home and Information Provision One of the barriers that prevents some employees from taking transit or a vanpool to work is the fear that they will not be able to get home quickly in the event of an personal emergency, such as picking up a sick child from school, or working unscheduled overtime. Guaranteed Ride Home (GRH) programs provide commuters who regularly carpool, vanpool, bike, walk or take transit to work with a reliable ride home when an unexpected emergency arises. GRH programs are designed to rescue commuters who are worried about how they'll get home when an emergency arises. Knowing there is a guaranteed ride home gives   CCLI: Transit and Vanpool Benefits  many people the security to take commuting options like transit and carpools with confidence. GRH programs may be established by individual employers; usually the employer will pay for a taxi home in case an employee who takes transit or a vanpool needs to go home at a time when transit services are not available or without the vanpool. Some MPOs and local governments have also established regional or county-wide GRH programs for employees that register for the program. GRH programs tend to be low-cost ways to encourage transit use, especially if a company only ""fills in"" coverage for areas not covered under a broader regional program. For example, a regional transit agency may provide a guaranteed ride home for monthly passholders, so a company would have to provide GRH only for carpoolers. Employers can also support transit and vanpooling by providing information on these options to their employees. A bulletin board or display with transit route maps and schedules can often be put up in a Human Resources office, lounge area, or hallway. Employers can also send periodic reminders to their employees about the availability of benefits through company voicemail or email systems, company newsletters, or an awards program designed to recognize alternative commuters. A supportive attitude toward transit and vanpooling can also help. Supervisors should recognize their vanpoolers' schedule; for example, they should not hold late meetings that would require employees to miss their vanpool.  MPOs, transit agencies, TMAs/TMOs, or other groups that provide services to support transit/vanpool benefit implementation.

EMISSIONS BENEFITS  AND  TRANSPORTATION  Transportation benefits can be an effective means of reducing vehicle travel and associated emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases, traffic congestion, and parking problems. Vehicle Trips Transit pass programs typically produce substantial shifts away from driving to work alone. Studies of programs in New York City,  20   CCLI: Transit and Vanpool Benefits  Philadelphia, and San Francisco found an increase in employee transit use for both commuting and non-work trips among those receiving employer-provided transit benefits.10 On average, employees receiving benefits took 1.7 to 3.2 new transit trips per week, as shown in the following table. (US DOT, 1995; Metropolitan Transportation Commission) Figure 3: Change in Transit Use due to Employer-Provided Transit Benefits Region Type of trip % employees reporting increased transit use Average increase in transit trips per week per employee (among employees receiving benefit) 2.05 1.19 3.24 2.5 1.1-1.2 0.55-1.7 1.7-2.9  users of transit, and remain irregular users.11 The largest increases in transit use appear to be in suburban areas, where existing transit share is lower than urban areas. For example, in the Bay Area study, the average increase was 3.03 new transit trips for employees working in San Francisco and 3.74 new transit trips per week for employees working outside of San Francisco. Correspondingly, the reason the average increase in transit trips was lower in New York than in other regions may be because New York already has a high transit share. In the surveys where respondents were asked about their auto use, the percent of respondents reporting a decrease in auto/taxi use was nearly equivalent to the percent reporting an increase in transit use. These findings suggest that new transit trips are associated with a reduction in driving trips. Other studies of transit pass programs at individual employers confirm the effects of these programs at reducing vehicle travel. The extensive U-PASS transportation benefit program at the University of Washington (UW) produced remarkable impacts in a short time:  San Francisco Bay Area Philadelphia New York  Commute Non-work Total trips Total trips Commute Non-work Total  34% 29% N/A N/A 11-23% 14-22% N/A  Although most of the employees taking transit benefits already commuted by transit, the surveys suggest that most of the users who increased transit use were previously non-users or infrequent  10  Metropolitan Transportation Commission.

It is not clear to what extent the level of the subsidy affects the number of new transit trips. One would expect that a higher subsidy would yield greater transit use. The San Francisco study, however, suggests that the level of the transit subsidy has little bearing on the transit ridership effect. No correlation was found between the amount of subsidy received and the number of new transit trips. The 1994 New York survey, however, found that employees receiving $31 or more per month took on average over three times as may additional trips as those receiving $30 or less per month. A comparison of the three New York surveys reveals that the increase in transit commute trips did not change much over time (about 1.1 - 1.2 new transit trips per week), even though the average subsidy in 1994 was about three times as high as in 1990. However, the number of new non-work trips was significantly higher per recipient in 1994, suggesting that the higher subsidy induces more transit trips for nonwork purposes. 11  21   CCLI: Transit and Vanpool Benefits  On September 30, 1991, the University of Washington, in cooperation with the Municipality of Metropolitan Seattle, implemented U-PASS, one of the most comprehensive transportation demand management programs in the United States. The U-PASS program was developed in response to campus and community concerns for trip reduction and improved commuter services in view of possible impacts from planned campus development. The U-PASS program is a flexible package of transportation benefits offered through a pass that allows University of Washington students, faculty, and staff to choose from a variety of commuting options at a greatly reduced price. After 1 year of operation,...[v]ehicle trips to campus are down 16 percent, parking lot use has decreased from 91 percent to 78 percent, transit ridership is up 35 percent, carpools have increased 21 percent and the number of vanpools grew from 8 to 20 in less than 9 months.

These gains have persisted over time; between 1990 and 1999, total UW-Seattle ridership grew to 7.2 million trips annually, a 68 percent increase. In the latest (1998) survey, only 25% of commuters to campus drove alone, a remarkable accomplishment over a period in which SOV mode share has risen nationwide. (University of Washington, 1999) The identically named program at the University of Wisconsin was similarly successful, moving an estimated 221,055 vehicle trips to transit during the 1994-1995 academic year. (Meyer and Beimborn, 1998) Emissions Reducing vehicle miles traveled (VMT) reduces vehicle emissions. The University of Wisconsin U-PASS program found a 20 percent reduction in emissions for trips to the university. (Meyer and Beimborn, 1998) Emissions reductions will generally track reductions in vehicle miles traveled, although if employees drive and then park-andride at transit stations, their cold-start emissions will cut into the emissions benefits.  22   CCLI: Transit and Vanpool Benefits  Krechmer, D., F.

As a result, it allowed transit passes to be provided to employees tax-free at a higher value than allowed as a de minimus fringe. It also allowed the employer, for the first time, to offer vanpool benefits tax-free. The Act imposed a tax-free limit of $60 per month for transit/vanpool benefits and $155 per month for qualified parking, and provided an inflation adjustment to these limits. In 1995, the tax-free limit for transit/vanpool benefits rose to $65 per month. In order to receive tax-free status, all benefits were required to be offered in addition to (and not in lieu of) salary. 1998: TEA-21 Allows Pre-Tax Salary Deductions for Transportation Fringe Benefits. The Transportation Equity Act of the 21st Century (TEA-21) of 1998 amended tax law to allow any qualified transportation fringe to be provided to employees in lieu of salary. As a result, employers can now allow employees to reserve some of their pre-tax income to pay for transit or vanpool options. The act also raised the tax-free limit on transit passes and commuter highway vehicle benefits from $65 to $100 per month, starting in 2002. 1999-present: Efforts to Encourage Greater Adoption of Transit/Vanpool Benefits. Since passage of TEA-21, interest in transit/vanpool benefit programs has increased dramatically. The U.S. government, and many state and local governments, have implemented programs to encourage adoption of transit/vanpool benefits and to lead by example by providing transit/vanpool benefits for government employees. In 1999, the federal government started the Commuter Choice Initiative. As part of the initiative, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) released the Commuter Choice Toolkit in 2000 to help employers implement transit benefit pro28  Since the 1980s, the tax status of transit/vanpool benefits has changed a number of times. This section briefly describes how their tax treatment has changed. 1984-1992: Transit Passes are de minimus benefits, No Tax Benefits for Vanpools, Parking Tax-Free. When the federal tax code provision on transportation fringe benefits was established in 1984 (in the 1984 Tax Reform Act), parking was the only commuter benefit included as a taxexempt qualified transportation fringe benefit. Transit passes could be offered by employers, but were considered de minimus fringe benefits rather than traditional fringe benefits. A de minimus benefit is a service or item of such small value or provided so infrequently as to make accounting for it impractical or impossible.12 As a result, transit benefits were allowed to be offered taxfree to employees as long as they were of small value. The initial de minimus value was $15 per month, which was later adjusted to $21 per month. If a benefit exceeded this value, it would be taxable in its entirety. Vanpool benefits did not qualify for any tax benefits (they were not included as either a qualified transportation fringe or a de minimus benefit). 1992: Energy Policy Act Allows for Tax-Free Treatment of Transit/Vanpool Benefits. In 1992, Congress passed the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Pub. L. No. 102-486). This Act expanded the term qualified transportation fringe to include transit passes and transportation in commuter  Examples of de minimus benefits include occasional personal use of a company copying machine, occasional parties or picnics, occasional taxi fare for employees working overtime, occasional tickets for entertainment, coffee and donuts, and group-term life insurance provided for a spouse or dependent of the employee with a face amount of $2,000 or less. 12   CCLI: Transit and Vanpool Benefits  grams. EPA, in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), also initiated a Commuter Choice Leadership Program to recognize employers leading the way in terms of commuter benefits. On April 21, 2000, President Clinton signed Executive Order 13150, Federal Workforce Transportation, which set an October 1, 2000 deadline for federal executive branch agencies to implement a transportation fringe benefit program. The EO also calls for all federal agencies in the national capital (Washington, D.C.) region to implement a transit and vanpool pass benefit program by October 1, 2000, paid for with agency funds. It also requires that DOT, the Department of Energy, and EPA implement a nationwide, three-year, transit pass pilot program for all of its employees, not just those working in the national capital region. (Outside the national capital region, employees are permitted to use pre-tax salary to pay for these benefits.) Since the passage of the federal executive order, several states, including Virginia and Georgia, have implemented programs to ensure that certain state employees receive transit/vanpool benefits. Some states, such as Maryland, Georgia, and Minnesota, have also implemented state tax credits to encourage employers to offer transit/vanpool benefits. Due to recent changes in the tax code, the Internal Revenue Service issued final regulations on January 11, 2001 concerning qualified transportation fringe benefits and their excludability from employees' gross income. The regulations provide rules to ensure that transportation benefits provided to employees are excludable from gross income and clarify changes to the law promulgated under the Energy Policy Act of 1992, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, and TEA-21.  29   ORDERING This publication may be ordered from the National Service Center for Environmental Publications (NSCEP) at: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency NSCEP P.O.

ACTION: Final regulation.  An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a valid control number assigned by the Office of Management and Budget. The estimated average annual recordkeeping burden per recordkeeper is 26.5 hours. The estimated annual reporting burden per respondent is .8 hours. Comments concerning the accuracy of this burden estimate and suggestions for reducing this burden should be sent to the Internal Revenue Service, Attn: IRS Reports Clearance Officer, W:CAR:MP:FP:S:O, Washington, DC 20224, and to the Office of Management and Budget, Attn: Desk Officer for the Department of the Treasury, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503. Books or records relating to a collection of information must be retained as long as their contents might become material in the administration of any internal revenue law. Generally, tax returns and tax return information are confidential, as required by 26 U.S.C. 6103. Background This document contains amendments to 26 CFR part 1 (Income Tax Regulations). On January 27, 2000, a proposed regulation (REG11357299) relating to qualified transportation fringes was published in the Federal Register (65 FR 4388). A public hearing was held on June 1, 2000. Written or electronic comments responding to the notice of proposed rulemaking were received. After consideration of all the comments, the proposed regulations are adopted as amended by this Treasury decision. The revisions are discussed below. Explanation of Provisions and Summary of Comments In general, comments received on the proposed regulations were favorable and, accordingly, the final regulations retain the general structure of the proposed regulations, including the question and answer format and a variety of examples illustrating the substance of the final regulations. However, commentators made a number of specific recommendations for modifications and clarifications of the regulations. In response to these comments, the final regulations incorporate the modifications and clarifications described below.  A. Whether Vouchers are Readily Available Section 132(f)(3) provides that qualified transportation fringes include cash reimbursement for transit passes ``only if a voucher or similar item which may be exchanged only for a transit pass is not readily available for direct distribution by the employer to the employee.'' Thus, if vouchers are readily available, the employer must use vouchers and cash reimbursement of a mass transit expense would not be a qualified transportation fringe. Most of the comments received addressed the issue of whether vouchers are ``readily available.'' Commentators representing employers generally favored rules permitting cash reimbursement. Commentators representing transit operators and voucher providers generally favored rules not permitting cash reimbursement. The following discusses three issues raised by commentators: first, whether the proposed regulations' 1 percent safe harbor should be retained; second, whether internal administrative costs should be considered in applying the 1 percent test; and third, whether other nonfinancial restrictions should be considered in determining whether vouchers are readily available. 1. The 1 Percent Safe Harbor Under Notice 943, 19941 C.B. 327, and the proposed regulations, a voucher is readily available if an employer can obtain it on terms no less favorable than those available to an individual employee and without incurring a significant administrative cost. Under the proposed regulations, administrative costs relate only to fees paid to fare media providers, and the determination of whether obtaining a voucher would result in a significant administrative cost is made with respect to each transit system voucher. The proposed regulations provide a rule under which administrative costs are treated as significant if the average monthly administrative costs incurred by the employer for a voucher (disregarding delivery charges imposed by the fare media provider to the extent not in excess of $15 per order) are more than 1 percent of the average monthly value of the vouchers for a system. Commentators, in particular those representing fare media providers and transit operators, suggested that the fare media provider fee percentage causing vouchers to not be readily available should be raised because many fare media providers charge fees in excess of the 1 percent limit and, thus, under this  This document contains final regulations relating to qualified transportation fringe benefits. These final regulations provide rules to ensure that transportation benefits provided to employees are excludable from gross income. These final regulations reflect changes to the law made by the Energy Policy Act of 1992, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, and the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century. These final regulations affect employers that offer qualified transportation fringes and employees who receive these benefits. DATES: Effective Date: These regulations are effective January 11, 2001.

In this regard, the proposed regulations provide that employers must implement reasonable procedures to ensure that an amount equal to the reimbursement was incurred for transit passes. For example, the final regulations clarify that in circumstances when employee certification is a reasonable reimbursement procedure, it must occur after the expense is incurred. The final regulations also clarify the application of the 1 percent rule if multiple vouchers for a transit system are available for distribution by an employer to employees, and if multiple transit system vouchers are required in an area to meet the transit needs of an employer's employees. The final regulations provide that if multiple transit system vouchers are available for direct distribution to employees, the employer must consider the lowest cost voucher for purposes of determining whether the voucher provider fees cause vouchers to not be readily available. However, if multiple vouchers are required in an area to meet the transit needs of the individual employees in that area, the employer has the option of averaging the costs applied to vouchers from each system for purposes of determining whether the voucher provider fees cause vouchers to not be readily available. 2. Internal Administrative Costs Several commentators representing employers recommended that, in addition to fare media provider fees, internal administrative costs, especially security and distribution costs, should be considered in determining whether vouchers are readily available. These commentators noted that administrative costs are increased when an employer must maintain both a voucher system and a reimbursement system to provide qualified transportation fringes. For example, the employer may maintain a cash reimbursement system for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and qualified parking, and also maintain a voucher system for transit passes. In addition, several commentators suggested that the increased costs and administrative burden for employers that maintain offices in multiple cities should also be considered in determining whether vouchers are readily available. The final regulations retain the test considering only fees paid to voucher providers in determining availability based on a plain reading of the terms of the statute. The language ``readily available for direct distribution by the employer to the employee'' under section 132(f)(3) in its plain, ordinary sense means that vouchers are easily obtainable for direct distribution to the employer's employees. The determination of availability bears no relationship with costs that may be incurred after vouchers have been obtained. The service fees charged by voucher providers and delivery costs can reasonably be viewed as affecting whether vouchers are easily obtainable; an employer's internal costs of subsequently administering a voucher program would not. Thus, based upon the plain language of section 132(f), internal administrative costs do not affect whether vouchers are readily available. Moreover, the test considering only voucher provider fees is a comparatively simple bright line test. A test that depends on the employer's internal administrative costs would necessarily be complex, requiring complex rules that would be difficult for employers to apply. 3. Other Nonfinancial Restrictions Commentators representing employers suggested that nonfinancial factors should be considered in determining whether vouchers are readily available. They suggested that factors such as whether there are reasonable advance purchase and minimum purchase requirements, and whether vouchers can be purchased in appropriate denominations, should be considered in determining availability. The final regulations adopt this suggestion because nonfinancial restrictions would reasonably affect whether vouchers are available for distribution by an employer to an employee. The final regulations provide guidance on the types of nonfinancial restrictions that cause vouchers to not be readily available. The final regulations provide that certain nonfinancial restrictions, such as a voucher provider not making vouchers available for purchase at reasonable intervals or failing to provide the vouchers within a reasonable period after receiving payment for the voucher, cause vouchers to not be readily available. In addition, if a voucher provider does not provide vouchers in reasonably appropriate quantities, or in reasonably appropriate denominations, vouchers may not be readily available. When and as the standards in these final regulations go into effect, they will supercede the current law standards in Notice 943.  test, transit vouchers would not be considered readily available in some large metropolitan areas. These commentators assert that the 1 percent test is therefore contrary to the intent of the statute. Commentators suggested that the 1 percent test, particularly if combined with inadequate cash reimbursement substantiation requirements, may result in taxpayer abuse, with the result that the benefit might not be used for the purpose for which it is intended, which is to increase the use of mass transit. In addition, commentators testified at the public hearing that the mandatory use of vouchers (with no ability to use cash reimbursement if vouchers are readily available) would increase the use of vouchers and promote the development of advanced technologies that minimize the burden on employers while ensuring that the benefit is used for mass transit. These new technologies might allow an employer to make payment directly to the transit operator, who in turn credits fare to the employee's magnetic media fare card, thus eliminating the need for employers to incur the expense of distributing vouchers. Other commentators, in particular groups representing employers, generally favored the 1 percent test, but suggested that internal costs be considered in applying the test (discussed below). These commentators took the position that an increase in the percentage might affect the market charge for such services. There was also a concern that a strict voucher-use requirement would result in fewer employers adopting transit pass programs, thus frustrating the purpose of section 132(f) to increase the use of mass transit. The final regulations retain the 1 percent test. The 1 percent test, applicable for years beginning after December 31, 2003, is appropriate in light of the rule (discussed below) that only voucher provider fees are considered in determining availability. It is intended that the delayed application of this rule would provide sufficient time for those affected by this rule to modify their systems and procedures appropriately. The 1 percent threshold, coupled with the exclusion of internal administrative costs from the readily available determination, represents a balanced approach that will promote the growth of voucher programs in most transportation areas. In addition, raising the percentage threshold could curtail the growth in transit benefit programs, which would be contrary to the goal of increasing the use of mass transit. Finally, in cases where cash reimbursement is allowed,  VerDate 11 2000  21:58 Jan 10, 2001  Jkt 194001  PO 00000  Frm 00048  Fmt 4700  Sfmt 4700  E:\FR\FM\11JAR1.SGM  pfrm01  PsN: 11JAR1   Federal Register / Vol. 66, No. 8 / Thursday, January 11, 2001 / Rules and Regulations B. Advance Transit Passes Commentators suggested that the administrability of transit pass programs would be improved if vouchers were permitted to be distributed in advance for more than one month. The final regulations adopt this suggestion. In October of this year, the IRS issued Announcement 200078 (200043 I.R.B. 428) to notify taxpayers that, when finalized, the regulations will clarify that transit passes may be distributed in advance for more than one month (such as for a calendar quarter) by taking into account the monthly limits for all months for which the transit passes are distributed. The announcement further provides, however, that if an employee receives advance transit passes, and the employee's employment terminates before the beginning of the last month of the period for which the transit passes were provided, the employer must include in the employee's wages, for income and for employment tax purposes (FICA, FUTA, and income tax withholding), the value of the passes provided for those month(s) beginning after the employee's employment terminates to the extent the employer does not recover those transit passes or the value of those passes. The announcement provides that pending the issuance of these final regulations, employers may rely on the announcement. The final regulations differ from the announcement in one respect. In any case in which transit passes are provided in advance for a period of no more than three months (such as for a calendar quarter), but the recipient ceases to be an employee before the beginning of the last month in that period, the final regulations provide that the value of a transit pass provided in advance for a month is excluded from wages for employment tax (FICA, FUTA, and income tax withholding) purposes (but not for income tax purposes) unless at the time the transit passes were distributed there was an established termination date that was before the beginning of the last month of that period and the employee does in fact terminate employment before the beginning of the last month of that period. C. Qualified Parking The final regulations address whether reimbursement paid to an employee for parking at a work location away from the employee's permanent work location is excludable from wages for income and employment tax purposes under section 132(f). Section 132(f)(5)(C) defines qualified parking, in part, as ``parking provided to an employee on or near the business premises of the employer * * * .'' The final regulations provide that qualified parking includes parking on or near a work location at which the employee performs services for the employer. However, qualified parking does not include reimbursement for parking that is otherwise excludable from gross income as a reimbursement treated as paid under an accountable plan under  1.622 of the Income Tax Regulations, or parking provided in kind to an employee that is excludable from the employee's gross income as a working condition fringe under section 132(a)(3). Thus, if the exclusion at  1.622 or section 132(a)(3) is available (even if not reimbursed by the employer), then section 132(f) does not apply. Whether a reimbursement for local transportation expenses, including parking at a work location away from the employee's permanent work location, is excludable from the employee's gross income under  1.62 2, or whether parking provided in kind to an employee is excludable from the employee's gross income under section 132(a)(3), is determined based upon whether the parking expenses would be deductible if paid or incurred by the employee under section 162(a) as an expense incurred in the employee's trade or business of being an employee for the employer.  1.622(d); 1.132 5(a)(2). Revenue Ruling 997 (19991 C.B. 361) addresses under what circumstances daily transportation expenses, including parking, incurred by a taxpayer in going between the taxpayer's residence and a work location are deductible by the taxpayer under section 162(a). The final regulations provide the minimum requirements to ensure that transportation benefits are qualified transportation fringes under section 132(f). An employer may have a transit benefit program that is more restrictive than a program meeting the minimum requirements under the regulations. In addition, these regulations do not affect the application of authorities outside the Internal Revenue Code which may restrict a transportation benefit program. Federal Government agencies, for example, may be required by other federal law to implement restrictions beyond those required under these regulations. D. Applicability Date The regulations are generally applicable for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2001. However, in order to provide a transition period for those affected by the 1 percent rule  2243  (described under ``The 1 percent safe harbor'' in this preamble), that rule is applicable for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2003. Effect on Other Documents The following document is obsolete as of January 11, 2001: Announcement 200078 (200043 I.R.B. 428). The following document is modified as of the date these regulations become applicable (see Q/A25): Notice 943 (19941 C.B. 327). Special Analyses It has been determined that this Treasury Decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) does not apply to these regulations. A final regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared for the collection of information in this Treasury decision under 5 U.S.C. 604. A summary of the analysis is set forth in this preamble under the heading ``Summary of Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis.'' Summary of Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis This analysis is required under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6). The collection of information under this rule is based upon the requirements under section 132(f). We estimate that approximately 265,000 employers that provide qualified transportation fringes to their employees will be affected by the recordkeeping requirements of this rule. None of the comments received in response to the notice of proposed rulemaking specifically addressed the initial regulatory flexibility analysis. Section 132(f)(3) provides that qualified transportation fringes may be provided in the form of cash reimbursement. The legislative history indicates that an employer providing cash reimbursement to the employer's employees for qualified transportation fringes must establish a bona fide reimbursement arrangement. As a condition to providing cash reimbursement for qualified transportation fringes, this rule provides that employers must receive substantiation from employees. The objective of this rule is to ensure that reimbursements are made for qualified transportation fringes. Whether an arrangement constitutes a bona fide reimbursement arrangement varies depending on the facts and circumstances, including the method or  VerDate 11 2000  21:58 Jan 10, 2001  Jkt 194001  PO 00000  Frm 00049  Fmt 4700  Sfmt 4700  E:\FR\FM\11JAR1.SGM  pfrm01  PsN: 11JAR1   2244  Federal Register / Vol. 66, No. 8 / Thursday, January 11, 2001 / Rules and Regulations voucher be distributed in-kind by the employer is satisfied if the voucher is distributed by the employer or by another person on behalf of the employer (for example, if a transit operator credits amounts to the employee's fare card as a result of payments made to the operator by the employer).

However, other personnel from the IRS and Treasury Department participated in their development. List of Subjects 26 CFR Part 1 Employment taxes, Income taxes, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. 26 CFR Part 602 Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Adoption of Amendments to the Regulations Accordingly, 26 CFR parts 1 and 602 are amended as follows: PART 1--INCOME TAXES Paragraph 1. The authority citation for part 1 continues to read in part as follows: Authority: 26 U.S.C. 7805 * * *  methods of payment utilized within a mass transit system. An employee certification in either written or electronic form may be sufficient depending upon the facts and circumstances. For example, if receipts are not provided in the ordinary course of business, such as with respect to metered parking or used transit passes that cannot be returned to the user, an employee certification that expenses have been incurred constitutes a reasonable reimbursement procedure. A certification that expenses will be incurred in the future, by itself, is not a reasonable reimbursement procedure. There are no particular professional skills required to maintain these records. In addition, section 132(f)(4) provides that an employee may choose between cash compensation and qualified transportation fringes. This rule provides that an employer may allow an employee the choice to receive either a fixed amount of cash compensation at a specified future date or a fixed amount of qualified transportation fringes to be provided for a specified future period (such as qualified parking to be used during a future calendar month). This rule provides that employers must keep records with respect to employee compensation reduction elections. An employee's election must be in writing or some other permanent and verifiable form, and include the date of the election, the amount of compensation to be reduced, and the period for which the qualified transportation fringes will be provided. The objective of this rule is to ensure against recharacterization of taxable compensation after it has been paid to the employee. There are no particular professional skills required to maintain these records. A less burdensome alternative for small organizations would be to exempt those entities from the recordkeeping requirements under this rule. However, it would be inconsistent with the statutory provisions and legislative history to exempt those entities from the recordkeeping requirements imposed under this rule. This rule provides several options which avoid more burdensome recordkeeping requirements for small entities. This rule provides that (1) there are no substantiation requirements if the employer distributes transit passes in kind; (2) a compensation reduction election may be made electronically; (3) an election to reduce compensation may be automatically renewed; (4) an employer may provide for deemed compensation reduction elections under its qualified transportation fringe benefit plan; and (5) a requirement that a  provided before January 1, 1993.

What is the effective date of this section?  2245  (b) Questions and answers. Q1. What is a qualified transportation fringe? A1. (a) The following benefits are qualified transportation fringe benefits: (1) Transportation in a commuter highway vehicle. (2) Transit passes. (3) Qualified parking. (b) An employer may simultaneously provide an employee with any one or more of these three benefits. Q2. What is transportation in a commuter highway vehicle? A2. Transportation in a commuter highway vehicle is transportation provided by an employer to an employee in connection with travel between the employee's residence and place of employment. A commuter highway vehicle is a highway vehicle with a seating capacity of at least 6 adults (excluding the driver) and with respect to which at least 80 percent of the vehicle's mileage for a year is reasonably expected to be-- (a) For transporting employees in connection with travel between their residences and their place of employment; and (b) On trips during which the number of employees transported for commuting is at least one-half of the adult seating capacity of the vehicle (excluding the driver). Q3. What are transit passes? A3. A transit pass is any pass, token, farecard, voucher, or similar item (including an item exchangeable for fare media) that entitles a person to transportation-- (a) On mass transit facilities (whether or not publicly owned); or (b) Provided by any person in the business of transporting persons for compensation or hire in a highway vehicle with a seating capacity of at least 6 adults (excluding the driver). Q4. What is qualified parking? A4. (a) Qualified parking is parking provided to an employee by an employer-- (1) On or near the employer's business premises; or (2) At a location from which the employee commutes to work (including  commuting by carpool, commuter highway vehicle, mass transit facilities, or transportation provided by any person in the business of transporting persons for compensation or hire). (b) For purposes of section 132(f), parking on or near the employer's business premises includes parking on or near a work location at which the employee provides services for the employer. However, qualified parking does not include-- (1) The value of parking provided to an employee that is excludable from gross income under section 132(a)(3) (as a working condition fringe), or (2) Reimbursement paid to an employee for parking costs that is excludable from gross income as an amount treated as paid under an accountable plan. See  1.622. (c) However, parking on or near property used by the employee for residential purposes is not qualified parking. (d) Parking is provided by an employer if-- (1) The parking is on property that the employer owns or leases; (2) The employer pays for the parking; or (3) The employer reimburses the employee for parking expenses (see Q/ A16 of this section for rules relating to cash reimbursements). Q5. May qualified transportation fringes be provided to individuals who are not employees? A5. An employer may provide qualified transportation fringes only to individuals who are currently employees of the employer at the time the qualified transportation fringe is provided. The term employee for purposes of qualified transportation fringes is defined in  1.1321(b)(2)(i). This term includes only common law employees and other statutory employees, such as officers of corporations. See Q/A24 of this section for rules regarding partners, 2-percent shareholders, and independent contractors. Q6. Must a qualified transportation fringe benefit plan be in writing? A6. No. Section 132(f) does not require that a qualified transportation fringe benefit plan be in writing. Q7. Is there a limit on the value of qualified transportation fringes that may be excluded from an employee's gross income? A7. (a) Transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and transit passes. Before January 1, 2002, up to $65 per month is excludable from the gross income of an employee for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and transit passes provided by  an employer. On January 1, 2002, this amount is increased to $100 per month. (b) Parking. Up to $175 per month is excludable from the gross income of an employee for qualified parking. (c) Combination. An employer may provide qualified parking benefits in addition to transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and transit passes. (d) Cost-of-living adjustments. The amounts in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Q/A7 are adjusted annually, beginning with 2000, to reflect cost-of-living. The adjusted figures are announced by the Service before the beginning of the year. Q8. What amount is includible in an employee's wages for income and employment tax purposes if the value of the qualified transportation fringe exceeds the applicable statutory monthly limit? A8. (a) Generally, an employee must include in gross income the amount by which the fair market value of the benefit exceeds the sum of the amount, if any, paid by the employee and any amount excluded from gross income under section 132(a)(5). Thus, assuming no other statutory exclusion applies, if an employer provides an employee with a qualified transportation fringe that exceeds the applicable statutory monthly limit and the employee does not make any payment, the value of the benefits provided in excess of the applicable statutory monthly limit is included in the employee's wages for income and employment tax purposes. See  1.6121(b)(1). (b) The following examples illustrate the principles of this Q/A8: Example 1. (i) For each month in a year in which the statutory monthly transit pass limit is $100 (i.e., a year after 2001), Employer M provides a transit pass valued at $110 to Employee D, who does not pay any amount to Employer M for the transit pass. (ii) In this Example 1, because the value of the monthly transit pass exceeds the statutory monthly limit by $10, $120 ($110-- $100, times 12 months) must be included in D's wages for income and employment tax purposes for the year with respect to the transit passes. Example 2. (i) For each month in a year in which the statutory monthly qualified parking limit is $175, Employer M provides qualified parking valued at $195 to Employee E, who does not pay any amount to M for the parking. (ii) In this Example 2, because the fair market value of the qualified parking exceeds the statutory monthly limit by $20, $240 ($195--$175, times 12 months) must be included in Employee E's wages for income and employment tax purposes for the year with respect to the qualified parking. Example 3. (i) For each month in a year in which the statutory monthly qualified parking limit is $175, Employer P provides  VerDate 11 2000  21:58 Jan 10, 2001  Jkt 194001  PO 00000  Frm 00051  Fmt 4700  Sfmt 4700  E:\FR\FM\11JAR1.SGM  pfrm01  PsN: 11JAR1   2246  Federal Register / Vol. 66, No. 8 / Thursday, January 11, 2001 / Rules and Regulations employee's wages for income tax purposes. (2) Reporting and employment tax treatment. Transit passes distributed in advance to an employee are excludable from wages for employment tax purposes under sections 3121, 3306, and 3401 (FICA, FUTA, and income tax withholding) if the employer distributes transit passes to the employee in advance for not more than three months and, at the time the transit passes are distributed, there is not an established date that the employee's employment will terminate (for example, if the employee has given notice of retirement) which will occur before the beginning of the last month of the period for which the transit passes are provided. If the employer distributes transit passes to an employee in advance for not more than three months and at the time the transit passes are distributed there is an established date that the employee's employment will terminate, and the employee's employment does terminate before the beginning of the last month of the period for which the transit passes are provided, the value of transit passes provided for months beginning after the date of termination during which the employee is not employed by the employer is included in the employee's wages for employment tax purposes. If transit passes are distributed in advance for more than three months, the value of transit passes provided for the months during which the employee is not employed by the employer is includible in the employee's wages for employment tax purposes regardless of whether at the time the transit passes were distributed there was an established date of termination of the employee's employment. (d) Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of this Q/A9: Example 1. (i) Employee E incurs $150 for qualified parking used during the month of June of a year in which the statutory monthly parking limit is $175, for which E is reimbursed $150 by Employer R. Employee E incurs $180 in expenses for qualified parking used during the month of July of that year, for which E is reimbursed $180 by Employer R. (ii) In this Example 1, because monthly exclusion amounts may not be combined to provide a benefit in any month greater than the applicable statutory limit, the amount by which the amount reimbursed for July exceeds the applicable statutory monthly limit ($180 minus $175 equals $5) is includible in Employee E's wages for income and employment tax purposes. Example 2. (i) Employee F receives transit passes from Employer G with a value of $195 in March of a year (for which the statutory monthly transit pass limit is $65) for January, February, and March of that year. F was hired during January and has not received any transit passes from G. (ii) In this Example 2, the value of the transit passes (three months times $65 equals $195) is excludable from F's wages for income and employment tax purposes. Example 3. (i) Employer S has a qualified transportation fringe benefit plan under which its employees receive transit passes near the beginning of each calendar quarter for that calendar quarter. All employees of Employer S receive transit passes from Employer S with a value of $195 on March 31 for the second calendar quarter covering the months April, May, and June (of a year in which the statutory monthly transit pass limit is $65). (ii) In this Example 3, because the value of the transit passes may be calculated by taking into account the monthly limits for all months for which the transit passes are distributed, the value of the transit passes (three months times $65 equals $195) is excludable from the employees' wages for income and employment tax purposes. Example 4. (i) Same facts as in Example 3, except that Employee T, an employee of Employer S, terminates employment with S on May 31. There was not an established date of termination for Employee T at the time the transit passes were distributed. (ii) In this Example 4, because at the time the transit passes were distributed there was not an established date of termination for Employee T, the value of the transit passes provided for June ($65) is excludable from T's wages for employment tax purposes. However, the value of the transit passes distributed to Employee T for June ($65) is not excludable from T's wages for income tax purposes. (iii) If Employee T's May 31 termination date was established at the time the transit passes were provided, the value of the transit passes provided for June ($65) is included in T's wages for both income and employment tax purposes. Example 5. (i) Employer F has a qualified transportation fringe benefit plan under which its employees receive transit passes semi-annually in advance of the months for which the transit passes are provided. All employees of Employer F, including Employee X, receive transit passes from F with a value of $390 on June 30 for the 6 months of July through December (of a year in which the statutory monthly transit pass limit is $65). Employee X's employment terminates and his last day of work is August 1. Employer F's other employees remain employed throughout the remainder of the year. (ii) In this Example 5, the value of the transit passes provided to Employee X for the months September, October, November, and December ($65 times 4 months equals $260) of the year is included in X's wages for income and employment tax purposes. The value of the transit passes provided to Employer F's other employees is excludable from the employees' wages for income and employment tax purposes. Example 6. (i) Each month during a year in which the statutory monthly transit pass limit is $65, Employer R distributes transit  qualified parking with a fair market value of $220 per month to its employees, but charges each employee $45 per month. (ii) In this Example 3, because the sum of the amount paid by an employee ($45) plus the amount excludable for qualified parking ($175) is not less than the fair market value of the monthly benefit, no amount is includible in the employee's wages for income and employment tax purposes with respect to the qualified parking.  Q9. Are excludable qualified transportation fringes calculated on a monthly basis? A9. (a) In general. Yes. The value of transportation in a commuter highway vehicle, transit passes, and qualified parking is calculated on a monthly basis to determine whether the value of the benefit has exceeded the applicable statutory monthly limit on qualified transportation fringes. Except in the case of a transit pass provided to an employee, the applicable statutory monthly limit applies to qualified transportation fringes used by the employee in a month. Monthly exclusion amounts are not combined to provide a qualified transportation fringe for any month exceeding the statutory limit. A month is a calendar month or a substantially equivalent period applied consistently. (b) Transit passes. In the case of transit passes provided to an employee, the applicable statutory monthly limit applies to the transit passes provided by the employer to the employee in a month for that month or for any previous month in the calendar year. In addition, transit passes distributed in advance for more than one month, but not for more than twelve months, are qualified transportation fringes if the requirements in paragraph (c) of this Q/ A9 are met (relating to the income tax and employment tax treatment of advance transit passes). The applicable statutory monthly limit under section 132(f)(2) on the combined amount of transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and transit passes may be calculated by taking into account the monthly limits for all months for which the transit passes are distributed. In the case of a pass that is valid for more than one month, such as an annual pass, the value of the pass may be divided by the number of months for which it is valid for purposes of determining whether the value of the pass exceeds the statutory monthly limit. (c) Rule if employee's employment terminates--(1) Income tax treatment.

Transit passes with a face amount of $70 can be purchased from the transit system by any individual for $65. (ii) In this Example 6, because the value of the transit passes distributed by Employer R does not exceed the applicable statutory monthly limit ($65), no portion of the value of the transit passes is included as wages for income and employment tax purposes.  2247  Q10. May an employee receive qualified transportation fringes from more than one employer? A10. (a) General rule. Yes. The statutory monthly limits described in Q/ A7 of this section apply to benefits provided by an employer to its employees. For this purpose, all employees treated as employed by a single employer under section 414(b), (c), (m), or (o) are treated as employed by a single employer. See section 414(t) and  1.1321(c). Thus, qualified transportation fringes paid by entities under common control under section 414(b), (c), (m), or (o) are combined for purposes of applying the applicable statutory monthly limit. In addition, an individual who is treated as a leased employee of the employer under section 414(n) is treated as an employee of that employer for purposes of section 132. See section 414(n)(3)(C). (b) Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of this Q/A10: Example 1. (i) During a year in which the statutory monthly qualified parking limit is $175, Employee E works for Employers M and N, who are unrelated and not treated as a single employer under section 414(b), (c), (m), or (o). Each month, M and N each provide qualified parking benefits to E with a value of $100. (ii) In this Example 1, because M and N are unrelated employers, and the value of the monthly parking benefit provided by each is not more than the applicable statutory monthly limit, the parking benefits provided by each employer are excludable as qualified transportation fringes assuming that the other requirements of this section are satisfied. Example 2. (i) Same facts as in Example 1, except that Employers M and N are treated as a single employer under section 414(b). (ii) In this Example 2, because M and N are treated as a single employer, the value of the monthly parking benefit provided by M and N must be combined for purposes of determining whether the applicable statutory monthly limit has been exceeded. Thus, the amount by which the value of the parking benefit exceeds the monthly limit ($200 minus the monthly limit amount of $175 equals $25) for each month in the year is includible in E's wages for income and employment tax purposes.  Q11. May qualified transportation fringes be provided to employees pursuant to a compensation reduction agreement? A11. Yes. An employer may offer employees a choice between cash  compensation and any qualified transportation fringe. An employee who is offered this choice and who elects qualified transportation fringes is not required to include the cash compensation in income if-- (a) The election is pursuant to an arrangement described in Q/A12 of this section; (b) The amount of the reduction in cash compensation does not exceed the limitation in Q/A13 of this section; (c) The arrangement satisfies the timing and reimbursement rules in Q/ A14 and 16 of this section; and (d) The related fringe benefit arrangement otherwise satisfies the requirements set forth elsewhere in this section. Q12. What is a compensation reduction election for purposes of section 132(f)? A12. (a) Election requirements generally. A compensation reduction arrangement is an arrangement under which the employer provides the employee with the right to elect whether the employee will receive either a fixed amount of cash compensation at a specified future date or a fixed amount of qualified transportation fringes to be provided for a specified future period (such as qualified parking to be used during a future calendar month). The employee's election must be in writing or another form, such as electronic, that includes, in a permanent and verifiable form, the information required to be in the election. The election must contain the date of the election, the amount of the compensation to be reduced, and the period for which the benefit will be provided. The election must relate to a fixed dollar amount or fixed percentage of compensation reduction. An election to reduce compensation for a period by a set amount for such period may be automatically renewed for subsequent periods. (b) Automatic election permitted. An employer may provide under its qualified transportation fringe benefit plan that a compensation reduction election will be deemed to have been made if the employee does not elect to receive cash compensation in lieu of the qualified transportation fringe, provided that the employee receives adequate notice that a compensation reduction will be made and is given adequate opportunity to choose to receive the cash compensation instead of the qualified transportation fringe. Q13. Is there a limit to the amount of the compensation reduction? A13. Yes. Each month, the amount of the compensation reduction may not exceed the combined applicable statutory monthly limits for  transportation in a commuter highway vehicle, transit passes, and qualified parking. For example, for a year in which the statutory monthly limit is $65 for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and transit passes, and $175 for qualified parking, an employee could elect to reduce compensation for any month by no more than $240 ($65 plus $175) with respect to qualified transportation fringes. If an employee were to elect to reduce compensation by $250 for a month, the excess $10 ($250 minus $240) would be includible in the employee's wages for income and employment tax purposes. Q14. When must the employee have made a compensation reduction election and under what circumstances may the amount be paid in cash to the employee? A14. (a) The compensation reduction election must satisfy the requirements set forth under paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this Q/A14. (b) Timing of election. The compensation reduction election must be made before the employee is able currently to receive the cash or other taxable amount at the employee's discretion. The determination of whether the employee is able currently to receive the cash does not depend on whether it has been constructively received for purposes of section 451. The election must specify that the period (such as a calendar month) for which the qualified transportation fringe will be provided must not begin before the election is made. Thus, a compensation reduction election must relate to qualified transportation fringes to be provided after the election. For this purpose, the date a qualified transportation fringe is provided is-- (1) The date the employee receives a voucher or similar item; or (2) In any other case, the date the employee uses the qualified transportation fringe. (c) Revocability of elections. The employee may not revoke a compensation reduction election after the employee is able currently to receive the cash or other taxable amount at the employee's discretion. In addition, the election may not be revoked after the beginning of the period for which the qualified transportation fringe will be provided. (d) Compensation reduction amounts not refundable. Unless an election is revoked in a manner consistent with paragraph (c) of this Q/A14, an employee may not subsequently receive the compensation (in cash or any form other than by payment of a qualified transportation fringe under the employer's plan). Thus, an employer's  VerDate 11 2000  21:58 Jan 10, 2001  Jkt 194001  PO 00000  Frm 00053  Fmt 4700  Sfmt 4700  E:\FR\FM\11JAR1.SGM  pfrm01  PsN: 11JAR1   2248  Federal Register / Vol. 66, No. 8 / Thursday, January 11, 2001 / Rules and Regulations transportation fringes used by the employee on or after the payroll date up to the compensation reduction amount elected by the employee for that payroll date. Example 2. (i) Employee Q elects to reduce his compensation payable on March 1 of a year (for which the statutory monthly mass transit limit is $65) by $195 in exchange for a mass transit voucher to be provided in March. The election is made on the preceding February 27. Employee Q was hired in January of the year. On March 10 of the year, the employer of Employee Q delivers to Employee Q a mass transit voucher worth $195 for the months of January, February, and March. (ii) In this Example 2, $65 is included in Employee Q's wages for income and employment tax purposes because the compensation reduction election fails to satisfy the requirement in this Q/A14 and Q/A12 of this section that the period for which the qualified transportation fringe will be provided not begin before the election is made to the extent the election relates to $65 worth of transit passes for January of the year. The $65 for February is not taxable because the election was for a future period that includes at least one day in February. (iii) However, no amount would be included in Employee Q's wages as a result of the election if $195 worth of mass transit passes were instead provided to Q for the months of February, March, and April (because the compensation reduction would relate solely to fringes to be provided for a period not beginning before the date of the election and the amount provided does not exceed the aggregate limit for the period, i.e., the sum of $65 for each of February, March, and April). See Q/A9 of this section for rules governing transit passes distributed in advance for more than one month. Example 3. (i) Employee R elects to reduce his compensation payable on March 1 of a year (for which the statutory monthly parking limit is $175) by $185 in exchange for reimbursement by Employer T of parking expenses incurred by Employee R for parking on or near Employer T's business premises during the period beginning after the date of the election through March. The election is made on the preceding February 27. Employee R incurs $10 in parking expenses on February 28 of the year, and $175 in parking expenses during the month of March. On April 5 of the year, Employer T reimburses Employee R $185 for the parking expenses incurred on February 28, and during March, of the year. (ii) In this Example 3, no amount would be includible in Employee R's wages for income and employment tax purposes because the compensation reduction related solely to parking on or near Employer R's business premises used during a period not beginning before the date of the election and the amount reimbursed for parking used in any one month does not exceed the statutory monthly limitation.  qualified transportation fringe benefit plan may not provide that an employee who ceases to participate in the employer's qualified transportation fringe benefit plan (such as in the case of termination of employment) is entitled to receive a refund of the amount by which the employee's compensation reductions exceed the actual qualified transportation fringes provided to the employee by the employer. (e) Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of this Q/A14: Example 1. (i) Employer P maintains a qualified transportation fringe benefit arrangement during a year in which the statutory monthly limit is $100 for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and transit passes (2002 or later) and $180 for qualified parking. Employees of P are paid cash compensation twice per month, with the payroll dates being the first and the fifteenth day of the month. Under P's arrangement, an employee is permitted to elect at any time before the first day of a month to reduce his or her compensation payable during that month in an amount up to the applicable statutory monthly limit ($100 if the employee elects coverage for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle or a mass transit pass, or $180 if the employee chooses qualified parking) in return for the right to receive qualified transportation fringes up to the amount of the election. If such an election is made, P will provide a mass transit pass for that month with a value not exceeding the compensation reduction amount elected by the employee or will reimburse the cost of other qualified transportation fringes used by the employee on or after the first day of that month up to the compensation reduction amount elected by the employee. Any compensation reduction amount elected by the employee for the month that is not used for qualified transportation fringes is not refunded to the employee at any future date. (ii) In this Example 1, the arrangement satisfies the requirements of this Q/A14 because the election is made before the employee is able currently to receive the cash and the election specifies the future period for which the qualified transportation fringes will be provided. The arrangement would also satisfy the requirements of this Q/A14 and Q/A13 of this section if employees are allowed to elect to reduce compensation up to $280 per month ($100 plus $180). (iii) The arrangement would also satisfy the requirements of this Q/A14 (and Q/A13 of this section) if employees are allowed to make an election at any time before the first or the fifteenth day of the month to reduce their compensation payable on that payroll date by an amount not in excess of one-half of the applicable statutory monthly limit (depending on the type of qualified transportation fringe elected by the employee) and P provides a mass transit pass on or after the applicable payroll date for the compensation reduction amount elected by the employee for the payroll date or reimburses the cost of other qualified  A15. (a) Yes. An employee may carry over unused compensation reduction amounts to subsequent periods under the plan of the employee's employer. (b) The following example illustrates the principles of this Q/A15: Example. (i) By an election made before November 1 of a year for which the statutory monthly mass transit limit is $65, Employee E elects to reduce compensation in the amount of $65 for the month of November. E incurs $50 in employee-operated commuter highway vehicle expenses during November for which E is reimbursed $50 by Employer R, E's employer. By an election made before December, E elects to reduce compensation by $65 for the month of December. E incurs $65 in employee-operated commuter highway vehicle expenses during December for which E is reimbursed $65 by R. Before the following January, E elects to reduce compensation by $50 for the month of January. E incurs $65 in employee-operated commuter highway vehicle expenses during January for which E is reimbursed $65 by R because R allows E to carry over to the next year the $15 amount by which the compensation reductions for November and December exceeded the employee-operated commuter highway vehicle expenses incurred during those months. (ii) In this Example, because Employee E is reimbursed in an amount not exceeding the applicable statutory monthly limit, and the reimbursement does not exceed the amount of employee-operated commuter highway vehicle expenses incurred during the month of January, the amount reimbursed ($65) is excludable from E's wages for income and employment tax purposes.  Q15. May an employee whose qualified transportation fringe costs are less than the employee's compensation reduction carry over this excess amount to subsequent periods?  Q16. How does section 132(f) apply to expense reimbursements? A16. (a) In general. The term qualified transportation fringe includes cash reimbursement by an employer to an employee for expenses incurred or paid by an employee for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle or qualified parking. The term qualified transportation fringe also includes cash reimbursement for transit passes made under a bona fide reimbursement arrangement, but, in accordance with section 132(f)(3), only if permitted under paragraph (b) of this Q/A16. The reimbursement must be made under a bona fide reimbursement arrangement which meets the rules of paragraph (c) of this Q/A16. A payment made before the date an expense has been incurred or paid is not a reimbursement. In addition, a bona fide reimbursement arrangement does not include an arrangement that is dependent solely upon an employee certifying in advance that the employee will incur expenses at some future date. (b) Special rule for transit passes--(1) In general. The term qualified transportation fringe includes cash reimbursement for transit passes made  VerDate 11 2000  21:58 Jan 10, 2001  Jkt 194001  PO 00000  Frm 00054  Fmt 4700  Sfmt 4700  E:\FR\FM\11JAR1.SGM  pfrm01  PsN: 11JAR1   Federal Register / Vol. 66, No. 8 / Thursday, January 11, 2001 / Rules and Regulations under a bona fide reimbursement arrangement, but, in accordance with section 132(f)(3), only if no voucher or similar item that may be exchanged only for a transit pass is readily available for direct distribution by the employer to employees. If a voucher is readily available, the requirement that a voucher be distributed in-kind by the employer is satisfied if the voucher is distributed by the employer or by another person on behalf of the employer (for example, if a transit operator credits amounts to the employee's fare card as a result of payments made to the operator by the employer). (2) Voucher or similar item. For purposes of the special rule in paragraph (b) of this Q/A16, a transit system voucher is an instrument that may be purchased by employers from a voucher provider that is accepted by one or more mass transit operators (e.g., train, subway, and bus) in an area as fare media or in exchange for fare media. Thus, for example, a transit pass that may be purchased by employers directly from a voucher provider is a transit system voucher. (3) Voucher provider. The term voucher provider means any person in the trade or business of selling transit system vouchers to employers, or any transit system or transit operator that sells vouchers to employers for the purpose of direct distribution to employees. Thus, a transit operator might or might not be a voucher provider. A voucher provider is not, for example, a third-party employee benefits administrator that administers a transit pass benefit program for an employer using vouchers that the employer could obtain directly. (4) Readily available. For purposes of this paragraph (b), a voucher or similar item is readily available for direct distribution by the employer to employees if and only if an employer can obtain it from a voucher provider that-- (i) does not impose fare media charges that cause vouchers to not be readily available as described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section; and (ii) does not impose other restrictions that cause vouchers to not be readily available as described in paragraph (b)(6) of this section. (5) Fare media charges. For purposes of paragraph (b)(4) of this section, fare media charges relate only to fees paid by the employer to voucher providers for vouchers. The determination of whether obtaining a voucher would result in fare media charges that cause vouchers to not be readily available as described in this paragraph (b) is made with respect to each transit system voucher. If more than one transit system voucher is available for direct distribution to employees, the employer must consider the fees imposed for the lowest cost monthly voucher for purposes of determining whether the fees imposed by the voucher provider satisfy this paragraph. However, if transit system vouchers for multiple transit systems are required in an area to meet the transit needs of the individual employees in that area, the employer has the option of averaging the costs applied to each transit system voucher for purposes of determining whether the fare media charges for transit system vouchers satisfy this paragraph. Fare media charges are described in this paragraph (b)(5), and therefore cause vouchers to not be readily available, if and only if the average annual fare media charges that the employer reasonably expects to incur for transit system vouchers purchased from the voucher provider (disregarding reasonable and customary delivery charges imposed by the voucher provider, e.g., not in excess of $15) are more than 1 percent of the average annual value of the vouchers for a transit system. (6) Other restrictions. For purposes of paragraph (b)(4) of this section, restrictions that cause vouchers to not be readily available are restrictions imposed by the voucher provider other than fare media charges that effectively prevent the employer from obtaining vouchers appropriate for distribution to employees. Examples of such restrictions include-- (i) Advance purchase requirements. Advance purchase requirements cause vouchers to not be readily available only if the voucher provider does not offer vouchers at regular intervals or fails to provide the voucher within a reasonable period after receiving payment for the voucher. For example, a requirement that vouchers may be purchased only once per year may effectively prevent an employer from obtaining vouchers for distribution to employees. An advance purchase requirement that vouchers be purchased not more frequently than monthly does not effectively prevent the employer from obtaining vouchers for distribution to employees. (ii) Purchase quantity requirements. Purchase quantity requirements cause vouchers to not be readily available if the voucher provider does not offer vouchers in quantities that are reasonably appropriate to the number of the employer's employees who use mass transportation (for example, the voucher provider requires a $1,000 minimum  2249  purchase and the employer seeks to purchase only $200 of vouchers). (iii) Limitations on denominations of vouchers that are available. If the voucher provider does not offer vouchers in denominations appropriate for distribution to the employer's employees, vouchers are not readily available. For example, vouchers provided in $5 increments up to the monthly limit are appropriate for distribution to employees, while vouchers available only in a denomination equal to the monthly limit are not appropriate for distribution to employees if the amount of the benefit provided to the employer's employees each month is normally less than the monthly limit. (7) Example. The following example illustrates the principles of this paragraph (b): Example. (i) Company C in City X sells mass transit vouchers to employers in the metropolitan area of X in various denominations appropriate for distribution to employees. Employers can purchase vouchers monthly in reasonably appropriate quantities. Several different bus, rail, van pool, and ferry operators service X, and a number of the operators accept the vouchers either as fare media or in exchange for fare media. To cover its operating expenses, C imposes on each voucher a 50 cents charge, plus a reasonable and customary $15 charge for delivery of each order of vouchers. Employer M disburses vouchers purchased from C to its employees who use operators that accept the vouchers and M reasonably expects that $55 is the average value of the voucher it will purchase from C for the next calendar year. (ii) In this Example, vouchers for X are readily available for direct distribution by the employer to employees because the expected cost of the vouchers disbursed to M's employees for the next calendar year is not more than 1 percent of the value of the vouchers (50 cents divided by $55 equals 0.91 percent), the delivery charges are disregarded because they are reasonable and customary, and there are no other restrictions that cause the vouchers to not be readily available. Thus, any reimbursement of mass transportation costs in X would not be a qualified transportation fringe.  (c) Substantiation requirements. Employers that make cash reimbursements must establish a bona fide reimbursement arrangement to establish that their employees have, in fact, incurred expenses for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle, transit passes, or qualified parking. For purposes of section 132(f), whether cash reimbursements are made under a bona fide reimbursement arrangement may vary depending on the facts and circumstances, including the method or methods of payment utilized within the mass transit system.

See Q/A8 and 9 of this section if the limit for a month is exceeded. (b) Example. The following example illustrates the principles of this Q/A17: Example. (i) Employee R pays $100 per month for qualified parking used during the period from April 1 through June 30 of a year in which the statutory monthly qualified parking limit is $175. After receiving adequate substantiation from Employee R, R's employer reimburses R $300 in cash on June 30 of that year. (ii) In this Example, because the value of the reimbursed expenses for each month did not exceed the applicable statutory monthly limit, the $300 reimbursement is excludable from R's wages for income and employment tax purposes as a qualified transportation fringe.  employer must implement reasonable procedures to ensure that an amount equal to the reimbursement was incurred for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle, transit passes, or qualified parking. The expense must be substantiated within a reasonable period of time. An expense substantiated to the payor within 180 days after it has been paid will be treated as having been substantiated within a reasonable period of time. An employee certification at the time of reimbursement in either written or electronic form may be a reasonable reimbursement procedure depending on the facts and circumstances. Examples of reasonable reimbursement procedures are set forth in paragraph (d) of this Q/ A16. (d) Illustrations of reasonable reimbursement procedures. The following are examples of reasonable reimbursement procedures for purposes of paragraph (c) of this Q/A16. In each case, the reimbursement is made at or within a reasonable period after the end of the events described in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(3) of this section. (1) An employee presents to the employer a parking expense receipt for parking on or near the employer's business premises, the employee certifies that the parking was used by the employee, and the employer has no reason to doubt the employee's certification. (2) An employee either submits a used time-sensitive transit pass (such as a monthly pass) to the employer and certifies that he or she purchased it or presents an unused or used transit pass to the employer and certifies that he or she purchased it and the employee certifies that he or she has not previously been reimbursed for the transit pass. In both cases, the employer has no reason to doubt the employee's certification. (3) If a receipt is not provided in the ordinary course of business (e.g., if the employee uses metered parking or if used transit passes cannot be returned to the user), the employee certifies to the employer the type and the amount of expenses incurred, and the employer has no reason to doubt the employee's certification. Q17. May an employer provide nontaxable cash reimbursement under section 132(f) for periods longer than one month? A17. (a) General rule. Yes. Qualified transportation fringes include reimbursement to employees for costs incurred for transportation in more than one month, provided the reimbursement for each month in the period is calculated separately and does not  Q18. What are the substantiation requirements if an employer distributes transit passes? A18. There are no substantiation requirements if the employer distributes transit passes. Thus, an employer may distribute a transit pass for each month with a value not more than the statutory monthly limit without requiring any certification from the employee regarding the use of the transit pass. Q19. May an employer choose to impose substantiation requirements in addition to those described in this regulation? A19. Yes. Q20. How is the value of parking determined? A20. Section 1.6121(b)(2) applies for purposes of determining the value of parking. Q21. How do the qualified transportation fringe rules apply to van pools? A21. (a) Van pools generally. Employer and employee-operated van pools, as well as private or public transit-operated van pools, may qualify as qualified transportation fringes. The value of van pool benefits which are qualified transportation fringes may be excluded up to the applicable statutory monthly limit for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and transit passes, less the value of any transit passes provided by the employer for the month. (b) Employer-operated van pools. The value of van pool transportation provided by or for an employer to its employees is excludable as a qualified transportation fringe, provided the van qualifies as a commuter highway vehicle as defined in section 132(f)(5)(B) and Q/A2 of this section. A van pool is operated by or for the employer if the employer purchases or leases vans to enable employees to commute together  or the employer contracts with and pays a third party to provide the vans and some or all of the costs of operating the vans, including maintenance, liability insurance and other operating expenses. (c) Employee-operated van pools. Cash reimbursement by an employer to employees for expenses incurred for transportation in a van pool operated by employees independent of their employer are excludable as qualified transportation fringes, provided that the van qualifies as a commuter highway vehicle as defined in section 132(f)(5)(B) and Q/A2 of this section. See Q/A16 of this section for the rules governing cash reimbursements. (d) Private or public transit-operated van pool transit passes. The qualified transportation fringe exclusion for transit passes is available for travel in van pools owned and operated either by public transit authorities or by any person in the business of transporting persons for compensation or hire. In accordance with paragraph (b) of Q/A 3 of this section, the van must seat at least 6 adults (excluding the driver). See Q/A16(b) and (c) of this section for a special rule for cash reimbursement for transit passes and the substantiation requirements for cash reimbursement. (e) Value of van pool transportation benefits. Section 1.6121(b)(2) provides that the fair market value of a fringe benefit is based on all the facts and circumstances. Alternatively, transportation in an employer-provided commuter highway vehicle may be valued under the automobile lease valuation rule in  1.6121(d), the vehicle cents-per-mile rule in  1.61 21(e), or the commuting valuation rule in  1.6121(f). If one of these special valuation rules is used, the employer must use the same valuation rule to value the use of the commuter highway vehicle by each employee who share the use. See  1.6121(c)(2)(i)(B). (f) Qualified parking prime member. If an employee obtains a qualified parking space as a result of membership in a car or van pool, the applicable statutory monthly limit for qualified parking applies to the individual to whom the parking space is assigned. This individual is the prime member. In determining the tax consequences to the prime member, the statutory monthly limit amounts of each car pool member may not be combined. If the employer provides access to the space and the space is not assigned to a particular individual, then the employer must designate one of its employees as the prime member who will bear the tax consequences. The employer may not designate more than one prime member for a car or van pool during a month.

Q22. What are the reporting and employment tax requirements for qualified transportation fringes? A22. (a) Employment tax treatment generally. Qualified transportation fringes not exceeding the applicable statutory monthly limit described in Q/ A7 of this section are not wages for purposes of the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA), the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), and federal income tax withholding. Any amount by which an employee elects to reduce compensation as provided in Q/ A11 of this section is not subject to the FICA, the FUTA, and federal income tax withholding. Qualified transportation fringes exceeding the applicable statutory monthly limit described in Q/ A7 of this section are wages for purposes of the FICA, the FUTA, and federal income tax withholding and are reported on the employee's Form W2, Wage and Tax Statement. (b) Employment tax treatment of cash reimbursement exceeding monthly limits. Cash reimbursement to employees (for example, cash reimbursement for qualified parking) in excess of the applicable statutory monthly limit under section 132(f) is treated as paid for employment tax purposes when actually or constructively paid. See  31.3121(a) 2(a), 31.33014, 31.3402(a)1(b) of this chapter. Employers must report and deposit the amounts withheld in addition to reporting and depositing other employment taxes. See Q/A16 of this section for rules governing cash reimbursements. (c) Noncash fringe benefits exceeding monthly limits. If the value of noncash qualified transportation fringes exceeds the applicable statutory monthly limit, the employer may elect, for purposes of the FICA, the FUTA, and federal income tax withholding, to treat the noncash taxable fringe benefits as paid on a pay period, quarterly, semi-annual, annual, or other basis, provided that the benefits are treated as paid no less frequently than annually. Q23. How does section 132(f) interact with other fringe benefit rules? A23. For purposes of section 132, the terms working condition fringe and de minimis fringe do not include any qualified transportation fringe under section 132(f). If, however, an employer provides local transportation other than transit passes (without any direct or indirect compensation reduction election), the value of the benefit may be excludable, either totally or partially, under fringe benefit rules other than the qualified transportation fringe rules under section 132(f). See  1.132 6(d)(2)(i) (occasional local transportation fare), 1.1326(d)(2)(iii) (transportation provided under unusual circumstances), and 1.6121(k) (valuation of local transportation provided to qualified employees). See also Q/A4(b) of this section. Q24. May qualified transportation fringes be provided to individuals who are partners, 2-percent shareholders of S-corporations, or independent contractors? A24. (a) General rule. Section 132(f)(5)(E) states that self-employed individuals who are employees within the meaning of section 401(c)(1) are not employees for purposes of section 132(f). Therefore, individuals who are partners, sole proprietors, or other independent contractors are not employees for purposes of section 132(f). In addition, under section 1372(a), 2-percent shareholders of S corporations are treated as partners for fringe benefit purposes. Thus, an individual who is both a 2-percent shareholder of an S corporation and a common law employee of that S corporation is not considered an employee for purposes of section 132(f). However, while section 132(f) does not apply to individuals who are partners, 2-percent shareholders of S corporations, or independent contractors, other exclusions for working condition and de minimis fringes may be available as described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this Q/A24. See  1.1321(b)(2) and 1.1321(b)(4). (b) Transit passes. The working condition and de minimis fringe exclusions under section 132(a)(3) and (4) are available for transit passes provided to individuals who are partners, 2-percent shareholders, and independent contractors. For example, tokens or farecards provided by a partnership to an individual who is a partner that enable the partner to commute on a public transit system (not including privately-operated van pools) are excludable from the partner's gross income if the value of the tokens and farecards in any month does not exceed the dollar amount specified in  1.132 6(d)(1). However, if the value of a pass provided in a month exceeds the dollar amount specified in  1.1326(d)(1), the full value of the benefit provided (not merely the amount in excess of the dollar amount specified in  1.132 6(d)(1)) is includible in gross income. (c) Parking. The working condition fringe rules under section 132(d) do not  2251  apply to commuter parking. See  1.1325(a)(1). However, the de minimis fringe rules under section 132(e) are available for parking provided to individuals who are partners, 2percent shareholders, or independent contractors that qualifies under the de minimis rules.

A. The following HEP are currently available.                               1. REVERSE MORTGAGES allow a homeowner to borrow, via a mortgage           contract, some percentage of the appraised value of their home. The homeowner may receive           periodic payments and/or a line of credit to draw against. Some reverse mortgages involve           the purchase of an annuity and are called Reverse Annuity Mortgages (RAM). In most reverse           mortgages the loan to the homeowner is not repaid until the homeowner dies, sells the home           or moves.             2. SALE-LEASEBACK allows the homeowner to transfer title of the home to           a buyer in exchange for an installment note satisfied by regular payments. The installment           note may bear interest. The buyer then allows the former homeowner to remain in the home           in exchange for rent. Because the rent is a lesser amount than the former homeowner           receives from the installment note, they are provided with needed proceeds. Some           sale-leaseback arrangements involve the purchase of an annuity.             3. TIME SALE allows the homeowner to sign a contract to sell their home           at death but maintain title to and continue to live in the home. The buyer of the contract           makes regular payments to the homeowner. The contract may provide for payment of interest           and/or the purchase of an annuity.             4. DEFERRED PAYMENT LOANS (DPL) are one-time lump sum loans used to           repair or improve a home or to pay property taxes. They are usually offered by local           government housing or community development departments with no repayment due until the           homeowner dies, sells the home or moves.
