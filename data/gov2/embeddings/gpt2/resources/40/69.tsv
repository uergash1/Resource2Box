First Trombones                            Ideally, a student's first trombone should offer a                            balance of tone, craftsmanship, and superior design                            and materials. Our selection offers you a selection of                            the best features available today.                              Many first trombones                            are made with a 2-piece bell (where the instrument's                            bell is soldered onto the body). This dampens                            vibrations and affects sound and projection. You can                            also choose a trombone with a ""seamless"" bell, where                            the two pieces are joined without solder and creates a                            seamless one-piece bell for continuous, even                            vibrations in all registers.                              The slide on a first                            trombone should move without any resistance                            whatsoever. Tolerances, manufacturing techniques, and                            craftsmanship of the inner and outer slides will                            determine how effortlessly it moves, providing                            accurate and easy placement.                              Buy New or Used Trombones  for the Dedicated Student                              These trombones feature better quality in materials                            and craftsmanship and more handwork than first                            trombones for better tone and response. Other options                            such as red brass bells provide increased tonal                            coloration, while the addition of an F attachment (a                            rotor-type valve triggered with the thumb) increases                            the note range of the instrument.                              Maintenance                              Maintenance and care are the most important factors in                            maintaining the playability and longevity of your                            instrument.                              Slides need regular                            lubrication to keep them moving quickly and smoothly.                            Trombone pipes and mouthpieces need to be washed out                            regularly with brushes or snakes. This will keep grit                            and dirt from lodging inside the instrument and                            damaging the slide casing.

Jeff Powell, founder of the National Child Safety Foundation and vocal advocate of background checks for child safety, commended the Boys and Girls Club of Bellevue for their proactive approach to screening.   oo often, child care organizations are jolted to take a closer look at hiring policies only after a child safety is compromised or they experience a close call,said Powell. ut increasingly, organizations like the Boys and Girls Club of Bellevue are proactively screening volunteers and employees, and parents are insisting on that level of precaution. Intelius is dedicated to giving individuals and organizations the ability to make better decisions about the safety of our kids. Today, background checks are convenient, and more accurate and cost-effective than ever, leaving little excuse for child-centric organizations not to screen. Kudos to the Boys and Girls Club of Bellevue for doing it right./p>  hild safety is a core value for Intelius, and helping the Boys & Girls Club of Bellevue create the safest possible environment for kids is one way we can continue that commitment,said Edward Petersen, vice president of sales and marketing for Intelius. roactive screening by any organization that works with children, including childcare providers, youth groups and after school activity centers is a vital step to ensuring parents have peace of mind that their children are in good hands.

Sundays are so constant - you just know one of your crucial players will miss occasionally.  Wouldn it be great to have a complete band sound even when someone is missing?    Do you have newer players who could use more confidence?  They gain it by hearing their part the one you sequenced for them, even as the band plays along.   Ramp up a vamp Transitions can be a challenge.  You just finished a quiet song.  The next one is a little more intense.  You are wondering how to get there.

Frdric Chopin  (1 March 1810  17 October 1849)   was a Polish composer and virtuoso pianist of the Romantic period. He is widely regarded as the   greatest Polish composer, and ranks as one of music's greatest tone poets.      Chopin was born in the village of {elazowa Wola, in the Duchy of Warsaw, to a   Polish mother and French-expatriate father, and in his early   life was regarded as a child-prodigy pianist. In November   1830, at the age of 20, he went abroad; following the suppression of the Polish November Uprising of 183031, he became one of many expatriates of the Polish ""Great Emigration.""  In Paris, Chopin made a comfortable   living as a composer and piano teacher, while giving few public performances.   Though an ardent Polish patriot, in France he used the French versions of his names and eventually, to avoid having to rely on Imperial   Russian documents, became a French citizen After some ill-fated romantic involvements with Polish women, from 1837 to 1847 he had a   turbulent relationship with the French writer George Sand (Aurore Dudevant). Always in frail   health, in 1849 he died in Paris, at the age of 39, of chronic pulmonary tuberculosis. Chopin's extant compositions were written primarily for the piano as a solo instrument. Though they are technically   demanding, his style emphasizes nuance and expressive depth. Chopin invented musical forms such as the  ballade  and   was responsible for major innovations in forms such as the piano sonata, waltz,  nocturne, tude, impromptu  and prelude. His works are mainstays of Romanticism in 19th-century classical music.

Like all brass instruments, it is a lip-reed  aerophone : sound is produced when the players vibrating lips ( embouchure ) cause the air column inside the instrument to vibrate. The trombone is usually characterised by a telescopic slide with which the player varies the length of the tube to change pitches, although the less common valve trombone uses three valves similar to those on a  trumpet . The word  trombone  derives from  Italian   tromba  ( trumpet ) and  -one  (a suffix meaning ""large""), so the name literally means ""large trumpet"".  Trombones and trumpets share the important characteristic of having predominantly cylindrical bores.  Therefore, the most frequently encountered trombones  the  tenor  and  bass  trombone  are the tenor and bass counterparts of the trumpet.  They are both pitched in B  with the slide all the way in, the notes of the  harmonic series  based on B can be played  but trombones generally read music in  concert pitch . A person who plays the trombone is called a  trombonist .   Construction        Basic Trombone Anatomy         tuning slide   counterweight   mouthpiece   slide lock ring   bell   knob/bumper   water key/spit valve   main slide   second slide brace   first slide brace   connector nut  The trombone consists of a cylindrical tube bent into an elongated ""S"" shape in a complex series of tapers, the smallest being at the mouthpiece receiver, and the largest being at the throat of the bell, before the flare for the bell begins. (Careful design of these tapers is crucial to the intonation of the instrument.) As with other  brass instruments , sound is produced by blowing air through pursed lips producing a vibration that creates a  standing wave  in the instrument. The detachable cup-shaped  mouthpiece , similar to that of the  baritone , closely related to that of the  trumpet , is inserted into the mouthpiece receiver in the slide section, which consists of a leadpipe, inner and outer slide tubes, and bracing, known as inner and outer slide  stays . While modern stays are  soldered ,  sackbuts  (a medieval precursor to the trombone) were made with loose, unsoldered stays, which remained the pattern for German trombones until the mid-20th century. The leadpipe contains the  venturi , which is a small constriction of the air column, adding a certain amount of resistance and to a great extent dictating the tone of the instrument; leadpipes may be soldered in permanently or interchangeable, depending on the maker. The telescopic 'slide', the defining feature of the trombone (cf.  valve trombone ) allows the player to extend the length of the air column, lowering the pitch. In order to prevent friction from slowing the action of the slide, additional sleeves were developed during the  Renaissance  and these  stockings  were soldered onto the ends of the inner slide tubes. Nowadays, the stockings are incorporated into the manufacturing process of the inner slide tubes and represent a fractional widening of the tube to accommodate the necessary method of alleviating friction. This part of the slide must be lubricated on a frequent basis. Additional tubing connects the slide to the bell of the instrument through a neckpipe, and bell or back bow (U-bend). The joint connecting the slide and bell sections is furnished with a ferrule to secure the connection of the two parts of the instrument, though older models from the early 20th century and before were usually equipped with friction joints and no ancillary mechanism to tighten the joint. The adjustment of intonation is most often accomplished with a tuning slide that is a short slide between the neckpipe and the bell incorporating the bell bow (U-bend); this device was designed by the French maker Franois Riedlocker during the early nineteenth century and applied to French and British designs and later in the century to German and American models, though German trombones were built without tuning slides well into the 20th century. However, trombonists, unlike other instrumentalists, are not subject to the intonation issues connected with valved or keyed instruments, and as such can adjust intonation ""on the fly"" by adjusting the slide positions, as need be. As with the  trumpet , the trombone is considered a cylindrical bore instrument since it has extensive sections of tubing, principally in the slide section, that are of continuous diameter. This is in contrast to conical bore instruments like the  cornet ,  euphonium , and  tuba , whose only cylindrical tubing is in the valve section. Tenor trombones typically have a bore of 0.450"" (small bore) to 0.547"" (large or  orchestral  bore) after the leadpipe and through the slide. Some small bore jazz trombones, though, have two different diameters of tubing in the slide section to simulate a conical bore. Without this innovation, the trombone would sound extremely sharp and piercing. The bore expands through the backbore to the bell which is typically between 7"" and 8"". A number of common variations on trombone construction are noted below.   History   Until the early 18th century, the trombone was called the  sackbut  in English, a word with various different spellings ranging from  sackbut  to  shagbolt  and derived from the Spanish  sacabuche  or French  sacqueboute . This was not a distinct instrument from the trombone, but rather a different name used for an earlier form. Other countries used the same name throughout the instrument's history, viz. Italian  trombone  and German  Posaune . The sackbut was built in slightly smaller dimensions than modern trombones, and had a bell that was more conical and less flared. Today,  sackbut  is generally used to refer to the earlier form of the instrument, commonly used in early music ensembles. Sackbuts were (and still are) made in every size from soprano to contrabass, though then, as now, the contrabass was rare.   Renaissance and Baroque periods   The trombone was used frequently in 16th century  Venice  in  canzonas ,  sonatas , and ecclesiastical works by  Andrea Gabrieli  and his nephew  Giovanni Gabrieli , and also later by  Heinrich Schtz  in  Germany .  While the trombone was used continuously in Church music and in some other settings (i.e., as an addition to the opera house orchestra or to represent the supernatural or the funerary) from the time of  Claudio Monteverdi  onwards, it remained rather rare in the concert hall until the 19th century. During the  Baroque period ,  Johann Sebastian Bach  and  George Frideric Handel  used t  "
